2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Petrol Excise To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the increase in excise of 7 cents per litre on leaded petrol and 5 cents per litre on unleaded petrol resulting from the Budget. This rise in petrol tax: (1) discriminates against low income families and those living in rural areas (2) increases business costs and will cause further unemployment (3) adds further to the price of an already heavily taxed product (4) breaks Mr Keating's election promise not to put up tax. And your petitioners therefore pray that the House oppose these increases in petrol excise. by Mr Cadman (from 2,391 citizens), Mr Evans (from 1,379 citizens), Mr Miles (from 162 citizens) and Mr Bruce Scott (from 139 citizens). Off-Road Diesel Fuel To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows: We the imdersigned citizens respectfully submit that the Government's proposal to charge users of off-road diesel fuel a tax equal to one per cent of the amount rebated to them through the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme under the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 be abandoned. The Petitioners note particularly that: 1. Users of off-road diesel fuel currently receive a full or partial rebate of fuel excise paid in recognition that they should not have to contribute to road funding and maintenance in the same manner as on-road users of diesel fuel; 2. We object to being forced to pay fuel excise on diesel fuel and then being charged a tax, which the Government is calling an 'administration fee', to have that money returned to us as a rebate; 3. This tax sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to governments charging similar taxes on rebates, such as those for personal income tax. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Forrest (from 878 citizens), MrReid (from 110 citizens) and Mr Ronaldson (from 87 citizens). Un realised Capital Gains and Losses To the Honourable the Speaker .and Members of the H-use of Representatives assembled The petition of the undersigned shows: We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that the Government's proposals to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 be abandoned. The Petitioners note particularly that:1. The majority of Australians regard the proposed method of calculating unrealised capital gains and losses as unfair and inequitable; 2. The implementation of this measure will have a deleterious effect on national savings and investments of pensioners and veterans; 3. We regard the Government's estimates of cost saving as spurious. . And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Evans (from 52 citizens) and Mr Hawker (from 22 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: 1. The majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian national flag. 2. We therefore request that the House of Representatives ensures that the Australian national flag, as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, is not changed or replaced without first being voted upon and approved by the people of Australia in a national poll. by Mr Hawker (from 98 citizens) and Mr Lieberman (from 20 citizens). Free the Bears To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain reSidents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so smaIl the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Your petitioners therefore respectfully a-k the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 1,249 citizens). Increase in Wholesale Sales Tax and To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: that pensioners, the unemployed and low and middle income Australians will be worse off if the Government's 1993-94 Budget is passed unchanged by the Parliament; the increase in the rate of wholesale sales will add to the tax' burden on basic household goods; the increase in petrol excise-in particular the excise on leaded petrol which is overwhelmingly used by low income people and fanners-will significantly add to the costs of operating a vehicle in Australia; the increase in the tax on wine from 20 to 31 per cent immediately and 32 per cent next year will do serious damage to one of this nation's most successful industries; the increase in the tax on lump sums received from unused leave is retrospective and unfair. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reject these measures on behalf of the citizens of Australia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Downer (from 33 citizens). Rejection of Increase in Leaded Petrol Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that: The 1993 Federal Budget announced by the Keating Labor .Government to increase the excise on leaded fuel by 10 cents per litre. is a selective, discriminatory tax on owners of older cars; discriminates. against poorer people and country people who own most of these older cars; will make it more difficult for people to save to purchase newer, more fuel efficient, less-polluting vehicles; is therefore counter-productive to reducing lead pollution in the air. .Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject this increase in fuel excise and that the House of Representatives will urge the Government to take initiatives to Excise reduce the cost of manufacturing cars in Australia, thereby making new cars cheaper to buy. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Hawker (from 578 citizens). Medicare ·Benefits for Optometric Examinations To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the tax House of Representatives in Parliament assembledThe Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows: 1. Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year. 2. Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source. 3. The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee. 4. The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases. 5. The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance. 6. Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available. We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered. by Mr Hawker (from 27 citizens). Homeless Rate Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: 1. We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless rate benefits without adequate investigation. 2. We believe that the flawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless rate benefits is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown. 3. With the number of young people receiving youth homeless rate benefits increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years,' we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should: Call on the Government to: (a) review the guidelines for young homeless rate benefits; and (b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown. by Mr Miles (from 69 citizens). Capital Works To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest opposition to certain expenditure for research of and capital works on Government buildings in Canberra, A.C.T., as proposed in the August 1993 Budget, in particular a new Prime Minister's mansion, when expenditures on essential services is being reduced and taxes increased; and further that expenditure on promotion and implementation of a new flag be abandoned until such time as Australia's economy is flourishing once more, and its people have hope for the security of their country. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to oppose all plans by the Government for such expenditure, and apply the funds to the betterment of this country. And your petitioners, as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Moore (from 605 citizens). Violence in the Media To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We the undersigned citizens of Australia, view with alarm the high incidence of violence in our community. Of particular concern is the number of random crimes, some extraordinarily brutal, which are eroding public peace of mind and leaving many people feeling personally threatened. We believe that the violence saturating our visual media-television, videos, newspapers/magazines, films and advertisements-both encourages and legitimises violent behaviour. The portrayal of violence, in context, which carries a rational message, can be acceptable, however its use as a marketing ploy simply to catch-consumer attention and boost ratings or sell products is totally irresponsible. We acknowledge social and economic factors play a significant part in motivating violence, nevertheless the sensational portrayal of violence in the media is one important factor that we, as a community, have the power to change, and we therefore call upon the Parliament to: Take Legislative action to prevent gratuitous brutality and suffering being promoted as 'entertainment' and/or used as a marketing ploy. Tighten restrictions on the importation of violent videos and films. Conduct an immediate inquiry into the sensational coverage which some elements of the media, in reporting news, give to violent events. Expand public awareness campaigns aimed at discouraging violence. by Mr Ronaldson (from 40 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the HouseThe overwhelming support for the retention of the existing Australian National Flag. Your petitioners therefore request the House Reject any proposal to change the Australian Flag. by Mr Bruce Scott (from 23 citizens). Petitions received. NA Delegation to the United States of",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United States of America of June-July 1993, entitled Fighting friendly fire. The visit of the seven-member delegation, led by me as Speaker, demonstrated Australia's recognition of the continuing importance of the United States to Australian interests. It was the first visit to the United States by Australian parliamentarians since the Clinton administration took office. As such, this visit provided the opportunity to acknowledge the generational change which has occurr\!d in both Washington and Canberra and to ensure that, despite that change, productive personal contacts are established and maintained. This is particularly important at a time when there are some difficulties in the Australia-United States relationship. In recognition of the need to establish contact within and beyond government, the delegation's program encompassed not only Washington and New York but also Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and San Diego. By visiting these locations the delegation was able to interact with congressional and administrative representatives and also with the wider American community in centres distant from Washington. The delegation enjoyed excellent access in Washington. Our first meeting was with the Vice-President, Mr Albert Gore, who assured us that the generational change in leadership does not imply any reduction in the importance that the United States attaches to its relationship with Australia. The Vice-President acknowledged Australian concerns over the export enhancement program and expressed the hope that the Uruguay Round will be brought to a successful conclusion. He toalso gave a firm commitment to a continuing strong presence in the Asia-Pacific. The delegation took the opportunity to also discuss with him the wider issues of structural unemployment, population growth and environmental pollution. It was agreed that the solution to these challenges will be complex and will involve job training, environmental protection, new designs and new processes. America Extensive discussions were also held with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Tom Foley; the Senate Majority Leader, the Hon. George Mitchell; and the chairmen of key congressional committees. Again, the core issue addressed in these meetings was the damage being sustained by Australia as a result of the agricultural subsidies war being waged by the United States and the European Community, hence the title of the report, Fighting friendly fire. The delegation drew attention to the fact that while the US policies may not be intended to injure efficient, unsubsidised producers such as Australia they are in fact doing so. When serious injury is inflicted, it is little consolation to be told that the collateral damage was unintended. The reaction to the delegation's representations was mixed. While committees representing farming interests defended the policies, several representatives of committees with broader budgetary and trade responsibilities indicated concern with the policy. They implicitly acknowledged the burden these subsidies represent for the American taxpayer. They also encouraged us to continue to make known in the centres we were to visit the damage the policy innicted on Australia and the anomalies and contradictions inherent in the subsidy approach. . The delegation left Washington convinced that the discussions there had been beneficial. It was clear that the direct contact made possible by meetings of this kind had led to a better understanding by both sides of the perspective of the other and the circumstances under which each is functioning. Given the influential role played by congress in decision making processes, it is particularly important that these opportunities be capitalised upon in the United States-Australia context. The delegation has therefore recommended that bilateral visits to the United States should take place at least once every two years, and that the Presiding Officers should continue to encourage appropriate visits by US congressmen to Australia. The delegation has also given thought to how to supplement the gains that may be made through dialogue with decision makers. It seems to the delegation that there may be much to be gained by identifying potential allies within the United States who would also benefit from a reduction in agricultural subsidies. To assist in this objective, the delegation has recommended that the Australian government commission a detailed study of the .costs to American consumers, and to producers in related industries, of the current United States agricultural subsidies and import restrictions on agricultural produce. The results of this study could then be widely circulated among both congressional representatives and those with whom we may seek to form strategic partnerships. As the delegation travelled beyond Washington and New York it became clear that, even among influential think-tanks, there is little understanding of the many ways in which Australia is affected by events, policies and practices in the United States. As detailed in the report, Australian issues and concerns gain negligible media coverage. In the three weeks of the delegation's visit, virtually the only news item on Australia carried by the major television networks was that of a drunken koala in Brisbane! Clearly, it is up to us to ensure that Australia makes its mark and that its case is heard and taken into account. In addition to those I have already mentioned, the report makes several other recommendations as to how this might be accomplished. In particular, utilising Australian and American chambers of commerce might be an appropriate way in which the message about Australia, its trading relationship and its broader relationship with the United States could be effected. I would like to thank my co-delegates-the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and Senators Burns and Watson-for their commitment to the very full itinerary planned for the delegation. I would also like to thank the secretary to the delegation, Ms Ilze Svenne, who not only did an outstanding job of organising the group throughout the very busy three weeks of the visit but whose knowledge of the relevant subject areas under discussion was highly valued by the delegation members. Finally, I would also thank Ms Geraldine Skinner from my staff and Mr Bob Tyson from our Washington embassy for their invaluable liaison between the delegation and those we met. I commend the report to the House.",14
4,Mr ROCHER,DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Speaker, I join you in complimenting Ilze Svenne for her work with the arrangements whilst in the United States and in penning this report which has been brought before the parliament. She did an outstanding job, and you have properly acknowledged that. Geraldine Skinner also contributed to the sQccess of the delegation, and I wish to record my thanks to her. To you, Mr Speaker, I offer my compliments. Your leadership was outstanding and, by dint of your high office, you enabled us whilst in the US to obtain access to individuals that would not have been otherwise possible, I am sure. While in Washington, we were able to meet a variety of people, particularly in the Capitol, and in that connection I wish to mention the work of Mr Bob Tyson, the person in charge of congressional liaison in our embassy in Washington. Having been the only member of the previous delegation in 1988 to the United States, I want to assure the House that what Bob Tyson was able to achieve by way of access to congressmen in particular was quite outstanding; and those arrangements, I suspect, could not have been bettered. The congress was sitting whilst we were there and that presented its own difficulties, just as you can imagine, Mr Speaker, from experience with visiting delegations to this parliament when we are sitting. There were some voids because of congressmen's duties in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. But the people we met were important in different but significant ways and we benefited accordingly, I believe. The fact that we met congressmen, as distinct from meeting members of the administration, as was the case with the previous delegation in 1988, brought home to me how valuable it is for Australian parliamentarians to do the sort of thing that we did. We have ministers travelling to Washington on a regular basis to meet with members of the administration and I think we added another dimension to representing Australia's interests by concentrating on congress and on congressmen and congresswomen. That is not to downplay the significance of our time spent with Vice-President Gore, so early in the administration. I think that was especially useful and will advance Australia's interests over the term of the administration. The itinerary was extensive and it necessitated travelling virtually the length and breadth of the United States. Any subsequent delegation might look closely at the value of going to New York, where delegations are a dime a dozen and access is a bit difficult. Overall, I was impressed by the number of expatriate Australians doing valuable work, mainly in business, while they are in the United States. It was a line of contact which could very well be developed to our advantage, and one which I hope any subsequent delegation will pursue. I thank my colleagues on the delegation for their generosity and courtesies towards me also.",15
5,Mr REID,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, and the deputy leader of the delegation on the fine job of leadership on the delegation. The delegation was an outstanding success, in my opinion, and I want to support the report and its recommendations, especially those that extend the range of contacts at a congressional level in Washington. The visit to the United States and the discussions with top-level committees and representatives of the congress were opportunities that can only benefit Australia. I sure, Mr Speaker, that your presence as leader of the delegation opened doors that may not have been opened to us otherwise. I refer particularly to the meeting with the Vice President, Al Gore. I was pleased to accompany you on that delegation, to have the opportunity to talk with the Vice-President and to put some of the concerns from my electorate and from other farming communities throughout Australia. I was pleased to receive an assurance from Vice-President, Al Gore, that the change in leadership in the USA does not imply any reduction in the importance which the US attaches to the relationship with Australia. However, it is one thing to acknowledge Australia's concerns about the export enhancement program, as Vice-President Al Gore did, but it is another thing to expect the US to act on those concerns. We found even upon our return to Australia that some of the comments that were made while we were in America were quite reassuring to us. However, we really have not received any kind of support since that meeting, despite the fact that we did receive certain assurances from the United States Vice-President at that time. The delegation received from Vice-President Al Gore-and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) also received subsequent to that visitcertain assurances from the President of the United States of America, Bill Clinton, regarding the same matter. While the President and Vice-President are giving undertakings to minimise the impact of subsidies on non-subsidising nations such as Australia, we are yet to see these words put into action. One thing that did come out in our visit was the cost to American consumers of the export enhancement program and other agricultural subsidies. The figure that we were quoted was in the vicinity of $90 billion, and it is quite obvious that Australia is going to have to ensure that United States consumers are also aware of this figure-the figure that they are paying out of their taxes to subsidise agricultural production. These consumers need to know that there are other markets throughout the world, particularly in Australia, that can supply their needs and that those needs am can be met at a much more competitive price. Subsidised American grain and other subsidised agricultural products are still being sold into Australia's traditional markets, and are still placing Australian fanners at a major disadvantage in the world market. The delegation had fruitful discussions with Senator Patrick Leahy, Chainnan of the Senate Committee on Agriculture; the Hon. Tim Johnson, Chainnan of the House Subcommittee on General Fann Commodities; the Hon. Lee Hamilton, Chainnan of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Senate Majority Leader, George Mitchell. It is my hope that before too much longer the rhetoric will tum to action, and efficient Australian producers will not have to compete unfairly against subsidised produce. However, it is not enough to sit back and wait. We must keep up the pressure on the US administration to end its export enhancement program. Obviously, the recommendation contained in this report-that we extend our range of contacts at a congressional level in Washington-will add to that and will give Australia the opportunity to increase the pressure on the United States. Mr Speaker, I would like to also join with you in commending Ilze Svenne, the secretary of the delegation, for her outstanding contribution to the success of the visit; Miss Geraldine Skinner, adviser to yourself, for an outstanding job in assisting us; and also Mr Bob Tyson, for his role in ensuring that wewere well briefed and that the visit was a success. NA Procedure Committee",16
6,Dr BLEWETT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled About time: bills, questions and working hours-report of the inquiry into reform of the House of Representatives, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
7,Dr BLEWETT,COMMITTEES,"The committee focused on three major and related issues: the handling of legislation, the structure and conduct of question time, and the fortnightly sitting program. On this last point, because a cabinet committee was working on a new sessional pattern for 1994, the committee confined itself to the weekly and daily timetable. However, the committee does strongly support the present two weeks on, two weeks off pattern. A central dilemma for the committee was how to provide adequate opportunities for debating legislation, when faced with only limited opportunities for expanding significantly the time for which the parliament sits. It may be possible to gain a few extra weeks as a result of a new sessional pattern, but there seems little opportunity for expanding the time of the House in so significant a fashion as to cope adequately with a flood of legislation. The effort to resolve this dilemma led to the most radical of the committee's proposals, those related to the handling of legislation. However, I think these are a change more in fonn than in actuality. After the first reading but before the second reading, the House will have three choices. The House will decide whether a bill will continue in the House for all stages, or will be referred to the new main committee for second reading and clause by clause consideration, or will be referred to a standing general purposes committee for an advisory report back to the House. That last option would occur only for a small number of bills. It is envisaged that the main committee would handle mostly non-controversial legislation at the second reading and clause by clause consideration stages, - ith the legislaReport tion returning to the House for the report stage and third reading. All members would be members of the main committee and be able to participate. Proceedings would be covered by Hansard and the television monitoring system. As divisions take place on about only 12 per cent of bills, this recommendation would in effect establish two parallel and coincident streams of legislation. One would be in the main committee-for non-controversial matters-and the other in the House, for more controversial bills. The advantages for members from this parallel streaming will be a greater opportunity for them to register personal and constituency views on uncontested measures in the main committee, and extended opportunities for debate on controversial legislation in the House. We are also suggesting the freeing up of the clause by clause consideration of the bill, wherever it takes place, and simplifying and streamlining legislative procedures and rituals. This should be seen as the parliament's contribution to improved working practice. In addition, we recommend, if the House adopts the main committee proposal, the election of a second deputy speaker, who should be the nominee of the opposition parties. We also envisage that some bills-probably only a small number, and particularly those about which there is no fundamental disagreement between the parties, but for which there may be dispute or uncertainty over detailswould be referred to the appropriate general purpose standing committee for advice before proceeding to the second reading in the House or main committee. The standing committees would be empowered to call for advice from the bureaucracy and interest groups, with a general objective of ensuring a better-informed debate when that debate takes place in the parliament. Let me tum to question time. Question time has become the focus of the parliamentary day for the f!1edia. It has become very much a gladiatorial combat between the leaders. For instance in 1992, admittedly a pre-election year, the opposition leader, deputy leader and National Party leader together asked between them some 70 per cent of all opposition questions and, of all answers, some 70 per cent were provided by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I doubt whether it is possible, or necessarily even desirable, to change the fundamental nature of the modem question time but we certainly can modify it and improve its conduct. The committee believes' that no single reform could more improve question time than shorter ministerial answers which have, on average, doubled in length over the past 15 years. We do not favour the rather inflexible time limit per question as in the Senate, but recommend that question time continue for at least 45 minutes and until at least 16 questions have been answered. We have also made provision for supplementary questions. If these disciplines are imposed on ministers, we propose that the power of the Speaker to deal with disorder, particularly in question time, be extended to allow him without resolution to order an honourable member's withdrawal from the chamber for a period of one hour. ",17
8,Dr BLEWETT,COMMITTEES,"The so-called sin - bin. Members of the committee not only saw the rostering of question time as a means of modifying the gladiatorial contest between leaders but also recognised the difficulty of any large scale adoption of such a system. We have therefore decided to recommend, as an experiment for two sessions, that Monday question time be· extended to one hour and, over the two Mondays, be divided into four half-hour segments with ministers, other than the Prime Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Finance, rostered according to related portfolios. The opposition would have the ability to request the presence of anyone minister other than the Prime Minister not rostered. Our recommendations on days and hours of sitting should be seen in the context of our other recommendations and in our determination to secure a more rational and effective working day. Although· we strongly favour the House rising at eight of an evening, we believe that this should be achieved without any overall loss of the present number of hours in the sitting fortnight. Accordingly, we are recommending that the House sit on Mondays and Tuesdays from 12.30 to 8 p.m., on Wednesdays from 9.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. with a one hour lunch break and on Thursday from 9.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. with a one hour lunch break. It was the committee's opinion that Wednesday evening should be kept free of parliamentary business but that Monday and Tuesday evenings be available for parliamentary committees. Such committee meetings would be free of division and quorum calls in the chamber; would be called at times to suit the majority of members of the committee; and, most importantly, would finish at an hour determined by the committee members themselves. The most important consequences of these changes for the daily timetable was that Mondays would become private members day and question time would take place at 3.30 each afternoon. We believe that honourable members, after they have examined the report, will find the proposals neither particularly radical, original nor overly ambitious. Essentially, we seek to make a series of evolutionary changes. The apparently most radical change, the one I mentioned, the main legislation committee, is a change more in form than in fact when honourable members look at the actualities of the way the House works. Many, if not most of the proposals, are drawn from procedural inquiries over the past 20 years and this, in itself, is a telling indictment on the House's ability to respond to long identified problems. The committee does regard its proposals as a package to be broadly accepted or rejected. If there develops an orgy of choosing and selecting and rejecting significant bits, the whole package will collapse. That· is why I was disappointed with the last minute appearance of a dissenting report. This dissenting report really is made up of two parts. It is a pretty conservative rejection of innovative or imaginative proposals. It rejects. the main committee on legislation and has doubts about rostered question time plus a number of rather carping and partisan criticisms of some details of the report. In that dissenting report, there is no recogdum nition whatsoever of the concessions made by Labor members. I have to say that, if Liberal Party members cannot rise in imagination above their representatives on the committee, there are no prospects of reform. If they follow the National Party member, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and do some lateral thinking and recognise that reform is a matter of give and take, there are real prospects of reform. It is certainly about time, Mr Speaker.",18
9,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"That was an interesting dissertation. I would like to congratulate the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), on his work. He has obviously pursued this particular inquiry with zeal. I also congratulate the staff of the committee, who assembled the report and who did so at some haste, I might say, towards the end of the inquiry's work. The report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, About time-bills, questions and working hours, comes at an important time in the history of the development of the institution of parliament and its effectiveness as part of the Australian system of government. As the people's house, the House of Representatives is not. highly regarded by the people who send us here. Its activities are widely seen as less than reputable at times and we, as the representatives, are the butts of many Australians' contempt. It is no coincidence that in recent years there has been a very dangerous erosion of the rights and prerogatives of parliament, visa-vis the executive. The Westminster system of parliamentary democracy relies for its effectiveness on a balance between the interests of the executive, the parliament and the judiciary. In the case of the parliament, the struggle for authority against the ever-encroaching executive seems to be a losing battle. It is no accident that the sense of powerlessness felt by many in the community is on the increase. Parliament is becoming more and more irrelevant to the process of government and the executive views parliament as not much more than a nuisance. The clamour for citizens' initiated referenand veto is a by-product of this sense of powerlessness and the utter frustration many feel in their dealings with the state. If we are committed to the parliamentary system of government, we have to ensure that it works and that it is truly representative. Logically, the first place to start is in the chambers themselves, and hence the committee's inquiry and the tabling of this report today. The necessity of the dissenting report from the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and me was brought about by the nature of some of the changes, and not because we do not agree with the motives of the committee. We have some differences as to how the proposed reforms might work and how they might affect the way in which our House conducts its business. We disagree with the proposal for a main committee. We want to see an opposition veto on the proposed rostering system for question time and we have made some changes to the sitting program to make it work better for all members. In particular, we are anxious to protect the rights of honourable members from the encroachment of the executive and. have assessed the committee's proposals on that basis. On the question of working conditions, it seems ludicrous to most reasonable people to have the important decisions of state made in an environment which mitigates rational thinking. Yet here we are with a physical workplace that is probably second to none in the world. It is a magnificent building set in one of the most thoroughly planned urban developments in the world and it should be a place where the nation's affairs are debated in an atmosphere likely to ensure that the best decisions are made by its repreaction sentatives. Unfortunately, at a'time when the nation crying out for leadership and common sense, the members of the people's chamber of its national parliament are obliged to force themselves into a regime that is not only harmful to their health but also reduces their capacity to think and act in a manner conducive to rational decision making. Recently, there has been a spate of serious health problems amongst some honourable members. The effect of long hours, lack of exercise stress is to trigger the sorts of grave bodily reactions that go with the lifestyle where excessive pressure is placed on the heart and circulatory. system. I congratulate Senator Herron's paper on those aspects of our work environment. A new member, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), was recently reported as commenting that it would pay members to have a detailed facial photograph taken each year to remind themselves of the acceleration of ageing caused by the pressure cooker environment in which we are thrust each time we arrive at Parliament House. The workload imposed on honourable members has grown exponentially in recent years. The committee system, designed to enhance the opportunity for the House to investigate matters of importance that could not otherwise be canvassed fully in debate in the chamber, has become a major burden for most honourable members. When this is added to the party meetings and other functions that occur both in and out of the sitting period, the opportunity just to actually think about one's work is virtually removed. The pressure on honourable members is increased by having a compressed sitting pattern. Thus there are two issues at stake here: one is the reform of the sitting regime itself-that is, the micro-aspects of what time we start and what time we finish; and the other is the amount of time we actually sit per annum. Here I must agree with the committee's sense of frustration with the fact that many of its recommendations, as the chairman has already indicated, are either partially or wholly derived from the findings of previous inquiries over the past 20 years. The lack of in response to earlier reports is regretted. Inactivity has compounded the original is problems and we all must accept collective responsibility for the results-that is, the serious health problems being encountered by honourable members. The honourable member for Moncrieff and I as authors of the dissenting report have little difference with the majority on the question of sittings hours. We were pleased to see that after some criticism of the original timetable and circulated the committee has accepted the view of members of the coalition that Monday and Tuesday mornings had to be kept free for the shadow ministry and party meetings respectively. The proposed sitting hours contained in the report go only a limited distance towards meeting the opposition's needS on Monday and Tuesday mornings. While the committee subsequently considered a pattern of sittings which could have been more satisfactory to the opposition, this pattern was abandoned when a majority of the committee opted in favour of a 6.30 p.m. adjournment on Thursday evenings to enable some members to return to their electorates that night. Under present airline schedules a number. of members would not b(;! able to return to their electorates on Thursday nights, and of those who could many could do so only if they were to leave parliament during the adjourna ment debate. I would like to discuss now the increase legislation and handling legislation. The increase in legislative activity in since its establishment is phenomenal, and the statistics are recorded in the report. In decade of federation an average of 23 acts year were passed, with an average of sitting hours per act. In 1992, 264 acts were passed, with an average sitting time of just over two hours. There has also been with that an increase the number of members. In 1901 there 75 members of the House of Representatives; by 1992 there were 148. If we extend the statistics of the number of sitting hours act we see that in the decade to 1910 each member could have averaged 20 minute increase speaking time per bill, whereas by 1992 the average had declined to less than one minute per bill per member. Whichever way one chooses to do the statistics, the incontrovertexperience ible fact is that we now have nearly many members of parliament as there were at federation but an allotment of only one-tenth of the debating time per bill that was able then for fewer members. It is unfortunate that the committee has not addressed the in-principle issue of a desirable amount of time, say, per annum that parliament should allot to various aspects of its business: consideration of bills, ministerial statements, matters of public importance, question time, private members' business and so on. Instead, the committee has proceeded on the hunch that members generally would like to have more opportunity for contributing to debate on bills. The committee rejected a proposal I put to it calling for a survey of all members so that they could put various proposals. The proposal by the committee chamber is a radical one and is fraught with some danger. It is designed to provide an alternative forum for debate on 'non-conup tentious' bills. Its raison d'etre is ostensibly to provide more time for debate. However, opens up a host of other problems that have not been satisfactorily resolved in the comtime-for mittee's report. One of these problems lack of opportunity to move new amendments in the report stage in the House. This in presents a serious problem where, as is sometimes the case, new matters are raised in the House the second reading debate. I accept some responsibility for the the first committee's recommendations because I a alerted the committee to the fact that in the 25 House of Commons in the United Kingdom the report stage often is a rehash of the debate in the committee and thus is counterproductive. However, my interest, derived from in inquiries I have made of members of the were House of Commons, was to examine the objectives of having the second chamber or main committee in the first place. In reality per the only benefit of introducing the main committee into the process of the House is to debating time. There is unlikely to be any improvement in the quality of the debate or any lessening of the point scoring or ·partisan nature of the discussions, if the in the UK, from where this idea twice as originates, is any guide. The disadvantages of the main committee availrevolve around the need to maintain the standing and importance of the activities of the House. If the committee is introduced, I suspect it will be at the expense of the relative importance of the contributions to debate by private members. In other words, it will introduce a classification to bills, and this can only be at the expense of the interests of constituents. After all, if an executive now cOI}siders parliament to be a nuisance then what better, in the case of the House of Representatives, than to shunt off less than controversial legislation to the backwater of the main committee? In the assessment of whether this measure improves or reduces the standing of parliament versus the executive my view is, after careful consideration, that it for a second will favour the latter. Thus we recommended the committee draw and circulate to all members of the House of Representatives a discussion paper canvasit sing an extended range of alternative means of increasing the amount of House debating example, an increase in the number is of sitting weeks per annum, programming legislation to avoid the use of gui110tine and so on. Scheduling question time at 3.30 each day raises another serious opposition concern. For most of the present parliamentary session the opposition has been precluded from raising matters of public importance and censure motions. Under the committee's proposal it is unlikely that any MPI would commence much before 4.30 p.m., which would mean a 5.30 p.m. conclusion. Furthennore, it can often happen that other items intervene between question time and the bringing on of a matter of public importance, which would have the effect of running the MPI much later. This is one of the very few opportunities the opposition has available to it to raise for debate those issues of public moment. Given the afternoon deadlines of major sections of the media, an effect of this proposal could be to render MPIs virtually meaningless in terms of their reach to the general public. I will conclude on the proposal for a sinbin, a proposal which we supported. I must add that the proposal to allow the Speaker to have the power to suspend a member for one hour for disorderly acts is an attempt restore the standing of question time in particular the proceedings of the House in general. As disciplinary action is rarely taken against government members, this must be used as carefully as possible by the Speaker, following its introduction. I again commend the committee and the chairman and the staff for the work that has been undertaken, and look forward to seeing exactly how these proposals are considered and agreed upon by the executive. This promises to be a very interesting time.",19
10,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEES," At the outset, I commend to the House the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure called About time: bills, questions and working hours. I am surprised and somewhat saddened by the rather negative position that the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) have taken to the report-the honourable member for Moore in his remarks and the honourable member for Moncrieff in her dissenting report, which was supported by the honourable member for Moore. There have been a number of reports of the procedure committee since it was instituted in the late 1980s. Many of the most sensible recommendations of the committee have not been taken up, though some of the more peripheral ones have. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will see, as other members who have read previous reports and served on the committee in the past wi11 see, that there are repeated in this report a number of the more sensible proposals that the committee's predecessors have put forward in the past, and there are also some dramatically new proposals here. As the chairman of the committee said, the report needs to be taken as a package. If members of the House and the executive decide to cherry-pick part of this, it will destroy the main thrust of what the committee was looking at, because in the committee's view there is a need for the parliament to sit for more hours to discuss legislation and other matters that are before the House. One has to make a choice on whether what we want is more days of sitting or more hours of sitting. In the past people have concentrated on and saying that more days of sitting equate to more hours of sitting. What the committee has tried to do here is come up with a proposition that wi11 allow us, in a sense, to have our cake and eat it too. The implementation of the main committee to deal with legislation gives us a mechanism, in essentially the same number of days and the same number of hours as the House sits now, to increase by about 50 per cent the 'amount of time that could be spent on legislation. I think that is a very sensible proposition for the House to give serious consideration to. There is no doubt that in the last few weeks we have seen some of the worse ways that we operate in this place. With a consistent guillotine running, with the House getting up a midnight each night, we have had people literally nearly dying to get out of this place in recent years. I think that that is a stupid way to deal with legislation. No-one can suggest that some contribution that a person is making here at half past 12 is as considered a contribution as it might have been had it been made at some more sensible hour of the day, particularly if it is on a Thursday night after we have been sitting until midnight for that week and the week before. The main committee proposal is a mechanism which will allow us to get away from the very late night sittings and will allow us to get away from the guillotine. It will allow us to have more consideration of what the legislation program is and give honourable members time to contribute to that. I reject the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Moore that it will become the place to which the government will shunt contentious legislation and I reject his propogovernment. sition that it will prevent amendments being made at a later date in the process. If he had read the report properly, and read the comments that he and other committee members had made, which were reflected in the report, he would see that that is not so. The mechanism for sendirig things to the main committee will be by discussion between the government and the opposition, and members ought to remember that nearly 90 per cent of the legislation that goes through this place goes through unopposed. The 10 per cent that is contentious would be dealt with in this chamber. If, during the process of consideration bill in the main committee, it were found that an amendment was needed, an abort mechanism is mentioned in the committee's report that would allow that bill to come back into this House for further discussion and amendment if necessary. So that safeguard is there. The proposal that the government would shunt contentious legislation to that committee is groundless. (Extension of time granted) Even if contentious legislation were shunted to that committee, very significant debate would occur there. It would be reported in the same way; it would be televised; it would be recorded in Hansard. There would be no hiding of things. The main legislation committee draws some of its inspiration from what happens in the House of Commons, but there is no doubt that we could amend that proposal to allow us to achieve greater time for debate and more sensible hours. It will overcome to a great degree the significant problem we have in the budget session each year with late night sittings, the frantic introduction of bills and, towards the end of the year, the guillotining of bills to meet the Senate deadline. I would also like to address the question time proposals that were put forward by the committee. The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), said that members of the House must remember that nearly half of the questions that are asked in this place are questions asked by the leadership of the opposition to the leadership of the Backbenchers do not playa role on the opposition's side in this, in the main. Junior ministers do not get scrutinised, and junior opposition shadow ministers do not get a chance to ask questions. The procedure committee thought we should address moving the focus of question time away from that gladiatorial contest between members of the leadership. Question time should be what it is alleged to be: a time when people ask rational questions and seek sensible answers. I have not seen too much of that on either side of the House in the last 10 years but, if we want to reinvent the wheel, let us see whether there can be some time of a during the week when we get back to what question time should really be all about. One of the ways in which we thought we could do that was to experiment with rostering. In the past, people have said that rostering was too hard, too silly, too difficult, undemocratic and so on. The committee has taken a sensible middle position on this and said, 'Let's roster for one day. Let's suck it and see for the first period of next year. If it doesn't work, we will do away with it. But let's have a trial and see whether it works. Let's see if we can encourage junior opposition frontbenchers to have a go at junior ministers. Let's take the leadership group out of it for one day of the week and see whether we can make the place work differently'. The other question that the procedure committee looked at was how to ensure that there is more give and take at question time. The committee approach, as it has been in the past, was not to have the time limit mechanism that the Senate has but to say, 'Let's have the number of questions regulate the system'. I recall that one day 14 questions went for an hour and nearly 20 minutes. If ministers had to sit through that every day they might decide that short answers were more important. So I think regulating question time by the number of answers to be given is sensible. The committee's proposal for supplementary questions is also very sensible. It allows people, if they have got a minister on the run, to put the pressure on without having time for the minister to be given another question from his own side to allow him to think about the matter. I think that will make question time a more dynamic forum. The sin-bin proposal is also sensible because it would allow a lesser penalty than suspension, and it would give the Speaker more control over question time. I commend the committee's report to the House and I say again that people should see this as a package. It is not something to be cherry-picked: if we do that we will get the worse of all worlds. There has been a lot of give and take by both sides on this issue. Now is the time for the parliament to do something about the way we operate in order to have a proper look at legislation, and to to make question time operate more efficiently. In particular, we need to do something about, and get a rational approach to, the working hours of this place. I thank the members of the committee for the time they have given to the report.",22
11,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"Like other speakers, I certainly want to compliment the committee staff on the job they have done throughout this inquiry and in generating the report. I also want to compliment the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), for the work he has done. At the same time, I must say I was rather perturbed at his praise of me when he launched into his speech when it sounded a little like the kiss of death. However, I suppose I must be generous and thank him very much indeed, although I think his praise may have had a certain slant to it. In considering the sitting hours and the sitting patterns of this chamber, one has to come to the conclusion very rapidly-it does not take very long after one is first electedthat they are pretty crazy. It is absolutely stupid that we should be sitting, as the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) said, until 12 o'clock night after night. I can recall a particular occasion when, as a deputy chairman of committees,· I was sitting in the Speaker's chair controlling the House at 5.25 a.m.  Garry.",24
12,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"Of course I always try to do a very good job. But that example is an indication of just how silly the sitting hours are. Those who have commented on the impact on the health of honourable members are absolutely spot-on. As an earlier speaker did, I also commend Senator John Herron for the paper he prepared on this issue. We are all aware that, in this present sitting, one honourable member has had a car accident on the way home after a long sitting. We are aware also that in the last couple of weeks another honourable member became very ill with a heart attack and stroke. It is commonly said-anecdotally, I suppose-that there are only two ways in which try honourable members in this place differ from the rest of the people of Australia. One is the incidence of marital breakdown. If that is true, I can understand why that has happened; it is because of the stupid lifestyle we have. The second is the incidence of heart attack. I totally support the proposition that we should reform the procedures of this House. I am particularly very enthusiastic about the idea of getting the House up at 8 o'clock, certainly on three out of the four nights a week, if not the four nights. In considering some of the points in the dissenting report, I see nothing wrong with suggesting that the second chamber should be treated with caution. I personally have no problem with that. I take the view that we must be bipartisan in considering both what the chamber does and the recommendations in this report. Whether we sit on the government benches or the opposition benches, we have got to realise that sooner or later that is going to change. Those now in opposition will be in government-hopefully after the next election, it is about time as the title of the report says-and so the report has to be judged in a very bipartisan fashion. We need to look at it from the point of view that we are in opposition' now on this side, but we will be in government, and so whatever shortcomings may be imposed now on the opposition by the committee's report, those same shortcomings will be imposed on the present government when it is in opposition. Above all, I think we have to agree that it is absolutely essential that there is change. I noted in the dissenting report that my friend and colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) mentioned the United Kingdom House of Commons in commenting that there is no evidence that the quality of debate is better with this method, as the same partisan tactics are used just as fiercely as in the main chamber. Quite frankly, with the greatest respect, I would certainly hope that that is so. After all, if we are going to be debating in a main committee, we should be just as fierce in protecting the rights of the people we represent and in seeking the betterment of Australia. On that point, therefore, I see no particular problem at all. Of course, we all acknowledge that the number of members of the parliament has doubled since Federation and that that is one of the reasons we need to increase sitting hours. (Extension of time granted) I happen to believe very strongly that we must have more time for debate. The only possibilities are to extend the number of sitting days or the sitting weeks or to get more hours into the existing ones. In the discussions that I have had with members of this committee-indeed, with honourable members on both sides who are not members of the committee - I have observed, by and large, an obsessive desire to get out of Canberra and to get back to the electorate. Without pinpointing anybody, I do not know of any honourable member who would say, 'Yes, I want to stay on in Canberra'. I know that when the government is applying the guillotine we always say in the opposition-as undoubtedly honourable members opposite would say and have said in opposition-'We are prepared to sit more days to get through the business rather than have the guillotine'. But the reality is that every honurable member in this place wants to get back to his or her electorate as quickly as possible to look after the electorate and, I suggest, without being in the least cynical but stating the obvious, to look after the votes. Every one of us is her- because we enjoy what we are doing and we want to be re-elected. So I think it is very important that we should face up to the reality that there are no honourable members who want to sit for more weeks and more days. This is why I support the proposition of having the main committee which will provide more hours, although we· .have not categorised exactly how many. I note in the dissenting report that the table which depicts hours per sitting fortnight has made no allowance at all for the number of hours sat by the main committee. So obviously there would be quite a bit more. Both government speakers have made reference to the package being a package, and the honourable member for Watson twice made reference to the desirability of not cherry-picking. The reality is that, while the committee has hope that it goes forward as a package, it is not going to be accepted as a package. I do not believe that for one minute. I believe that there will be change to it and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Although as a committee we think that what we have put forward should be adopted, that will not necessarily be the case. All wisdom on this does not reside in us as members of the committee. Like the member for Moore, I would have been happier had we had the opportunity of a questionnaire to all honourable members of this House to ask for their opinion on specific items within the recommendation. In fact, I did ask that a questionnaire be sent but we ran out of time and that did not happen. In all fairness, however, every honourable member of this House was given the opportunity of commenting and making submissions to the committee. In fact, the President of the Senate made a submission, as did Senator Herron, and I thank both of them for that. But there were only 13 submissions from 147 honourable members of this House. Those submissions came from five government backbenchers and five members of the coalition, and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) wrote to me personally. When we come to considering the package, in all fairness, have got to make the point that 134 members of this chamber did not bother to write to the committee and make their opinions known. I think that is a great pity. But there must be reform. .. , I believe that this committee has done a good job. I do not agree with absolutely everything in the recommendations but I support the committee's report because· I . believe that change must happen. While the honourable member for Bonython is desperate-'desperate' is perhaps too strong a word, and I should say 'would really like'-to have it accepted as a package, I do not think that will happen. There will be changes, but the main and most important thing is that the procedures of this House be changed for the better health and the better· government of Australia.  want to support this very important report of the Standing Committee on Procedure, About time: bills. questions and working hours. I want to thank Robyn Webber and the staff, who supported the committee so well. The report is extraordinary to me because it contains a dissenting report from a former deputy chairman who found it difficult to attend meetings-and I can understand that and do not hold that against her-and who presented views in the dissenting report that the committee itself did not have the opportunity to consider. It was seconded. by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), who also agreed with the majority report. But be that as it may, this is an important package of· reforms. It is not a wish list of everything that the committee would like to see changed; it is a practical approach about what is necessary for change. I invite members of the House to consider what the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) said on reflecting on the last couple of weeks: one of the most important things we have to do is to take ourselves seriously if we are to ever ask the public to take us seriously for what we do. In regard to the hours reform, which I strongly recommend, I ask that, if it is implewe mented, we look at the impact on the staffparticularly the attendant staff-in the House. I hope that they would not be disadvantaged. If the sin-bin proposal is adopted, I hope that it is not implemented by way of trial on members of the committee. It should be applied impartially and fairly. The main chamber proposal is a most important reform. Some people have suggested, quite rightly, that we deal with too much legislation. But it must be remembered that we also have a Senate, which does not want to see delegated legislation introduced. Therefore, we are always going to have a significant amount of legislation to deal with. This report is all about wanting to be able to deal with it sensibly and appropriately. We have three options: dealing with it within the House; referring it to the standing committees, which is an important change; and the main chamber proposal. Like the member for Watson, I do not think--..:.if one has seen the amount of guillotining that has gone on, particularly over the last few years-that any member in this House, on either side, can be very proud of the way we handle legislation. It is, essentially, anti-democratic. But this is an opportunity to change it, and to avoid the amount of guillotining that we do. There will be other benefits, which members have mentioned, such as providing more opportunities for members to speak. I am a very strong proponent of rostering. I note that people, in discussion, often say that this is some way for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to avoid coming to question time. I just find it ironic that, in my view, the best performer in the House-who absolutely loves answering questions and gets highly frustrated at not being asked questions-is going to be specially advantaged because of these proposals. I find that really amazing. I think the opposition is far better off without him in question time. I make the point in support of the honourable member for Watson that every minister in the Senate is used to answering questions. It is part and parcel of the many varied roles involved in being a member of the executive. But one cannot say that this chamber, in any way, scrutinises the administration of the ministers, if 70 per cent' of the questions are asked by the leadership group to the leadership group. This is an important trial, and I want to emphasis that not all members of the committee unanimously embrace it. But what they do say is, 'Let us give it a go and see how it works'. In terms of parliamentary principles, it is well founded, and I think it should deserve the support of all honourable members. Last but not least, the committee does refer to having joint estimates committees. Again, I pay tribute to the honourable member for Watson, who revolutionised this place with the expansion of House of Representatives committees. The issue of joint estimates committees is an issue that the procedure committee can take up in the future, but the estimates committees in the Senate have demonstrated their ability to scrutinise the budget much more effectively than it is done in the House, and I think the proposal of joint estimates committees is worthy of consideration and development by members of this House. I strongly endorse the report and thank the chairman for his contribution. (Time expired) .",24
13,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"If nothing else is taken up in this report by the executive or the parliament, there is one thing that has to be: that is, a change in the days and hours of sitting. That recommendation is contained on page 33 of the report. The committee recommends that the parliament sit on Mondays and Tuesdays from 12.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.; on Wednesdays from 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., and on Thursdays from 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. That is a revolutionary change, but it is a sensible change. The current sitting hours of this parliament are obscene. They are absurd. They are placing great strain !lot only on members of parliament but also on support staff. Frankly, I do not think there is anyone else in Australia that would cop it, except members of parliament, who somehow think that they are different and that they are immune from the health problems and the stress problems. Before I became a member of this House I was a public defender, a legal aid barrister-a quite stressful job that required many hours in preparation and in court addressing juries in criminal trials. It was not as stressful or as tiring· as this job is, in terms of hours. Since I have become a member of this place, with late night sittings, my body clock has been thrown right out. If nothing else, this parliament needs to start sitting sensible hours, because at the end of the evening what is spoken in both this place and the other place is gibberish. Hopefully, a change in sitting hours might lead to a bit more sanity. The proposed sitting hours that we have recommended are a compromise. They are different from the draft that we circulated. They are different from my preferred ideal. My preferred ideal is 2 to 8 on Monday, and 10 to 1 and 2 to 8 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with the first item of business being question time each day. But that went by the board because the opposition demanded that Tuesday mornings be free for its shadow cabinet and party meetings, et cetera. So what we have in terms of the sitting times is a reasonable compromise, and they are reasonable hours. The other thing that we need to do, if we accept this, is to resist calls by the executive to break the 8 o'clock rule. I was one member who from the outset said, 'Nothing beyond 8 o'clock in terms of the formal sitting times of the parliament'. If the executive has a backlog of business and bills that it wants to rush through, let us sit extra days and let us schedule extra sitting weeks from Monday to Thursday. But we should not break the 8 o'clock rule under any circumstance, because it turns this place into a mockery. That is one thing that I urge on members of the parliament-to resist any attempt by the executive to break the 8 o'clock rule, if these sitting times are accepted. I note that the report talks about Monday and Tuesday evenings being when we can have party committees or parliamentary committees. That is a voluntary thing when not all members of the parliament are involved. But that is a matter for the respective committees. What I like about this scheme is that it leaves Fridays free; it is two weeks on and two weeks off. I would like to see Fridays being used. for parliamentary committee hearings. We will still have the sensible two weeks on and two weeks off so that we, as members of the people's house, can go back and service our electorates and be available for our constituents. That is one of the reasons that I rejected the three-week cycle with one week off: it takes us out of our electorates. One of the things about modem-day politics is that. the electorate is demanding more and more to see its members of parliament and to have them accessible. This proposed sitting pattern not only allows accessibility to members but also allows decent sitting hours. We will be able to leave at 8 0' clock. We will be able to go to our flats and units in Canberra, or whatever, have a reasonable sleep time and come back the next morning, properly prepared to take on business. How members can back up after a 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock sitting in the parliament the night before, or even 11 o'clock, is just beyond me. They cannot; it is fairly obvious. It is about time we changed it. The one recommendation in this report that I think is not negotiable is an 8 o'clock cut-off for the sitting. (Time expired)",27
14,Dr BLEWETT,COMMITTEES,Bony than) (10.42 a.m.)I move: That the House take note of the paper. I would like to thank all members of the committee for their work and particularly Ms Robyn Webber and the secretariat for their excellent backup services.,28
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Jenkins)Order! In accordance with standing order 102B the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. UNEMPLOYMENT: SOLUTIONS,28
16,Mr SAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises the need for innovative solutions to reduce unemployment; (2) in particular, acknowledges the export potential of environmental industries; and (3) takes note of the preliminary Scan Report of the Green Jobs Unit jointly set up by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Conservation Foundation. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is growth in environmental industries. A fundamental issue for any group of people investigating employment in this country is to answer the question: where can job growth be enhanced? The continuing development of environmental industries can provide part of the answer. In fact, the scope is enormous: waste management; renewable energy products and services; pollution abatement; transport, particularly heavy rail and light rail; forestry and conservation, including ecotourism; agricultural land rehabilitation; and environmental research and development. These have all been identified as potential job opportunities. Lynette Wilks, the coordinator of the green jobs unit, put forward compelling arguments in Habitat .Australia in August of this year. She stated: The world market in environmental goods and services is growing rapidly. The O.E.C.D. has estimated international trade in the environment industry currently at $200 billion, growing at 5%7% annually to reach around $300 billion by the Year 2000. Lynette Wilks also points out that, although Australia is at the cutting edge in some technologies, such as waste water treatment, Australia currently holds only a tiny fraction of international environmental trade, with annual exports totalling $200 million and with imports of environmental technology and equipment and services estimated to be $1 billion. Wilks reminds us of the clear intentions of the United States and Japan. Firstly, in the United States, the Clinton-Gore administration is targeting the environmental industry as one of the brightest opportunities to spur economic recovery. A presidential task force has been established, with a brief to integrate ment generation into this fast growing area. Secondly, Japan has declared world leadership in environmental technology as a national goal. The influential Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry is now currently spending $1 billion a year on new earth 21, a joint government industry program, to produce cutting edge environmental technologies. An example of the potential market is Taiwan, which intends to devote five per cent of its considerable GNP to environmental management over the next five years. The developed world has a chronic and endemic human surplus of labour of some 10 per cent plus. Traditional industries such as textiles, iron and steel and metals processing are all declining in employment, whilst electronics, telecommunications and biotechnology are gaining, but not to an extent to take up the labour surplus. The microelectronic industry has spawned whole new industries but has also frighteningly reduced the need for labour throughout the world. Throughout the industrialised world we are substituting capital, energy and increased output for human labour, which is in surplus. Traditional economic growth no longer is always accompanied by commensurate increase in the number of jobs. However, there is growth in environmental industries. During the recent recession in the United States, the 40 largest environmental firms reported an average nine per cent increase in payroll, in dramatic contrast to most of the economy. This morning there are three examples I would like to point to where environment industries can provide part of the employment answer. They are renewable energy, rail transport and waste management. If we took a nuclear plant and wanted to produce 1,000 gigawatts of electricity, we would need 100 workers, in a coal or oil fired plant we would need 116, but if we were thinking of a solarthermal facility we would need 248, or on a wind farm facility, 541. The challenge is to build renewable energy systems that are of lower or equivalent cost to conventional systems; that is to deliberately direct spending employ- to areas that are labour intensive. A move to solar energy on a large scale would in fact create jobs. Australia has the potential to be a world leader and major exporter of manufactured solar thermal technology. A study by the Australian New Zealand Solar Energy Society demonstrated that an increase in the use of solar energy for hot water, for example, from a current six per cent of Queensland households to 25 per cent would create 1,500 new direct jobs, with a further number of indirect jobs. Applied across Australia, that would result in 12,000 to 15,000 new jobs. From anintemational perspective we could get the example of Denmark, which encouraged the wind power industry because oil prices had soared in the 1970s. By 1985, 10 per cent of Danish power needs were provided by wind power, creating 3,000-odd jobs and with the loss of only 28 in the conventional oil-fired power industry. A German study showed that the spending of a billion deutschmarks on road construction created fewer jobs, 14,000 to 19,000, than the same expenditure on light and heavy rail. For a billion deutschmarks, in light rail one gets 23,000 jobs and in heavy rail 22,000 jobs. Every year in Australia the cost and subsidy of road transport is about $10 billion, if one takes account of the $5 billion we spend on road building and maintenance and the estimated $5 billion subsidy as the result of road trauma. Little recognition appears to be given to the size of this particular road trauma subsidy for road transport. By contrast, subsidies for light and heavy rail are not so kindly treated in this country. That does not make sense, and a greater balance is required. Investment and development in heavy and light rail could be 100 per cent Australian in materials, design and manufacture. Enormous potential exists for the export of cost-efficient urban transport systems in our own region. I point out that the Hong Kong light rail system was made in this country. As far as waste management is concerned, it is interesting to point out that a recent Industry Commission draft report on the environment waste management industry estimated expenditure on sewerage systems by Australian water authorities in the 1990s to $5.5 billion. Given 15,000 to 25,000 jobs per billion dollars spent, these developments alone could lead to the development of between 70,000 and 100,000 jobs. Compared with incineration and landfilling, recycling offers more employment and is cheaper due to its much lower capital cost. The jobs are permaIlent in both operation and maintenance lJctivities. In an examination of the number of jobs to process one million tonnes of waste, Michael Renner observed that for landfilling one has a range of 50 to 360 jobs; for incinerators, 130 to 1,000 jobs; and for recycling, from 550 to 2,000 jobs, for the same expenditure. The cost of an incinerator, which has been canvassed in this country from time to time, is $500 million, which is three times the cost of a recycling facility to handle the same amount of waste. Alcoa, in the United States, estimated that there are 30,000 people employed in the recycling of aluminium alone. That number is equal to twice the employment figures in the primary aluminium production industry, and is based on a very low rate of recycling of only 11 per cent. If the recycling rate were boosted to 75 per cent, that could mean up to 375,000 jobs in the USA. Obviously, recycling would cause some job losses with the lesser need for raw materials but, as the International Labour Organisation points out, the gains would outweigh the losses. It is important to acknowledge that some of the debate in Australia on economic growth and the environment is very unproductive. On one hand, some people in the 'economic growth at all costs' movement suggest that full employment must be left to the whims of the free market. On the other hand, some people in the environment movement suggest that full employment levels must be sacrificed on the altar of environmental purity. But economic health and environmental health are interdependent. The choice for lower unemployment levels is not between the environment and economic growth; it includes both. The ancient Greeks had a single word for the economy and the environment, and that word was 'oikos'. That be concept was right, back then, and it is right for now. The fundamental role of any economy is to provide jobs. If that is the case, it means that there must always be adjustments to policy to cover unintended consequences or negative aspects of any policies set. Australia led the world in the introduction of social benefits, and it can lead the developed world in breaking the cycle of unemployment. The economic orthodoxies of the past 10 years have had both positive and negative effects. From a positive point of view, Australia is much more internationally competitive. But those economic orthodoxies have had negative effects, too, with significant job losses. Economic growth alone will not solve the unemployment problem. There need to be balancing mechanisms for new industries. (TIme expired)",28
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Newell-I second the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I reserve my right to speak.  motion is a mea culpa from the Labor Party. Australia's unemployment level is unacceptably high. The government does not know what to do, and so the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has donned the mantle of John Curtin and commissioned a white paper. The caucus employment task force has released its contribution, a paper called Growth plus. The chairman of that task force, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), along with his caucus colleagues, appears to have forgotten that we need growth before we can have growth plus. We need to achieve growth of four per cent just to maintain current employment levels. At the moment, we can manage only 2.5 per cent. Labor governments have failed to give this country the policies we need to increase productivity, to become more competitive, and to increase investment and domestic savings. The honourable member for Port Adelaide represents the heartland of South Australia's working class. He comes from a strong and proud community but, thanks to Labor's policies, the city of Port Adelaidehis own electorate-had an unemployment rate of 16.9 per cent in the March quarter of this year. This pattern is repeated throughout suburban Adelaide. The north-west of my electorate is battler territory where, in the Enfield local government area, unemployment stands at an unacceptably high 15.3 per cent. It is appropriate that two South Australians should be leading the debate here today. To many commentators, our state is the heart. of the new Australian rust belt and·for the next six weeks it will be the focus of political attention in the lead-up to the December 11 poll. South Australia's problems represent many of the difficulties this nation will have to overcome if we are to reduce the disgraceful levels of unemployment the ALP has cursed us with. Growth plus contains some worthy suggestions. Unemployment is a national tragedy, and we are scarcely going to reject all the recommendations put forward to end the mess. However, the document fails to make any recommendations on how the massive amounts of revenue needed to fund employment and training programs might be found. In the back rooms, the white paper has become the scene for a battle over the economic direction of the Labor Party. Economists have warned for many months that unemployment is going sideways, as one month's employment gains appear to vanish when the next set of statistics appears. If we are in a recovery, then it is an extremely shaky one. It is clear that current policies are failing deliver. Many people in the government, along with professional welfare lobbyists and union bureaucrats, would like to see the introduction of some form of jobs levy, an extra tax for spending on job creation. It is hard to think of a cruder or more wasteful instrument to use. Dr John Quiggan of the ANU estimated earlier this year that a program to support 500,000 jobs could cost $7.5 billion. In South Australia, Professor Cliff Walsh has repeated OECD and other international research which suggests that it is necessary to fund three to five government positions just to create one job. It has been suggested that our wage levels cause unemployment· and that lower wages would soak up unemployment. These arguments Ilfe largely unacceptable in social terms. Instead, if we want a real and lasting solution to unemployment we need an intelligent and pragmatic industry policy that recognises international realities and this country's abilities, combined with a flexible industrial relations system. Flexibility in labour market arrangements does not have to be a euphemism for cutting wages. Instead, it can be a mechanism that allows companies and their workers to make mutually beneficial arrangements that maintain wages and conditions while increasing levels of productivity and quality of work that will increase their competitiveness. We must take the same approach when dealing with the issues of industry policy. Throughout the 1980s many of the key assumptions of Australian society, such as tariffs and centralised wage fixing, were gradually dismantled as part of the restructuring of the Australian economy. However, as these have gone, both sides of politics have been guilty of failing to ask what should be put in their place. The transition period, as we come out of recession and move into a new and more competitive economy, will be painful. The costs must not be borne by the disadvantaged. We must provide social protection. We must stop the growth of inequality in our society. We cannot trust the vagaries of the market to but, at the same time, we should be reluctant to return to a blind faith in the state. To do this, we need to have a truly creative and flexible industry strategy that can deliver. Temporary employment programs financed by extra taxes will not be the best solution. However, we should not need to destroy our standard of living in pursuit of this goal. Many honourable members may recall the excellent industry paper issued by Senator Vanstone earlier this year. In it she said: Policies to lower costs are rather like the primary school of industry policy. They are essential. basic. pervasive and long lasting in effect, but not to equip us to move ahead, let alone be a world leader in today's complex society. In 1993 it should be clear that producing and selling products at lower costs is not the sole solution to our· economic woes. We cannot attempt to rely on our traditional commodity exports. Instead,businesses, as well as governments, should be fostering ways in which we can build on or create domestic advantages that are unique to Australia. We must learn from countries like Japan howto supply innovative products and maintain a market advantage through better technology, better quality and better marketing. As Senator Vanstone wrote: . Government has an important role to play in developing and strengthening the environment and culture for innovation. Establishing innovation based international competitiveness in a range of industries will require major adjustments to deep set attitudes, institutions and structures that have evolved out of our protectionist past. These ments will not occur simply because tariff barriers are eliminated. Government must playa leadership role and work with Australian industry to build competitive strengths. A focus on costs is not simply enough. In the world growth industries of value added goods and services, a cost reduction strategy is no for a clever, novel or quality product that meets customer needs. This situation is clear in my home state of South Australia. South Australia may well have the greatest problems of the three rust belt states. For the last five financial years, our annual employment rate has been well above the national average. Victoria is still the headquarters of many companies. Tasmania has the potential to develop resource based industries. However, South Australia is in a very difficult position. In June last year, a report by international finance consultants Arthur D. Little found that South Australia's economy and standard of living were under threat. The report said: The problem is not the current recession. It is deeper and much more fundamental. The receding economic tide of the recession is simply revealing the structural weaknesses just beneath the surface of the economy. The Labor government is tired and incompetent. However, the Liberal Party wants to build on some of the policies I have outlined enough above. The election gives South Australians the opportunity to elect a Liberal government which will attract investment, create jobs and restore confidence and pride in our state. As the Arthur D. Little study showed, South Australia can be nationally and internationally renowned in science, computing, software, corporate services, medical and pharmaceutical supplies, environmental management, agriculture, education and community services, engineering and the design and construction of infrastructure. We can refocus the MFP through our tertiary institutions, the technology park and science park to create new centres for excellence with strong export potential. We can become a food basket for South-East Asia through rural diversification and increased food processing. A Liberal government in South Australia adjustwill be able to encourage the development of niche national and international markets through manufacturing and technologically innovative private enterprise so that our companies are not constantly competing with larger organisations and their established substitute marketing and distribution chains. This will create new employment opportunities and will be aided by more flexible employment arrangements. However, we will make sure employees are protected through the right to remain in unions and awards or to negotiate enterprise agreements. There will be minimum standards for enterprise agreements guaranteeing pay and leave entitlements that will include sick, maternity and parental leave, and laws that will prevent employees from being forced into enterprise agreements. The current drain of jobs and population from South Australia does not hurt only my state. It puts new demands on interstate infrastructure and services and undermines their competitiveness. The types of policies much Dean Brown and the South Australian Liberal Party are advocating will restore a greater sense of equilibrium and create an environment where industry and employment can develop. Today's motion mentions environmental exports. We all recognise the,ir potential. But Lynette Wilks, the Australian Conservation Foundation's Green Jobs Coordinator, wrote in August this year: Australia is itl grave danger of missing the boat in the fast developing environment management business. It is afflicted by the generic problems which strike other industries: lack of venture to commercialise existing technologies; a small domestic market; inexperience in exporting etc. As I said earlier, we need to have growth to have growth plus. We need new and creative policies. Only then will we cure unemployment. (TIme expired)",30
18,Mr NEWELL,COMMITTEES,"I rise, having seconded the motion put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). The motion reads in part: ... recognises the need for innoviltive solutions to reduce unemployment; in particular, acknowledges the export potential of environmental industries; and takes note of the preliminary Scan Report of the Green Jobs Unit ... 1 thank the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) for getting to the motion in the last 30 seconds of his address. Essentially the motion goes to the heart of one of the problems facing Australia at the present time. In its attempt to provide some debate and to bring forth some solutions for government action to address this problem, we felt that the motion had a lot of bipartisan support. The eight or nine minutes that the honourable member for Sturt spent wandering and lamenting other aspects of the political field did have both the honourable member for Port Adelaide and me wondering whether we should not call a point of order on him. However, in the sense of trying to achieve some bipartisanship, we felt we would remain in our places and allow the debate to ensue with the good nature with which many members have approached this subject. A- honourable members will know, there is an urgency as no other to seek out innovative solutions that will help reduce unemployment levels in the country. The situation confronting Australia, with some one million unemployed people, is that quite a substantial chunk of those are long-term unemployed. I would anticipate that the role of the innovation, if I could put it that way, is to actually seek solutions which will mean that many of the unemployed, particularly the longer-term unemployed, will be able to come into other sectors of industry through either training or retraining. This is the challenge that has been taken up by the government and it is led by capital the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his motion. In May, the Prime Minister announced a task force on employment opportunities, which the honourable member for Port Adelaide co-chaired. The task force will release a discussion paper in December, which I am confident will provide a package of innovative, strategies to combat unemployment. The changing face of the labour market means that traditional programs and schemes to create employment are no longer effective. To some extent, the honourable member for Sturt did allude to the changing face of the labour market. In tackling the unemployment problems, we need· to look at how the labour market is changing, and why it is changing. Years ago, it was sufficient to leave school at grade 10 t6 be confident of getting a job. This sentiment represents rapidly fading memories of a bygone era. Technological advancement and computerisation mean that low skill jobs slowly disappeared as the structural nature of the economy began to change under the influence of government changes in policy. It has been recognised on both sides of the House, including the honourable member for Sturt, that those changes were very necessary. As factories became mechanised, many former labour intensive industry jobs, such as those in agriculture, building, road and rail construction, were slowly lost to machinery; and the employment sector slowly began to change with the economy. Indeed, employers began to look for employees who had at least completed their secondary education. As a nation we began to focus on education as a sure-fire way of improving employment prospects. As the economy comes out ofrecession, the role of the government in providing jobs has been questioned-and the term 'jobless growth' has been alluded to-because the innovation, already in established sectors of the economy taking up mechanisation and computerisation, means that those sectors are able to increase their output and meet the increased demand without actually increasing their labour force component. However, there are now more and more people with tertiary qualifications taking jobs that they are overqualified for,. for the simple reason that they need that job to survive. This in tUt:11 puts pressure on people in other sections of the community with fewer qualifications who - ould normally take these positions. Unemployment is not simply an economic problem; it must be tackled with a holistic approach, that is, one that looks at not only the economic reality of unemployment but also the social, cultural and the financial cost to society. We must begin to change social attitudes to unemployment, to remove the stigma that has been traditionally associated with those people who, for whatever reason, have been unable to secure gainful employment. The unemployed should be encouraged, supported and assisted, not ridiculed or neglected. The road to reducing unemployment must start with each and every Australian, with a commitment to change our own personal attitudes about unemployment and become positive about the future of Australians. Many Australians would accept the impost of a jobs levy as such. But without a positive attitude, nothing can and will be achieved. 'Unemployment' is a term I am only too familiar with. My electorate of Richmond on the north coast of New South Wales has an unemployment rate in excess of 17 per cent. The tide is turning, though, in the community, led by the federal government's drive and determination to seek out innovative ideas to solve our unemployment dilemmas. One area in my electorate that has enormous export potential is environmental industries. A major part of this potential centres ecotourism, particularly between the areas of Byron Bay and Murwillumbah, with its unique rainforest, tropical bushland and flora and fauna habitats. The environmental significance of the north coast region is acknowledged by the thousands of visitors-local, interstate and international-who visit the region each year. With proper planning, support and infrastructure the· north coast could· become an internationally acclaimed eco-tourism centre. There are already companies establishing themselves in this field, designing package deals to cater for.a wide range of individuals and special interest groups. From a full-day trip to a four-clay package specifically for bird lovers, for example, these companies are providing a first-class package that involves the opportunity to not only experience the delicate nature of the region's ·ecosystem first hand but also to learn more about it. Through education these people will learn about these unique ecosystems and how important it is to preserve them for the future. Provided proper planning structures are put in place, the eco-tourism industry would be sustainable as an asset able to be enjoyed by future generations of Australians. It would provide jobs for local people and bring millions of dollars into the region, stimulating local economies. The green jobs and industry program is a cooperative effort by the Commonwealth government, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is an initiative which, I believe, augurs well for employment growth in the environment area while encouraging ecologically sustainable development which, as chairman of the caucus environment recreation and arts committee, I wholeheartedly support. . The preliminary Scan report on the Green Jobs Unit has identified a number of areas that have great potential for creating jobs in the environmental area. The. report has focused on the waste management and cleaner production industries and the potential of ecotourism. The waste management sector is one area that has been identified as having increased employment opportunities in the on future. As we look towards more innovative and ecologically smart waste management systems, more employment opportunities will exist. Many years ago, when different local government areas and bodies were moving towards. waste management in its infancy, many of those jobs were deemed to be of a low-grade nature and in fact often were utilised by areas such as sheltered workshops as part of local government's assistance to the sheltered workshops and helping to get those people in sheltered workshop type situations incorPorated b-ck into mainstream Australia. The fact is that as time has moved on those low-grade jobs, as I refer to them, have become much more mainstream and the industry itself is now certainly mainstream and certainly a part of the Australian economy. The honourable member for Port Adelaide highlighted very strongly the numbers of jobs which these' areas, waste management and recycling, have the potential to provide in Australia. Recycling, reprocessing, water treatment, waste disposal by municipal councils and waste contractors and environmental laboratories are all areas that hold the employment opportunities in the future. With the right regulations, the right innovations from governments of all persuasions, we can actually encourage those industries to grow. Just as we have attempted to restructure Australian industry in general with our removal of tariffs, government policy does have the capability of actually pushing along and assisting those industries. It takes courage in some areas to actually establish the right policies, but it is possible for us, as a federal government, to lead that way and it is pos,sible for members on both sides of the House to actually join behind and push that along. If people do not like that term, perhaps we can . get out there and lead. After all, that is what we are in this House for. (Time expired) Ms WORTH' (Adelaide) (11.12 a.m.)-At a time when one million Australians cannot find work, I agree that there is an urgent need to develop innovative solutions to reduce our chronic levels of unemployment. Australia is suffering from the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression, destroying this country's social fabric and dividing people into haves and have-nots. If you are aged 20 and live in my electorate, at least every third member of your age group will be out of work. There has been a fivefold increase in long-term unemployment since 1980. If you are a retrenched worker aged over 40, there is a good chance that you will join another 370,000 Australians who have been out of work for more than a year. We \:lave to ask why. In Australia, the worldwide retraction of labour markets has been exacerbated by economic mismanagement and the inability of this government to deal decisively with unemployment. The environment has been embraced by the government before. It was used to further its political agenda in 1990 when it needed to chase the green vote to win the federal election. But when the polls showed that the recession we had to have usurped the focus of the Australian people the environment was dropped like a hot potato. Post-recession, in an attempt to salvage credibility, the government is belatedly exploring options to fix our massive unemployment problem. While I commend the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) for acknowledging the export potential of environmental industries, I cannot help but feel cynical of this sudden focus on green technologies. The government's response so far on unemployment has been to confirm that the rate will not fall below 10 per cent before the year 2000, but it has out laid enormous sums of money to train and retrain people to jobs that do not exist. The point is: we are not becoming the clever country, but our dole queue does contain some very clever people! New industries cannot be created-or existing industries greened-by massive subsidies or other government programs. Grand visions, policy statements, proposals, committees and strat.egies are no substitute for actually doing something. While we all agree with the need for innovative solutions to reduce unemployment, we have a government that cannot generate business confidence or a climate in which these things can be done. Green industries are defined in the ACTU and the Australian Conservation Foundation's preliminary green jobs industry scan as 'the products, technologies and services which target the reduction of impacts on the environment'. These include polIution abatement, energy conservation, water and sewerage works, conservation and forestry, environment administration, agricultural and land rehabilitation, transport and community work, recycling and waste management, and environmental research and development. I note that interest in these areas in Australia is high, with the House of Representatives standing committee inquiry into environmental policies which stimulate employment growth receiving 93 submissions. Worldwide demand for environmental management in goods and services is expected to double over the next decade to $US400 billion. The QECD predicts it will be the growth industry of the decade, globally yielding average growth rates of 5.5 per cent. With 18 of the world's 30 cities with a population of four million or more based in Asia-all with stricter environmental standards-it is clear that this region holds much promise. In North America, the green industry has been valued at approximately $132 billion a year, and is growing at a rate of seven per cent annually. It is a bigger employer than the aerospace and aviation industries there. In the European Community, it is estimated that pollution control processes directly employ between 1.2 million and 1.5 million people. The booming waste management business in Australia is said to be worth at least $3 billion annually. It is promising to see that some industries-including Kinhill Engineers, RibLac and BHP Engineering-are securing a footing in markets such as India, Singapore and China. . But note this. Peter Ellyard, a former director of the Commission for the Future and special adviser to the United Nations conference on environmental development in Brazil, has said: The Korean economy transformed itself from a peasant economy to the stage where 20 per cent of its exports are in silicon chips-within 20 years. They now change their export mix every five years and are realising that the next opportunities will be in the green age. Australia on the other hand is still exporting the same things we did 30 years ago. We need to start thinking about the problem the way the Koreans do. While the government is preparing its white paper on employment, other countries are already doing what we should be doing better. Technology leaders such as Sweden, Germany and Japan have rapidly developed export markets for pollution control and prevention technologies. The Australian Financial Review reported in 1991 that Indonesia had established an environmental protection agency, not with Australian advice but using Canadian consultancy advice. Guess who is likely to sell the subsequent equipment to Indonesia? As the honourable member for Port Adelaide has correctly pointed out, Australia has the raw material. It has leading and innovative environmental management capacities, in disciplines as diverse as agriculture, chemical manufacture, mining, water and ,waste water treatment, and solid waste disposal. Australia is a stable base from which to enter fastgrowing Asian markets with an envir()nment and research base at the forefront in the Asia Pacific region. The fledgling green industry has shown enormous success and, within my electorate, some technology is already being exported overseas. The University of South Australia's energy and engines research group has developed the vehicle and engine performance monitoring and analysis system known as VEPMAS, which monitors exhaust emissions. Interest in it has been displayed by many countries, and it has already been implemented in Malaysia. The university's urban water resources centre developed Australia's first monitored storm water conservation scheme at New Brompt()n Estate, which uses residential roof run-off for open space irrigation. This exciting project will have wide application around the world. A successful joint venture between the University of Adelaide's business arm, Luminis, and a South Australian company, Adelaide Brighton Cement, is set to be marketed around the world. The two have developed a revolutionary fuel burning technology which is more efficient and environmentally friendly than existing gas fired burners in rotary kilns used by many industries around the world. Health technology is also in demand in Asia. There is the work of South Australia's internationally renowned craniofacial unit; and Ashford Hospital, also in the electorate, is a non-profit community hospital which sends its nurse educators to Kuala Lumpur to teach and update nursing skills in that city. These export dollars are passed on to health consumers in our state. But, instead of establishing the lead, Australia's weakness in product development and commercialisation is helping it lose the international technology race-and .not just in the environment. This government is imposing solutions rather than helping private industry generate its own. With business confidence at a low ebb, it is not surprising that this country's weak jobs growth has been attributed to Australian companies failing to make the capital investment needed. It is this capital investment that is needed to export products and services overseas. Roy Green, .from the Employment Studies Centre at the University of Newcastle, in relation to the recession, last month said: Firms are still attempting to repair their balance sheets and unwind unprecedented levels of debt. . . as such the present recovery in corporate profits likely to herald a period not of full employment of 'jobless growth'. He believes, like many others, that the jobs focus will shift from large enterprises to smal1 and medium sized enterprises. The federal government aQllounced in its budget that it will spend $86 million over three years in response to the MCKinsey report on emerging exports. But with a sluggish economy and the large number of federal taxes which provide significant disincentives to smal1 businesses, I have no idea how enterprises of this size in green industries",33
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Hollis)Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. As the honourable member had a minute to go, she will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. HMAS NIRIMBA: COMMUNITY USE",37
20,Mr GORMAN,COMMITTEES,"Greenway) (11.23 a.m.).,I move: That this House: (1) welcomes and supports the recommendation of the Community Advisory Committee, chaired by the member for Greenway, which recommended that an educational precinct, comprising a public and Catholic senior high school, TAPE and the university campus, was the best . community use for HMAS Nirimba following the decision to transfer training to HMAS Cerberus; (2) further endorses the decision by ministers Beazley and Ray to implement the educational precinct subject to' agreement with the New South Wales Government; and (3) calls upon the New South Wales Government urgently to conclude negotiations with the federal government for the purchase of the land before December 1993 at which date the . Navy wi\l march out of HMAS Nirimba. I had the good fortune to chair the HMAS Nirimba consultative committee. Other members of the committee were as follows: Mr John Aquilina, the state member for Riverstone; Councillor Jim Anderson, who is the mayor of Blacktown City Council; Mr David is Huntley, Regional Secretary, New South but Wales, Defence; Captain Jack MACGaffrie, who is the DireCtor-General, Facilities, from the Navy; Lieutenant-Colonel Tony Miles, who is the Deputy Director, Defence Facilities Policy; Mi Steve Renwick, who is the union representative from HMAS Nirimba; Ms Judy Gray, also a union representative from HMAS Nirimba; Ms Gladys James, Director of Environmental Planning from the Blacktown City Council; Mr Rick Clarke, who is a minute secretary from the Department of Defence, New South Wales; and Mr Steve Alchin, who represented the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, commonly known as WESROC. I would like to thank the committee members, one and all, for the help and assistance that they gave to me in obtaining the results we finally obtained. I do not have to state to the House my complete opposition to the closure of HMAS Nirimba. Of course, my dearest wish would be for Nirimba to continue to play the important role in training that it has for the Navy and to continue to be a vital part of my electorate, my community and, indeed, the region. Like most other members, I have been forced to bow to reality and, regrettably, see Nirimba go out of existence. My next best option was to see the Nirimba facilities put to the best community use for my electorate. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) asked me to chair the community advisory conimittee to determine the best use for HMAS Nirimba once it closed. In July 1992 the committee commenced work. The advisory committee recommended that the best use for Nirimba, after it closed as a naval base, was as a comprehensive educational precinct. The overwhelming support and encouragement I have had for the proposal has been tremendous. Clearly, this is what the people want, this is what I want, and this is what must be done-not for me, not for the council and not only for the navy but for the young people of my electorate and indeed all of western Sydney. Sadly, in the 16 months since the recommendation was made, we are still waiting for an agreement to be struck with the New South Wales government regarding the site's future. Some wait was expected. Negotiating the future of a multimillion dollar site does take time. But I am at a loss to explain the dragging of the feet of the New South Wales government on this issue. Converting HMAS Nirimba into an educational precinct, with two senior high schools, a TAPE and a university, will be of great benefit-not just to my electorate but to so many young people in the greater western Sydney region. I know that my colleague the honourable  chamber-I thank him for this-has taken a very keen interest in the future of Nirimba. He, unlike the New South Wales government, it seems, knows full well the flow to his constituents from an educational precinct. My colleague has had a long and very deep interest in this matter. Together we have lobbied hard for the establishment of the educational precinct. I must say that I am gratified that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Defence have both endorsed the implementation of the educational precinct at Nirimba and continue to negotiate with the New South Wales government through its Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Virginia Chadwick, for an acceptable outcome, which will see the dream of an educational precinct become reality. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of the New South Wales government to this precinct has been underwhelming to say the least. We have yet to .have an unambiguous statement from Minister Chadwick, much less the colour of her money-even though the Minister for Defence has offered to negotiate on the cost of the land and, I understand, has even offered a deferred payment system. This is a great opportunity. Millions of dollars of infrastructure and months of building time have already been completed. It is just sitting there waiting to be used. The people of New South Wales could have a valuable new university, a TAPE, two high schools-one Catholic and one state-and other New South Wales governments would necessarily be committed. Both the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Defence are disappointed, as I am, with the state government, as it has not yet fully agreed to become a partner in this most exciting and very important project. I would like to take this opportunity of asking the state government, through the education minister, Mrs Virginia Chadwick, even at this late stage to come forward and join with us in this development, which will see in the very near future a campus of the University of Western Sydney, a TAPE college, two senior high schools and perhaps a couple of other smaller schools-such as the specialist music school of western Sydneyand which will ensure that the Nirimba site remains a major facility within my electorate benefits that will . of Greenway. The New South Wales government has an opportunity to demonstrate to the people of western Sydney that it does care about the aspirations of their children and it does recognise the significant difficulties that western Sydney's .young people have in travelling such vast distances to other universities outside of the western suburbs. There is an urgency here because in December of this year HMAS Nirimba staff will literally march out of the facility and transfer their activities to HMAS Cerberus in Victoria. It is important that the New South Wales government comes to a decision in the very near future, otherwise the cost of security of the station within itself will cost many millions of dollars. On behalf of my parliamentary colleagues in western Sydney and my constituents, I hope that the New South Wales government does actually make a decision within the next few weeks. The sailors from HMAS Nirimba have become a very important part of Blacktown city. Sailors from the base have regularly been partners for the debutantes at various social functions within the electorates of the western suburbs. Unfortunately, with their removal, there will now be a problem with a lot of the functions that the sailors have carried out. One important function that the sailors carried out on a regular basis was to man one of the lifesaving club's facilities on the central coast. I understand that there wi11 be some difficulty in replacing them with other young people, either from the armed forces or from the local communities, to keep the surf lifesaving club open. Of course, if it has to close, it will be a disaster. It would be remiss of me if I did not thank some of the other staff members of Blacktown City Council, such as Linda MCClure, who is one of the town-planners and who sat in on all of the meetings with the consultative group. Also, I want to thank Mr Terry MCCormack, who acted as the council secretary, making sure that we had the very latest information and that we received the minutes the next day, instead of waiting for them to be posted from town. Finally, HMAS Nirimba will be sorely missed by all of us in western Sydney and I am sure I speak for all of my col1eagues when I pass on very best wishes to the personnel of HMAS Nirimba in their change of station. MrNEHL (Cowper) (11.32 a.m.)-I second the motion and, in supporting the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), I say, with the same acknowledgment that he makes, that it is a great pity that the sailors HMAS Nirimba will be moving out. If that is the case and they do have to go, it is certainly appropriate that the proposition that he is putting forward fora joint educational precinct should be supported. However, in passing, I make reference to the Schofields airfield, which I believe is part of the area. I am a Httle disappointed that the honourable member for Greenway did not mention the future of Schofields airfield-unless I missed his reference. I would like to state quite clearly that it should be retained. It is part of the general aviation facilities of Sydney; it is also of some use for commuter airlines. I think it would be a negative step for that particular airfield to be taken away. In passing, I mention that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) completed his early flying training at Schofields airfield, but that is not the reason I suggest it should be retained. I endorse what the honourable member for Greenway has said about the joint educational precinct. Of course, honourable members do have a model to follow. I am pleased to inform the House that the New South Wales Legislative Assembly passed and carried the Southern Cross University Bi11 1993. This wi11 establish a new university, based on the existing campuses of the University of New England at Lismore and Coffs Harbour. I know the honourable member for Greenway wi11 have a great deal of interest in developments taking place in Coffs Harbour because that particular campus of the Southern Cross University wi11 bea joint educational precinct. It wi11 be the first in New South Wales and, I believe, the first in Australia. It is an exciting project. It is one with a great deal of vision and I believe it wi11 lead the way for further developments in other parts of Australia. As I said, I know the honourable member for Greenway will be watching what happens in Coffs Harbour with a great deal of interest because it will lead the way for what he is trying to achieve. There is to be a campusconstruction is already under way-in Hogbin Drive between the main. centre of Coffs Harbour and the southern suburbs of Sawtel1, of Toormina and Bonville. It wi11 incorporate a senior high school, a university and a TAPE college. When it starts at the beginning of 1995, there will be 1,500 TAPE students and 250 high school students. The university in fact is already using the campus in Coffs Harbour and has 330 students this year. This number will increase to 440 next year, it will double by 1996, and there will be 800 full time student places by 1998. The senior high school will take 250 year 11 students initially and will expand to 450 students in 1996 when it takes on year 12 students. It is expected that thereafter it will build up to 650 students. It will be a selective high school that will serve not just people in the immediate area but also students from further afield. The high school curriculum will have a vocational emphasis to link it in as much as possible with the TAFE and, to a lesser degree, with the university. It will also have an academic focus in the early planning stages. An interesting feature is that it is planned to have a year 13 for high school students when they will be able to complete distinction courses-I think that is an innovation. I will be very interested to see how that develops. All of the students at the joint education facility will be able to tap into the TAFE and university courses. The TAFE courses will focus on business studies, including finance, management, small business, tourism, hospitality, computing and welfare-in fact, all of the major growth areas in the economy of the north coast. The Coffs Harbour TAFE at the present time is doing a wonderful job in training so many people in those courses, and it will go from strength to strength once it moves to the new campus. The TAPE courses will be compatible with what the university offers. As well, there will be other workshops for things such as welding and metal fabrication. It is also interesting that the high school students, if they wish, can undertake TAFE courses as part of the HSC. It is going to broaden the whole concept of education. As I said earlier, it will be a selective high school which will draw from a wide area, so that once it becomes established it will attract a great deal of attention from high school students all over northern New South Wales. The project under construction at the present time will have a 500-seat lecture and perform-nce theatre, a school of business, computing centre, tourism and hospitality courses, a three-storey library, design centre, sciences complex and workshops. It makes a great deal of sense to have these joint facilities which can be used by the three arms of education. I pay tribute to the common sense of the Coffs Harbour City Council and the Coffs Harbour Ex-Servicemens Club, because the Hogbin Drive site acquired for the university college's development encompasses 141 hectares of rural land. Part of this site was a gift from the Coffs Harbour City Council to the University of New England network, and this was achieved with an enormous amount of. cooperation from the Coffs Harbour ExServicemens Club. In fact, when one looks at the story of what. happened to provide that land for the university, it is a remarkable instance of cooperation and work from the community which actually provided something which is going to benefit the community for decades to come. . In addition to the land for the university, the Department of School Education and the New South Wales TAFE Commission purchased the remainder of the site. As I said, the site is located between Coffs Harbour 'and the southern suburbs, and Hogbin Drive'is a secondary distributor road. joining Coffs Harbour, Sawtell and the major growth area of Bonville. It is close to Coffs Harbour airport, extensive playing fields, a large Catholic high school and a new industrial estate. The whole project is one that the honourable member for Greenway and his proposal for Nirimba will be able to benefit from because it is the first of its kind and",37
21,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"Of course I am inviting the honourable member for Chifley. I would be delighted to show him the earthworks and the construction that is going on. As I said, the planned facilities for stage 1 include accommodation for administration, student amenities, the canteen and student union, the library, an open learning facility, lecture theatres, general-purpose classrooms, science laboratories, tourism and hospitality courses, computing facilities, staff offices and, naturally, support areas. The whole site has been properly landscaped. There will be lakes and it will be a very pleasant place, indeed, to study. It will be an asset not only to Coffs Harbour but to the whole of the north coast of New South Wales. Further developments envisaged for the university college will focus on areas including educational and industrial research, curricula tailored to meet specific economic and community needs, the expansion of open learning modes of education and on-site residential accommodation. This university college will have a tremendous impact on the regional community. I am sure the same will apply to the project that is being sponsored by the honourable member for Greenway. The economic and social effects of the Southern Cross University, Coffs Harbour campus, will include the injection of $28.5 million for stage 1 campus construction; significant employment opportunities; the creation of additional teaching, research and support positions and the subsequent multiplier effect; the infrastructure support to maintain services to the new facility; and continuing expansion of the above'areas to cater for an additional student population of 3,500 to 4,000 by the year 2005. It does provide a significant research faciliat ty for the region, and the opportunities for joint use are very significant. I say to the House and to the honourable member for Greenway that the joint educational precinct at Coffs Harbour-incorporating the university campus of the new Southern Cross University, the TAFE and the selective senior high school-provides an example for the whole of Australia to follow and, as well, I look forward to seeing developments at Nirimba in future years.",40

23,Mr TAYLOR,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"Groom) (11.43 a.m.)I move: That this House: (I) acknowledges the substantial national and international contribution by service men and women of the Australian Defence Force (ADF); (2) regrets recent decisions by the Government which places ADF morale at risk; and (3) calls on the Government to recognise its contractual conditions of service responsibilities to ADF personnel, particularly those in recognition of the exigencies of service life. I pay tribute to those in the Australian Defence Force and to Australian defence personnel generally. I pay tribute to their dedication. I pay tribute to their industry. I pay tribute to their deep professionalism in terms of what they have achieved both domestically and internationally. In recent times we have seen them giving aid to the civil community in the floods in Victoria, the bushfires in Queensland and, in the wider context, in peacekeeping activities in the Western Sahara, Somalia and most recently in Cambodia. I congratulate the Australian Defence Force for a great job, very well done, of which this House and, indeed, the nation should be justifiably proud. That sort of thing does not j-st happen. There are four key areas in the success of the Australian Defence Force: leadership-whether that leadership be at the political level or the military level; high standards of training; good, modern equipment; and a large measure of high morale. Some of my colleagues, and I hope honourable members on the government benches, will be talking today about training and equipment. I want to concentrate on the other two issues of leadership and morale. I preface· my remarks with the general comment that, whilst there are not a lot of votes in the defence arena, one might sayand there is indeed a very large measure of public apathy-that is not to say that we should not, in both houses, continue to exercise the very large degree of bipartisanship that exists in terms of our national security strategy. I would like to pay tribute at the political level to the present Minister for Senator Robert Ray. Since he has been the minister he has shown a very large measure of communication and comprehension skill in his portfolio, and I congratulate him on that. I also congratulate his predecessor, the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, who has a large and very profound intellect in this sort of portfolio. On our side of the House, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in his previous capacity as the shadow minister for defence made a very large contribution to the defence debate in the last parliament. Indeed, my colleagues in the other house, Senator Robert Hill and Senator David MACGIBBON, in their shadow portfolio responsibilities, likewise making a very strong contribution in the defence area. At the military level I pay tribute to recently retired Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, who showed an unsurharassment passed ability to lead the Defence through a very difficult period. I also pay tribute to his successor, Admiral Alan Beaumont, and his chiefs of staff in the navy,army and air force: Vice Admiral Ian MACDougall, who is a personal friend of mine; Lieutenant General John Grey; and Air Marshall Barry Gration, the younger brother of General Peter Gration. The new joint force commander service wife: Lieutenant General Sanderson, has show- I himself to be a superior military officer and a diplomat of the highest order in his recent dealings in Cambodia. I congratulate him on the that. I want to tum now to the major thrust of today's motion, in relation to morale and the importance of morale in the Australian Defence Force. Things are being done at the moment in a climate of having to do a lot more with a lot less. One only has to look at the 1993-94 budget to see the traumatic effect that cuts are having in real terms on the defence budget. Bearing in mind that the defence white paper in 1987 was predicated on a three per cent real increase from 1987 to 1992 and chang-d in 1991 to zero growth, what do we find In the most recent budget but decreases of a substantial amount over the Defence, next three or four years? As a result, operational capability is in a precarious situation, a fact that has been acknowledged privately and publicly by both the ministers responsible in that portfolio at . the moment. There are a lot of challenges for Senator Ray that I will not go into because of pressures of time, other than to say that some of those challenges are very strong indeed in terms of training standards and morale. I d- no! thin- I would be exaggerating this mornIng In sayIng that morale in the Australian Def-nce Force is on a knife edgewhether In terms of the budget limitations I have talked about or in terms of government deciSions and legislation affecting defence are people in recent weeks. Then there are the questions about training standards reflected in some very strong media comment hi recent weeks about the crash of the 707 off the the Victorian coast about 18 months ago and most recently, the questions about sexuai accusations that have been aired Force in the media as well. Finally, the major thrust of this morning's motion is the deep concern amongst families about what this government is doing or not doing about their conditions of service. To best exemplify that problem, I would like to read part of a letter from a Victorian defence don't know about you, but as a service wife for 21 years I have packed up my family and followed my husband arou-d - ustralia and overseas, making most of the Situation, assuring the children that they will make new friends, making do with often su.b-standard - ousing, buying yet more new curtams, and playmg mother and father to my children because ""Daddy has to go away fora while"". If you. were not a service family, you would have established yourself in a stable environment, purchased a home, and probably be paying far less m mortgage payments than you are to DHA. Once again we are being asked to pay for supporting our spouses as they serve our country. Since Cabinet has decided that Service members ar- not a special case when taking Allowances or Fringe Benefits into account for Socia:! Security assessments, but in fact are equal to any other wage earner, you wou!d naturally a-u.me that they are also equal when it comes to declslOns on overtime, penalty rates etc. It seems some wage earners are more equal than others! She goes on to say: As our spouses have been told TO SHUT UP COP IT SWEET, I believe it is our responsibility to speak up now and to fight not only against the changes to Social Security assessments but also recognition of the special status of Service spouses and families. When the Government decides that my husband's allowances entitle them to hit 'my bank account doesn't impress me at all. I think that that is typical of the unease is being felt in the Defence Force at moment, and that is not being helped by other decisions in terms of Cambodian allowances, et cetera. In conclusion, I ask the government and those opposite to speak to this motion in spirit in which it is meant. We need to recogof nise that a: problem left smouldering can develop quickly into a bush fire and, for sake of the Australian Defence Force, its people, its families and indeed the nation, that must not be allowed to' happen.",41
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Neville-I. second the motion and I reserve my right to speak.  I first read the motion on .Defence Force conditions of service put forward by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor} I had some trepidation contribution. about it, but! should not have misjudged him for I support the bulk of his contribution. is my privilege to chair the Defence Subcomthe mittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign seriously Affairs, Defence and Trade, and I am imview pressed with the interest, contributions bipartisan approach that all members of committee bring to its deliberations. I feel little embarrassed because, unlike so many members of that committee, I do not have' long standing interest in defence. It was only when I was appointed a parliamentary tary that I started taking a very keen interest and, of course, I have been aU the better that. . I want to support the honourable member for Groom in his remarks abo!Jt looking at four issues that lead to the professionalism in our ADF and our defence structure. Many of us take a great deal of pride in its level of AND achievement and, dare I say, international recognition. He touched on leadership, and I certainly agree with that. I think the relationfor ships between the ministers and the top level of the ADF and the department all contribute to it. I think it has been really under the leadership of Tony Ayers and Peter Gration it and since that we have had such a cooperative environment, a real team effort, between the that defence civilians within the department and the the ADF; and that is as it should be. Equipment is one of my favourite subjects. All too often the great' revolution that has taken place in acquisition and logistics over 10 years is little understood by the public. I the think we got some feel for it when so many us were able to be at the launch of the Collins class submarine. The idea that Austhe tralia could be involved in such a superior manufacture of a submarine comes as startling to some but I think is a source of great pride. It reflects the $2.3 billion a year this government devotes to capital equipment. In doing so, the contribution of Australian industry has gone from the low point of about 25 per cent to over 70 per cent. The Collins was more than 70 per cent. But I had better make sure that I cover some of the morale issues that the honourable member raised, having agreed with him about so much of his On the budget, the ADF has pointed out It that we are probably getting pretty close to bone now and that any further cuts would affect capability. I believe it is the of the top echelon within the department and and the ADF that capability has not been that· affected and that at the moment we have a superior capability. I share the concerns and I do think that the government runs grave a risks if it goes beyond the cuts that have already been made. I think that is also supsecreported by the minister. It is true that there is to be a Senate inquiry for into sexual harassment aboard the HMAS Derwent and there has been a more recent incident, not involving female harassment but the male harassment. We ought to understand that the changes in approach by our society and the changing values in our society are posing difficulties for many out in civvy street, and I do not condone that. There is always going to be a particular problem in the armed forces and they are going to need time to adapt. That is in no way excusing any of those incidents; I just think we ought to have a clear understanding that the disciplined and sheltered lifestyle that those in the ADF are required to lead poses some problems in terms of adap-­ ing. Clearly, there is a commitment by the government and the leadership to ensure that that adaptation does take place. Action has already ensued and, following appropriate inquiries, more may follow. It is a problem for the ADF, but I am confident that, over time, as with other issues, it will be able to deal with it. I particularly feel for those service men women who, as a function of their ordinary service, are required to uplift themselves and re-establish themselves in new locations all too frequently. I think the leadership of the ADF has a responsibility to minimise that to the maximum extent ·possible. I also note that there are new challenges for the ADF because we are increasingly having married men and women serving in the services. That poses problems, too. I do not agree on the issue of substandard housing. It is true that there is some substandwas ard housing. In the 10 years of this government we have spent something like $750 million, and so we should have, in improving a disgraceful situation. The housing standards are much better and the defence committee, in going around the countryside, certainly can see some of the bad old houses but is delighted to see some of the new standard houses. That is as it should be. The issue of allowances or pay for the service men and women of Australia is a difficult one. We need to understand that it is not really the government that sets those standards of pay and allowances; we have an independent defence forces tribunal, whose responsibility it is to set them. I seem to recall that Peter Gration, whom I too have a great deal of admiration for, deferred consideration of the services allowance as not being appropriate at the time. It was not a government decision, it was not a cabinet decision, it was not a decision of the Minister for Defence and it was not a decision of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. That tribunal does have a difficult task in making sure that our service men and women are appropriately and adequately rewarded for their service to this country, which they perform so magnificently. Members oil both sides of the chamber would be concerned if they were not able to get their just entitlements. It is sometimes very difficult to compare the myriad of allowances that go to make up service men's and women's pay with what exists on the outside in civvy street, Be that as it may, I understand that the tribunal is looking at the service allowance and that a and further hearing is scheduled, I think for 3 December; and I hope that the decision will be a fair and a just one. The other aspect I wanted to perhaps finish on is the overseas allowances in Cambodia. When the service men and women who have performed so magnificently in Cambodiawith the gratitude, I believe, of the whole world, not just of this nation-departed, they were advised that their allowance would be subject to review and, in particular, after the election was likely to be decreased. In fact, it decreased because the danger was perceived to have been lowered. I think that is as it should be. In Somalia, now that we have departed, it was decreased; but, given the increased violence; it has recently been restored-and so it should be. So we cannot say that people who are posted overseas are always going to be on the set rate of allowance for that service. It is going to fluctuate with the perceived dangers. It may go upand down several times. That they are entitled to it, I do not argue; and I do not think we should argue that, where the danger has decreased, it is appropriate to reduce it. In conclusion, I thank the honourable member for bringing forward this motion. I appreciate the spirit in which he has moved it and the opportunity it is providing for many members to appropriately reflect on the contribution of the ADF.",43
25,Mr NEVILLE,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"In supporting the motion, I share a disbelief with members of the coalition that the gutting of our defence forces could continue in the way that it has been occurring over the last decade. In the 1988 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on personnel wastage in the Australian defence forces, defence personnel were described as 'being required to work beyond reasonable limits and having low self-esteem'. It was felt 'that political and some military leadership is insensitive, uninterested and ineffectual'. A damning indictment indeed. Sadly, five years on, I ask: what has changed? The Consultative Group of Service Spouses at that same time told the inquiry: There is a growing sense of despair, but no-one in government, the Public Service or the general community cares sufficiently to take the radical action that is now necessary to remedy a situation that for years has been allowed to deteriorate to such appalling levels. Again, Mr Deputy Speaker, what has changed? Personally, I am saddened to hear the gratuitous adulation heaped on our defence personnel serving in UN peacekeeping units by visiting ministers, politicians and media and then see how poorly the rhetoric is matched by genuine concern for the long-term well-being of these same personnel and their families. It is a sorry state of affairs when 30 per cent of those charged with the defence of this country live below the average weekly wage - once justified on the grounds that there were additional service entitlements. But even those, paltry as they are, are to be effectively removed by the fringe benefits provision impacting on some 7,000 personnel. That will mean in many instances less ability to access family support benefits, and ultimately a lower standard of living for the wives and children will ensue. As if that were not enough, these proud custodians of our national image will lose their capacity to be covered under the veterans act. In a fortnight's time we will commemorate Armistice Day. There will be much national pride and many tears, as well there should be. But no doubt we will be subjected to the rhetoric and to the stories of the follies of uncaring generals and of the uncomplaining foot soldiers living in unbelievably inhumane conditions. We will adulate our heroes-and, again, we should. But the acid test of what we think of these proud young men and women in our defence forces-the successors, if you like, of the ANZACs-will be found in the way we treat them here, now, today. In the short time available to me, I would like to point out to the House that this malaise in morale permeates through to the most fundamental levels, even down to the vastly diminished cadet corps. It, too, has been gutted and is sadly a pale reflection of its former self. I will illustrate the point by information supplied to me this very week by Mrs Debbie Borrowman, a mother who accompanied 55 cadets from Bundaberg's I8-ReU Hinkler unit to the annual cadet camp at Greenbank near Brisbane. This information has been confirmed by others, including an officer who, for obvious reasons, I will not name. Mr Sciacca interjecting Mr NEVILLE....,... I hope the parliamentary secretary listens. I might add that Mrs Borrowman is not some overprotective mum but a former researcher in juvenile crime prevention. For her, the cadet movement has the deeper significance of character building-a view I share. On one of this House's standing committees, on which I serve, we are constantly told of methods of inculcating discipline in the young, to give them feelings of self-worth and self-esteem, to create a balance with the soapies and the all-pervasive overt violence which is the legacy of so much television. Here we have a movement which gives young people discipline, challenge, training and self-worth. But how does the rhetoric translate into action? The Greenbank camp which handled some nine units and some 600 cadets during the first week of the September school holidays was understaffed to an appalling level. As Mrs Borrowman described it, the cadets went to Greenbank with excitement and much expectation. She pointed out how much these teenagers idolised the men and women of the defence forces. The food at the camp, prepared by contract caterers, was insufficient and of poor quality. In fact, on occasions it ran out. One officer described as 'entree servings'. The boys and girls had to share shower blocks in rotation. The cadets taken to Wacol for the confidence course had to wait two hours for their transport. There was no training in weapOnry.

26,Mr BEVIS,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"In the limited five minutes available in this debate, I do not have the opportunity to respond as I would want to the comments that have just been made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). Given that I .have not got the time to go through them as I would like to, I will do my best to ignore them. I think he has missed both the motion and the plot. When it comes to defence, I think a lot was mentioned by the honourable member for  ber for Groom (Mr Taylor) with which all honourable members of this House would agree. There is not just some hollow rhetoric in the comments that members of this parliament have made in relation to the operations and the work of our defence personnel both here and abroad. There is avery deep felt and genuine appreciation and respect for the work which they have undertaken on· behalf of our nation. I say that, both as· a member of the parliament's defence subcommittee and proudly as the member for Brisbane representing the Enoggera army barracks and the 1st division headquarters. Soldiers from that area have participated in Cambodia, Somalia and peacekeeping ventures in the Sahara and elsewhere. They have done much good work for this country and for the cause for peace, freedom and justice in the world. I am proud to be their member in this place. There are a number of areas in defence in which members on all sides involved with defence activities would like to see some changes. Not surprisingly, they tended to be the focus of some of the comments of the honourable member for Groom. In addressing those, I think it is important to also understand many of the things which have happened through the force structure review and some of the other changes which are, in fact, welcome initiatives. They are welcomed by the defence forces and, I believe, welcomed it by the great bulk of Australians. I just want to mention a few of those things, some of which the honourable member for Chifley also touched on. . There are major acquisition programs which this government has embarked upon and has committed itself to over the next decade. Foremost amongst those is the construction of the Collins class submarines and the ANZAC frigates, which not only will provide the Australian Defence Force with much needed capability but also have proven to be instrumental in assisting Australian industry to develop skills and expertise which it did not previously have, and which it is now in a position to export. Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade were privileged to attend a handing over ceremony at Amberley air base of the recently acquired FIlls. That is a wise acquisition. which all honourable members would acknowledge as being desirable, and which members of the Defence Force themselves see as being important. The decision of the government to reintroduce Chinooks, albeit a limited number, into service is also an important decision. The massive injection of funds to equip our land forces with increased numbers of improved wheeled vehicles and night vision equipment is an important measure which this government has set in place and which, in spite of the difficult economic times, it has committed itself to. Those sorts of things improve both capability and morale in the services. However, there are a lot of personal things that families in the defence forces do have to endure. They were mentioned by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and others. Like many honourable members, I am well aware of them. However, again, I think it is important to look at what this government has done during its term to rectify those. Accommodation is now better than it has been for decades. There are still examples of poor accommodation and we know that, but if honourable members look at the performance of the last five years in particular they will see that the government's commitment to improve accommodation for our defence personnel has been outstanding and should be recognised as such. Similarly, in education we have done more than any government since 1901 to try to provide some comparability between state education systems so that the people in our defence forces who transfer from state to state do not find their children being disadvantaged. Superannuation was brought into the 1990s by this government only a couple of years ago with a new superannuation scheme. The fact that we have provided those overseas operations as part of peacekeeping forces has, in large measure, been welcomed by the defence forces and. has also improved their morale. The final point I would like to make is in relation to the problems we face. We have a declining government share of GOP. We are spending less as a government, yet the opposition wants us to spend more on defence. So do we, but we have to face economic reality. At the last election the opposition went people intent on reducing net expenditure by $300 miIlion. (TIme expired)",46
27,Mr REID,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"The motion put by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in recognition of the work of the Australian Defence Force has my support. Members of the Australian defence forces make a substantial national and internavey tional contribution. I want to place on record my support for those services in Australia. Let us never forget that people in the defence forces are our most valuable resource. If that contribution is to continue, it is imperative that the Australian defence forces maintain morale and maintain control over such important support infrastructure as strategic planning and mapping. At present, this important work is carried out by the Army Survey Regiment based at Fortuna Villa in the electorate of Bendigo. The regiment's high quality work is respected internationally, and the quality of its map making and printing is recognised worldwide. Our forces may have to depend on accurate mapping to stay alive, yet the Labor government has opened up this important area to an enforced. competitive tendering process called the commercial support program. There are now a number of private companies competing with the Army Survey Regiment for the right to make maps for the armed forces. The use of private companies raises a number of questions about the security aspects of this important defence work. Security is virtually automatic when tflis material is being produced by the defence forces themselves, but this may not be the case if a private company becomes involved. I want to commend the members of the Army Survey Regiment-Lieutenant-Colonel Bob MCHenry, his officers and staff-for the huge effort that they have put in in preparing their submission. I know, from personal contact with them, that they have put in hours of effort on weekends and at night to complete this submission and meet the challenge that is presented by it. What happens to the members of the defence forces when they need maps urgently, but workers employed by a private contractor to the to make those maps go on strike? As we know, industrial action in this country, regrettably, is a fact of life. The Army Survey Regiment is also an important contributor to the economy of Bendigo, which has been hard hit by the recession. The regiment has been a contributor to the local region for the past 50 years. The armed services and the Army SurRegiment have a quite unique relationship with the citizens and the city of BendigoThe regiment has carried out a number of community efforts throughout its history in the region, and there is a very healthy relationship indeed between the armed forces, the Survey Regiment and the people who reside. in the area of the city of Bendigo. They are accepted into the community and they make a very valuable contribution to a whole range of activities. In particular, with their technical expertise in the printing and mapping field, they have made a significant contribution of many hours of time to the community over those years. The community view, which I endorse, is that Bendigo cannot stand to . lose this valuable industry which brings in around $10 million a year to the city of Bendigo, and which also brings in a whole area of expertise which could be lost to that city. It is an area in which the local TAPE col1ege and the University Col1ege of Northern Victoria, under La Trobe University, wish to encourage future training programs to be conducted to develop that expertise to a higher level. Furthermore, Australia cannot afford to lose any control over important aspects of defence infrastructure. This is absolutely vital in this process because it is important to the defence forces to ensure that the security of their strategic planning and mapping is in fact control1ed by the defence forces. I simply want to reiterate the support that I have for the Army Survey Regiment in Bendigo and I commend them on their valuable hard work in providing this submission to the process.",47
28,Ms DEAHM,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"It gives me great pleasure to speak to this motion this morning, and I commend the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) for bringing it to the notice of the House. I also strongly support the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) who, sadly, have had to leave for other engagements. Honourable members who have read Hansard will note that on 18 October I made an extensive speech principal1y about RAAF base Richmond, which is in my electorate. I paid great tribute then to the men and women of the RAAF, just as the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has paid similar tribute to the army people in his electorate. I reiterate my support for that They do a fantastic job, both in the defence of our country and in overseas aid missions such as the earthquake in New Guinea. The planes going to New Guinoea for that rescue mission have come from RAAF base Richmond. They also play an enormous part in the local community, in disasters such as floods and bushfires, to which this area is very prone. So my support is firmly behind the defence forces. I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Groom and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) about the government's recent amendments to social security legislation which affects the defence forces. I support some of those sentiments. Even though the government's move is to bring them into line with other social security recipients, there is a special case for the defence forces, in some cases, and I am certainly working closely with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) on that issue. However, it ought to be noted that in the Fightback package the opposition proposed a very similar measure. In fact, it was much more stark than the. government's current measures. The opposition intended to include what it referred to as a total remuneration package which included superannuation and al1 fringe benefits and not just the measures that the government has included. For those interested, this information is contained in clause 11.7 - on redefinition of income for family assistance-on page 182 of Fightback. More importantly, the Fightback measure included no $1,000 free area. Our legislation allows that the first $1,000 of affected fringe benefits will not be taken into account. The opposition's policy had no such provision, once again a clear indication that the lowerto middle-income earners, including defence personnel, would have be-n worse off under the opposition's plans. The estimated savings from the introduction of our legislation is $81 million. Under Fightback; the estimated savings would have been $250 million, a considerable amount more. I will take the time left to me to underline unit. some of the positive moves that the government has made towards the support of service personnel. In 1988 this government established the Defence Housing Authority. This initiative was in response to the dissatisfaction with the quality, size and lack of amenity of the housing provided; housing was then a significant cause of concern to defence personnel. No-one can deny that the DHA has significantly improved housing standards. I did a lot of door-knocking around defence areas during the campaign and, sure, there were a few substandard houses, but they are the ones that are now being replaced with much better quality housing. Under this government the ADF has promulgated an ADF family support policy, including the family support funding program, now in its fifth year of operation. The total cost of the program to date has been $3.5 million. This program provides seeding grants to groups of defence families to enable them to work together on projects or programs which are beneficial to service families in the area. Since 1989 grants have been made to over 680 family groups for playgrounds and recreational facilities, preschools and kindergartens, playgroups, neighbourhood houses and community centres. Other examples of this government recognising the importance of the contribution made by the families of defence personnel include the national consultative group of service families, defence families information and liaison staff, the family information network for defence, and the funding and establishment of employer sponsored child care in defence facilities. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am also not happy with the contracting out program that is happening and we need to work to make sure that security is not jeopardised and that. our personnel have the best facilities available to them.",48
29,Mr HALVERSON,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"Casey) (12.22 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, I quote: The unfailing fonnula for production of morale is patriotism, self-respect, discipline, and self-confidence within a military unit, joined with fair treatment and merited appreciation from without . . . It will quickly wither and die if soldiers come to believe themselves the victims of indifference or injustice on the part of their government ... These words were written by General Douglas MACArthur in 1933; 60 years later they are still accurate. Morale, esprit de corps, confidence, sense of purpose-call it what you will, without it battles may be lost before they even begin. The sad fact is that it is easier to lower morale than to raise it. Under this Labor government, particularly in recent times, the priority accorded to defence matters and numerous other important defence related issues has been in free-fall mode. Morale has suffered accordingly. The deferice budget will be cut by some. $237 million over the next four years. Most of these cost savings will be achieved by further pruning of expenditure in the vital areas of training and operations, for example, further reductions in already reduced field exercises, flying time and steaming time. , There is no doubt that, when a government starts to chip away at the operational readiness of its defence, forces, it starts to raise doubts in the minds of service personnel, not only about the relevance and value of their role but, more importantly from the point of view of morale, their capacity to adequately perfonn their duties and responsibilities. Some of the recent policy changes and cost-cutting measures have created significant new problems with regard to morale, for example, the constant rumours about redundancies, the conditions of service, and the stilliong-awaited determination on the pay structure and service allowances for the ADF, including allowances for the ADF members who served in the United Nations teams in Cambodia, Somalia and the Gulf. With regard to this last matter, I visited our troops in Cambodia and Somalia and observed first-hand the challenging conditions .under which they operated and the dangers they faced. There is no doubt that they perfonnedmagnificently. Yet, in the case of the rearguard ADF force still in Cambodia, when it came to paying them the allowances they believed they had been promised, this government has changed the rules and withdrawn the $65 tax-free allowance, replacing it with a $40 taxable paYlT!.ent instead . The savings involved are about $20,000, but at what cost? I know I am not the only member of this House who has been contacted by concerned service spouses who are genuinely distressed and increasingly disillusioned by what they quite understandably regard as the unfair and unreasonable actions of an uncaring and unappreciative government. It must be remembered that the perceptions and attitudes of service families, particularly spouses, are a significant factor and have an enonnous impact on the morale of the services generally. If the families and spouseS are uncertain and dissatisfied, so are the troops, and vice versa. For example, when air crews are required to fly in old and unreliable aircraft, they are quite reasonably and justifihas ably not happy about the situation. Their concerns are obviously transferred to and shared by their families. There is something very wrong when 60 per cent of marriages of ADF personnel serving in Cambodia have ended in divorce; when a coroner finds that inadequate training is a contributing factor in an aircraft crash in which five young RAAF personnel died; and. when a Minister for Defence admits that at least 3,400 Defence Force families, mostly in the lower ranks, are, or at least were until government once again changed the rules, entitled to receive the additional family payment, a welfare benefit paid to parents in lowpaid work to help support their children. These low-paid workers are the men and women on whom this nation depends for its security, the ones who are prepared to put up with the uncertainties and difficulties of a military career and the consequent demands on their families and social and personal relationships. These are the people who have said, 'Yes, I am prepared to lay down my life for my country'. They are the ones who, unfortunately but understandably, have, in the words of Douglas MACArthur, come to believe themselves the victims of indifference or injustice on the part of their government. It is a vital, difficult and dangerous job we are asking them to do. The least we can do in return is to provide them with adequate and appropriate .training, equipment, financial compensation and recognition for their efforts and sacrifices on our behalf.",49
30,Mr LES SCOTT,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"In the few minutes available to me I would like to support the first part of the motion of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), particularly where he acknowledges the substantial national and international contribution by service men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I think that should stand on its own without the other two rather divisive parts that have been put before the parliament today. I would like to acknowledge, as I have acknowledged on many occasions, the role the Defence Force plays in my electorate at the Amberley air force base and the contribution it makes. The honourable member for Groom visited that base. Recently when the new FIlls were welcomed and the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, visited Amberley we had the opportunity to participate in thathandover ceremony, which was well attended. That acknowledged again the great contribution by the Defence Force people at the Amberley air force base. As honourable members have said here today, our defence people are people we can be extremely proud of, and I believe very strongly that they should get every assistance from the government that can be readily made available to them. I believe Defence Force people have a particular problem. Having myself worked in an industry where I was subject to a mobility factor with my employment, I know that it creates problems where families are required to move from place to place, more so in the situation· defence personnel face. They move interstate more regularly, whereas a lot of people who are in mobile employment move only within the state. When people move interstate they have a lot of education problems for the children. Over the last decade, during the time of this government, much has been done to improve the lot of defence personnel, particularly in housing. The Defence Housing Authority, which I spoke on recently, is making a tremendous contribution to improve the standard of housing of our defence people, and rightly so. Again in my own electorate, the improvement in the housing standards. is second to none. I had the opportunity recently to visit some of the new dwellings that are being constructed for those people. I am pleased particularly to support the sentiments expressed here but not so much the criticism offered by those opposite.",50
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE,"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. House of Representatives Women in Parliament",50
32,Mr CARLTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mackellar) (12.30 p.m.)This is the last chance I will have to speak in a grievance debate, so I wish to make a few remarks about the parliament itself. I was pleased to see this morning the tabling of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure called About time. I will not refer specifically to that, so to remain within standing orders. I would like to make some more general remarks about the operation of the parliament in two particular respects: firstly, the operations and work of the House of Representatives and, secondly, the role of women in the parliament. With regard to the House of Representatives, it has been. a matter of very great concern to me over the 16 years that I have been here that this chamber has become less and less relevant in the parliamentary system. If you look at the way we treat legislation, it is quite possible in this House to have 1,000 pages of legislative material plus explanatory memoranda-as in the case of the wholesale sales tax legislation of 18 months or so agohaving to move through this. House in the course of about a week and to be given only a couple of hours of debate. That is an extreme case but, clearly, a nonsense. When I was shadow Treasurer, 275 pages our of - tax legislation were introduced into the House on a Thursday night and debated on the following Tuesday night, and the explanatory memoranda were put down by the minister assisting the Treasurer in the cluding debate. It has become a practice of the senior minister not even to bother turning up for the summing-up of the debate but, more importantly, none of the legislation examined by this House at all. This House absolutely useless in terms of examining legislation. We pass legislation across to the Senate without even the primary treatment that decent sewage would receive. No wonder the Senate then becomes blocked in its attempts, history. democratically-and it is the only democratic chamber-to try to give it primary and secongartens dary treatment. It should be the role of the Senate to review legislation which has been looked at properly by this House. The only way this will happen is if we adopt the procedures of the New Zealand parliament or of the House of Commons, where standing committees examine all legislation properly and, when necessary, hold public hearings. This would mean that when legislation goes across to the Senate all the tricky bits will have been aired in public, all as the attitudes of people in the community will have already come forward and the senators will be able to give the legislation the kind of proper consideration that it deserves. Matters of question time and all these other matters I will not remark on because they are the subject of this report. I hope that people will take a progressive view of the report and indeed go beyond it. The heart of the matter is really facing up to the fact that the House of Representatives plays virtually no role in examining legislation for which it has at least half of the responsibility. The second matter I raise is the question of women in parliament. I begin by quoting remarks from Maybanke Anderson, taken from Jan Roberts's recently published biography, Maybanke Anderson, which is a book I would recommend to honourable members. Maybanke said: It can no more be right or expedient for one half of population to make laws for the other half than it would be right for the people north of the 34th parallel to legislate for those south of it. Maybanke was writing in the Women s SUf frage Journal of 15 June 1891. She was conreferring to women having the vote. I also recommend Ann Millar's excellent book, Trust the Women, which was published just recently-Ann Millar is an officer of the is Senate-and also Jan Roberts's Maybanke is Anderson. If honourable members read what happened at the time, they will get some idea of the. extraordinary opposition to giving women the vote. At the same time, of course, women had no property rights in divorce. This is a very short time ago in Australia's Maybanke Anderson also fought for kinderand playgrounds for working-class children, because they were out on the streets and dirty and not looked after. She fought for a number of these things, and there was enormous pressure at those times and wonderful people fought for these reforms. It is interesting to note that some of what are now regarded as the very old conservative families of Sydney, the Windeyers and the Stephens, were the main helpers of Maybanke Anderson in reforming divorce laws. The remarks she made about suffrage really also relate to legislation, because in this House, which is 91 per cent composed of men, we legislate for everybody-for men and women-and it is taken for granted, or has been until recently, that we will do that sensibly in a totally male dominated chamber. The Senate is about 80 per cent men. People have said that the number of women is moving up, but I point out, in line with what the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) reminded us of recently, that the women representatives in the Senate from the two major parties have been reduced in number over the last decade. The two major parties have actually gone backwards in the Senate in representation by women. Why do I think this is important? Because it is a legislative chamber and a representative chamber. If the attitudes of the 19th century are translated into a constitutional arrangement, then it is normal for the place to be dominated by men. But if we were constructing a completely new constitution for the 21st century it would not be normal at all. The attitudes as to the role of women that we now have I regard as very much more enlightened. All these absurd notions that they were not allowed to vote or to have property rights in divorce or whatever, and a whole lot of other restrictions, have been swept aside. And it is very odd, I find after 16 years in this chamber, to look round when we vote and see very few women here at all. That is something that has to be changed. Since I have examined alI the various means that have been put forward to try to change this-and as a former state secretary of my own party I am welI aware of the processes of the parties-Ida not believe that extension of existing means will bring about the necessary change. In fact, at the current rate of progress, there will be about equal numbers of men and women here by the year 2050. And I do not think we want to wait around for then. As honourable members know, I have put forward a proposal which would bring about the change very rapidly. Mr Sciacca-It is good to see you doing your bit.",51
33,Mr CARLTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the honourable member for Bowman, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, for that remark. It would be quite simple to proceed rapidly to a satisfactory solution, probably only by changing the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I will not canvass the proposal I have put forward because it has been put out in the public forum and it is out there for debate, but I do urge honourable members to worry a lot more about this issue. It is not only a question of legislating in a way in which we have true knowledge of the issues as they affect men and women-and, basically, most of us at the moment do notbut also a question of the whole tone of the place. This is a place of combat. It is not a place of consensus. It is a place where a high priority is put on combat and there is great focus on it. Those in the press galIery rely 'on it. They like the present system. But it is not the way most people operate. It is not the way most families operate or most businesses operate. I think, therefore, that the whole thing must be treated much more seriously than it has been. Looking at the fights that were held at the end of the 19th century and the reforms that were made then, I think the reform I am proposing is less radical. I also remind the House that Australia took the very radical step of being the first country in the world to introduce the secret ballot-and that was regarded as very odd 100 years ago. Work Related Injuries",52
34,Mr TANNER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I endorse the comments that have just been made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and applaud him for the contribution he made to this debate earlier this year. The comments that I would like to make today are also related to matters of specific concern to women, although they do affect men as well-that is, the problem of RSI, or repetitive strain injury, and other similar occupational injuries, such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, ganglions and, using a general phrase, occupational overuse syndrome. We have seen in Australia throughout the 1980s effectively an epidemic of such injuries across our work force. We have seen this in blue collar areas, such as in production line work in companies such as Rank Electric, as it then was, in Melbourne, and in many areas it has affected office workers, particularly those using keyboard equipment. There is widespread community ignorance about the phenomenon of RSI. We have some of the more extreme examples, with people such as Bruce Ruxton making outrageous statements, using the term 'Lebanese arm' and things of this nature. People have coined the phrase 'kangaroo paw', implicitly suggesting that in some way this phenomenon is restricted to Australia only. There are still many doctors who claim that RSI does not exist, or that it is in some way a figment of the imagination of those who suffer from it. Even one of my former colleagues, Senator Peter Walsh, once raised doubts about the genuineness of RSI in a contribution in the Senate some years ago. The problem was identified many, many years ago, in fact, centuries ago, by an Italian physician, Bernardino Pamazzini, in a paper published in 1713 entitled, De Morbis Artificum. The phenomenon, contrary to the notion put forward by the saying 'kangaroo paw', is quite widespread in other industrialised nations-as can be found, for example, by reading a recent edition of New Scientist with a very informative article entitled, 'RSI On Trial'. What tends to happen is that in many other nations the problem is swept under the carpet. People who suffer from it are dismissed. They do not have the ability to obtain compensation entitlements and the like. Therefore, there is no serious analysis of the extent of the problem. RSI causes severe ongoing pain, particularly to t-ose sufferers who have more entrenched and severe examples of the syndrome. It can spread. It is possible for a person to suffer repetitive strain injury in one arm and because of the fact that they then tend to favour that arm in ordinary everyday activity they develop problems with the other arm. Problems often extend into the neck, the back and other parts of the body. . The causes of these problems are still not clear. New technology has clearly been a major contributor. In the old days of the keyboard, it was common-it was standard, in fact - for a typist's time to be interrupted by activity such as changing paper, the return and things of that nature, whereas now the standard keyboard involves a constant activity. Keyboard design has many faults. The standard keyboard is designed for a male sized hand in many circumstances, rather than for a smaller, or typically female, sized hand. Fifty-seven per cent of key strokes are with the left hand, which is typically the non-dominant hand for most people in our society because of the design of our standard keyboard. Chair design has been a problem. Fortunately, there have been many advances in this area, but we still have many problems. I personally have been involved in industrial situations where it has been abundantly clear that major outbreaks of RSI have been caused by outrageously defective ergonomic circumstances. One involved the Victorian TAB, or telephone betting, in the early 1980s where the chairs had humps in the back, forcing the keyboard operators to sit forward. The work stations were so low that they were unable to get their legs underneath them so they had to sit sideways with thlfir legs crossed and then key in. That is the worse possible posture that you could have for engaging in keyboard work. Predictably, over 200 people then suffered serious RSI problems, many of them unable to perform that sort of work ever again. When we consider that many of these people had relatively limited skills in most other areas and depended very much on their keyboard abilities for their prospects to obtain employment, we have got a very serious situation indeed. There have also been many examples of outright exploitation of workers where companies, until recently including major banks, offered workers bonuses for the speed at which they would· key in material. Data processing workers would simply have targets to achieve, numbers of keystrokes per hour, and they were being offered bonuses if they exceeded those targets-a clear recipe for injury. Stress has been identified as a factor, and stress not in the sense of people developing imaginary injuries, as is sometimes suggested by some doctors, but stress in a direct physical sense. If persons are sitting in a tense posture, they are much more likely to develop muscle injuries as a result of overuse of particular muscles than if they are relaxed. Hormone variations in women have also been identified as a factor which can render an individual more susceptible to RSI than otherwise would be the case. There has even been one study, and a serious scientific study rather than some of the peculiar material that floats around from time to time, that suggested that fluoridation may in fact have a connection with the RSI phenomenon. The consequences for individuals can be extremely severe. They often have to put up with severe ongoing pain which can fluctuate from day to day and from hour to hour and are put in a very difficult situation where, if they do ordinary everyday things and tolerate the pain, others in the community may form a view that they are bludgers, that they are actually just shamming, that they are malingerers. The alternative is to cut themselves from many ordinary human activities. Many women in particular suffer very serious family problems because they are unable to undertake ordinary domestic duties like vacuuming, washing dishes and the like because of their injuries. Their husbands, who are still in the work force, are then expected to start doing these things. The tensions that are produced in the family as the result of those problems can often be very severe tensions and can in fact lead to family breakdown and divorce. Many people with RSI suffer extremely savage treatment by insurance doctors, doctors who make considerable amounts of money out of having injured workers referred to them for assessment and writing reports saying that basically there is nothing wrong with them. RSI has been a fairly lucrative area for such doctors being able to present reports saying that it is imaginary, that there is nothing wrong with the individuals, there is no reason why the persons cannot go back to work and the like, even though they are in severe and ongoing pain. Recent research has indicated that there are objective signs that can indicate that RSI problems are genuine, for example, different temperature levels in different parts of the arm, indicating that there are actual scientific objective factors which can demonstrate the presence of these problems. I personally. have seen, as I am sure other members of this House have from time to time seen, individuals with grossly swollen fingers and wrists. One particular former member of my union had to have his wedding ring cut off because the swelling in his fingers was so bad that he was unable to take it off, and it was causing pain to him simply to have the ring still on. I would like to conclude by referring to what I would regard as one of the more disgraceful episodes in the history of this government in the late 1980s, which related to the matter of RSI. This was the Susan Cooper case, where the government took an absolutely gung-ho approach to demonstrate in the courts that RSI effectively did not exist, and the union supporting her, her union, lost roughly $200,000 as a result of the pursuit of off that case in that way by the government; the case was unsuccessful. Members of my union were put in a position where the government was in effect saying to them, 'If you want to pursue this case for compensation for your injuries, we are going to run the case for six weeks in the Supreme Court, call overseas witnesses, and the costs you will bear will bankrupt the union'. That is an approach that not even private insurance companies took. It was an absolutely disgraceful approach by any government to the problems of seriously injured workers. Mr Bruce Scott-Was this a Labor government?",52
35,Mr TANNER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a tragedy that it was our government that was doing it. What should be happening is that we should have proper enforcement of breaks for people in atrisk situations, constant monitoring of equipment design-(TIme expired) United States Agricultural Subsidies",55
36,Mr HAWKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In this grievance debate today, I would like to raise the question of corruption in the United States agricultural subsidy program. I would like to start by reminding honourable members of the fact that we have the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade supposedly reaching an end in two months time. Although this is three years overdue, the delay has, of course, partly been on an ongoing basis, because of some of the work of the United States. Notwithstanding the fact that America's pressure for freer trade through the GATT has been widely publicised, I believe it is time to take a close look at the domestic record of the United States, particularly as it applies to agricultural subsidies. There was a remarkable expose in the New York TImes this month of a major scandal in the agricultural subsidies that the United States has been so generously applying to domestic users. This is all in relation to the agricultural department's $40 billion campaign to bolster crop exports over the last 10 years. This subsidy program in the year 1993 added up to a staggering $17 billion, just for that year. That is more than the total value of Australian exports in agriculture in anyone year. The program was started a decade ago to try to help beleaguered farmers. Instead, it has had a very different outcome. Firstly, it has enriched a small group of multinational corporations; secondly, it has done very little to expand America's share of world trade in agriculture; thirdly, it has encouraged corruption; and, fourthly, it has been hurting America's allies and, in particular, Australian farmers. It is interesting to note that it was not until the 1970s that the Americans finally dropped the subsidies that they had had in place since the Depression of the 1930s. By the 1980s, it started again to promote international sales of wheat, rice and other products through loan guarantees and cash subsidies. There is no doubt that there are some massive problems with this program. It is not meeting any objectives and, as I said, it is riddled with corruption-for example, the export enhancement program from 1986 which is supposed to help the United States compete with Europeans. In fact, it has been plagued by abuse and, despite assurances from time to time to the contrary, it has cost Australian farmers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales on our traditional export markets. This is the staggering part: in the first four years, of the $US2.3 billion awarded, $US1.38 billion-that is, 60 per cent-went to four multinationals. Two of them-would you believe?-are based in Europe. But the story gets 'Worse: the Americans are not only subsidising foreign companies, they are also subsidising foreign farmers. There are federal subsidy programs that have been used to buy cheap foreign commodities. These are shipped from the United States, thinly disguised as American exports. There was an example in the late 1980s of $208 million worth of tobacco that had been shipped from America: at least $135 million worth-that is, 65 per cent-was grown overseas. It seems absolutely ridiculous. Tobacco was grown in Zimbabwe, Brazil and-would you believe?-in France. This was sold under the subsidy program and sold to-guess who?-Iraq, of all places. So, in fact, the American taxpayer ended up subsidising foreign grown tobacco and paying to sell it to the Iraqis, just before the Gulf War. The next point is that the objectives have clearly failed. It was supposed to help American farmers compete and increase market share. It has done little to open new markets. For example, the American rice farmers have a 19 per cent share of the world market whereas, in the 1970s, they had about a 19 per cent share. So, in fact, it has achieved nothing. Since 1986, 80 per cent of the money in one of the programs has been spent to subsidise wheat sales. Exports· did increase in 1987-88, but the researchers in the United States Department of Agriculture have credited the subsidies with generating only 20 per cent of that growth. But since 1988 the wheat exports of the United States have actually declined below the levels that prevailed when the program started, so despite spending all that money the quantity is falling and the market share also has shown the same sort of trend. In 1986 the United States sold 30 per cent of world wheat exports; by September 1993 it still had 30 per cent market share. The European Community, which has a 20 per cent share, has in fact increased its share by four per cent, and there are similar patterns with other agricultural products. . The scandal goes on. There has been enormous cost to the taxpayers in America, but in many cases the true cost of this has been hidden and the Department of Agriculture in the United States has become more and more secretive in the way it reports. As the article in the New York TImes highlights, there has been an incredible number of cases of straight-out corruption. My next point is the way that Australian farmers have been betrayed by the United States. Until recently Australian farmers, as much as any group in the community, have been very staunch supporters of the United States as our allies. Yet time and again, despite repeated assurances, the Americans have had no hesitation in muscling in on some of the traditional export markets that Australia has developed over many years. We have found that the Americans have been using subsidised wheat to try to edge us out. This is at a time when Australian farmers are much more competitive in their production costs than farmers in the United States, . at least until the farm gate. After that American farmers have considerable advantages, particularly in lower fuel taxes and lower transport costs. On top of that, they get a huge subsidy which should be going to help them but, as I have already pointed out, it is not in fact reaching the target it is aimed for. We have to look at the future, first of the context of previous programs. As I said, the Americans took until the 1970s to get rid of programs that had been brought into help alleviate the effects of the depression of the 1930s. President Clinton announced in his plan in September that he is going to lift some of the controls on technology exports, that he is going to intensify efforts to promote manufactured goods, and that he is going to offer up to $600 million a year in subsidised loans to foreign buyers of American factory products, but when it comes to agriculture he has said nothing about the 80 per cent of export financing dollars spent on farm pr07 ducts. He is obviously running two standards, as we have seen so often. It may be that the scandal that has been exposed by the New York llmes will start to exert some pressure. We would all hope so, but having seen rorts exposed previously· in many cases around the world and seeing how little effect exposure has, one has to have a healthy degree of cynicism. But it is time for some acknowledgment that one of our major trading partners, and a very good ally of ours, has in fact worked against its own taxpayers and particularly some of its allies, the farmers of Australia. The time has come for Australian farmers to take up this fight again, but also I think the Australian government has to take up this matter again. I do not think it is good enough waiting and hoping for an outcome from GATT in December-we have already been waiting an extra three years for that. We all know the difficulties there, but I believe there are opportunities for the Australian government to take a much more active role in putting pressure on the Americans to ensure that a program, one that has clearly failed but is costing Australia dearly, is cut off. (TIme expired) Launceston Post Office",55
37,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I ask the indulgence of the House to bring a matter of importance to its attention. One of the City of Launceston's best known landmarks, the post office, has been offered for sale by tender, and the citizens of Launceston are very concerned. They have asked me to all in draw various details of this matter to the attention of the federal government. To explain what I am about, I will read to the House a letter written by the Han. Don Wing, MLC Tasmania, to Mr Trevor Holm, who is State Manager of Australia Post Tasmania. It reads: Dear Mr Holm, As you may be aware, there is a widespread reaction of incredulity to the announcement that Launceston Post Office is to be sold. Indeed, there is a sense of bewilderment people cannot countenance one of the City'S known landmarks as anything other than the Office. The reaction of citizens is greater as there not previously been any indication made publicly of Australia Post's intention to sell the Post The first public indication was at the time of advertising for tenders on the bas.is that these close as early as November 24, 1993. This is surprising and regrettable, especially as the tower, clock and chimes were funded by public subscription in the first decade of this Century. It is felt, therefore, that the citizens of Launceston morally own at least a significant part of the Post Office building. For these reasons I am anxious to do everything possible to give the citizens of Launceston reasonable opportunity to express their views the matter and to make appropriate representations with a view to achieving an outcome which is reasonably acceptable to both the citizens of City and Australia Post. A number of possible solutions come to my mind and no doubt there will be others which occur to other citizens and their representatives. However, it is important that there be adequate time for to be investigated and canvassed. Having recently inspected this building, surprised to find there is such a large area available for office and other accommodation. One matter that I would wish to canvass is the possibility Australia Post retaining a reasonable and permanent presence in the building, so that it may continue be known as the Launceston Post Office, even if Australia Post or a different owner balance of the building for other purposes. In any event, I would hope that the building would be used for some type of government or public purposes-perhaps including community organisations. In view of the suddenness of Australia Post's announcement that the property will be sold, you prepared to withdraw the property from sale? If not, will you agree to extend the time for closing of tenders for several months to enable this comin munity to have adequate and reasonable time to deal with the situation appropriately? Yours sincerely, DON WING, M.L.C. NA This letter was .written last Monday, 25 October, following community consultations the at which I was in attendance along with Mr . Ray Bailey, MLC; Mr Lionel Morrell, Acting as Regional Chairman of the National Trust of best Australia (Tasmania); Tony King from the Post Tasmanian Arts Council; Lance Armstrong from the Greens, MHA for Bass; Lalla has Smekthurst, Administrator of City Prom Ltd; Peter Parsons of the Launceston Chamber of Office. Commerce; Alderman Ian Routley from the would City of Launceston; Byron Dilworth. of Tasmanian Exhibition Services; other concerned citizens such as Lance Barnard, who is a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia; Bill Tann; Ken and Audrey Partridge; and Helen Polley. These people represented a broad range of citizens who were concerned that Australia Post had put this notice into action. I might a add that those people came together with less about than 24 hours notice. There has been widespread consternation that the public has not this been given sufficient time to act. However, we, the first group of concerned citizens, have acted very quickly and responsibly. On Tuesday, I received further correspondence from a Mr Gregg, who is the State President these of the National Trust of Australia (Tasmania). I quote a couple of statements of relevance I was from that particular letter: Following the recent public announcement by Australia Post to offer this property for sale by of Tender, the Trust has been successful in obtaining the 'in principle agreement' of Australia Post to to certain restrictive covenants that would seek to protect that portion of the property occupied by the were to use the Post .Office building. We will shortly recommend to the Municipality of the City. of Launceston that they grant a Preservation Order pursuant to Section 690A of the Local Government Act, and to this end we have asked Australia Post to assist by their prior agreement to not seek compensation should a Preservation Order are be granted. The National Trust has undertaken these initiatives in order to obtain suitable heritage protection measures for the Launceston Post Office the event that the property passes out of the ownership of the Commonwealth of Australia, and thereby lose the protection currently afforded by the Australian Heritage Commission Act. It is the intention of the National Trust to promote the future use of this building to as many community organisations as possible and this may include the possible interest by the National Trust in utilising a portion of the building as its State Administration Headquarters. Should sufficient interest be found by local commerce, tourism and information agencies to fully utilise the spaces within the building, then its viability may be promoted as a public building. Me Morrell-for the National Trust, Tasmania-also spoke up and said that this initiative could open a window of opportunity for the city of Launceston and the Tamar Valley region. I have also availed myself of the opportunity to meet today with the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) to bring ihis matter to his attention. It is anticipated that because the proposal is gaining rapid momentum, key political and cQmmunity representatives could seek a meeting with the minister to place the community requirements and concerns in front of the federal government. This beautiful heritage building was built by John and Thomas Gunn, contractors, in 1889-just over 100 years ago. It has been an historical landmark in the city of Launceston ever since. The tower was added in 1903 by public subscription to celebrate the centenary of the founding of Launceston, but by some error it was completed without the. provision of a clock, although the original plans had provided for one. So in 1906 a public committee was formed to raise the money, and soon it was ordered from Gillet and Johnston of Croydon in Surrey, England. It arrived and was added in 1909. The clock and chimes were the responsibility of the city council from 1910 to 1949 and then Australia Post took over its maintenance. Therefore, the citizens of Launceston show that they have had Ii long history of past ownership and pride in this graceful, Queen Anne style building. To step into this building is like stepping back in time because of its architecture and elegance, but it is a highly functional post office, which offers the public every facility of posting. It is an example of fine architecture and workmanship. A major concern is that if it is sold unconditionally it may have its facade, interior or atmosphere altered, thus removing its historical and heritage significance, as has been the case, I might add, with similar heritage buildings in the Launceston area. I feel particularly akin to this building because of the atmosphere which it exudes to me each better day as I am in my electorate office, which is opposite it. Before closing, I might add that on coming into this House at 12.50 this afternoon I received a phone call from my electorate to say that an extension has been given for the sale to 15 December, which offers local citizens a better opportunity to have their say. I thank the House for its indulgence in this case. As the member for Bass, I will continue to fight to retain our heritage buildings for future generations. I also urge all honourable members to keep a watchful eye on progress in their areas. Let progress not overtake our thinking to the detriment of our beginnings. International Labour Organisation",56
38,Mr MCARTHUR,MEMBER FOR LAUNCESTON,"Today I want to grieve on behalf of all Australians who are witnessing this Labor government's obsession with paying attention to United Nations bodies such as the International Labour Organisation based in Geneva. This government has a fixation with ratifying ILO conventions and examining ILO recommendations. Australia has a Westminster system of government. Our federal, state and local governments make laws as a result of being elected through a largely preferential voting system that gives clear political outcomes, unlike the proportional voting systems that are often used in Europe. These ILO conventions circumvent Australian laws. An interdepartmental committee is examining just how quickly Australia can bring into force another 75 of those ILO conventions, to add to just over 50 which Australia has already ratified. On 11 November 1992 Senator MCMullan said that it was desirable to ratify these ILO conventions because such ratification supports domestic policies of his government, lends credibility to Australia internationally, confirms Australia's acceptance of international labour standards and promotes higher labour standards in the Asia-Pacific region. Hardly any of these statements are factual. It is not democratic for Australia to even partially give away sovereignty to the International Labour Organisation. Paying close attention to the ILO's conventions and recommendations will not create one extra job for Australians or change the conditions under which Australians work. ' The European Parliament is an ineffective democratic institution which demonstrates just what problems can result from international influences. The real decisions are made by the Council of Ministers in Brussels. For instance, the quality and production techniques in relation to butter in Ireland are dir-cted by office bound bureaucrats based in Brussels. That is the situation in those sets of arrangements which are similar to the ILO conventions. Of course, these directives out of Brussels are not the outcome of political debate in the European Parliament. In the preamble of the ILO constitution there are phrases which include such measures as prevention of unemployment, provision of adequate living wage and recognition of the principle of freedom of association. These are all laudable objectives that both the government and the opposition here would support. However, I have a number of reservations about the ILO. Its conventions and recommendations are so vague as to be almost meaningless. Take, for example, its conven. tion concerning the promotion of collective bargaining. Even though this is, as the name implies a 'promotional' convention, which is a step down from the more usual type of convention, the statements within it are almost meaningless. Article 5, for example, says: Measures adapted to national conditions shall taken to promote collective bargaining. What does this mean? Under new industrial relations laws to be introduced in this House this afternoon, it has been suggested that unions and their officials will be able to scrutinise and effectively have to approve all enterprise agreements prior to registration. Is this an enterprise agreement entered into freely or under ILO conditions? I ask the House. I note in passing that this government contravenes the ILO's freedom of association principles. Employees here can be coerced into joining trade unions by strongarm tactics. Employees should retain the legal, enforceable right not to join a union, and I am sure that right would be very much in mind with the ILO conventions. Secondly, the ILO conventions are ignored for differing reasons by various member states. China, for example, a bastion of liberal democracy if ever there was one, has ratified and brought into i- own law only 17 conventions. China has a permanent seat on the ILO because it is regarded as one of the 10 member states ranked by industrial importance. China is not regarded as having a good record in looking after the interests of employees or, for that matter, having a good record in human rights. One of the conventions China has ratified recognises the right to tripartite consultation between employers, unions and government in making labour laws. However, this three-way consultation cannot really exist in a one-party state such as China. These ILO conventions involve major loss of sovereignty and independence for Australia, a very important process. Parliamentary scrutiny is far less effective for the actual ratification because the notification of ratification is an executive act that does not have to be 'published in the government Gazette. The parliament cannot seek to overturn a ratified convention, because it is not a disallowable instrument, and I ask honourable members to note very carefully those observations. When a convention is ratified by a member state, such as Australia, we have 18 months to incorporate that convention in our domestic laws; This could still be acceptable. Australia be can very easily change laws with the passage of amending legislation through state or federal parliaments. In the case of an ILO convention, the issue is not as simple. The only way to escape from an ILO convention is to do what is called 'denounce' it. That can be· done only 10 years after the convention was entered into and, after that time, on every subsequent 10th anniversary. So Australia is locking itself into an inflexible system which gives power to Third World bureaucrats of the ILO whose democratic processes are very questionable. The ILO has an international committee of 20 eminent jurists and the like, who are charged with meeting every March to review the progress of member states in implementing conventions and recommendations. It is true that some conventions-such as those on the freedom of association-are regarded as so fundamental to the ILO's charter that Australia's progress on implementing major points is looked at by - his expert committee, irrespective of whether Australia has ratified such a convention. 'In the year to June 1992, the committee of experts examined 13 of the conventions that Australia had ratified, just to see how we were going. I note, however, that the committee of experts did not hand down a report on anyone of China's 17 ratified conventions! The stupidity of this whole exercise is that, a nation chooses not to be cooperative with the ILO, there is very little that the ILO can do, apart from perhaps huff and puff to the world's media. The ILO does not seem to recognise that increasing productivity and capital investment in the workplace are the only ways to bring down Australia's high level of unemployment. In convention No. 172 on working conditions in hotels, restaurants and similar establishments, the ILO maintains that there should be a weekly break of at least 36 hours for employees in these types of businesses. I point out that it is common for the tourist industry to have seasons of peak demand, and that many employees and business owners in coastal and ski resorts would not desire or expect more than a day off in a fortnight, in the short peak season over the summer or winter respectively. Employees need the wages and tips; employers need the skilled and enthusiastic labour. Australia is deciding whether to ratify convention. However, I note that the United States, which has only 7 per cent unemployment, as against Australia's 11 per cent, abstained from voting on this particular convention. Some of the ILO's conventions are inappropriate for Australia. Honourable members no doubt saw the report on Tuesday night which said that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has apparently watered down his original plan to compel employers to notify the Industrial Relations Commission if they were dismissing 15 or more employees, even for economic reasons. The ILO convention on tennination of employment, dating from 1982, is almost certainly where the minister got his strange idea from. In article 14, the convention says: When the employer contemplates termination for reasons of an economic, technological, structural or similar nature, he shall notify, in accordance with the national law and practice, the competent authority thereof as early as possible giving relevant information, including a written statement of the reasons for the terminations, the number and categories of workers likely to be affected and the period over which terminations are intended to be carried out. This would have been a bureaucratic nightif mare for Australia's employers. The only way that many employers have been able to stay in business has been, regrettably, by reducing staff numbers. They have had little or no alternative, under this Labor government. The convention has not yet been ratified by Australia. If it is ratified by this government, it will be annoying to see the ILO committee of experts asking Australia in most years why the government might not have gone the whole hog and imposed the silly part of this ILO convention on employers. This government should concentrate on encouraging business investment rather than on fonning committees just to see how quickly Australia can make itself subject to even more dictates and requests of international bureaucrats in the International Labour Organisation. Port Authorities  p.m.)-My grievance today is the irresponsible practice by the New South Wales and this Victorian governments of using their port authorities as money machines, or milch cows. Their action in extracting exorbitant dividend payments from the ports results in increased and unnecessary costs for both importers and exporters. It forces port authorities to charge very high rates for port services, thus reducing Australian exporters' ability to compete in international markets. There was a recent comparison of port charges in Australia and New Zealand. Even excluding stevedoring charges, the average Sydney and Melbourne charges for the porting of a ship were twice those of porting the same vessel in comparable New Zealand ports. That says one thing only: those shipping companies are being ripped off by port authorities which are, in effect, taxing authorities for their state governments. No matter what protestation or smokescreen may come from the New South Wales and Victorian governments, everyone-from wool growers, to exporters, to ship operators to port operators-knows that these governments are using their port authorities to effect a tax on trade, regardless of the consequences. Their actions seriously damage the efforts of Australia's industries to expand our exports. The Industry Commission, referring to dividends, said on page 59 of its May 1993 report: Thus, dividends should not be set according to the revenue requirements of governments ... But as is apparent from participants' comments-several state governments have used port authorities as revenue raising mechanisms irrespective of their profitability ... The problem of using government business enterprises, with natural or regulated monopoly characteristics, as 'milch cows' to meet government budgeting needs is more general than that of port authorities alone and appears to have been increasing with the budgetary stress facing state governments. Then the Business Council of Australia told the Industry Commission in the course of its inquiry: The monopolistic positions of state and territories port authorities (should not be) misused by their owners for the purpose of generating general revenue. Let me emphasise: the primary role of a port should be to facilitate trade and commerce. It should not be that of acting as a tax collector on trade. Unfortunately for Australia, that is what is happening, particularly in Sydney and in Melbourne. If state governments continue to tax trade-and, in doing so, they are effectively taxing industry by way of inflated port charges-they should come clean and state that that is their policy and identify their actions as being those of an industry policy generated by the respective state. Their policy is an increasingly serious impediment to Australia's international trade and to our coastal shipping services. Over the past three years there has been a dramatic improvement in waterfront productivity. The $165 million paid out by this government on behalf of taxpayerS and the $255 million invested by the industry-and that is essentially from the people who use shipping services-has generated an average 25 per cent reduction in stevedoring charges, a 57 per cent reduction in the number of people employed on the waterfront, a considerable reduction in turnaround times, and about a 57 per cent increase in productivity. In some individual cases it is much higher than that, but I am taking basic figures. What is happening is that much of the benefit of that investment and much of the benefit of the refonn on the waterfront are not going to the people who use ports and who use shipping services. It is going to state governments by way of enforced dividend. In this year alone in New South Wales the Maritime Services Board is expected to have to pay to the state treasury a sum of between $90 million and $95 million. In New South Wales the dividend policy-what the Maritime Services Board is expected to pay by way of dividend-has been set for the next five years. It is a wonderful business when the dividend is able to be set five years in advance of any trading activities! I am sure that there are many people who would like to invest in such companies on the stock exchange. Let me conclude, in the very limited time. I have in this debate, by saying that it is in Australia's interests that ports perfonn their primary role; and that primary role is to facilitate trade and commerce, not be a collector of taxes on trade. Pensioners: Managed Investments .",58
39,Mr VAILE,MEMBER FOR LAUNCESTON,"My grievance today is on behalf of all of the pensioners in the electorate of Lyne who have managed investments. There are thousands of people within the electorate of Lyne who are confused, frustrated and irate as a direct result of this government's policy towards pensioners who hold managed investments. After being elected only a short while ago, the government's ruling on managed investments as being different from the treatment given to share portfolios is my first real taste of public bureaucracy in action. This really is a decision straight out of a Yes, Minister scene. It is plainly obvious that the principles apply to the treatment of pensioners with share portfolios are exactly the same as the principles that should apply for managed investments, yet the government has sidestepped the issue and totally ignored the principle of the situation. I put it to the that the same arguments can be used against the inclusion of listed securities in the income test as are applied to managed, investments, that the capital gain is not necessarily realised and there will be no actual income un less the holder of the managed investment cashes in some of his investment to realise the gain. While managed investments are generally less volatile than shares and so their value is less likely to fluctuate, it remains true that their value can fluctuate quite substantially. For example, if the managed investment is in a share portfolio and the share market experiences a rapid rise, that .person's pension entitlement could be substantially affected due to what is a paper.increase in the value of the i,nvestment. Such an increase may also be wiped out in any following fall in the share values, leaving the person with .an investment with the same capital value at the end of the period while his pension has been affected during the fluctuations in the value of the managed investment. This government, in its desperate efforts at revenue raising, continues to have a very strange idea about what is income, and managed investments are a classic example of this. The government does not seem to realise that the approach it uses is totally unjust because its method treats something as income even though the only way it can be made use of is by the realisation on the selling of the product. I believe income is something that you buy milk with, income is something that you go to the movies with, income is a regular, high turnover source of disposable funds. Yet the government seems determined to treat non-disposable and low turnover investments as income. These are more often than not very elderly people who have put all their savings into one nest egg, quite often simply to be left for later generations to get a start in life. I sense that the government knows just that. This is the classic leftist Labor answer to death duties. that The government knows that death duties would prove to be a political nightmare for it, so this is its underhanded way of getting around that issue. With the introduction at the end of September of the government's pension changes with regard to managed investHouse ments, hundreds of thousands of pensioners around Australia will be much worse off than before the legislation was introduced. The point I would like to highlight today is the serious breakdown in communication between the government that has brought in this legislation, the department that has to regulate it and the pensioner who has a managed investment portfolio. There seems to be a concerning breakdown in the filtration of information within the department, because when this legislation was put into practice at the end of September it was not for another two weeks that many people first knew of the reasons for the changes to their pension income due to their managed investments. On the anecdotal evidence from pensioners in my electorate, the average pensioners on the street with a small managed investment have received an average $50 a fortnight cutback in their pension, and they are struggling to understand how this has occurred and whether they can do anything to redress the situation. This government must realise that the majority of pensioners in Australia do not follow the passage of bills through this place. They are not particularly interested in what goes on here. They are quite often more interested in enjoying retirement and trying to ensure continuity during their twilight years. So it worries me that I am now swamped with complaints when the legislation passed through this place over a year ago and that it is only now that a great many of these pensioners have found out what is going on. The filtration of information within the Department of Social Security must be improved. I realise that change is occurring to laws at a great rate, but I argue that the priority for this department should be the people that it serves. They must be as informed as the person behind the counter and, with regard to these changes to managed investments, this simply has not happened. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will know, I live in a beautiful area of Australia on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, where there are a great many people who have small managed investment portfolios and who also receive the pension. It is these people who are being seriously disadvantaged by this crazy Labor Party scheme, which is yet another slap in the face to the elderly community and yet another money grabbing exercise by this big spending, big taxing government. I would like to put on record some of the correspondence that I have received from the community within my electorate so as to highlight the concerns of the people in the electorate of Lyne. The first letter is from a leading Australian banking institution which has turned up its nose at how this government has kept the people involved in this situation well and truly in the dark. I quote from a letter from the finance manager of a branch of St George: With the pennission of one of my clients and a constituent of yours, Mr Reg and Mrs Dulcie Swindley, I've enclosed the letter they have received from Social security. The letter was received by them on the 12.10.93 but you will note that they lost their pension on unrealised asset gains on Managed Investments effective from 23.9.93. Mr Swindley is 84. Clients of mine in Tamworth also received their letter last week effective however from 23.9.93. The Tamworth Clients have health problems with one about to undergo treatment for cancer. This inhumane treatment of Senior Citizens is intolerable. Logic to me, would be for Social security to send a letter advising that from say 31st October, their pension will cease, unless they can show changes in recorded circumstances that reduces their income below pension threshold. I have a further letter here from one of my constituents, a Mr Geoff Bath, from Bonny Hills, who rang me and subsequently sent a letter which said in part: Re our telephone conversation concerning the cancellation of my Veterans' Affairs pension on 30th September 1993. My income from my managed investments is approx $353 per fortnight, whereas the Veterans' Affairs people maintain that I am getting $1,020 per fortnight, which means I will have to cash in some of the investments from time to time to live on. The department's different view of the actual facts is incredible. The difference comprises the amount between $353 actual income per fortnight from an investment and the department's assessment of $1,020 per fortnight actual income. This is a clear-cut case of the mushroom theory in operation, starting from the office of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), and flowing down through each social security office until the people who really should be informed about what is going on, the people with pensions and managed investments, are not told anything until a couple of weeks prior to the event actually occurring. It was only after the exertion of enormous public pressure and a concerted effort by the opposition that the minister, following a fair bit of pressure and advice from his backbench, I would imagine, amended the legislation with regard to share portfolios. But now he maintains his belief in managed investments being a reason for reducing the pension, despite exactly the same principles based applying to managed investments as they did to share portfolios which, I might add, use an outrageously complex formula that has been shown to be no reflection of the actual real gains made by having a managed investment. I quote the following information on the formula from the background information on the relevant social security amendment bill: The first step in calculating the income from the investment that will be taken into account for the income test is to calculate the annual return, which is the value of the investment multiplied by the rate of return received in the previous year. Losses will be calculated in the same manner. The return from the investment is calculated by adding together the closing value of the return and any distribution made and subtracting the opening value. (In this way any capital growth in the investment is included in calculating the rate of return.) This is quite outrageous and not the sort of mumbo jumbo that one can expect our senior citizens to understand. I therefore call on the government to reconsider its approach to the treatment of pensioners with managed investments. This government promised great things for pensioners at the last election, such as removing them from the tax system by 1995. Yet, unfortunately, it has only moved pensioners further down the road to poverty. This government seems to think that people are like cars: the older they get, the less they are worth. This attitude must be changed, and I urge the government to reconsider this situation. Bonson, Mr Don",61
40,Mr SNOWDON,MEMBER FOR LAUNCESTON,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.34 p.m.)-Today I do want to grieve. I grieve about the passing of a very important person in the Northern Territory community. In my view he was a person who symbolised, in many respects, what Australians ought to be. Yesterday in Darwin we saw the funeral of a patriarch of a very large Aboriginal family. That person was Don Bonson. Don's life epitomised the struggle that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of his era had in confronting racism and institutionalised discrimination. Yet he waS someone who had a view of life which was based largely on the desire for fair treatment and equal rights for all, regardless of race, regardless of station in life. He recognised the particular place that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have, which was not recognised during his childhood. During his life, Don saw many of his Aboriginal brothers and sisters put behind wire in compounds in Darwin, including the infamous Kahlin compound. He saw Aboriginal kids marching in line up the street to afternoon out at the pictures of a Saturday. It was difficult to tell whether they were male or female until they got older, because they were all dressed the same and treated the same, and yet he was an Aboriginal person. Don was born in Darwin on 11 February 1914 to a Welsh father, Joseph, and an Aboriginal woman who lived in Darwin, Dolly Cummins. Don met Patricia Ah Matt as a youngster, and they were later to marry. What is significant about his contribution-and indeed his life-is that it epitomises a great deal of contemporary Australia. In many respects it highlights the fallaciousness of the position which is being adopted by those in our community who have voiced strong opposition to the recognition of Aboriginal native title and have taken opportunistic positions, such as those taken by the. opposition, which have at their base institutional discrimination and racism which Don Bonson thought had passed when Kahlin compound was closed. Don grew up in an era wh-n to be an Aboriginal meant that a person was treated in a particular way which was very different from the way in which other Australians were treated. The way in which we treated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s in this country formed the basis for what was to become in 1949 a visit from hell in terms of the apartheid regime which was implemented in South Africa. In a sense it was modelled on what existed in Australia. Don Bonson saw that system, how it operated and how it discriminated against his people. Yet, undeterred, he led a life which demonstrated many of the things which are at the base of the way in which people who belong to the Labor movement act. He was in every respect a true believer. He was a true believer in the principles which underlie the struggles of the labour movement and those in the community who are oppressed or less well off. Don was a life member of the Labor Party. He was a life member of his union, which he joined, I am told, in the late 1930s. Throughout his working life he had a dedication and their commitment to the achievement of social justice for workers and Aboriginal people. That struggle which he endured, that commitment, will be long remembered. His passing has brought great sadness to his family, his friends and the community generally. His contribution and that of his partner, Patricia, who died earlier this year, to the Darwin community will not be forgotten. They have together left a great legacy for al1. Don's life saw him as an active particiin pant and observer of changes which have led at last to at least some people in this country confronting the social and economic reality Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australin ians and accepting that the doctrine of terra nu11ius has in fact been consigned dustbin of history. That is a reality which the High Court has manifestly recognised, but sadly it seems it will not be recognised members of the opposition in this House. Don leaves behind 12 children: Don, Jotheir seph, John, Robert, Ken, Gwen, Patricia, Betsy, Lynette, Dorothy, Leah and Marie. There are stories that when the immediate family gets together its members number 75. Don Bonson left a great impact ern Territory community. As I said, Don, his partner and family have left us a great legacy. That legacy is in part demonstrated by the way in which he was able to tolerate the racism which he confronted as a young person growing up and that he saw his relatives being subjected to because they were black. We now have a position in this country where at last the Australian community, as a result of the High Court decision, has taken position that we ought to accept the reality Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, their lives, their history and their proper place our community. The High Court has recognised that they have common law rights which have existed from time immemorial. Unfortunately, in this country we still have people who .are conus do. cerned to express a view that those rights should be put aside for self-interest, sectional or political interest, or political opportunism. That is part of the manner of the debate in this country on the question of Mabo.

43,Mr SNOWDON,MEMBER FOR LAUNCESTON,"At the heart of this debate is the racism and cynicism of those by who oppose the principles which have been laid down by the High Court. I repeat that for own selfish and political interests they are trying to perpetrate division within our community against the interests of the wider Australian community and the interests and human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait on the NorthIslander Australians. Those people should be ashamed of themselves. Why do they not walk away and examine what they have done and the way in which they want to lead this country into debate? Why do they not accept the reality of those human rights which have nmv been recognised in this. nation as a result of the . High Court decision? Why cannot they accept a that these human rights are rights which of belong to us al1, without discrimination? Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australin ians deserve those rights as much as you and I deserve them. What we ought to do is ensure, when we legislate around the Mabo decision, that we incorporate and strengthen those rights and that we do not diminish those rights, as those in the opposition would have I ask this House to recal1 the life of Don Bonson, to recal1 the struggle that he went through in confronting the racism he endured as an Aboriginal person, and to understand divithat the sorts of debates that we are now seeing in this country would have us go back ask to that same racist division and discrimination honagainst those people.

45,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I endorse the comments of the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should take out private health insurance. This is a suggestion I wholeheartedly endorse and would also extend to every member in this House. On our incomes we should not be relying on Medicare, which I would remind honourable members is a public health insurance system set up to protect the lower income earners, the pensioners and the unemployed. Today it is being abused by people who can afford private health insurputting ance, not least the Prime Minister. I made mention of this in my maiden speech, and 7 May I wrote to the Prime Minister urging him to take out private health insurance and to encourage his colleagu- to take it out.",66
46,Mr SLIPPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Did he reply?,66
47,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"He has not yet replied. I must say I am totally disappointed at his failure to take it out. People on incomes like his should not be reliant on public health. have had letters from many people in my electorate-pensioners, unemployed, low income earners, real Aussie battlers, those who are waiting to get into hospital. They want private health insurance. They want it because they cannot get into public hospitals but regrettably they cannot afford it and the government will not provide any incentive people to take out that health insurance because it is blinded by an illogical outdated ideology. These same Aussie battlers are also waiting because Medicare has failed them. It is high time that higher income earners were given an incentive to take out private health insurance, allowing Medicare to be utilised by those at whom it was origiover nally aimed-the low income earners, pengenerate sioners, the unemployed and so forth.

48,Mr HOLLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Yesterday morning I returned to Canberra from a population conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where Australia's strong support for population policy was praised by everyone. Imagine my dismay when I looked at the local paper on arriving back here and learned for the first time of the government's cave-into the - wayout policies of Senator Harradine. To hold up funding for vital population programs until the link between population policies and social, economic and poverty issues are proven is like stopping funding for education until the creationist theory is proven one way or the other, or to stop all funding for AIDS research because someone does not like gays. The decision is a disgrace. It is a decision that this government took and I hope that it will be overturned because that decision, by someone's morality on other people, has condemned thousands and thousands of on women to death throughout the developing world and thousands and thousands of people to a life of poverty. I am ashamed to be part of the government that made that decision. Roads: Funding",66
49,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have received a letter from the rural city of Marong regarding the impact of the federal budget on motorists I and roads. ThecounciI recently considered a letter from the RACV relating to the above subject which highlighted the following issues. The most important points are that road funding has been cut by nearly 30 per cent and Victoria's allocation has fallen from about $360 million to $245 million. Victoria's allocation has remained at about 20 per cent for of the national total. The budget has also increased taxes on motor fuels to generate and additional general revenue. The main points in regard to fuel are that , the price of unleaded petrol and diesel will increase by 5c per litre over the next year, leaded petrol will increase by lOc per litre the 18 months, and these increases will some $1.4 billion additional revenue annually. Council expressed its concern and disappointment at the level of taxing of motorists and the small return being made by the federal government for roadworks throughout Australia. I ask the parliamentary secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous), to take up this very important issue with the Minister for Transport and Communications. Timber Industry",66
50,Mr JENKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the absence of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who cannot be here today, I wish to take up a favourite subject of his in these statements. That, of course, is the government of one Jeffrey Gibb Kennett, the Premier of Victoria. As people who listen to these statements and read the Canberra Times from time to time would know, the honourable member for Dunkley has the habit of indicating and outlining the atrocious policies of ment, whether they be in cigarette packet warnings, industrial relations, dismantling of workers compensation, closure of schools, cuts to education, cuts to pre-schools, cuts to community welfare organisations or cuts to the funding of citizen advice bureaus. I would like to touch upon a further form of cuts that the Victoria government is going to get into, and that is timber cutting for woodchips. honourable member for Dunkley, who is very but interested in the environment, I think would wish me to raise this subject. On the front page of the Melbourne Age yesterday, there was a report that the Victoricivilised an state government is planning to give go-ahead to large-scale woodchipping in Gippsland in old-growth areas. The Japanese firm Harris-Daishowa has been able to obtain a limited woodchip supply, usually from the sawmills. The state government will now like allow it to woodchip forests in Victoria. This is particularly dangerous when one considers that a report obtained by the from the department of the state Minister National Resources shows that 48 per cent of East Gippsland's old growth forest is outside national parks and remains unprotected. It also alarming because Victoria is a signatory to the national forest· policy designed to identify areas of significance and areas for timber industry. (Time expired) Prime Minister: Foreign Policy",67
51,Mr MACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The foreign affairs efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in badmouthing the British, amusing the Irish, savaging the French, grovelling to the Americans and pandering to China and Malaysia are largely inconsequential in world terms and serve mainly to enrage or entertain various sections of the Australian community. His attentions to Indonesia, however, are much more important. This nation, our nearest neighbour of 250 million people, in the next 20 years will playa major part in our future. n is vital that we establish as much contact as possible at all levels, but in the knowledge that the Indonesian people are under the control of a military dictatorship with the world's most consistently bad human rights that governrecord over the last 25 years. This authoritarian regime had killed up to a million of its citizens in 1966, and 200,000 East Timorese in 1975 and possibly 200,000 since. It slaughtered thousands of Melanesians in Irian Jaya in 1977. Thousands were killed . in Sumatra in 1989 and since, and hundreds died in Dili in 1991. The ruling clique has not The only consistently disregarded human rights, publicly tried to say that they do not exist, using the sophistry of cultural sovereignty. The regime has thumbed its nose at the world with its rule of the gun, its blatant Stalinist show trials and its continuing travesty of behaviour. Our Prime Minister is the coming dangerously close to becoming the east Neville Chamberlain of South-East Asia. Williams, Dr Don",67
52,Mr SAWFORD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would to take this opportunity to pay tribute to one of South Australia's most outstanding men in industry. Dr Don Williams, on 18 October, resigned from his position as ManagAge ing Director of the Australian Submarine for Corporation, which is situated in my electorate of Port Adelaide. During his six years as head of the Australian Submarine Corporais tion, I had many occasions to meet with him and always found him to be professional, energetic and a person of great substance and the vision. He departs the Submarine Corporation at a time when it has just recently successfully launched its first Collins class submarine, where Don steered it through its most difficult phase. It is probably worth mentioning that the project, with Don at its helm, was completed on time. Don Williams has had a very iIlustrious career. He has held non-executive positions with the University of South Australia, Opera in the Outback, and the Trust for One and All, just to mention a few. He has worked in London at the Imperial College and the Rice University in Houston. He is currently the chairperson of Australian National and a member of the Economic Development Board in South Australia, and it is now his intention to devote even more time to these duties. I thank Don on behalf of the people of Port Adelaide, South Australia and Australia for his work with the Australian Submarine Corporation and wish him every success in his future endeavours. Don WiIliams always said that it was more productive to talk about what is right in this country than what is wrong. On this side of the House, we would all say, 'Hear, Hear!' to that statement. Australian Defence Force: Cadets",67
53,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I spoke earlier today of the low morale, even in the Australian cadet movement, as part of a debate on the army. A Mrs Debbie Barrowman and officers of the Bundaberg Cadet Corps advised me this morning of conditions at Greenbank military camp, where cadets undertook their September camp. The food for the camp was prepared by contract caterers and was insufficient and poor in quality. In fact, on occasions it ran out. One officer described it as 'entree serving', and this for growing teenagers! Boys and girls had to share the same shower blocks in shifts. The cadets taken to Wacol for a confidence course waited up to two hours for home transport. There was no training in weaponry, radio, or map reading by Regular Army personnel or by the reserve officers. But most frightening of all, there were insufficient Regular Army officers on range duty to assist the officers of the cadets on the rifle range. Here we had young people using live ammunition, with the full responsibility falling back on teacher and volunteer officers. It is not good enough. If the cadet movement, the most fundamental level of all military experience, can be so poorly resourced by government, it is little wonder that such malaise and low esteem permeates right through all levels of the service. Once a fertile ground for the recruitment of young people with ambitions for military careers, this potentially great organisation has been marginalised and treated with contempt. Aboriginals",68
54,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"If there are stiII any doubts remaining in the Australian community about the type of treatment which has been afforded Aboriginal Australians, particularly in the first part of that 200 years of European settlement, those doubts must be dispelled by the experiences of and our knowledge about the sort of thing that happened to people like Truganini and other members of that Aboriginal race. The most recent, appaIling evidence of the way in which those people were treated was the treatment of Tambo Tambo, whose mummified body has now, after 110 years, been found in the cellars of a funeral parlour in the United States. One hundred and ten years ago, that young man, before the age of 21, was torn away from his family, his community and his culture by people representing, for God's sake, Barnum and Bailey circus, to be treated as an oddity, as something simply to provide amusement for caucasian whites in the United States. He was taken over there and was obviously devastated by the experiences he had. It was said that after 12 months in the United States he died of pneumonia. I bet he did not die of pneumonia. I bet he died of humiliation and of· devastation by being subjected to the indignities involved in the types of experiences that that young man had 110 years ago. Let us dispel forever the belief that some people may hold that Aboriginal Australians were not subjected to the treatment that we now all know they were. (TIme expired) Industry Policy",68
55,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Industry policy has become the flavour· of the month. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) now talks in terms of a post-tariff policy. When one puts this twist in the context of the now fashionable push towards regional economic development, one quickly realises that there is a revival of interest in interventionist industry policy. About 12 months ago my staff and I produced a paper entitled New ways in Wills. Unashamedly anti-economic rationalist, it argued for a radically different approach to reviving communities ravaged by so-called restructuring. Many of the ideas in the submission from the caucus task force on unemployment-for example, industry development to capitalise on the natural advantages of particular areas, making use of locally available skills, increased funding for local government capital works, emphasis on import replacement, and the role of small and medium community enterprises-can be found in New ways in Wills. What is a problem is that the task force has produced some potentially dangerous possibilities concerning voluntary work. By suggesting that voluntary work will prepare the unemployed for paid work, there remains the implication that the unemployed are unemployed because they lack the appropriate skills. I would have thought that those on the Left, who have some understanding of structural unemployment, might be wary of such propositions. Unemployment will not disappear merely because the unemployed have acquired, to quote the task force, - Self-esteem, social interaction, and a sense of achievement for worthwhile purpose'. Gilmore, Dame Mary",69
56,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The subject of my statement is Dame Mary Gilmore and the honour that has been bestowed on her, in recognition of her role in Australia, by placing her likeness on the new $10 note. She was an AWU representative, a socialist, and in fact was regarded by the Australian trade union movement as one of the great Australians. She was a feminist who fought against institutionalised prejudice. Her affinity with the indigenous population of Australia was exemplary. She was rewarded for her contribution to literature by a British Empire Medal for services to literature, and she was involved in the peace movement. She devoted her life selflessly to reforms such as votes for women, old age and invalid pensions, child endowment, improved treatment of returned servicemen, maternity allowance, child health centres, the rights of illegitimate and adopted Australians, Aboriginal Australians, unionists, writers and ordinary Australians. It is with great pleasure that I see that the women of Australia have a historical role model, someone who has fought against the odds to show exactly what Australian women and Australians can aspire to and do. It is with great pride that I represent the seat named after Dame Mary Gilmore. She is starting to get the recognition that she truly deserves. She deserves a lot more, and it will be my role to make sure she gets that recognition. (TIme expired) Canada: Election",69

62,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the attack on the Governor General by the Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation relating to Mr Hayden's comments about the republican debate. Does the minister agree that, far from the Governor General having acted in what Mr Hill claims is an outrageous and improper way, these words should be applied to describe the Managing Director's disgraceful conduct? Does the minister further agree that it is totally unacceptable for the head of an organisation which is supposed to operate under a charter requiring fairness and impartiality to enter a current political debate partisan way and, in the course of so doing, make such insulting remarks about the Governor General? Finally, does the Acting Prime Minister agree that Mr Hill has so compromised the independence and integrity of the ABC that he should be dismissed?",70
63,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am at somewhat of a disadvantage because I have not caught up with these remarks.,70
64,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Here it is.,70
65,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as the opposition is concerned, if it were not for morning papers, there would never be any questions at question time. The ABC has a history of independence, which the Leader of the Opposition would be well aware of. Fortunately, the ABC is currently led by someone who has a reputation for the very strong exercise of that independence and for expressing views either in his own right or on behalf of the ABC. I do not think either the office of the Governor General or the current occupant of that office is so sensitive as to be concerned about the remarks referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. Commonwealth Bank of Australia",70
66,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister able to report to the House on progress in regard to the Commonwealth's offer of some of its shares in the Commonwealth Bank? Is the minister aware of comments questioning the pricing methodology used by the government to sell the shares? If so, what is the government's attitude to these comments?",70
67,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second largest offer of shares ever in Australia's corporate history, which has involved the sale of a portion of the government's shares in the Commonwealth Bank, is proceeding most satisfactorily. This offer involves the sale of approximately 178 million shares in the Commonwealth Bank, in which the government is reducing its shareholding from about 70 per cent to 50.1 per ce!lt. The offer opened on 6 October for the general public and closed last Friday. For the institutions, it opened on 20 October and closes tomorrow. The offer is virtually at the in a point of conclusion. The details of the response so far are that, on the retail or general public side, 191,000 applications have been received. That is over one per cent of the Australian population. The bids total over $1.1 billion. Of that 191,000, about 100,000 are new investors in the Commonwealth Bank-in other words, not existing shareholders. About 99 tlz per cent of those applications are for amounts of $25,000 or less, and they will be subject to a discount of 25c. The institutional bidders are also in the process of completing their bids. They are guaranteed 35 per cent of the available shares, and they are providing strong support for the offer as well. That strong support comes from not only local institutions but institutions from overseas as well. Institutional bidders have, as I have said, till tomorrow night to finalise their position. The government will then finalise the strike price at which the shares will be sold and announce that strike price on Saturday. The question also referred to some criticisms of the offer. They particularly relate, as I understand it, to the fact that in the prospectus there was no fixed price or even a price range. It would of course not have been possible to include those, given the method of sale and the fact that this is a secondary offer. The method of sale is an open tender system, which is rather new in Australia but quite common in the United States. It is rather like an auction in which institutidns bid for shares at varying prices. From that array of bids, the government determines a final strike price to apply to all applications for shares, although the 25c discount applies to the retail bidders on amounts less than $25,000. With this type of sale process, it is obviously not appropriate to set a price because the price is determined by the auction. It would have been quite absurd for us to have a fixed price. In the case of Woolworths-whose very successful float - mployed this method alsothere was a price range. It has been suggested that we should have included a price range to give investors some idea of what the price would be when they put in their applications. Of course, Woolworths was in a different situation from the Commonwealth Bank. Woolworths had no shares on the stock exchange. There was no daily reference point in which investors could see in their newspapers what the market was pricing the shares at. It was a primary offer; not a secondary offer. This is a secondary offer in which there are shares in the market-shares which are being priced daily by the action of buyers and sellers. As a result of that, investors can clearly see, day by day, how the market is . valuing the shares of the Commonwealth Bank. In those circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank is in quite a different situation from that of Woolworths. Therefore, it is not appropriate for us to have included the price range because investors can get that knowledge of market prices. It has also been suggested that the Australian Securities Commission has been unhappy with the Commonwealth's approach to this sale, particularly in relation to the pricing aspect. Let me say that, in relation to that suggestion, before we embarked on the sale process the whole matter was taken to the Australian Securities Commission. No objections or concerns were raised in relation and none has been raised since. Native Title",70

73,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can he provide to the House the most recent indicators on the outlook for employment? What are the implications of this outlook for Australian families?",71
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Almost without exception, the leading indicators on employment are quite positive. The latest indicator, released only yesterday, is my department's skilled to it, vacancy index. It is a monthly count of vacancies and skilled occupations advertised in major metropolitan newspapers in the states and the Northern Territory. The October index increased by 4 per cent from September and is now 32 per cent higher than in October last year. It is 48 per cent above the low point of the 1991 recession. Out of 16 occupational groups, 14 have recorded increases and two remain unchanged from the previous month. Vacancies in all occupation groups are at least 10 per cent higher than at the recession low points. The most spectacular increases since October last year have been in the metal trades, which are up 200 per cent; the printing trades, up cent; vehicle trades, up 59 per cent; food trades, up 54 per cent; building trades, up 40 per cent; and the area of health practitioners, up 32 per cent. Other key indicators of labour demand are also strongly positive. The ANZ Bank job vacancies series has risen 21.5 per cent in year to September. Last month it recorded its fourth consecutive month of rising vacancies. The ABS job vacancy series for August was 39.2 per cent higher than a year ago, showing accelerating growth with an increase of 9.5 per cent in the three months to May 1993 and 18 per cent in the three months to August. Broader business indicators are also moving in the right direction. General economic growth, as measured in GDP tenns, has been growing for seven consecutive quarters. The ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends is showing improvements in outputs and new orders. The National Australia Bank survey of business conditions, released only last week, highlights a strengthening in business confidence. Critically, this strengthening in confiinterest dence will be given a boost by the very good CPI figures released yesterday. The downward revision in the inflation forecast of three cent for the year will also encourage investment and employment plans. So it is good news for all Australian working families. Over the course of the recession, the rise in unemployment has been serious among married couple families, although less severe than for the general population. The statistics relating to that situation bear some consideration. In June, neither spouse in 9l.6 per cent of all married couple families was unemployed. Both spouses were unemployed in only 2.1 per cent of married couple families; and in only l.3 per cent of married couples with dependants. Again in June- 2.7 per cent of families, including sole parent families, with dependants had both parents or the only parent unemployed. Adding in married couple families with one parent unemployed and one not in the labour force, seven per cent of all families with dependants did not have a working parent as a result of the unemploy70 per ment situation. There are about 324,000 dependants of such families. Since those figures were recorded in June, ABS job vacancies for the September quarter have risen by 9.3 per cent, the strongest· quarterly rise since February.l985. Of course, the improvement in employment will not be the dramatic. Given the up and down pattern in monthly ABS labour force surveys, the October employment figures are likely to show a correction following the large increase of over 45,000 jobs last month. But, generally, the trends are good and should be welcomed. Particularly welcome is the assessment of figures in relation to families. Obviously, in a recession, hearts go out in the first instance to families with dependants where the parents are unemployed. Mr Downer-Talk, talk, talk!",71
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of the opposition have a problem with reasonable figures. Even when they are not under attack, they invite attack by their constant babble across the front bench. When they are presented with what ought - o be a matter of concern and to those who care about Australian families, they are incapable of maintaining silence. They are a totally adolescent group, per with an attention span of about 30 seconds. On average, the position of Australian families, though many have been affected by the recession, has been better than that of the community as a whole. These figures bear that out and I think the figures will get even better as the sorts of changes that will inevitably come from the skilled vacancies flow through to the labour market over the next few months and years. Native Title",72
76,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Special Minister of State and it relates to native titleholders who have exclusive use of the land or pastoral leases converted to native title equivalent. Will such land be subject to council or shire rates and land tax? Will it be subject to normal requirements relating to fire prevention, pest and wild animal control? Will it be subject to normal development and environment regulations?",72
77,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the provisions in the paper released by the government explaining our position on native title was that state laws would apply. There was provision in the proposals that the normal state laws would apply to native title owners, laws relating to the protection of the environment, the protection of endangered species, national parks and fisheries-all those sorts of laws would apply. So it is really a matter for the state or territory government concerned. There are different laws, of course. In the Northern Territory there are different laws than other states in respect of the sorts of matters that the honourable member raises. But, basically, what will apply is very much within the province of the state or the territory concerned and the laws they wish to pass. Business Confidence",73
78,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development aware of recent reports showing strong evidence of a solid improvement in business confidence? In view of the government's proposed industry statement, can the minister - Iso inform the House of the importance of government actions in strengthening the economic recovery?",73
79,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Business confidence is obviously a key driver of investment. In the last little while we have seen a whole suite of indications of quite dramatic improvements in business confidence. By way of example, the Dun and Bradstreet survey showed employment expectations at their highest for some four years and that business expects both the economy· and employment to improve in the December quarter. The National Australia Bank's Quarterly business survey found improvements in short-term business confidence and further employment growth expected. The September survey of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures found that of 565 companies surveyed those expecting production sales growth over the next few months significantly outnumbered, by a factor of more than five to one, those which took a more cautious approach. The Westpac survey of consumer confidence showed a sharp rise of nearly 10 per cent in response to jobs growth. According to the October edition of the Bureau of Industry Economics' Australian Industry Trends', we have seen very strong growth in our economy; indeed, the highest rate of economic growth in the OECD. The innation numbers of yesterday are, of course, very positive and were a matter of some discussion during today's meeting of the Australian Manufacturing Council.

At the meeting this morning, in making his first contribution to the Australian Manufacturing Council, was Mr John Farrell from Oceanfast in Western Australia. He ran through in some detail why the shipbuilding industry in this country is so enormously successful. He pointed to the fact that order books were full for the next two years. He regarded our competitive advantage as being a 'judicious mixture' of things such as the creativity of the work force and the high skill levels. But, importantly, he made the point that government needs to be engaged or involved with that industry. That stands in such sharp contrast to the Leader of the National Party's colleague, the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, who said only two weeks ago that Australia's manufacturing industry is 'inefficient'. This is at a time when we are smashing records in terms of both elaborately transformed manufactured export goods and other export merchandise. Indeed, there has been a doubling of manufactured exports since 1982. The growth rates in that area continue at very high levels indeed. I note the honourable member for Goldstein is rolling his eyes towards the ceiling. Well he might. In the face of extraordinary and objective evidence about business confidence, he recently said, 'There is very little that would point to a turnaround in business investment sentiment'. That is in the face of a whole suite of objective economic evidence to the contrary. I will not name the member of the opposition because it may be an embarrassing thing, but I am prepared to drop a hint. This 'talking the economy down' view is of course not shared in private by members of the opposition. An interesting conversation was relayed to me only yesterday, involving a member of the opposition in this House, to the effect the opposition was in fact very depressed because as the economy recovered it could see its chances slipping away. He also passed on the observation that 'When Bronnie arrives next year that's going to really cause us some trouble'. I will not name the member, but he has a fann out near Bungendore. Let me conclude by infonning the House of the industry statement to be brought down next year. I have just concluded the process of identifying organisations, companies and individuals to whom I will be writing in the next week or so seeking an input into the industry statement. As opposition members will be aware, the proposed industry statem-nt is already receiving very considerable support in principle-certainly strong interest in making a contribution-and the most consistent theme from all of those who should be the allies of you on the other side of the House is how badly you have gotten it wrong. Unemployment",73
82,Mr CLEARY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It is encouraging to see that his caucus task force on unemployment has . arrived at the conclusion that we need a new and imaginative industry policy. Many of the ideas in the caucus report can be found in a document entitled New ways in Wills which my staff and I produced almost 12 months ago. He might recall that I sent him a copy. Notwithstanding this, does the honourable member consider that inducing the unemployed into such voluntary activities as Meals on Wheels, gardening and laundry is the way to overcome the structural unemployment that is a feature of modern capitalism? Furthermore, can the honourable member explain to the House how it is that voluntary work in, for example, the Meals on Wheels program will produce the kinds of skills to make Australia the so-called internationally competitive, export oriented country that he and his colleagues exhort us to aspire to. Finally, how does the honourable member respond to those who fear that pressuring the unemployed into voluntary work will only compound the existence of a cheap wage underclass?",74
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must say that the report that produced by the honourable member for Wills, while no doubt probably extremely well researched, has slipped my mind. But I will go back and take a look at it because no doubt he feels that there is much in it that ought to interest a minister for employment. On the general point that he makes, I think his line here, whilst understandable, is a bit wrong headed. The community requires a variety of skills. Some of those skills lie in the service areas, some of them lie in highly skilled manufacturing areas but I think all of them need to be structured in a way that provides real career paths and opportunities for people who engage in any area of employment. One of the areas where there is an absolutely critical need is in improving the training facilities available for the operative elements in the community. The restructuring of skills training through the Australian vocational certificate is very much directed towards that end. I think that people who handle all fonns of employment or enjoy any particular fonn of employment in the community are entitled to a decent career path. Some of those career paths will be through the sort of work that is done associated with voluntary agencies in the community generally. That particular element of the service and support sector is an area where I think, in the future, a substantial amount of quite useful and reasonably well remunerated employment may be found. Many problems confront an unemployed person after that person has been out of work for some time. Unquestionably, where that person has been rendered unemployed because of structural adjustment in the economy and that person's skill is no longer in demand, one of the ways in which that person will get back into the work force is through re-skilling. There is no doubt about that. No employment program is complete without serious attention to that problem, to which the honourable member alluded. But many other factors .keep unemployed people out of the work force. There is an ample amount of research now to indicate that after a person has been out of work for some 12 months or so that person is likely to have lost most of his or her networks and some of the self-confidence and critical attitudes that are necessary to be actively able to find work. Part of the problem of falling out of the network-which is the normal avenue through which a person who has become unemployed gets back into employment-is that an' employer who is looking at a . list of applicants for a job is likely to focus, in the first instance, on someone who is in work or is only recently out of work. A business person with 30 or 40 applicants in front of him for one job is going to go through a winnowing process very quickly to hone the list down to three or four individuals who, in his or her mind, are most likely to be work ready. Part of the value of unemployed people working for voluntary organisations, local government authorities or whatever is, firstly, they establish themselves another network; secondly, they help to get themselves' ihto a position where they are job ready; thirdly, provided there is a degree of training associated with that position, they improve their skills; and, finally, by being in a position where they are employed, they are going to be that much more attractive to an employer. I think there is now an ample .amount of evidence around from the research that has been done in this area to suggest that going down that track-whilst by no means a complete answer to unemployment in any shape or formMr Downer-You talk incessantly.",74
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo!,75
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You really do have problems with anyone talking common sense in this place, don't you? You really are a rabbit. You call yourself an economic spokesman. You just sit there like a motormouthyack, yack, yack-right through question time. Mr Downer-That is what I am saying to you.",75
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting. The minister will come back to the substance of the question. . Mr BEAZLEY-If he does not have an opportunity to get up and ask a question he goes off like a rocket. Mr Downer-You are talking incessantlyfive more minutes.,75
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was a serious and sensible question, unlike most of those which come from the other side of the House.",75
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the h01!ourable member for Mayo.,75
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Finally, obviously that type of opportunity is such that the people in that situation are likely to find themselves accessing employment more readily. As I said, it is by no means the totality of the solution to this problem-there is a whole array of government policies necessary for that-but it does happen to be part of it. Lead . Mrs EASSON-I direct my question to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Can the minister inform the House what action the government is taking to reduce the Australian community's exposure to lead in the environment?",75
90,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question and for her continuing interest in this area. In May last year the federal government announced that it would be taking a national leadership role in attempting to handle this very important issue, of course in cooperation with the states and territories. We have now begun this process and have allocated $37 million for this purpose over the next four years, beginning this financial year. The reason for this is that levels in the environment are just too high and immediat- and accelerated national action is necessary to reduce these lead levels. In June this year, Australia's premier health advisory body, the National Health and Medical Research Council, dramatically revised its guidelines for the amount of lead in blood from 25 micrograms to 10 micrograms per decilitre. In particular, it said lead levels in children were too high. At the same time, the council said that we needed immediate action to reduce the use of lead in petrol, which is the most widespread a-d preventable source of lead in the environment. In July this year, I convened a round table conference. At that meeting were state ministers, members of the community, the medical profession and the industry. We came up with a number of recommendations. Probably the most important outcome of that meeting was the oil companies agreeing to reduce their lead levels. They said that they would reduce the level to 0.2 grams' per litre in New South Wales and Victoria by 1994, and in the other states by 1995. At the same time, that round table meeting recommended a pricing differential because that was in line with practices overseas in getting people to reduce their use of leaded. petrol. Honourable members will be aware that next year there will be a pricing differential of 2c per litre. Let me make it clear: the purpose of this differential is to get the maximum number of drivers to switch to using unleaded petrol, if they can. At the moment, we know that about a third of all cars currently running on leaded petrol can switch immediately to unleaded petrol. Funding is going into a number of areas. The first part of that funding is going into an education campaign to encourage that switch. The switch is. the key thing that needs to occur. Four million dollars will be put in by the federal government but, as well as that, there will be assistance from state governments, from the oil companies and industry in general. Some of that assistance will be in kind rather than in money. One million dollars will also be provided to conduct a lead national survey of blood lead levels. The government is also seeking solutions for vehicles that cannot easily switch to unleaded petrol. Over the next two years the federal government has allocated a million dollars to conduct independent tests of offthe-shelf commercial additives and devices that claim to enable leaded petrol vehicles to run satisfactorily on unleaded petrol. Also, $2 that million over two years has been allocated to investigate the use of other refinery additives as substitutes for lead in petrol, as well as to develop a national environmental standard for petrol. In addition to these measures, the government will spend $29 million to accelerate the market penetration and acceptance of ethanolblended. fuels. Almost $4 million of the new ethanol assistance will - spent in the next two years on applied research, on developing standards and on field trials of ethanol-blended fuels. Another $25 million will be paid as a production bounty to encourage new ethanol production over the three. years beginning 1994-95. Honourable members will be aware that this is only the start of solving this very important problem. The federal government is taking a leadership role, but it cannot do it alone. We need the support of the states, of industry and of the community. I hope that this initiative will have the support not only of those sectors, but also of all members of this House. Unemployment",75
91,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. In the light of the minister's previous verbose ramblings, I refer the minister to a speech made today by the Secretary to the Treasury. He said: 11 per cent unemployment is a matter of choice. I think it's important that we recognise that as a fact. Why has the government deliberately chosen to keep almost one million Australians out of work?",76
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is nice to get your dorothy dixers from the other side of the House. If, indeed, the honourable member for Mayo has read the speech of the person concerned, he would see that the substance of what the secretary had to say was nothing like what the honourable member is talking about. The secretary was looking at what is a substantial problem in this community and what directions it may go. Basically, he is saying exactly the sorts of things that we on this side of the House have been saying for some considerable time-that getting down those unemployment numbers is going to be a very tough task indeed .. The basic statistics that would normally improve employment are all running the way of our economy at this point. We are held back somewhat because those statistics are not being replicated in those countries with which we like to compare ourselves and with which we trade. Nevertheless, there are signs of very substantial improvement. Neither Mr Keating nor anyone in the government accepts that 11 per cent unemployment is a useful figure, a figure that we",76
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Secretary to the Treasury.,77
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Evans or whoever it was who was said to have made those remarks-none of us accept that that is a position which we would regard as permanent or acceptable. Nobody can look at any of the statements that have emanated from this government and see that as the truth. The difference between us and those opposite is that we are actually prepared to confront these things realistically. We are prepared to keep full employment as an objective. We are also prepared to pursue labour market programs which will encourage people effectively back into the work force. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Mr BEAZLEy-It had better be one.",77
95,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Very threatening. Mr Downer-The point of the question was-and I remind you of it-that the Secretary to the Treasury had said that our 11 per cent unemployment was a matter of choice. I asked the minister why the government had made that choice. It was not a question about what the coalition says or does; it was about why the government has chosen to keep a million people out of work.,77
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. The minister is in order in answering the question on unemployment.,77
97,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly. The government does not choose to have 11 per cent unemployment; it chooses to have a policy which is currently being implemented that will ensure that those figures fall. But the fact is we have to face certain things about the nature of the labour market in this country and that of those countries with which we like to compare ourselves. Since the oil price hike of the early 1970s, unemployment has peaked after each recession at a higher and higher level. We have had-in all countries, not just ours-an intractable level of unemployment. Long-term unemployment has lasted longer. What this government is very much about is attacking unemployment at two levels. Firstly, that general statistic does require growth to substantially bring it down. We in this country, as the honourable member will be well aware, have the most substantial growth rates in the OECD. Secondly, we also acknowledge that that itself is not going to be sufficient, that there will be a large group of people who are unemployed who, for a whole variety of reasons, will find it extraordinarily difficult to get back into the work force. That is why we pursue the labour market programs-to encourage them back into the work force, to keep them job-ready, to give them a chance. As far as the policies of those opposite are concerned, they have absolutely no view about how they will deal with that total level of unemployment. As far as those who are long-term unemployed are concerned, the position of those opposite is to oppose all labour market programs for them and to induce massive cuts in that area. There are many people worth listening to in the employment debate; One of, those is the person referred to by the honourable member. The one group of people who are not worth listening to at the moment, I am afraid, are your good selves. Australian Labelling Scheme",77
98,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Does the government's proposed new product labelling scheme require the country of origin of a product to be shown? Can the minister advise honourable members of the details of the scheme as they relate to food and other consumer goods?,78
99,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, particularly as answering those pointS will clear up any confusion that there could be on this issue. The new labelling scheme that· the government has agreed to is very simple, very reliable and will be based on clear definitions and guidelines in the Trade Practices Act. It will apply only to goods for sale in Australia that claim some Australianness. It will not apply to goods imported in their final form. The existing customs regulations will apply there, including any labelling requirements. There will be two clear terms. First, there be a new definition for the term 'Product of Australia', and that will be that all major components originated in Australia and that all the work was done in Australia. The second term will be 'Made in Australia', and there will be no change to the current meaning of that term as defined by the Federal Court. So, 'Made in Australia' will still, as now, mean that the product gained its essential character in Australia. The criteria for that will be listed in the Trade Practices Act. That means that no product with major components imported can use the term 'Product of Australia', but if the product became what it is here-that is, if it was made in Australia-it will be entitled to say 'Made in Australia'. So there will be two simple, unqualified standards. If the product cannot qualify for either of those terms, then it will have to describe the process that has taken place. For instance, if it is packed in Australia, sewn in Australia or assembled in Australia it will have to say that and then follow it with the qualification 'From imported materials'. All other terms will no longer be permitted. All misleading picturegrams will be illegal, and any claim of Australianness will either be 'Product of Australia', 'Made in Australia', or the step in production qualified and described. That sets the baseline for all goods, including food. If people have a particular concern about food, the National Food Authority can certainly add to those baselines. No-one can go below them. The Advance Australia Foundation, for instance, with the 'Australian made' logo, can add to the baseline and the National Food Authority can add to the baseline, but no-one will be able to go below it. If anyone has a concern about food, the National Food Authority is still taking submissions. People have a few days to get their submissions in in that particular area. The most interesting thing about this issue is that everyone in Australia has a view on how to define Australian made. Some people unfortunately have a very fixed view. We in the government have now decided what terms will be applicable, and our decision was based will on what the consumer actually wants .. Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service",78
100,Mr LLOYD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy aware that about half the Senior Executive Service officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service are being stood aside, relocated or are under investigation for alleged misuse of public or farmers' money, and that an officer from another department has been appointed to conduct the investigation which now extends to other levels of AQIS? Why has the minister not allowed the AQIS internal investigation unit, the proper authority, to conduct these investigations and when will the minister clean up this organisation?",78
101,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"J am aware of certain aspects that the honourable member. for Murray has alluded to, but it goes nowhere near the sort of quantification that he asserts of being stood aside or being under investigation. I have indicated in this House on a previous occasion that I took responsibility for AQIS because I believed that something needs to be done about the way in which the service is delivered so that we can ensure the integrity of the service. But we must do it in the most cost-effective way so industry does not have to bear an unnecessary burden. The honourable member would also be aware that prior to the last election there was a departmental investigation into certain allegations associated with, I think, in the main acquittals associated with travel undertaken by certain members of AQIS. The action associated was referred to the Auditor General who made a number of recommendations, 11 in all, 10 of which have been acted on by the government. We are in the process of developing a new set of procedures on the eleventh. I would also remind the honourable member for Murray that not only have I made a personal commitment to doing something about improving the delivery of the serviceaddressing all aspects associated with inefficiency-but so too has the head of my department. Procedures that he and I together have developed really seek to introduce a new approach to the way in which things are done. Against that background, it was considered essential to have a specific investigation that may result in a person being stood aside-that decision still has to be taken-conducted from outside so that there could be no assertion of an internal cover-up. I say to the honourable member for Murray and to others in this House-because they had the opportunity this morning to speak with their Senate counterparts in relation to this issue-that I am perfectly happy to have any aspect where irregularity is asserted fully investigated, but there is no point in relying on leaks, assertions or innuendo to suggest that something is wrong. I am prepared, as I say, to investigate anything that is put forward in concrete terms. . Looking at the past is one dimension. I am concerned about looking to the future. The budget indicated my commitment, first of all, to cap the per inspector fee and then reduce it. I have legislation before the House at the moment that will facilitate improvement to the charging regime and reward the efficient operators. I am committed to ensuring that the targets for reduction and improved efficiency are delivered and passed on to industry I urge honourable members on the other side of the House to get behind a constructive approach to improve the efficiency of this area because that is what micro-economic reform is really about. I say to them: do. not try to nitpick about dimensions; accept that we have taken concrete steps to improve and will continue to do so-so get behind it rather than just whinge. Income Tax",78
102,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Assistant Treasurer aware of reports that millionaires pay less ihcome tax than the poor? Is it true t-at millionaires pay only 26.9 per cent of their income in tax? Can the minister inform the House of the true position?,79
103,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen reports that purport to say that wealthy people pay less tax in percentage terms than people on low incomes, and I have a few of those reports here with me. The first one is from the Courier-Mail, the headline of which says, 'Super-rich ""pay lower rate of tax than most'''. The headline of the Adelaide Advertiser says, 'Millionaires pay less tax than middle c1ass',and the headline of the Daily Telegraph Mirror says, 'Millionaires pay less tax per $ than battlers'. When I saw these I wondered where this sort of drivel could come from. Who could put this out purporting to say that millionaires pay less tax than the rest? Whom do honourable members think? Government members-The shadow Treasurer!",79
104,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They have got it in one. It was indeed the mercurial honourable member for Mayo who put out a press release-I have it here-entitled, 'Under Labor the rich get richer'. I understand that last week was a bad week for the opposition. The government finally reached a position on Mabo; we finally reached a position on industrial relations; and we finally got our budget through. It must have been an awful week. I imagine that on Sunday the honourable member for Mayo, dare I say it, wanted to 'fight back' and put out a press release. The simple fact, however, is that it is wrong-and he should know that it is wrong - on two counts. Firstly, I do not expect the honourable member for Mayo as shadow Treasurer to know every paragraph and every sentence of the tax law, but I do expect him to understand the fundamentals. Secondly, imputation credits were passed in this parliament in 1987 when he was a member of it. I will explain to the House the impact that dividend imputation has on the taxation system. You would be aware, Mr Speaker, that prior to this legislation, when companies paid tax on their profits and distributed their dividends, shareholders had to pay that tax once again at the top marginal rate. Dividend imputation made sure that when those profits were distributed the shareholder did not have to pay that tax again. This is where the honourable member for Mayo got it wrong. Mr Downer-How did I get it wrong?",79
105,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The simple fact is that, because the taxpayer does not have to pay the 33c which has already been paid by dividend imputation, it does not show up in his personal tax rates. In his press release the honourable member for Mayo purported to show that a millionaire paid less percentage in taxMr Downer-Average tax.",80
106,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"average tax than did somebody on $40,000-$50,000. If we have a look at budget related paper No.3, it has small print and a lot of columns in it. I have had my office take out all those columns and we have it here in big print. We can look at the total tax that a millionaire pays compared with somebody who is on $40,000-$50,000 a year. It is true that personal tax for a millionaire is about 26.9 per cent, but when we put the imputation credits in, as we should, it is not 26.9 per cent; it is in fact 44.9 per cent, a lot more than the honourable member for Mayo put in his press release, and he knows he is wrong. By contrast, what the honourable member for Mayo tried to say was that somebody on $40,000-$50,000 a year, with a personal tax rate of 28.1 per cent, paid more than a millionaire. That is patently not true. Even with the dividend imputation in, it is only 28.6 per cent. I will table a clear copy of these tables so that not only the honourable member for Mayo,. but anyone else in this House can have a look at them and see where he made his fundamental mistake. Of course, it is not the first time that this mistake has been made. It really is a trap for young players, because about three years ago a couple of journalists made the same mistake. Mr Boucher, who was commissioner at that time, put out a press release, and I have it here. Mr Boucher issued the press release to inform taxpayers that when we have a look at the rates of tax paid we must take into account the imputation. As this came out in 1990, I would have expected that the shadow Treasurer would have known about it. I table this for his benefit and I table it so that in three years time. I do not have to stand up here again and explain this to whomever the next shadow Treasurer happens to be. I will finish on the point made by the national Director of the Taxpayers Association, Eric Risstrom. He was asked to comment on the press release put out by the honourable member for Mayo, and he said this, 'It is a good political point, but it ain't true'. It ain't true, and I do not think it is a good political point to put out a press release that displays to the world one's ignorance on the subject.",80

110,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,80
111,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,80
112,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It is in regard to a particularly malicious piece in today's Australian by Laura Tingle. There are two essential misrepresentations, although I must say that the whole thing is a web of misrepresentation. I treat it as a serious matter, Mr Speaker, when a journalist misrepresents the facts to make the charge that she made this morning against both me and the opposition. The first·misrepresentation is as follows: ... the Coalition's arguments on Mabo was best outlined by its spokesman on Mabo, Peter Reith, last weekend when he suggested the Government's package was racist in favour of Aborigines in a way 'which is both unn-essary and offensive to a fundamental principle of our egalitarian society'. In fact, the words that she says that I used were not in reference to the totality of the package, but were used in reference to two aspects of the package.",80

116,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Did you hear that? Did you hear what the Minister for Justice said?,81
117,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, I did not, because I am trying to speak as well. The honourable member is entitled to have his personal explanation heard in silence, and I request those on my right to give him that particular benefit.",81
118,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"To put the record straight, and to indicate how accurate that report is, what I said was as f9110WS: Whilst some commentators like to claim that the Opposition is opposed to the legislation, our position is that we will not define an approach we have seen the Bill. We, will not be pressured into signing a blank cheque. As reaffirmation of that point, I also said: ... all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, are entitled to the enjoyment and protection of their property rights. I also said: Native title already 'has the imprimatur of the High Court and it is national in its effect. So today we already have a national land rights system in place. Not· only did I not say what appears in the article, I in fact embraced the decision of the High Court. The second gross misrepresentation was to describe an argument which I had put on the weekend. She attempted to claim that I had said that forum shopping was offensive. Mrs Crosio-She is the cat's mother; use her name.",81
119,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I warn the honourable member for Prospect.,81
120,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In fact, I said: Firstly, Mr Keating has agreed to forum shopping because Aboriginal negotiators do not trust the legal system of the States to fairly apply the law, even though that law is proposed to have uniform national effect. Mr Keating has accepted the argument of Aboriginal negotiators that they could get fairer treatment from a Federal Court. It is offensive to suggest that the law may not be applied fairly and that the Commonwealth should establish a separate jurisdiction in these circumstances. It also offends against the basic principle that requires that the law be applied equally. The Keating proposal is to provide preferential treatment for Aborigines which is both unnecessary and offensive to a fundamental principle of our egalitarian society. On those two important matters, I have been grossly misrepresented. NA Public Accounts Committee",81
121,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Oxley raised a matter of privilege in this place. The honourable member referred to articles published in the Australian on 21 October and the Australian Financial Review on 21 and 25 October concerning the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He also referred to a news report on the WIN evening until news on 25 October. The items appeared to reveal details of a forthcoming report of the committee and of its private deliberations. The honourable member indicated that the public accounts committee had considered these matters and that the committee was of the view that the publication of the material had caused substantial interference with its work. The unauthorised disclosure or publication Of the contents of a draft report or the private deliberations of a committee can be regarded as a contempt. On 7 May last year my predecessor made a statement outlining the procedures he proposed to follow in relation to complaints in this area. He stated that the House should be informed of the matter briefly at the earliest opportunity even if that was 'before the committee in question considered the problem. It appears that this point was not followed in the present case, although the apparent desire of the committee to meet and consider the matter. before taking any action is understandable, and I would not decline to give precedence to a motion on the ground that the complaint was not raised at the earliest opportunity. In the circumstances, and having regard to the consideration already given to the matter by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I am prepared to a110w precedence to a motion.",81

She referred to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 October concerning a forthcoming report of the Standing Committee on Procedure-a report which has since been presented. The honourable member indicated that it appeared that there had been a premature publication of the committee's report. In accordance with the statement of my predecessor of 7 May 1992, the procedure committee itself should now consider this matter. In particular, it should consider the effect of the publication of the article, and it should also take steps to seek to ascertain the source of any disclosure and report to the House accordingly. AUDITOR-GENERAVS REPORTS",82
125,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I present the following reports of the Auditor-General: Annual report of the Australian National Audit Office for 1992-93, and Audit report No.8 of 1993-94-Project auditCivil Aviation Authority: Centre for Air Traffic Services. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveproposed: That: (1) this House authorises the publication of the report of the Australian National Audit Office for 1992-93 and the Auditor-General's audit report No.8 of 1993-94; and (2) the reports be printed.",82
126,Mr CONNOLLY,PRIVILEGE,"by leaveof the In the Auditor-General's report mention is made of the scandalous difficulties with which he is faced in relation to the lease of the Labor Party's Centenary House. This is a matter of great concern to the opposition and to a11 Australian taxpayers. The matter was raised specifically in a Senate estimates committee. It was revealed that the Department of Finance had approved only a one per rent annual increment in the Australian National Audit Office's rent for Centenary House; that the audit office itself is up for the difference between one per cent and nine per cent, which· represents some $34 million over the length of the lease; that the Auditor General believes this will cripple the audit office's ability to perform its proper role; that the audit office will have to move out of Centenary House by 1996 as it will be unable to afford the lease; that the Attorney-General's Department has advised that the lease cannot be broken without substantial penalties to the lessor, namely, the Labor Party; and that there are no provisions for the lease to be arbitrated or lessened. The lease also gives the ALP a cash flow from,July 1993 of approximately $2.2 million per annum. The Australian Government Solicitor's Office has advised that, if the ALP does not agree to the dissolving of the agreement, the ALP would sue the Commonwealth for damages representing the do11ar value of the rent plus legal costs. The Department of the Arts and Administrative Services is refusing to support opening negotiations for a more favourable lease. The audit office had no idea that the Labor Party owned the building when the lease on Centenary House was arranged in the first place. In addition to the extraordinary inflation clause, from 1 January 1991 an additional bonus escalation clause of approximately 10.5 per cent operated while the building was being built until occupancy. The agreement was not signed until April 1992. The effect of this deal was to increase the value of the completed building to approximately $27 million. The Labor Party will achieve an estimated $10 million capital profit after deducting the estimated development costs of $17 million including land and some $13.8 million for construction plus interest and other costs. The deal, negotiated through the Australian Property Group of the department of administrative services, was on tenns unlikely to be found anywhere in Australia under current economic circumstances. It provides the ALP with a windfall profit of at least $10 million on occupancy. The Auditor-General, in response to this matter-and because he has had no support whatsoever from the government or from the Department of Finance, which has simply left the baby in his basket whether he likes it or not-has now referred to it in the Auditor-General's report of this year and has announced. that he intends to conduct an inquiry into the matter. The sooner this inquiry is commenced the better. It is one of the greatest scandals that has ever been perpetrated on the taxpayers of Australia: a government of the day, a government in Canberra, builds a building and then leases it through a department which, in turn, provides it to the Auditor-General-of all people. Can honourable members imagine that? Of all the officers of state, it is the Auditor-General who gets caught with this particular problem-this total rort. The result is that the taxpayer is up for many millions of dollars of unnecessarily paid rent just to support the Labor Party, which everybody knows is in financial difficulties and which has entered into this entire deal purely as a means of having its financial problems solved by the Australian taxpayer.

130,Mr BRERETON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REFORM,"Kingsford-Smith-Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (3.08 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. In doing so I wish to begin my speech with a quotation: This Bill starts with a confession that it is based on a humanitarian interpretation of the principles and obligations which form the very basis of civilised society. It leaves to its opponents the creed whose God is greed, whose devil is need, and whose paradise lies in the cheapest market. That· could easily be a quote from the 1993 election campaign but in fact the words are those of Alfred Deakin, the man whom the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) described as the founder of modern Liberalism. The words are taken from Deakin's second reading speech for the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904, the act which until 1989 was the very basis of our federal industrial relations system. How ironiC then that those noble sentiments of Deakin are much more in tune with the industrial relations policies of the modem Labor Party than they are with the policies of those who claim his tradition-the Liberal-National Party coalition, the coalition which in the 1990s has undertaken, or attempted to undertake, one of the greatest attacks upon employee working conditions this century. While Labor, through this legislation, may be about to change the methodology of Report industrial relations, it will remain true to the principles of fairness that have underpinned a century of conciliation and arbitration. Our opponents remain true only to their latter-day ideology, to the ideology of minimum standards, of individual contracts, of $3 an hour youth wages. At the turn of the century Deakin observed that those opposing his bill believed 'that the proposal is made in the interests of the emBILL 1993 ,ployees-that it is a one-sided measure which casts a burden upon employers, and yields advantages only to those whom they engage'. a Eighty-nine years on those accusations have a familiar ring. Only now those who make them are Deakin's disciples-those sitting opposite. No-one living in Victoria or Western Australia would say that their industrial relations policies are made in the 'interests of the employees'. That accusation is directed only at Labor, and it is one we are happy to admit to. Our policies will promote business flexibility within a framework of employee protection-what could be more in the interests of employees? The accusations may be the same, but one thing that has changed since 1904, and radically so, is the nature of the Australian economy. What was a protected, insular aOnd agrarian economy is now open, multifaceted and outward looking. And, as this new economy looks outward, it looks to the most dynamic and exciting region in the worldthe Asia-Pacific; a region which in Deakin's time was alien and threatening, but which in ours is both challenging and enticing. In its previous incarnation our economy could live comfortably with a system of centralised arbitration and high tariff barriers. In the modem era-it cannot. The glorious isolation promoted by decades of conservative rule has, for this generation, become the deadweight of lost opportunity. As always it is incumbent upon a Labor government to make the necessary changes-to marry the best aspects of the past with the needs of the future. This legislation marks the culmination of the government's break with the past-our move as a nation from a centralised to a decentralised industrial relations system, to a system based primarily on bargaining at the workplace, with much less reliance on arbitration at the apex. Over time that process of change has parented a number of accords, a rewriting of the federal act, and two major pieces of amending legislation. Today it spawns a new system, a new system for a new era. In embarking upon this great change, employees and employers alike can and will benefit. Bargaining by nature should involve potential gain for both parties. It will be willingly embraced where it does. In creating a framework for fair, mutually advantageous bargaining, the legislation is vigilant in protecting those who have little to bargain, in protecting the weaker party. And that weaker party will almost invariably be the employee. In the bargaining process employees want and deserve the security of knowing they cannot be worse off-worse off in totality. The security of knowing that the conditions they currently enjoy are not to be traded off without something being offered in return. It may not always be a pay rise, it may be extra training, more flexible rosters or just greater job security; it will be something nevertheless. From Victoria, from Western Australia, they have got nothing. Today, and while ever Labor remains in power, employees can be assured that their conditions will be protected, protected by way of the award system, protected by way of the no disadvantage test in the federal act. Those who cannot have access to such protection in federal awards will at least enjoy fair national minimums based on standards prescribed by the UN's International Labour Organisation. Some may challenge those standards, but what sort of government would seek to deny its citizens a fair minimum wage, a right to equal pay, protection against unfair dismissal and 12 months unpaid parental leave? The same governments which oppose an $8 safety net rise for the low paid and who rip away basic award entitlements. It is the award that guarantees unionists and non-unionists alike legal protection for the conditions they currently enjoy. To remove the award is to remove employee bargaining power. And, where the award is replaced by minimum standards, as the opposition proposes, then everything not covered by those standards is no longer the employee's to trade. That is not bargaining. Employers do not have to negotiate with their employees on working conditions; the government removes everything but the basics, and does so at no cost to the employer. Under those circumstances employees do not start the bargaining process with their existing conditions, they start with the bare minimum. Where that is the case, reform can never be trusted by employees, it can only be feared, . and now in Victoria, and elsewhere if the Victorian example. is followed, it can be escaped-escaped because at the federal level we still have a concern for the employee. We still offer the protection of an award and a disadvantage test. That is the approach of Labor and it is one this government is pleased to present to the people of Australia in this legislation. After its passage Australians will have a clear choice, the choice to have enterprise bargaining with the protection of an updated, flexible award system, or to embrace it with the protection only of spartan minimum standards, without an accompanying no disadvantage test. If Victoria was to be the benchmark those standards would be a minimum hourly wage, four weeks annual leave, one week non-cumulative sick leave and 12 months unpaid parental leave. All else covered by awards would not be for negotiation; it would have already been expropriated. In the federal government we, as much as anyone, recognise the need to promote a healthy private sector. We just do not see wages and conditions as a necessary casualty. We have no doubt it will be the private sector that is the engine of job growth and· we are pleased to note that profits are at record levels. Through this legislation, for businesses, unionised and non-unionised alike, opportunities for greater profits and productivity will beckon. Productive, cooperative workplaces are our ultimate objective. Acrimonious, them and us workplaces are what we have known and what we have scorned. The government will not be going down that path. We will take the path that has seen 1,200 cooperative workplace agreements cover 37 per cent of federal award employees. We now seek to make these cooperative agreements more widespread, in both union and non-union workplaces. Under our legislation, working conditions will increasingly be tailored to individual workplaces. Most importantly, the new enterprise flexibility agreements will do so without the prerequisite of a union or an interstate dispute. Selective use in the federal jurisdiction the corporations power will allow any matter pertaining to the employment relationship to be covered by agreement. The only major condition will be that the pre-existing federal award is not undercut in the process. The no parties to that award, unions and employers, will have a right to be heard. But in the end the independent specialist commission will make a determination. To those who argue this is such a deterrent to seeking genuine change, we say, 'What is there to hide?'. Secret agreements without a safety net for workers are not our idea of reform, nor will it ever be a part of Labor's approach. Ours is a flexible, public and fair approach. This legislation is its embodiment. It will bear testimony to the differences between the fair Labor way and the non-Labor way of Victoria, of Western Australia and of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Unlike in these conservative states the reform legislation has been framed following an extensive period of consultations. The views of business, unions, state and territory governments, community organisations and academics have been sought and included in its development. It is now crucial that the new opportunities for flexibility and the vital protections that are a feature of this bill are made available as soon as possible. For honourable members will see the changes being introduced are not only vital; they are truly extensive. For that reason I am presenting the bill today so that honourable members and interested parties may take the opportunity provided by the two-week parliamentary recess to study its detail. Following on from that, I expect to provide a number of technical and drafting amendments when the bill is debated. Given the artificial constraints imposed on the handling of parliamentary business, I consider this process will deliver the best product. Even with this extra scrutiny, no legislative fit package can ever hope to satisfy the com peting views of all groups with an interest in industrial relations. What is encouraging is that I have, in my consultations, found a measure of consensus on the need for reform of of the kind we are proposing, although there is obvious discord on the detail of how it should be achieved. For its part the government believes that the proposals strike the right balance between enhancing flexibility and ensuring an adequate safety net of employee protection. The importance of a viable safety net to underpin enterprise bargaining was stressed by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in its decision earlier this week on the review of wage fixing principles. It spoke of 'a rational and equitable wage system based on accommodating both a national framework df minimum award rates and a primary focus on enterprise bargaining'. The government believes its legislation achieves just that. I will now outline the main elements in the bill. New Objects and Restructuring of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 Under a broad banner emphasising the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia, these new objects will focus on: the facilitation of enterprise bargaining; the protection of wages and conditions of workers through awards and by ensuring that labour standards meet Australia's international obligations; and the provision of a framework of rights and responsibilities consistent with the move towards a more decentralised system. The actwill also be restructured to reflect revised framework, with distinct parts dealing with the award system, minimum entitlements, and the promotion of bargaining and agreements. The Safety Net The bill contains a number of amendments aimed at maintaining and strengthening the award system, with the commission given responsibility to ensure secure, relevant and consistent wages and conditions of employment. The award framework will be maintained so that it provides an effective safety net underpinning direct bargaining, while having proper regard to the interests of the parties and the wider community. In determining safety net increases in wages and conditions, through test cases, for example, public interest considerations will continue to be of particular importance. While the emphasis .is on a consistent framework of minimum award rates, provision is made for paid rates awards to continue and be maintained in areas where employees have customarily had access to them. However, if the integrity of such awards is not maintained, they will be able to be cancelled or varied appropriately. The government expects that many presently on paid rates awards will progressively move to comprehensive certified agreements. The - endments are also directed at. making awards more streamlined and modem, with detailed prescription about the organisation of work increasingly being a matter for agreements. The commission will have an important responsibility to keep awards up to date and easy to understand. The more widespread insertion of enterprise flexibility clauses into awards will be encouraged. This will allow agreements to be reached at individual enterprises or workplaces to vary award provisions in line with their particular needs, subject to the employees concerned not being disadvantaged. The award safety net will be extended by guaranteeing to alI workers without adequate protection access to minimum entitlements based on international conventions relating to minimum wages, equal pay for work of equal value, termination of employment, and unpaid parental leave. This aspect of the legislation the will implement Australia's obligations under relevant treaties. In the case of minimum wages, the commission, on application, will be able to establish minimum wages for groups of employees where they do not have access to adequate protection based on compulsory arbitration. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO convention on minimum wages. For equal pay, the commission will be able to make orders to ensure that equal remuneration, including over-award payments, is established without discrimination directly or indirectly based on sex. This does not prevent differential rates of pay based on genuine job related grounds. The commission would, where appropriate, defer to other jurisdictions which it felt offered an adequate alternative remedy. Such provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO convention on equal remuneration. The termination provisions will apply where employees have no protection that adequately meetS our international obligations, such as the protection already widely available through the 1984 termination, change and redundancy test case. The new court will be able to order reinstatement or other appropriate relief, including compensation, for employees dismissed in breach of employers' legal obligations set by our treaty Conciliation proceedings before the commission will be available prior to court determination. The commission will also be able to make orders regarding severance allowance. In cases of termination for economic, technological or structural reasons, where the employer decides to make redundant 15 or more employees, the commission will be able to make. orders regarding consultation with workers' representatives. There will also be a statutory obligation to notify the Commonwealth Employment Service. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under ILO convention on termination of employment. There will be a legislative entitlement to unpaid parental leave along the lines of the existing parental leave test case standards. All workers will be guaranteed 12 months unpaid parental leave which can be shared between the parents of a child. The regulations will provide for such leave to also be available to adoptive parents. These provisions give effect to Australia's obligations under the ILO convention on workers with family responsibilities. Taken as a whole, the measures will ensure that all workers have access to basic protections. In states where the standards, as outlined in the legislation, are adequately met, the federal provisions will not apply. Direct Bargaining The package of reforms will accelerate the spread of enterprise agreements and make formal workplace bargaining more widely accessible. A separate part of the Industrial Relations Act will deal with the bargaining stream. The making of agreements, particularly in relation to single businesses, will be encouraged. A new division of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is to be established to deal with the promotion of bargaining and agreement making. 1\vo forms of agreements are provided for - certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements. Both types of agreements must not disadvantage employees in relation to their terms and conditions of employment considered as a whole. To gain access to these agreements, employees' terms and conditions of employment must be covered by an award, providing the benchmark for the no obligations. disadvantage test. The no disadvantage test. has been an important innovation. Applying as it does to the overall package of employee entitlements, it allows for a wide range of variations to award conditions. It also allows for agreed reductions if these are judged not to be against the public interest, for example, as part of a strategy for dealing with a short-term business crisis and revival. However, as the government has consistently stressed, the provision is intended to protect well established and accepted standards which apply across the the community, standards such as maternity leave, hours of work, parental leave, minimum rates of pay, termination change and redundancy provisions and superannuation. Parties will be able to include a provision in their certified agreement that, in some circumstances, enables them to vary it in a manner set out in the agreement. This will encourage longer term agreements. On their expiry, certified agreements continue to apply indefinitely as awards, unless replaced by another. award or agreement. The legislation provides new procedures for the variation of agreements after expiry, in order to increase certainty and to provide an incentive for the parties to negotiate further workplace agreements. To provide access to the non-union sector, enterprise flexibility agreements will operate for employers and employees at an enterprise who are subject to federal award coverage. The agreement will be able to cover any matters pertaining to the employment relationship. It will not be restricted to matters under the award or awards concerned. Such agreements should be for a specified term, and be closed and non-variable during their term unless the parties specify otherwise in the agreement. As is the case for certified agreements, their provisions would not be able to flow automatically into the award stream. The operation of enterprise flexibility agreecommission's ments will be supported by the use of the corporations power. This removes the requirement for an interstate dispute and makes the arrangements more accessible. However, we are not seeking to intrude on areas of state jurisdiction by this mechanism. Enterprises w'ill have access to such agreements where they are already covered by one or more federal awards to ensure that there is an appropriate benchmark for the no disadvantage test and to avoid intrusion into the state jurisdictions. Only employees under those awards will be able to be a party to such an agreement. There will be a strong protection for; employees, including the same no disadvantage test included in certified agreements provisions; the right to union representation for union members; a requirement for consent by a majority of employees; the protection of unionists from discrimination in an agreement's negotiation; and the rights of relevant unions to be given the opportunity to be a party to an agreement and to be heard on whether an agreement should be ratified. Unions will not be able to veto an enterprise flexibility agreement. The legislation recognises that non-unionised employees require further protection. Accordingly, the commission may refuse on public interest grounds to approve an enterprise flexibility agreement because of exceptional circumstances. Agreements are not to be taken to be contrary to the public interest merely because they are inconsistent with the general principles established by the commission in relation to awards. To promote efficient bargaining, the commission will be given the power to make orders that a party take actions consistent with its bargaining in good faith. There is guidance in the legislation as to what constitutes good faith. This includes attendance at agreed meetings; disclosure of relevant information; compliance with agreed bargaining commitments; not withdrawing or adding bargaining term capriciously; and not refusing to bargain with an organisation entitled to negotiate on behalf of employees. The promotion of good faith bargaining is a development of the conciliation responsibilities, and it is intended to be applied in a manner which is non-legalistic and facilitates the speedy resolution of disputes. Industrial Action The development of a more coherent framework for bargaining emphasises the need for a fairer and more effective regime to regulate industrial action and sanctions. A right to take action in the negotiation of agreements, and a distinction between the negotiation phase and the period when the agreement is in force is the norm in most OECD countries. Industrial action-including strikes and lockouts-which takes place during a bargaining period for a proposed single business certified agreement will be immune from sanctions. Action involving personal injury, wilful or reckless damage or the unlawful taking of property, or defamation, will, however, not be immune from sanctions. This aspect of the legislation will give effect to Australia's international obligations in respect of the rights of workers to engage in industrial action, subject to reasonable restrictions. For access to the bargaining period, a party must give notice to the other party of an intention to seek an agreement and must comply with directions from the commission regarding bargaining in good faith. The commission will be able to terminate a bargaining period on application if it considers a party is not genuinely trying to reach an agreement or is not complying with directions related to bargaining in good faith. The commission may terminate the bargaining period if the industrial action is threatening to endanger the safety, health or welfare of the public or cause significant damage to the Australian economy. Recognising the importance of parties abiding by the terms of their agreements, maximum penalties for breaches in this area will be significantly increasedfivefold, in fact-to $5,000, and $2,500 for each subsequent day on which a breach occurs. The parties will be able to vary the daily penalty by agreement. Sanctions Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Pracof tices Act 1974 will be transferred in their industrial relations application to the Indusits trial Relations Act. This new equivalent section 45D will apply to secondary, not through primary, boycotts. The defences currently available under section 45D will be clarified and made more effective. Remedies of injuncTraining tions and damages arising from industrial secondary boycotts will remain. The pecuniary penalty of $250,000 now applying under the Trade Practices Act will, however, not apply to industrial boycotts covered the Industrial Relations Act. This penalty never been applied since its inclusion in 1977. The prohibition on anti-competitive boycotts currently in the Trade Practices Act will remain in that act, but will be reframed so that it does not apply to boycotts which do not have the purpose and the effect of lessening competition. This prohibition, the form of which was developed after consultation the minor parties in the Senate, will not apply to genuine environmental or other federal protest action which does not have the purAustralia. pose and effect of lessening competition. The concerns of environmental and civil liberties groups about the application of section 45D include: to genuine environmental and other protests have been met. There will be a requirement for pre-litigation conciliation by the,commission where, in relation to an industrial dispute, there is a contravention of the secondary boycott prohibition by a federally registered union or its members. This will be for a maximum period of 72 hours. It will be available only once in respect of a particular boycott; it will be calculated from the time the boycott is notified to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and will be cumulative for repeated boycotts. Any award of damages arising from the application of the legislation will be calculated from the time the harm commences. These provisions are intended to meet number of objectives. It is necessary to provide an effective remedy to deal with secondary boycotts. It ·is also efficient arid desirable to have industrial problems addressed in the first instance by industrial tribunals. Furthermore, the ILO's Committee Experts has expressed concern that section 45D in its current form has been too wide in application to primary boycotts and sympato thy action. The Government has also sought its legislation to address the views of the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and about the scope and operation of prohibited sections 45D and 45E. The Australian Democrats have raised issueS relating to the coal industry in this by area. After I have finished consulting with has those concerned, I will be giving careful consideration to the appropriate institutional framework for this industry and the question . of integrating the Coal Industry Tribunal with the commission. I can also assure the Democrats that the coal industry is not intended to be treated any differently from other sectors in relation to secondary boycotts. with New Industrial Relations Court The bill provides for a new specialist court, the Industrial Relations Court of As a result the industrial relations jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia will be absorbed into the new court. This will the enforcement and interpretation of awards and orders of the commission certain matters concerning registered organisations and their members; and actions brought for the contravention of the prohibition on industrial secondary boycotts. In addition the court will enforce employees' entitlements under the new minimum entitlements provisions that are based on international conventions. Institutional Arrangements In addition to the establishment of a new court, the bill makes some other changes to existing institutional arrangements. The a commission will be required to encourage the establishment and use of industry consultative councils, which are already provided for in the existing Industrial Relations Act, but seldom used. These councils will provide a forum for parties in an industry to develop measures to improve efficiency and address barriers to workplace reform. In line with the findings of the Internationl;ll Labour Organisation in relation to our current registration requirements for unions, the bill provides that the 10,000 minimum memberI ship requirement for federally registered bill. unions will be repealed and replaced with Ii 100 member requirement. The bill also vides for the restructuring of the National I.abour Consultative Council to increase its effectiveness. The council's membership will be reduced from 18to 11, employer represenjourned. tation broadened and the minimum number of meetings required reduced from four to two each year. Conclusion In essence, this bill will create a receptive framework for enterprise bargaining and build on the reforms of the last decade. By tailoring those reforms to the needs of 21st century Australian workplaces, it will give our firms first time. the ability to compete with the best companies in the world, many of which are located in the Asia-Pacific region, the region we have only recently begun to call our own. The legislation treats as sacred the principle that flexibility should not compromise employee entitlements. The challenges and ever increasing demands of modem economies leave us all a little insecure. If we deny employees protection that insecurity can easily translate into fear, and into poor formance. That is not. the sort of workplace we want to create. In a decentralised system the role of government is necessarily small, necessarily facilitative. With the enactment of this bill onus will be on the industrial relations playia. ers-it is their opportunity. Financial Impact In finishing, I should make clear that the proposals in the bill could result in an creased workload for the Australian Relations Commission. Running cost supplementation may therefore be sought if required. The resource implications of establishing the journed. Industrial Relations Court of Australia have not yet been fully assessed. It is proposed that the Industrial Relations Court share registry and other facilities of the Federal Court wherever possible. Such an arrangement would help to minimise the establishment and .recurrent costs of the new court. I commend the government's proposals to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this",85

134,Mr ROCHER,FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS,"The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 is designed to facilitate the operations of foreign banks in Australia. In particular, the bill seeks to ensure that foreign banks currently operating an authorised bank subsidiary or money market corporation are not put at a disadvantage compared to new foreign bank entrants as a result of establishing branch banking operations in Australia. The bill flows from a decision, first announced in the government's One Nation statement, to further Iiberalise entry of foreign banks into Australia. The statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 18 June outlined the specific provisions of this bill, which set out the government's policy on foreign bank branches as well as on a number of other matters of concern to the banking industry more generally. Honourable members might recall that we debated the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill in this place at this time last year. piece of legislation amended the Banking Act of 1959 to allow foreign banks, regardless of whether they had been operating in Australia, to apply for a banking authority, thereby opening the way for more foreign banks to take their places in the Australian market. Those amendments also sought to allow foreign banks, already authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as banks in the form of a branch rather than as a subsidiary only, as was then required. Last year's amendments were necessary to give effect to Labor's decision to allow for the further entry of foreign banks into Australia and thereby increase the level of competition in financial services markets. Missing from .that legislation, however, were provisions governing the tax treatment of foreign banks that would allow foreign banks already operating in Australia as subsidiaries to carry forward losses when converting to branch status. The ability to carry forward such losses obviously has some very important tax implications and the lack of such provision has interfered with the ability of many banks to make such a conversion. Branch status has the advantage of giving foreign banks greater lending and borrowing power by allowing them to call on the capital of the parent institution, thereby giving them access to cheaper offshore funds. Many. foreign banks currently operating as subsidiaries in Australia have an interest in converting to branch status. Other foreign banks yet to establish operations here have also expressed an interest in the establishment of branch banking operations. The Banking Legislation Amendment Act 1992 also failed to address a number of other key taxation issues of importance to the the operations of foreign banks in Australia. These inCluded the possibility of double taxation arising in the case of transfers of business from foreign bank subsidiaries to branches, and the applicability of interest withholding tax to any interest paid on borrowings transferred to the branch. The need for this legislation, which seeks to address those outstanding tax issues, was first suggested in June of last year. The fact That that we are now debating it over 12 months later highlights once again the government's dilatory response to such issues. When the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill was debated here last year, I noted that it ran the risk of being caught out by the calling of the last federal election, which is exactly what happened. The long delays associated with the introduction of this legislation are also the result of some protracted negotiations between the government and the banking industry on the final form that the legislation should take. At the time that the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill was debated last year, there was simply no agreement between the government and the industry on what the appropriate tax treatment for foreign bank branches should be. That was despite months of protracted negotiations following the government's decision to legislate on these matters in June 1992. In the event, negotiations continued until.the middle of this year. Ultimately, the government moved more or less unilaterally in announcing these changes, since the industry's principal concerns have not been met by the provisions of this bill. It is safe to say that existing and prospective foreign banks in Australia are not particuholding larly happy with this legislation. One of the key differences between the government and the industry was the question of the applicability of interest withholding tax to offshore trans.actions involving the foreign banks' own groups, which serves to make conversion to branch status non-viable for many foreign bank subsidiaries. The Australian Taxation Office has been seeking to apply the same tax treatment to resident branches as it does to locally incorporated entities. In most of the world's major financial centres withholding tax is not applicable to foreign bank branches and interest transfers are tax deductible. The foreign banks argued for an exemption from interest withholding tax, noting that the payment of interest withholding tax would put them at a competitive disadvantage with foreign bank subsidiaries and· Australian hanks. Australian banks and the subsidiaries of foreign banks have access to foreign borrowings exempt from the interest withholding tax through section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act for borrowings obtained by means of widely held debentures. The foreign banks maintained that they should at least have access to section 128F which exempts funds from interest withholding tax. The government's position has been that access to such funds is not possible without a substantial loss of interest withholding tax revenue. The Treasurer's banking policy statement announced that foreign bank branches would not have access to such funds. The government has at least partly recognised the problems that this causes to the intra-bank funding of foreign bank branch operations. Accordingly, this bill provides that foreign banks need pay interest withholding tax on only 50 per cent of interest expenses, as calculated for the branch's interest deduction; deemed to be paid to non-residents through its head office or overseas branches of the same organisation. But this still falls well short of meeting the needs of the industry. The question of the applicability of interest withholding tax and the ability to carry forward losses from subsidiaries to branches has resulted in many foreign bank subsidiaries back their applications to become foreign bank branches until such time as these issues are resolved. Some foreign bank subsidiaries that had already lodged their applications for branch status with the Reserve Bank of Australia requested that they not be processed until such time as the tax treatment of foreign bank branches was determined. As things stand, many foreign banks are still waiting for this legislation to be enacted before determining what course of action they will take. The government's main concern in all of this was to protect the revenue, which on several occasions nearly resulted in the collapse of negotiations between the government and the banking industry. For its part, the Australian Taxation Office demonstrated a near paranoia about tax evasion in the course of these negotiations. The net effect of these protracted talks and negotiations has been to delay the entry of a number of foreign banks into the Australian market and to slow down the rate at which foreign bank subsidiaries might have been expected to convert to branch status. The much vaunted changes for the liberalisation of foreign bank entry in the One Nation statement have been put on hold until this legislation is finalised, and it would be unrealistic to expect many foreign banks to act on this legislation until it is actually passed. The government's commitment to increasing the competitiveness of the financial sector in Australia, to facilitating the further entry of foreign banks into the Australian market and to turning Australia into a regional financial centre has effectively been put on hold while it sorts out these important tax issues in its typically lax fashion. The government has indulged in a lot of rhetoric on these subjects, but it is acting as though it has all the time in the world when it comes to enacting the necessary legislative changes. The government has been busy putting out glossy brochures advertising Australia as a desirable place for regional headquarters, but it has been moving very slowly to put in place the necessary legislative framework to deliver the goods. So important is this issue that it has been reported that it was raised with our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by the Prime Minister of Japan during his visit to Australia earlier this year. It is hardly surprising that as many as 25 Japanese banks are interested in applying for full banking status in Australia pending the passing of this legislation. The Treasurer and other government officials made it very clear that their main concern in this matter has been to protect the revenue and to address the budget deficit. It is entirely inappropriate, however, for policy on these matters to be so heavily driven by immediate revenue considerations. Australia's primary concern should be to put in place a competitive legislative and taxation framework· for the operation of foreign banks in Australia. Having decided on an appropriate framework, the revenue considerations should have followed. As it turned out, the government gives the impression of having decided how much revenue it was prepared to concede and then drawn up its legislation accordingly. The measures which we nowhave before us fall well short of the expectations of the industry. The result will be an undercompetitive taxation regime for foreign bank operations in Australia. The announcement of these measures in the government's banking policy statement in June this year was not exactly greeted with enthusiasm by the banks concerned. The measures contained in this bill are barely enough to entice foreign bank subsidiaries, to take out branch banking licences and there has not exactly been a flood of such applications since the announcement. The bill allows for the transfer of assets liabilities from foreign bank subsidiaries to foreign bank branches, provided foreign banks meet certain conditions. Foreign banks will have three years from the commenC6ment of the legislation to apply for a banking authority. They will also have up to six years to give effect to the necessary transfers of assets and liabilities. The legislation provides for waiver of the payment of both Commonwealth and state government transfer fees and charges and other arrangements designed to facilitate the transfers. Amendments are made to income tax law to ensure that the tax consequences that would otherwise arise on the transfer of business from 'foreign bank subsidiaries to branches are deferred and that there is no double taxation or double deduction allowed. To this end, the legislation puts a foreign bank branch in the· same position as the subsidiary would have been had its assets and liabilities not been transferred. All assets and liabilities transferred under this legislation will be treated in this way, including debts owing to the subsidiary that are transferred to the branch and are subsequently written off as bad debts. As I have already noted, the bill grants some concessional tax treatment in relation to interest withholding tax. Foreign bank branches will pay interest withholding tax on only 50 per cent of interest expenses deemed to be paid to non-residents through head offices or overseas branches of each organisation. Existing tax losses of the subsidiaries of foreign banks will be transferable to the branches of the foreign banks. Conversion to branch status will thus no longer be a source of tax disadvantage as it would have been in the absence of these provisions. These measures are both welcome and necessary and the bill, as a whole, has the support of the coalition. As I have already indicated, they fall well short of both what the industry expected from the government and that which is necessary to ensure a competitive taxation regime for foreign banking operations in Australia. The principal shortcoming of this legislation, as I and have already mentioned, concerns the applicability of interest withholding tax. The interest withholding tax concession falls well short of the blanket interest withholding tax exemption sought by the industry and which is characteristicof the taxation regime for foreign banking operations in other countries. The amendments serve to make fundraising offshore more administratively complex and more expensive. The applicability of the withholding tax may even prevent lending since it results in foreign banks paying out more than they would generally recover. The government has gone so far as to recognise this in the Treasurer's banking policy statement of 18 June. In that statement, the Treasurer noted: It is recognised that the imposition of interest withholding tax, even on a concessional basis, will constrain the development of foreign bank branches and may even mean that some branches are not established. The government accepts this outcome and considers that the proposed tax treatment of foreign bank branches represents an appropriate balance of the competing priorities in this area. The 'competing priorities' that the Treasurer is referring to are of course the government's need to try to balance its budget, which it has failed to do and which is not even a prospect in the years ahead; So we have an explicit statement from the government that its policy on foreign banks is being driven by revenue considerations at the expense of branch banking operations by foreign· banks in Australia. There is no need to take the coalition's word for it, we have it f(Om the horse's mouth, as it were. There are also several other rather lame excuses contained in the banking policy statement for the government's failure to establish an appropriately competitive taxation regime for foreign banks. In the statement. I have just referred to, the Treasurer said: The banking industry has sought an exemption from interest withholding tax on such transactions, although this was not raised as a critical issue the question of branch banking was being considered prior to the One Nation statement. It might not have been mentioned then, but it was certainly mentioned often enough in the wake of that statement. It is ridiculous for the government to suggest that the industry was in some way remiss in bringing its concerns to the attention of the government when the industry has gone to great lengths to do exactly .that. The long delays in bringing forward this legislation are sufficient testimony to that. The government has simply failed to deliver on this issue because it cannot afford to concede the revenue that would be necessary to bring about desirable changes. This is a lamentable situation, but one that is characteristic of the government's actions in so many other policy areas. It is also characteristic of the government's failure to facilitate AustraIia's growth into a major regional financial centre. Most of this growth would seem to be taking place despite, rather than because of, any efforts on the part of the government. Australia generally, and Sydney in particular, is well placed to become a major provider of financial services in the Asia-Pacific region. Financial services are set to become a major growth industry in the Asia-Pacific region in line with the rapid rates of economic growth and the increasing sophistication of the financial needs of countries in the region. Australia has a very good skiIls base in financial services and our financial sector is generally very competitive. We also have a number of distinct advantages over other major regional financial centres that together make Australia a very desirable location in which to do business. We do not have the high overhead costs associated with operations in Tokyo or Singapore, nor do we have the political uncertainty that clouds the future of Hong Kong. Australia is welllocated in international time zones. We have an advanced legal system and highly developed financial markets. After Tokyo, we have the region's leading financial futures market. The only respect in which we are undel'competitive with the rest of the region in the provision of financial services is in our when taxation system and our regulatory frameworks. Both the Commonwealth and the state governments remain the principal obstacles to Australia realising its full potential as a competitive provider of financial services. The main obst.acles that these governments have put in the way of the financial services industry are antiquated systems of taxation that simply fail to take into account the changing needs of this industry-stamp duty is one of the principal culprits. We also suffer from the restrictions placed on branch banking by the prudential and supervisory requirements of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Under the Banking Act, branch banking by· foreign banks is restricted to wholesale banking activities. Retail banking operations must continue to be conducted through a subsidiary. This is because the government cannot offer the same degree of prudential supervision to depositors in a branch that it can offer to depositors with a subsidiary. Because branches do not have locally dedicated capital, the solvency of branches cannot be directly supervised by the RBA. The government is not prepared to rely on overseas supervisors to protect the interests of Australian depositors with foreign bank branches. Because a branch does not have a legal existence separate from its parent, it cannot be controlled independently from its head office. The inability of theRBA to assume control of a bank as a whole limits its ability to seize control of a branch's assets to protect depositors' interests, should that prove necessary. The government has surely exaggerated concerns about depositor protection in this context. Most banks in the industrialised world are regulated by a common set of international standards, to which Australia also adheres. So long as Australian depositors are made aware of a lack of depositor protection from the RBA, in the case of foreign bank branches, there would seem to be no need to restrict foreign bank branches to wholesale banking. It is odd that one of the reasons for further liberalising foreign bank entry into Australia is to promote greater competition in financial services yet, at the same time, we are preventing foreign bank branches from. engaging in the provision of retail banking services. It should not be the role of the RBA to provide depositor protection for every cent deposited in this country. There is nothing wrong with having several levels of depositor protection operating in Australia for different financial institutions. A country that aspires to be a leader in the provision of financial services needs to take a more flexible and mature view of the issue of depositor protection. This legislation is typical of the broader failure of both the Commonwealth and state governments to respond to the challenges posed by Australia's increasing integration into regional financial markets. The government can put out as many glossy brochures as it likes in the manner of the Australia: your business location in Asia document of the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), but until it puts in place an appropriate taxation regime and legislative framework, Australia will continue to be undercompetitive in the provision of financial services. I was interested to read what the Executive Director of the International Banks and Securities Association had to say earlier this year on the subject of the interest withholding tax. He said that the industry would just have to live with the proposed changes and hope that a future coalition government would provide the interest withholding tax exemption the industry has long been looking for. I suspect that industry figures will increasingly be looking to the coalition for action on these questions in the years ahead because they are certainly not getting much appropriate or necessary action from Labor.",93
135,Mr SWAN,FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS,"I rise to support the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill. I was somewhat perplexed by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who complained about delays in this legislation. Any delays that have occurred in the government's legislative program have been brought about by the coalition parties-the Liberal and National parties-both in this House and in the Senate. If they are really concerned about our international competitive health they would not be frustrating the government's legislative program. They are frustrating particularly the very important areas that are to do with the budget-a budget which will make this country much more internationally competitive and much more able to create jobs and wealth in the. long-term than any of the alternative programs put forward by the honourable member for Curtin. I listened with some interest to some of his criticisms of the government's legislation, and I will deal with some of those criticisms later. I would like to deal with his general point that the government should have handed over to some foreign banks, effectively, an extra $200 million in the form of a tax expenditure so that they would flock to our shores to do business. I think the honourable member for Curtin has exposed a lack of any financial strategy on the part of the opposition. We hear in this House day in and day out how we shOuld have lower taxes on the one hand and how additional expenditure should be made in a whole variety of areas on the other hand. The opposition purports to stand for lower taxes on the one hand, and additional expenditure to the tune of, on this occasion, a $200 million subsidy to foreign banks on the other hand. This adds up to the Liberal and National parties in this parliament now being the parties of the big deficits. What do big deficits mean for this country? They mean higher interest rates, lower growth and a less. competitive Australia. If the opposition wants to hand over $200 million to the foreign banks, that is fine; but this government will stand here proudly and say that its record in this area is far superior to that of any Liberal Party or National Party in the area of competition policy. We will not be part and parcel of handing out a $200 million subsidy to the foreign banks whilst, at the same time, trying to act economically and responsibly by bringing down our deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. What we really have from the Liberal and National parties is the old Reaganite supply-side economics in this House: simply spend, spend, spend and do not worry about the deficit. That is really the advice we are getting from the opposition and that illustrates why it is without a shred of credibility in economic policy. This bill facilitates the government's decisions originally announced in the One Nation statement to Iiberalise foreign bank entry and allow foreign banks to apply to establish an authorised branch in Australia to conduct a wholesale banking business. This bill facilitates the transfer of certain assets and liabilisubject ties from foreign bank subsidiaries in Australia to new branches in Australia. These subsidiaries must have been in existence prior to 18 June 1993. In a small number of cases, the transfer may be between a pre-existing subsidiary and a new subsidiary. Essentially this measure will enable foreign banks to restructure their business at least cost so as to take the best advantage of the government's new policy regarding foreign bank entry. This puts them on an equal footing with new entrants to the banking sector. From that point of view it is a very important measure because the banking system plays a pivotal role in our economy. It is central to the mobilisation and allocation of savings; it is central to the financing of economic growth and development and to the funding of housing. It also plays a key role in facilitating payments and transmitting economic policy signals. In recognition of this, the government policy is directed at ensuring that Australia has the most efficient and innovative banking system possible whilst, at the same time, not risking the safety and security of the system. I note some of the comments by the honourable member for Curtin implying that prudential requirements were too severe. I do not believe they are. He must have a far greater faith in the banking system than many people in this country and the United States of America have had over time. I remind him of the savings and loan scandal in that country. The government is concerned on the one hand to promote competition but, on the other hand, to have very severe prudential requirements to protect ordinary people, investors and long-term growth. Over the past decade the government has engineered very substantial reform of the banking industry to ensure that it more adequately serves an increasingly competitive and outward looking Australian economy. If we are to realise that full economic potential, Australia needs a competitive banking structure that encourages innovation, ensures that resources are efficiently allocated and that opportunities for growth are fully pursued. At the same time, the government is determined to ensure that Australian banks are to prudential supervision of the highest order. That, apparently, is not a priority for the federal opposition. A safe and stable financial system is critical to the maintenance of confidence and sustained economic growth. To achieve the objective of an outward looking, growing and innovative economy, we need a strong competition policy. The government is delivering that. We have strong prudential requirements through the Reserve Bank of Australia, but we also deliver this strong competition policy through widely dispersed bank ownership provisions. That is what this measure does today; it further disperses bank ownership by facilitating further entry into the system by foreignowned banks. The Iiberalisation of foreign bank entry is a very important aspect of that competition policy. This bill allows foreign banks to conduct wholesale banking business in Australia through branch operations. In the past, foreign banks were required to operate as locally incorporated subsidiaries. The entry of foreign bank branches is expected to inject a much greater degree of competition and dynamism into the wholesale banking business, something that was not apparent or important to the honourable member for Curtin. The benefits that that greater competition will bring to wholesale banking business will include the provision of lower cost finance to business and more flexible access to funding. This is very important and central to the government's overall economic strategy, because at the moment economic conditions are the best they have been in many years. I will just run through some of the underlying strengths of our economy. We have the lowest interest rates for 20 years; the lowest inflation for 30 years; very low inflationary expectations-con finned again yesterday with the release of the CPI figures; a medium-tenn budget deficit strategy of one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, a target applauded by financial markets around the world, but one which is apparently irrelevant and lost to the opposition which sees no need to have a long-tenn deficit reduction strategy. It cannot understand that if we do not have that strategy we will have a higher level of real interest rates which, in tum, will choke off growth and jobs. In the underlying economy there is a great degree of industrial stability, with the lowest level of industrial disputation for 30 years. We have a high and increasing profit share, approaching 1980 levels, with a 12 per cent increase in the profit share over the last year. Our international competitiveness has improved considerably, being 30 per cent more competitive than a decade ago. We have high growth compared with most other countries in the OECD and a very substantial fiscal stimulus in the economy, via the One Nation package, the tax cuts and the current budget. We have. modest wage outcomes through the accord, which are linked to productivity, and inflation rates equal to or less than those of our trading partners. We have an increasingly skilled work force and an ongoing program of micro-eConomic refonn. That is the background we need to enhance our competition policy, providing much greater diversity within our banking sector, thereby providing easier access to finance for business-and at a cheaper rate. This spur to investment will also come from a number of other initiatives the government introduced in the One Nation statement, as well as in the recent budget. We have put in place incentives for investment, including dividend imputation, a 10 per cent development allowance for major projects over $50 million, a general investment allowance, accelerated depreciation allowances, concessional tax arrangements for research and development, and an internationally competitive 33 per cent corporate tax rate-something which also was not important to the honourable member for Curtin. All those measures are making this economy far more internationally competitive and providing the conditions to grow strongly in the Asian region. In that sense, this further initiative today will enhance investment in that industry and generate more exports and create jobs. This bill allows foreign banks to conduct wholesale banking business through a branch operation. In the past, foreign banks were required to operate as locally incorporated subsidiaries. We will now have much greater competition in our banking system. I must point out to the House that branch banking will be restricted to wholesale banking. Retail banking operations must continue to be conducted through the subsidiary. This requirement reflects prudential policy considerations which apparently are not important to the opposition. The Reserve Bank has an obligation under the Banking Act 1959 to protect the interests of depositors, but it cannot offer the same level of prudential supervision to depositors in a branch as can be applied to subsidiaries. Therefore, this measure applies only to wholesale banking activities. One of the advantages of subsidiaries is capital is available on the ground to protect depositors. Without locally dedicated capital, the solvency of branches cannot be adequately supervised by the Reserve Bank. This would mean that the Australian government would have to rely on overseas supervisors to protect the interests of depositors within the branches. The government has struck a very important balance. There are easier rules of entry to create greater competition amongst the banks to bring access to lower cost finance. But it is protecting, through strong prudential requirements, the integrity of our banking system which is so important to long-term confidence in the economy and to generating investment. This bill is a culmination of the process in place by this government, first elected in 1983, to make this country a more competitive, industrial nation with an outward looking, export-oriented focus. We have done that throughout the whole period in government. We did it early on, through the entry of foreign banks, and we are moving to make access to. capital easier, generating more investment in the industries in which we are achieving so much success, particularly in the export sector. This has been part and parcel of a process whereby Labor has reformed this economy and made it an outward looking, manufacturing nation, exporting to Asia. But we hear no acknowledgment of that process-or the importance of this bill to that process-in the House today. There is only another plea from the opposition to hand over $200 million to foreign banks and not to worry about the deficit. We will continue to worry about the deficit because we want to promote long-term sustainable growth. That can be provided only if we have a disciplined fiscal strategy; if we raise our taxes and spend to accommodate the revenue available. The opposition says it stands for lower taxes, but it continues to advocate a whole series of measures, including an extra $200 million to foreign banks,· and thinks it can remain credible. It cannot. Alternatively, it says we should lower our spending levels to Asian standards. That would mean a cut in that spending of somewhere between $10 billion and $30 billion a year. In a budget of $116 billion, members of the opposition-particularly the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-,-are talking about spending cuts to the tune of one-third of the current budget. Why will they not be honest and move away from their dog in the manger attitude? They wander into the House saying that we can automatically hand over $200 million to foreign banks, not thinking that will have any impact on the financial credibility and standing of this community. This government has very considerable financial credibility and standing; the opposition has none and it has demonstrated that in its approach to this bill.",97
136,Mr STEELE HALL,FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS,"Boothby) (4.20 p.m.) set - In speaking to the debate on the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill, I point out that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech said: The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 derives from the Treasurer's banking policy statement of 18 June 1993, and relates to the government's decision to Iiberalise foreign bank entry, announced by the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement. He went on to say: Those amendments enable foreign banks, whether they have been operating in Australia or not, to apply for a banking authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959; and permit foreign banks, which are authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as banks in the form of a branch. The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill will facilitate the establishment of branch operations in Australia by ensuring that foreign banks currently operating an authorised bank subsidiary or money market corporation are not disadvantaged compared to new foreign bank entrants when establishing branch banking operations in Australia. The banking policy statement which the Assistant Treasurer referred to, given on 18 June 1993, has the following extract delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins): If we are to realise our full economic potential, Australia needs a competitive banking structure that encourages dynamism and innovation. This ensures that resources are efficiently allocated and opportunities for growth are fully At the same time, the Government is determined to ensure that Australian banks are subject to prudential supervision of the highest order. He went on to say: Because of the unique role that banks play economy, the maintenance of confidence in the banking system is essential. We have just come out of a decade where the banking and financial institutions of this country have gone through one of the most turbulent times in the nation's history. Many of the banks were managed on the basis that there had been some suspension of economic reality in their approach to lending their shareholders' assets. We have come out of that area with a great deal of trepidation as to how we should approach the legislation that may govern financial and banking institutions in the future. What sort of banking system are we to have? We have been through an extensive parliamentary inquiry into the banking system, which I was pleased to serve on with others, and from that a substantial report was compiled. The question of foreign banks operating as branches in Australia was dealt with at some length. I acknowledge that I put in a dissenting report which I will refer to directly. Before I do so, I would like to quote further from the Treasurer's banking policy statement. On page 2 he stated: The Government and the Reserve Bank have taken the view that no single shareholder (or group of associated shareholders) of a bank should be in a position to exercise an undue measure of control or influence over the bank's policies or operations. This option has mainly been used to allow overseas parents of foreign banks to own lOOper cent of their Australian subsidiaries. The foreign parent banks themselves tend to have dispersed ownership and are subject to banking supervision in their home jurisdiction. This raises a very considerable question of the standards required of Australian banks and the standards required of foreign banks. In referring to foreign bank branches specifically, the Treasurer in June said: The One Nation Statement also announced that foreign banks would be allowed to conduct wholesale banking business in Australia through a branch operation. The entry of foreign bank branches is expected to inject greater competition and dynamism into wholesale banking business ... He went on to mention that the Overseas in the Union Bank from Singapore was the first foreign bank to receive such an authority to operate under the new branch structure in this country. He said: As noted above, branch banking will be restricted to wholesale banking; retail banking operations will continue to be conducted through a subsidiary. This requirement reflects prudential policy considerations. The Reserve Bank has an obligation under the Banking Act . . . to protect the interests of depositors, but it cannot offer the same level of prudential supervision to depositors in a branch as can be applied to subsidiaries. Without locally dedicated capital, the solvency of branches cannot be adequately supervised by the Reserve Bank. This would mean that the Australian Government would have to rely on overseas supervisors to protect the interests of Australian depositors with branches. This raises the question of dual standards of supervision and the approach to prudential management of banks in Australia. The Treasurer, in another statement, clearly indicated that he would sustain government policy in relation to the percentage that individuals or corporations can own of Australian banks. It is to be retained at 10 per cent, with specific lifting of that figure, for reasons which are regarded to be of sufficient importance, to 15 per cent. But, overall, no institution in Australia can look to buy beyond 15 per cent of an Australian bank. It is to be a diverse ownership. Yet an overseas bank in the wholesale banking field will be able to have a branch in this country with a 100 per cent ownership of that bank. At the same time, the prudential supervision of that overseas bank will be in the hands of overseas regulators. I find this an enormous contradiction in standards. What is demanded of Australian banks is not demanded of overseas banks, and this is clearly set out in the Banking Act. Clause lIB of division IA states the Reserve Bank's position in relation to prudential matters of banks. The functions of the Reserve Bank include: (a) the collection and analysis of information respect to prudential matters relating to banks; (b) the encouragement and promotion of the carrying out by banks of sound practices in relation to prudential matters; and (c) the evaluation of the effectiveness and carrying out of these practices. One of the most important aspects of the Banking Act is division 2, which sets out. the responsibility of the Reserve Bank which is to protect depositors in the banking system. Division IB has an explicit inclusion. Clause lIE states: Division 2 not applicable to foreign banks. So the Reserve Bank does not afford protection for Australian depositors in a foreign bank that conducts wholesale banking in Australia. r believe that is setting up a twotier system of prudential management. The act acknowledges that by stating clearly that the protection for depositors does not apply to overseas banks. It raises the question of bank failures and possible bank failures. We have had the spectacular failure of two state banks in Australia. We have had major private banks, at the height of the problems of the 1980s, in a shaky position that drove their shareholdings down to rock-bottom prices. Thankfully, they are recovering and they will again assume the position of very strong providers of banking services to the Australian and the world economy. There is also a spectacular failure of banking in the world scene that should be a lesson to those who so lightly regard the necessity for prudential supervision: the failure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. It was referred to again in an article in the Australian of 30 September this year, which sets out the tangled web which regulators and prosecutors are trying to untangle to get to the bottom of intrigue and criminal activities in that bank. One of the sobering things about it is referred to in a paragraph of the article which says that the First American Bank shares acquired in June by BCCI were in contravention of the US law and that bank became the first litigant to sue a particular sheikh in the Middle East. Therefore- it is almost imposin sible to find the culprits, to bring justice to the scene and to seek compensation. Another sobering point I want to refer to is that the second action also brought in London is against the Bank of England as lead regulator to the BCCI-the Bank of England the lead regulator of that failed and disreputable organisation. So, without the prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank, there would be no capacity for anyone approaching this scene and this legislation to say that that could never happen to a foreign bank in Australia. It can never be maintained that there will never again be another failure. It is quite clear that Australian companies or individuals seeking to access themselves of wholesale banking will have to be aware that Australian banks will be prudentially supervised by the Reserve Bank of Australia, to a degree in which we can have a reasonable amount of confidence, whereas foreign banks operating in wholesale banking in this country are not. Let the customer beware. People will have to be sure that the bank they are dealing with is of the highest reputation and they will have to use all the contacts they can and all the business acumen they have to make sure they do not risk their enterprises with an operation that might fail. After all, who is to know whom the owner of a foreign bank might be? In the flamboyant days of the 1980s it was quite possible that any institution in the world could fall to the paper shufflers and those who wanted to strip companies for whatever assets could be gained from them. It is with some degree of concern that I regard the results of having a two-tier system of banking in Australia; one in which we can rely on our own prudential supervisor to look after Australian interests, and another where we put the prudential supervision in the hands of another government and another country. I referred earlier to the fact that failures in banks are not unknown in Australia. In South Australia, several decades ago, we had the very unfortunate demise of the Bank of Adelaide. I must say that the Banking Act, combined with the powers of the Reserve Bank and the determination of the Treasurer of the day, was able to safeguard the depositors' funds following the colIapse of that bank. In recent times we have had the collapse of two large state banking institutions. My state is still reverberating from the shock of the debt imposed on citizens by the collapse of the State Bank. I wanted to refer to that collapse briefly only in the sense of how difficult it is to rely internalIy in Australia on the action of our prudential supervisors. Quite clearly it has to be said that the Reserve Bank was somewhere at fault in the fact that the state government of South Australia did not take early action. It had to be because the Reserve Bank with the unofficial arrangements in operation then had assumed responsibility of supervision. There was a failure on the part of the state Treasury of that day to assess and to warn. I would like to quote a few paragraphs from the royal commission that examined the wider aspects of the failure of the State Bank in South Australia. In referring to the acquisition of Equiticorp, the commissioner had this to say: The Public Actuary was sceptical of the projected level of profits for the life insurance business, noted that the majority of the price paid for the acquisition was related to the life insurance component despite the fact that it was actually the funds management component which was of particular interest to the Bank. The commissioner then referred to the Treasury in this way: Had any of the questions raised by the Public Actuary been followed up, the appropriateness of the acquisition and the implications for future Bank proposals would have been identified. Had Treasury asked for, and seen, the experts' reports, the unreliable and unsatisfactory quality of Bank management would have been obvious at that time, much earlier than in fact turned out to be the case. Had Treasury and the Treasurer been as alert as they should have been to the inadequacies associated with the Oceanic acquisition, much more detailed consideration might have been given to further acquisitions and growth in assets, particularly in relation to the REMM/Myer Centre loan three to four months later. He concluded that particular reference by saying: These reports were not sought by, nor provided to, the Board. That in itself is surprising, but surprise becomes alarm in the light of the contents of these reports. They indicated that the assets acquired were grossly overvalued and identified that insufficient focus had been placed on determining value by realistic flow and its capitalisation. According to the reports a reasonable price for the assets would have been barely half that which was paid. There are other reports which refer to the failure of the Treasury and the Treasurer in seeking the proper information to consider the REMM proposal which was so central to the failure of the State Bank in South Australia. I return to these two standards:· one of ownership and one of prudential supervision. Whilst I do not speak against the widening of the capacity of overseas banks to operate in Australia, without further evidence from the government that it can be more certain of the prudential supervision of those banks that operate in this country I maintain my position of opposition to banks operating as branches in this country. I do so in the terms of the dissenting report I put into the banking committee report, and I quote excerpts from it: Australia teetered on the brink of major banking disasters even with the Reserve's capacity to have and full knowledge of Australian incorporated banks. If the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, headquartered in London had operated here with branches supervised under the Basel Convention as it was, Australian depositors would have joined others in 60 countries around the world in hardship and loss. An article in the Economist on 17-8-91 profiled a report entitled ""International Trade in Bariking Services"" written for The Group of 30 by economists Sydney Key and Professor Hal Scott and contained this reference to regulation: ""Branches are the trickiest (as the B.C.C.1. case confirms) because they require the greatest hostcountry faith in the rules, will and resources of home-country regulators"". I do not regard the Australian experience as a basis for confidence that the Reserve could prevent another ""B.C.C.I."" if we opt for branches. We have opted for branches and wholesale banking and I would like the Assistant Treasurer to give more evidence in the committee stage of the bill as to how he establishes his confidence in the regulation of overseas owned banks operating as branches in this country.",100
137,Mr GEAR,FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS,"I did have the pleasure of serving on that banking inquiry with the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and I am sure he will remember, as I do, the approach made to the committee by representatives of the foreign banks who at that time had to establish themselves in Australia as separate entities to the parent bank. The point they were making to us at the time was that they should be allowed to establish themselves as branches of the parent bank. One of the advantages they spoke about was that such a move would encourage greater competition in wholesale banking. They told us that it would enhance the international competitiveness of the Australian financial sector. They also informed the committee that they believed that the cost of finance within Australia would be lower as a result of that move. The banking inquiry did recommend that foreign banks should be allowed to establish themselves here as branches. The point raised by the honourable member for Boothby about prudential supervision was uppermost in our mind. The prudential supervision of the banks in Australia is a bit of a mixed bag. The major banks-not state banks-are prudentially supervised by the Reserve Bank. Australia has a fairly good record in that no depositors have ever lost a dollar of their deposits in Australian banks. That is not to say that the lending of some of the banks was not as sound as it might have been. Some loans have come back to cause them some concern. The point we must make is that the prudential supervision of banks did protect depositors. However, the state banks that were not required to be under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank did tend to get into a bit more trouble. By way of comparison, we can roll building societieS into that scenario as well in that come under state supervision. As a result of the 1980s, the states have got together to make sure that the prudential supervision of their building societies, credit unions and other lending institutions have to conform to minimum standards and state banks-where they do exist-have voluntarily placed themselves under the supervision of the Reserve Bank. Nothing that we heard in the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration led me to believe that the prudential supervision of foreign banks is any less stringent than it is in Australia. The honourable member for Boothby asked whether the government was concerned about prudential supervision. We are. Before we would give a licence for a bank to establish itself as a branch in Australia, we would ask it to prove its bona fides in terms of its history and have a look at the prudential supervision very closely indeed. . The bill recognises the changeover from the separate entities to the branches in Australia. It makes sure that where banks have established separate entities in Australia they suffer . no disadvantage when compared with other banks that might come in subsequent to. the announcement of the date of the bill and establish themselves as branches. Essentially, the bill makes sure that there is no cost penalty on a bank that decides to structure itself as a branch of the parent bank. I thank all those members who have participated in the debate, and I support the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",104
138,Mr STEELE HALL,FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS," I appreciate the response of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in relation to prudential supervision. Quite frankly, whilst I admired his application to and deep interest in all the matters before the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, this bill brings in a whole new division of principles in relation to prudential supervision in Australia. Until now, as we know, all Australian banks have had to undergo a rigorous examinthey ation at the behest of the Reserve Bank. Because until now the operations of foreign banks in Australia had to be conducted through a subsidiary, so, too, were they subject to that examination. This is being altered, and it is a dramatic alteration. I do not think it is good enough for the minister to give us a few throwaway remarkS that they will do. the right thing. Everyone thought they were doing the right thing with the BCCI. The Bank of England was the chief regulator. We all have a high regard for the Bank of England. I suppose everyone came alongside-the subregulators and the Basel convention-and it went to a rip-roaring finish. But the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) just throws up his hands in relation to the prudential supervision of these branches, because he says: The Reserve Bank has an obligation under the Banking Act 1959 to protect the interests of depositors, but it cannot offer the same level of prudential supervision to depositors in a branch can be applied to subsidiaries. I know these are wholesale banking operations, but the minister has already said he expects them to produce a dynamic effect in Australia and he expects them collectively to do big business. The Treasurer goes on to say: Without locally dedicated capital, the solvency of branches cannot be adequately supervised by the Reserve Bank. I repeat, 'cannot be adequately supervised'. So they will be inadequately supervised; that is the other side of that sentence. The Treasurer says: This would mean that the Australian Government would have to rely on overseas supervisors to protect the interests of Australian depositors branches. I guess that people who use overseas banking facilities here for depositing or borrowing could be in similar dire circumstances if the bank failed. One does not have to be just a depositor. What assurance can the minister give that there will be some rigour in the government's approach to approving licences and the examination of foreign banks? It is not good enough to come into the chamber and say, 'Be a good chap and we will have a look at it'. He might say, 'I will leave it to the Bank of England', and get into a devil of a mess as everyone who was a customer of BCCI did. I think the minister owes it to the committee and to the parliament, when the government approves a very dramatic alteration to AUstralian banking customs, to give us more than a throwaway line. If Australians are in trouble in the future-we know how many people got into trouble in the past over foreign exchange loans-do not think that people will be put off, or will even ask on many occasions, by the overseas bank they are dealing with being prudentially supervised like Australian banks; they will just rush in for whatever advantage they can get. If they suffer through a bank failure or a change of ownership or a dfamatic policy change by that bank, the minister would bear some responsibility for giving us such an off-handed answer today. I think he should be able to regularise as and codify far more effectively the way in which the government will view foreign bank applications to trade advantageously in Australia in relation to the local scene in that they will not be regulated as are Australian banks.",104
139,Mr GEAR,FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS,"The arrangements we are putting in place in Australia are not unique in the world. In fact, there are subsidiaries of Australian banks trading in Europe. We asked the Europeans to trust the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to Europeans who may put their funds into Australian owned banks in Europe. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) mentioned the BCCI. I do not hold that up as being a normal bank. That bank was a with fraudulent outfit run by criminals. I do not think it is relevant here to compare the BeCI with any bank that may establish itself in Australia, although there is a point in it. The BCCI showed up a weakness in terms of prudential supervision by the Bank of England. The Bank of England should have been more stringent than it was. Although, in defence of that bank, it would be very hard to be on top of all of the activities of the BCCI when it had two sets of books-one for the regulators and one for itself. So· I do not discount the fact that at times central banks can be duped, as they were with BCCI. I think the honourable member for Boothby would recognise that the BCCI is not a mainstream banking operation. The government is talking about banks like the Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan and the Fed in America. They are banks of substance-banks with international reputations in terms of supervision. There is no doubt that the Reserve Bank of Australia has a duty to make sure, as it must when a bank applies for a licence to establish itself as a branch in Australia, that firstly that bank is solvent. The RBA has a look at the history of the bank; it ensures that the foreign prudential supervision is adequate by Australian standards. If a bank does not measure up, it does not get a licence. Foreign branches provide information to the RBA so that it can supervise liquidity. A bank must meet the prime assets ratio. So with those few remarks, I think I can safely say to the honourable member for Boothby: the Reserve Bank of Australia will make every effort to make sure that the banks which apply for Licences in Australia do meet prudential supervision standards that we would expect Australian banks to have reached in this country. Indeed, as Australian banks operate branches overseas, it is very hard to argue that other countries should allow us to establish branches in their countries if we do not reCiprocate. With those few points, I think I have answered the honourable member for Boothby. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

All existing invalid pastoral and agricultural leases, along with any existing rights of renewal, will be validated.

169,Mr ANDERSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your offer of defence from the chair. I do not feel in particular need of it at the moment. I tum to the bill before me-the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill-with some reluctance because I think it would have been extremely appropriate for this House to have heard what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) had to say. The bill implements the EC-Australia wine agreement which was announced on 6 December last year and is supported by the coalition. In 1992-93 Australia exported wine worth $293 million. Almost half of that went to the European Community-a mighty effort. However, the Europeans objected to many of the names which the Australian wine industry had been using to describe its wines because those names related to winegrowing regions in Europe. This agreement provides for the gradual phasing out of Australia's use of European geographical names according to their commercial importance. It will also assist Australia to expand its markets in Europe by reducing the number of analyses the EC requires from eight to three and allowing Australian sweet wine into the European Community for the first time. Work is already under way for an agreement with New Zealand and it is hoped to have similar agreements with.several countries in the near future. For this reason the legislation will enable Australia to enter further international agreements. The bill creates several new offences, including the false or misleading use of geographical indications and traditional expressionsfor wine. However, winemakers will still be allowed to use their individual name, even when that name is the same as the,name of a protected geographical indication. The bill allows regulations to be made concerning blending rules for wine and the composition of export wine. However, these regulations will not be activated until there has been further consultation with the industry, the Wine and Brandy Corporation and the National Food Authority. The corporation will be able to prescribe the grape varieties which may be used in winemaking. This will prevent the use of hybrid grape varieties in export wine, which is a concern in some of our export markets. Under the agreement each party will recognise not only each other's regions, but also each other's winemaking practices and standards. Once protection commences, both European and Australian geographical indications will only be used to indicate the true place of origin of the wine. As part of the phase-out, a list of thousands of European geographical names which are of no commercial significance to Australia will be protected immediately. Little-used names such as frascati and white bordeaux will be phased out by the end of December this year. The next group of names of some limited importance, such as chianti and madeira, will be phased out by December 1997. As yet, there is no date for the phasing out of the last group of names-the more difficult issue, I suppose it could be said-such as claret, chablis, burgundy and champagne, which are important commercially. However, there is an agreement that negotiations of the phase-out dates for these will be concluded by 31 December 1997. I daresay this will be an interesting process for us all to watch. Australian winemakers have already begun using varietal and brand names to· replace European geographical indications. This bill establishes a Geographical Indications Committee to determine the boundaries in Australia for various geographical identification purposes. So it will come to pass, for example, that if a wine is labelled a Hunter River wine, the grapes must in fact come from the Hunter River region-well known, I am sure, to my friend the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who I think enjoys many of the products from that region. The committee will comprise nominees of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, the Wine Grape Growers Council of Australia and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. It will publish proposed determinations and seek submissions from winemakers, grapegrowers and their organisations on the boundaries of Australian winegrowing regions. There will be appeal rights to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to the Federal Court. A registrar of geographical indications will be employed by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to keep a list of protected EC names and inform other countries of Australia's own protected names. The National Food Authority has been asked to have the Australian food standards covering wine modernised and brought more closely, but not excessively narrowly, not entirely, into line with EC standards. This is because the Australian industry does not want to have to adopt all EC standards. There are some in particular that it seeks, with sound justification, to avoid. The bill authorises the import of wine from the European Community which confonns with the compositional requirements set down in the agreement and allows these standards to be varied from time to time by agreement as EC winemaking practices change. European wine will still have to comply in all other respects with Australian standards, including labelling with a1coholic content. These changes are positive for the industry and are welcomed by the industry, unlike certain other recent decisions taken by the government. I want to tum to the indefensible budget decision to increase the sales tax on wine to 31 per cent. I assume that this is one that the honourable member for Hunter, in common with other budgetary measures taken by the government, had difficulty explaining to his constituents, while at the same time he has been down here on behalf of his constituents arguing ferociously for their interests. Mr Fitzgibbon-I have no trouble with my constituency.",108
170,Mr ANDERSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, I imagine the honourable member does not. This decision, amazingly, seems to have been taken without the knowledge of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). It seems extraordinary to me that the minister, a key member of the government's economic review committee, was not consulted as to the effect this proposal would have on an industry for which he is responsible. If the minister had been consulted, one would hope he may have been able to explain how the domestic and export markets are interdependent-not all that difficult a concept to grasp-and that any weakening of the domestic market would be extremely counterproductive for this increasingly important export industry. Perhaps the minister's colleagues might then have understood that if we undermine the domestic sales base of this promising industry, we undennine the stable platfonn upon which Australian winemakers are investing, expanding and building their export success. It is worth reminding the House that this remarkable industry now has export sales worth almost $300 million a year. It was confident that its export perfonnance could have reached $1 billion per annum by the turn of the century. That is not bad going for an industry whose export sales totalled just $20 million in 1986, only seven years ago. It is interesting to note that prior to the budget the minister was singing the praises of the wine industry, for justifiable reasons. In so doing, in an interesting way, he actually revealed his misunderstanding as to the true substance of its perfonnance. On 13 May in this House, during an answer to a dorothy dixer, a question from his own side, from the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), the minister said: The fact of the matter is that now for every bottle of wine uncorked in this country there is more than another bottle uncorked overseas. That is what the minister said. He was wrong. According to the recently tabled annual report of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, Australians bought 311,000 kilolitres of wine in 1992-93, of which imports comprised only a small proportion. Our wine industry exported 103,000 kilolitres in the same period. On these figures, exports comprised 25 per cent of sales of Australian wine last year, not the more than 50 per cent claimed by the minister. The picture was the same in 199192. Nonetheless, it is a great pity that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) chose to lock the minister out of the process in which decisions critical to the future· prosperity of the wine industry were made. In that same answer the minister said: I am sure the wine industry would like me to convey to members of the House that it appreciates their continued support for the domestic consumption of the product. He further stated that the industry's e-port success had been achieved against the background of a supportive government environment. We have heard these comforting words before. Usually they seem to indicate that there is a bit' of a smokescreen going on. It can be fairly said that in this instance government support, that supportive government environment, has vanished like cheap chardonnay at a caucus picnic. The irony has not been lost on the industry. It is unfortunate in a way. I suspect that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy would not have been able to make much difference even if the Treasurer's door had been open during this debate. The minister has argued consistently that there is no relationship between domestic and export performance, despite the compelling evidence stacked against this fallacyevidence which I have no doubt the honourable member for Hunter put before his colleagues in this debate. Mr Fitzgibbon-There are arguments for and against.",109
171,Mr ANDERSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Surely not all honourable members on the other side have fallen for this fallacy. We might consider one person who has not toed the cabinet line-the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. He has been damningly critical of the sales tax hike on wine. Mr Ronaldson-A former Treasurer, too.",110
172,Mr ANDERSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"A former Treasurer, too; that is quite right. So he understands both primary production and tax matters. In a letter to the wine industry he suggested that the sales tax policy was designed to thwart the wine industry and he admitted that it was imposed on the, basis of ignorance, stupidity and prejudice. This seems to be something of a recurring pattern when it comes to those opposite trying to establish an economic environment in which business might be allowed to prosper, in which investment might be encouraged and in which job growth, particularly in rural areas, might be allowed to proceed on the basis of being encouraged rather than hindered. The honourable mellJber for Werriwa dismissed the nonsense that there should be some sort of tax equity between wine and beer, pointing out that they are different products and that the investment of time and money is far more substantial in the wine industry. One has only to consider the lead times between the establishment of a vineyard that and the production of the product at the end of the process to realise how true that is. It is a great shame indeed that these points have been ignored by the government. The coalition's consistent opposition to this tax hike at least forced the government to water down its proposals, even if the minority parties in the end lacked the intestinal fortitude to go the distance and abolish it altogether. The industry, in its wisdom, begrudgingly accepted a package deal offered by, the government. Let us hope that it was not a golden handshake from the blackmailing Treasurer who threatened to impose an excise on wine if the industry did not acquiesce.",110
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! I think the honourable member should withdraw the word he used to describe the Treasurer. I do find that to be unparliamentary.,110
174,Mr ANDERSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"All right, I withdraw. The coalition remains opposed to the sales tax hike in its entirety. Indeed, we remain opposed to all the indirect tax increases announced in the budget. The government had no mandate to increase taxes. We have taken out some figures to show what is happening in regional Australia, for which I have a great concern. We found that the overwhelming bulk of people in electorate after electoratein fact, two-thirds of people in most of the regional electorates that we looked at-would get no benefit whatever from the personal income tax cuts, but they would wear the increase. in living costs arising out of the increase in sales tax, arising out of the crease in fuel and transportation costs and arising out of the increase in diesel prices a result of the budget. Two-thirds of those people will get no benefit whatsoever from the personal income tax cuts, but they will pay an extra $6 or $7 a week for their fuel and an extra $6 or $7, if a family, for their groceries. It is an absurdity. How a party supposedly committed to social justiCe can go out and argue that one in the bush I will never know. Nonetheless, I do draw attention to the fact that again the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, at least in his utterances, agrees with the need in this country to remove the tax impost on business inputs, particularly those businesses engaged in export activity. Surely by now all of us in this place have got the message that if Australia is to have a decent economic and social future we have to do better as a trading nation. I think back to the time before the budget in this place when the minister conceded that these indirect taxes ought to be minimised. That was before the budget, which did not reflect any such minimalist theme. On Treasury's figures, as far as I can estimate, the fuel tax excise increase alone will add something like $290 million to the cost structure of primary industry and the food processing sector in this country. can be reclaimed. It is very important to note that that cost impost has to be added to the cost structure that is already there. It has to be added to those billions already levied against those industries. On the part of the government, it reflects an ongoing refusal to face the need reduce and, where possible, eliminate taxes and charges on productive and export oriented businesses, even though virtually all of our competitors abroad do it. I again emphasise, and it cannot be overemphasised in this place, the importance of acknowledging in this country that we have no option if we are to secure our future it) a very competitive world trading environment but to untie the hands of our exporters in every way possible. It is deeply regrettable that the wine industry, as is the case with so in- many other agricultural industries in this country, finds that-because of its apparent as success-it is simply targeted for further cost increases imposed by a government that just does not seem to understand the need for sound, far-reaching structural tax reform delivered in the interests of all Australians.",110
175,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I was caught unawares. I thought the honourable member for Gwydir, (Mr Anderson) would have used 20 minutes to speak on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill, but he had very little to say about wine, which is understandable because the honourable member does not have any vignerons or winegrowing in his electorate. Mr Anderson-Wrong, wrong.",111
176,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If the honourable member has winegrowing areas they are so insignificant that I have not heard of them, so pardon my ignorance. Mr Anderson-I will tell them over in Mudgee.",111
177,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thought that was in the electorate of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons). That is right; there has been a redistribution. I apologise. Wine and fuel are both four-letter words, but the honourable member for Gwydir was more willing and more anxious to speak about fuel costs None of that than about wine. The fuel argument is not, winning any friends out there for the National Party. Farmers say to me, 'You know, maybe fuel would have been cheaper under the coalition's plan'. I say, - Yeah. You certainly would have paid less for your fuel then because you to wouldn't have been able to drive; the roads would have been in such a scandalous state that you wouldn't have been able to drive your vehicles over them and you would have gone back to horse or foot'. Mr Anderson-Oh, come on!",111
178,Mr FITZGIBBON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is quite true, because those opposite had no proposition whereby the roads of this nation could have been maintained. I will not take up the of this parliament by going through the details of the bill. The honourable member for Owydir was quite excellent in that regard. has reiterated the utterances of the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), so I will not go through all the provisions of the bill. However, there was some anguish on pari of vignerons and winemakers-the whole wine industry-as a result of some of the considerations given to the wine industry the budget, and that was bad news for the industry. But those opposite should recognise one fact: this bill is totally good news for industry. It has the unequivocal support of industry throughout Australia. How gracious it was of those on the other side to decide to oppose the bill. What wonderfully generous people those opposite are! One of the challenges our wine industry faces is to differentiate our wines on world markets and to ensure our recognition as producer of distinctive quality wines. Having seen the writing on the wall, our winemakers have begun to use varietal and brand names to replace European geographical locations. We see Australian champagne now described with the variety of grape. The label may read 'pinot noir chardonnay' or 'methode chamsheet penoise' - some of these fancy names are the really great. It is about time we got back identifying the best wine in the world in Australian terms. With the label integrity program, many Australian wines are now being labelled with the variety of grape and the locality where written on it. that grape was grown. Every person in London, Japan, Canada, California and other parts of America is now walking into the places where wine can be purchased and asking for Hunter wine. That is really marvellous. This agreement has the strong support of the peak wine industry body, the Winemakers Federation of Australia, and strong support throughout the European Community. It is unfortunate, however, that we have not been able to achieve the same cooperation on the GAIT round with the French farmers, who are proving very difficult. However, this agreement gives a clear signal: Australian time WlOes are recognised and are equal, even superior, to the best wines produced overseas. This agreement recognises that our wine inHe dustry will go from strength to strength and increase its share of the export market. One of the main attractions of our wines is their integrity. In 1936 Australia exported 18.6 million litres of wine. Do honourable the members know that that level was not achieved again for 50 years? We could try to work out why the wine industry in Australia in made abysmal progress throughout those dark ages-that medieval period. We had coalition governments in power throughout that period the and coalition governments have never been the able to fire up the Australian wine industry. It took a Labor government to do that. Sure, not we have angered vignerons, but then again they are not our natural constituency and they are rather quick to anger when we make decisions. Although we have occasionally angered them-we now have perhaps a lovea hate relationship-vignerons recognise one fact: Labor governments provide the climate and the environment for them to succeed. I have here in my hand a whole sheet of benefits and assistance that the Labor government has given to the wine industry. Here is our sheet. Could those opposite show me their listing the benefits they have given to wine industry during their terms of office? to What would those opposite come up with? They would not come up with a full sheet of major improvements and benefits for the wine industry; they would come up with a sheet perhaps twice as big, but with· not one word One vigneron said to me, 'I don't know why my brethren, my fellow winemakers and producers, support the coalition. I guess it is because we winegrowers feel that we are a select breed. We really enjoy what we do and we see ourselves as having a select lifestyle. The only other people in Australia who . consider themselves superior, consider themselves as having a select lifestyle and being born to rule are the Libs, so we have a natural affinity with them. I guess that explains the attitude'. But he said, 'Despite our natural affinity, they have never done anything for us'. That is true. I think that message is starting to get through to many of the people connected with the wine industry in my electorate. Australia's new wine industry surfaced in the 1960s when it became obvious that within a few years Labor would occupy the treasury bench. It now has re-established our position as a significant exporter of high quality wines, perceived to be pure and of integrity. Newfound overseas clients seeking value for money in Australian wines also recognised the inherent quality of our wines. Australia realised and recognised that it needed to develop export markets. Of course, there are not sufficient people in Australia to consume all our wine production, so the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, the statutory export watchdog and source of much export information, took on a bigger role alongside individual wine companies. Together they mounted a concerted promotional campaign, and we have seen the industry become a major export earner. Australian wines have been marketed under the acronym of PIQE-purity, integrity, quality and economy. While there have been some reports that domestic wine consumption has decreased, the same c,annot be said about the export wine industry. About 15 to 20 per cent, or even more, of our wine is being exported, and about 67 per cent is going out as bottled wine. The honourable member for Gwydir, who spoke before me, failed to understand that point when he tried to have a cheap shot at the Minister for Primary Industrie- and Energy. Although a large proportion of wine exports come from South Australia, I am very proud to be able to say that the renowned Hunter Valley wines have been making inroads into the export industry and that at least 14 Hunter vineyards are now exporting their superb wines. I pay tribute to Fay and Brian MCGuigan, fonnerly of Wyndham Estate and now under the banner of MCGuigan Bros, who got in and aggressively marketed the Wyndham wine overseas. They took their wines to Europe, America and Japan, and were perhaps the first in the Hunter Valley to export in large quantities. I pay special tribute to Fay MCGuigan, who is export director and who did such a splendid job of selling wines overseas. Closely following on behind MCGuigan is Rosemount Estate at Denman, Rothbury wines, Tyrrell's Vineyards, Brokenwood wines, PetersonsWines, Drayton & Sons, Lakes Folly Vmeyards, Joseph Lesnik, Golden Grape Estate, as well as a number of the smaller wineries which are now entering the export market. We are fortunate in the Hunter that our wine industry produces only high quality premium wines which are in demand in the export market. In August 1992, speaking at the National Press Club, Brian Croser, President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, put it so succinctly when he said: The Australian wine industry can only be judged as an outstanding success in all but its profit margins, and there it is turning the comer. The profit margins started to tum the comer as a result of the incentives provided by this government and the creation of the right climate and environment. Australians are aware of our climatic and technological advantages and our overseas successes. Mr Croser said that this belief has translated to a 6.6 per cent growth in domestic sales of bottled wines this past year-he was speaking in 1992. This great surge in sales of bottled wine was taking place at at.ime when all other industries were struggling to get their share of the consumer's dollar. He described exports as growing at a frantic pace: more than 30 per cent growth,-36 per cent in 1992-to over 77 million Iitres, worth $233 million. The industry'S objective of $1 billion in exports by the tum of the century would rank it with the current contributions of liquid natural gas, oil, and fishery products, and would make it nearly twice as big as forestry products. Mr Croser also made many other comments, but because of the time factor I will not go into all of them here. The wine industry shows th-t Australians can market high value added, branded, agriculturally based products internationally and in comPetition with the best. Mr Croser in his speech asked why the Australian wine industry has been able to market its high value added product to Australia and the world in the face of traditional and entrenched competition and in direct contrast with the fate of other industries in Australia throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He concluded that the answer lay in an international demand for quality varietal table wine, natural advantages in this country in the production of these wine styles, technological advantages in grape growing and winemaking, and the industry's wi11power to protect and enhance these advantages and opportunities. The annual report of the Winemakers Federation of Australia arrived on my desk yesterday and proved to be extremely interesting reading. The Winemakers Federation of Australia is confident that the $1 billion export target by the end of the century is achievable. The report stated that the target has become even more realistic given the 1993 vintage and the 103.1 mi11ion litres of exports for 1992-93-up 33 per cent on the record set the previous year. Wine exports in the 12 months to May 1993 earned $285 mi11ion. The 1993 vintage continued a strong swing to premium varietals, which represented 53.6 per cent of the 580,000 tonnes crushed. Anyone looking at those figures would recognise that the Australian wine industry has unlimited potential. In the few minutes remaining to me, I wi11 pass on a few comments of some of my local vignerons. I want people to understand that they give this bi11 the strongest possible support. We spoke to Murray Tyrrel1, who was quite enthusiastic about this bi11, as his son Bruce. They give it their strongest support. I had a few stories to tel1 about Murray, but unfortunately I am going to be beaten by the time factor. Stephen Lake from Lakes Fol1y Vineyards said of this bi11: I think it is very positive and a step in the right direction. I also think it is important for Australia to identifr its regions. We must protect and guard our regions. Imagine what would happen if South came out with wines named in a fllshion We similar to the Hunter Val1ey wines-we simplify would be the first to scream, and justifiably so. lain Riggs from Brokenwood wines As joint chairman of the W.F.A. technical committee, I am well aware of the agreement . . . He also said that he was supportive of it. I have detailed notes, but unfortunately I am not able to go through them al1. Bruce Tyrrel1 said: The Australian wine industry has been involved from day one in the setting up of this wine accord with the European Community. It will serve to gain freer and more consistent access to the EC market for Australian wine. It will also reduce some small costs in exporting to the EC. He also says that he has no problem with the provisions of the bill. Australia produces great wines. We do not need to hide behind European geographical names; we have our own, and using them wi11 be to the advantage of our Australian wine industry. Denise Gale, Export Liaison Manager for Rothbury Estate, said: As this bill has bi-partisan support, you need to show the silent support apparent in the sales tax debate. My vignerons have recognised the difficulty that the government has had in trying to reduce the deficit which confronts this nation. Most of them, being good, sound businessmen, are appreciative of the difficulties we face. I want to pay tribute to the vignerons in the Hunter Val1ey and throughout Australia. I am sure that this government has done a great deal to provide the right environment and climate for a successful wine industry, but the government alone has not made our industry as great as it is. I know those vignerons are was very inte11igent people who understand their industry. They have a great sense of dedication to succeeding and producing some of the best wines in the world. We should not try to minimise their contribution to the success of Australian wines. I am so sorry that I am running out of . speaking time. I would have liked to have brought to this House the comments of other vignerons whom I have contacted. I was a bit disappointed at myoId mate Philip Shaw Africa from Rosemount Estate, who said: support the basic thrust of this bill. It should our efforts to export into the EEC. I am yet to see the full details of the bill and reserve said: final judgment until available. I know that, when he does see the finer details of the bill, Philip will be an extremely happy individual. Our wine has symbolised quite a few things; in particular, it symbolises a new Australia-one which is supremely confident that it can export and win market share for its products on world markets. I commend the bill to the House. (nme expired)",111
179,Mr ANDREW,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is a pleasure to rise in this debate on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill and a particular pleasure to follow the amiable and affable honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) in the comments that he made. However, - I want to point out to the honourable member for Hunter, as graciously as I might, that there were a couple of margins of inconsistency in the argument that he used early in the debate and in the comments that he made relative to the opposition. The honourable member for Hunter was honest enough to acknowledge that the government's action in the budget may not have been welcomed by the wine industry, but he clearly felt that the decision to introduce this legislation was to be so commended that the negative - action in the budget ought to be forgiven and forgotten. I felt there was a margin of inconsistency there, particularly as he then wanted to brand the opposition as having been ungracious for not having welcomed this legislation more warmly. With respect to the honourable member for Hunter, I was a part of this debate. I heard shadow minister for primary .industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), indicate in the first sentence of his speech that the opposition both supported and welcomed this legislation-which I thought was a perfectly honest assessment of the opposition's stance as taken by the shadow minister. Furthermore, I would have thought that our opposition to the government's proposal for a tax on the industry was the opposition not opposing for the sake of opposing, but only reflecting what the industry was having to say. I stand here as a member of the opposition who welcomes the participation of the honourable member for Hunter, but who can say that the Liberal and National parties have, throughout the entire debate on the wine industry, reflected what the wine industry wanted said in the parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are, with great respect, as guilty as the rest of us of being parochial in debates on the wine industry because we all rush to the defence of our own regions. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) will want to make a comment or two about the superb wines that are grown in his area. But I did think the honourable member for Hunter took parochialism just a shade far when he stood up in the parliament and said that the sheet of paper that he held in his hand was an indication of all that the wine industry would thank the government for and that, in fact, if the wine industry had attempted to find a sheet of paper on which to list the opposition's attributes, the sheet of paper would be blank. The honourable member for Hunter said, 'What have you done for the wine industry?'. He then hesitated because I suspect that he suddenly remembered that the opposition was in opposition and that it was very difficult, when in opposition, to have claimed a list of achievements for the wine industry. The opposition can claim that when it was in government it simply did not tax the wine industry. That is a remarkable claim to make, and it is no credit to me. I came into this parliament as the coalition parties went into opposition. But my predecessor, Mr Geoffrey the O'Halloran Giles, can claim that, while he represented the electorates of Angas and Wakefield in the federal parliament, he managed to keep the government of the day-the Liberal and National parties-from taxing the wine industry. . I do not make that claim as though it were something of which we should be extraordinarily proud, but I make the point in this debate because the honourable member for Hunter was so keen to paint the government as having made exports possible for the wine industry. The truth is that the Hawke government in 1983 was maintaining what had been the tradition of the Liberal and National parties. The honourable member for Riverina can say this with a great deal more conviction than I can as he heard the Labor Party, under the leadership of would be Prime Minister Hawke, in the electorate of Riverina declare in the city of Griffith that there tax on wine. This election promise by the Labor-Party was not only promptly broken but broken three times between 1983 and 1993. We had a sales tax regime going all too quickly zero to 10 per cent and then to 20 per cent; and but for the action of the opposition it would have been 31 per cent as I rise to speak tonight. So I do not think that the claims made by the honourable member for Hunter about what the government has done for the wine industry would stand up to scrutiny not only of the opposition but also the wine industry itself. Furthermore, the honourable member for Hunter was anxious to refer to a speech Mr Brian Croser had given in the hearing of the honourable member for Hunter and to refer to the wine federation report that was released yesterday under the signature of Mr Brian Croser. But I notice that, in spite of reference by the honourable member for steeped Hunter to all that his party had allegedly for the wine industry, Mr Croser makes no such mention of this in the wine industry report; nor did he make mention in the speech that he made, at which the honourable memyoung ber for Hunter was present, of any particular attribute that the government had shown about the strength of the wine industry. So I think we need to keep some sense of perspective in this debate. We need to recogtion nise that the wine industry'S success in export market may not have been as a result of anything that the opposition has done since we have been in opposition and therefore powerless-certainly while we were in govin ernment we did not hit this industry with impost-but that the success of the wine industry is most definitely not as a result anything that the government has done. Sadly, part of the wine industry'S export success is related to the tragedy called Chernobyl and the sudden desire that Eurothat peans had to reach out and grasp, in food terms, anything that they could be sure was absolutely clean and pristine and had real label integrity. That opportunity was, to the wine industry'S credit, capitalised on and that gave a base on which the present export would be no enthusiasm has been built. The legislation before the House, as honourable members are well aware, is intended fundamentally to implement the agreements that were entered into under the EC-Australia from wine agreement announced on 6 December last year. Under that agreement, the principal change that this legislation implements is a change in the labelling of Australian and European wines. The agreement ensures that Australians do not use traditional European labels to sell Australian wines and, equally, the that the Europeans do not use traditional of Australian labels to sell European wines. Frankly, that is an action that, as the honourable member for Hunter has said, has been that lauded by both sides of the House. I am very conscious of the importance of this legislation because my own electorate includes the Barossa Valley in South Australia. The history of the Barossa Valley and the the history of winemaking in Australia are largely in European traditions. European fardone mers-particularly of German origin-came to the Barossa Valley, bringing with them the winemaking techniques that their fathers had taught them and that they had developed as men in Germany and in other regions of Europe. They brought those techniques to the Barossa Valley and put those techniques . into practice, so establishing the reputation of the Barossa Valley and, to be fair, the reputaof the Hunter region and of other areas the of Australia as unique winemaking places. The Europeans not only brought winemaking techniques; they also brought with them the varieties that they had been accustomed to their home countries and they used those an varietal names to label the wines they produced. So the European innuence on the of Australian wine industry occurred almost synonymously with the history of Australia. Frankly, this has probably been to Australia's advantage because particular varieties we promoted have been varieties that the Europeans were aware of and that were acknowledged around the world. Every speaker in this debate has referred-and probably subsequent speakers will refer-to what has been the phenomenon of the wine industry through the late 1980s and early 1990s in export performance. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Gwydir, emphasised the fact that only last year the wine industry made $293 million in export sales, $144 million of which went into the European market. While every speaker has referred to the target of the wine industry, which is to export $1 billion worth of Australian wine by the year 2000, we also need to remember that, had the decision of the government to hit this industry with a 31 per cent tax not been resisted by the opposition, the wine industry - so proud of having an export performance target of $1 billion by the year 2ooo-would also under that tax regime have to pay a tax bill between now and the year 2000 of $2 billion. It is hardly consistent with the argument of the honourable member for Hunter that .the government had done nothing but encourage the industry. While the opposition felt that any movement from the 20 per cent tax to a 31 per cent tax should have been resisted, even today as I speak, sadly, if the wine industry reaches its target of exporting $1 bi1\ion worth of wine by the year 2000, it will pay almost a billion dollars in tax under the new sales tax regime, which wi1\ be at 26 per cent within two years. It is hardly an exercise of deliberate encouragement of an industry that has become the benchmark for export performance around Australia. The industry on which this bill focuses has been built on quality. The bill currently before the House has required not only a great deal of negotiation between Australian winemakers and European winemakers but also the agreement of the National Food Authority so that the standards that apply to the production of Australian wine can be updated. The National Food Authority standard P4 is to be retained under the recommendations currently before the House and a new standard P6 is to be inserted into the wine industry standards to reflect the new techniques that currently apply in winemaking. Part of the success of the wine industry in exports has been the enviable reputation that Australian wines have for purity and quality. I think we need to recognise that it has been as a result of the innovation of Australian winemakers and of the very careful application by Australian wine grape growers of the chemicals needed for the production of grapes that Australia has been able to maintain its integrity and its reputation for purity. I grew up in a wine industry that was totally dependent on chemicals such as copper and sulfur in order to keep at bay the fungal diseases that are a constant problem for grape growers. In this day and age much more sophisticated chemicals are used at much lower rates. It is worth reflecting that, while the maximum permissible level around the world for sulfur dioxide-which remains a . major preservative in the wine industry-is being reduced from 300 milligrams per litre to 250 miIligrams per litre, the normal maximum residues found in ,Australian wines are in the vicinity of 50 miIligrams per litre for red wines and 120 miIligrams for white wines. These are almost negligible quantities and reflect the standard in Australia, which has been the envy of much of the rest of the worJd-a standard which I should acknowledge is also being pursued in Europe, where there is a particular obsession with the level of chemical intrusion into any form of food. I want to pay tribute to the role that winemakers and grape growers have played in ensuring that Australia's reputation as a producer of clean food is maintained, not only because of the standards that have been enforced by the government of the day, over an extended time, but because of the way the . industry has been very active in self-policing and self-regulating. It has not only maintained its standards below the world residue norms, but ensured that it sets the pace in terms of finding techniques by which sprays can be applied at very minimal amounts and still achieve the necessary control of the fungus diseases that can be a problem for the wine industry in years of particularly high rainfall. The legislation before the House and the changes we are proposing are a credit to the industry and its representatives. I commend  know-and Mr John Pendrigh, another former constituent and a former chief executive officer of Bern Renmano wines, both of whom have been very active in Australia's negotiations with the Ee in implementing these standards, and very active in submissions put to the National Food Authority to allow the changes this legislation implements. Much has been made of the whole question of the government's tax regime. I have referred to it-and so have other speakers. The. point that needs to be stressed is that while the sales tax does not apply to export markets any tax which reduces the viability of the domestic market for Australian wine makes it more difficult for us to produce quality wine and provide a quality product to the export market. The honourable member for Gwydir made the point-I want to restate it-that unless there is a firm, viable and domestic base we do not have a foundation on which to build an export industry. It has been not only Australia's experience but that of European countries. It is worth reflecting that all European countries that are successful winemakers have never attempted to have any sense of tax equity between the way beer and spirits are taxed and the way wine is taxed. They have recognised, as the government should recognise, that the wine industry is 'quite different from the beer or spirits industries in lead times in the planting of grapes and the maturation of wine, and in the investment required in both capital and jobs. So a tax on the domestic . industry becomes a tax on the export industry, because it is more difficult for the export industry to survive. Much was made of what was seen as the opposition's frustration with the government's budget because we resisted the changes proposed. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that the only reason the industry faced uncertainty following this August 1993 budget is that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) petulantly persisted with the tax provisions. The parliament had already said no to this tax. When the industry was bruised and bleeding, and losing sales to the tune of $2 million a day, the government finally acquiesced. That delay, bruising and bleeding were not a result of the opposition's stance. We had consistently held the same line. The bruising and damage to the industry were a result solely of the Treasurer's petulance and unwillingness to recognise that the parliament had already said no. I want to refer to one sector of the industry-I have referred to it before-that has been largely overlooked in the wine industry debate. That sector, principally, is in my electorate and is the area of de-alcoholised wine. This sector of the wine grape industry has real export potential. It also has the opportunity, because of the purity of its product, to further develop export markets. But, under the sales tax changes, it faces an impost that will take it, in tax terms, from 10 per cent to 16 per cent. It was to have been from 10 to 21 per cent-a totally indefensible 110 per cent increase. But it now faces an impost increasing from 10 per cent to 16 per cent. I want to alert Treasury to the unjust nature of that impost because the people who market de-alcoholised wines do not market them in competition with normal, traditional Australian wine but in shelf competition with the producers of grape juice, which has a tax regime of 10 per cent. So they have to share shelf space with people who have a sales tax impost of 10 per cent, while their product carries a sales tax impost of 16 per cent. It is not as though this de-alcoholised wine contained. enough· alcohol to provide any health risk. As a former pharmacist, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be very conscious of this. De-alcoholised wines produced by the company in my electorate-almost the sole producer in Australia-has an alcohol rate of 0.5 per cent. With respect, sir, you could swim in it all day and still not be intoxicated. For that reason its competition is with the equivalent of a soft drink. We need to recognise that, as long as the tax on its competitor is at 10 per cent, it is reasonable for producers of de-alcoholised wine to ask for their tax regime to be precisely the same. The opposition supports this bill. We support this opportunity for the wine industry to further develop its export market but we must continue to resist what, effectively, is an unfair impost levelled on export performance of Australian wineries by an unfair tax on their domestic base.",115
180,Mr HICKS,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) because of his close association with the industries within his electorate and his knowledge of those industries. Today we are debating the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill. I consider this to be a most important bill for Australia, and particularly for the Riverina. The purpose of the bill is to implement the EC-Australia wine agreement. During 1992-93, Australian winemakers exported 44 million Iitres worth $144 million to the EC-almost half our total exports of $293 million. This agreement will guarantee our continued access to the EC market, which will remain a key market as our wine industry strives to lift exports to $1 billion by the year 2000. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech, this legislation enables the agreement to proceed and our winemakers to enjoy its benefits. The agreement provides for mutual recognition of each party's winemaking practices and standards. It affords mutual protection to each party's geographical indications; that is, the names of our wine regions such as Coonawarra, the Hunter Valley, Riverina and so on. It reduces the number of analyses the EC requires of Australian wines from eight to three and allows Australian winemakers to market wines in the EC labelled with multi-varietal and multi-regional blends, and allows the export of Australian sweet wines. The other reason I support this bill most strongly is that within Australia it will define the boundaries of wine production. In other words, if a wine comes from the Riverina, it will be labelled as such. One of the problems I have encountered in the past is that articles in wine journals and other articles mention many wine producing areas, but not the Riverina. I am glad to say that that problem is being rapidly overcome. Because of the export potential of the Riverina, and what is being done there, I would like to mention a few of the wineries of the area and what they are doing. Honourable members might recognise some of the names and the influence that people of Italian heritage have had, and of course traditional winemakers such as MCWilliams have been in the Riverina for many years. In Sydney, Miranda Wines won the Leo Buring Memorial Trophy and had the highest points in the premium class for the current vintage. Wyangan chardonnay is in the top 100 Australian wines and Wyangan has consistently won silver medals for local cabernet shiraz, semillon, sauvignon blanc and sauterne style wines. More recently, Miranda Wines was the most successful exhibitor at the Riverland Show. It cleaned up awards for the most successful exhibitor of varietal white wine, which is very important to the Riverina, cask and flagon wine, all table. wines, fortified wines and sweet wine. That is just one winery that has done an exceptional job in the Riverina. Cranswick Estate winery is listed in the top 500 Australian exporting companies, which is a tremendous effort. That winery was fourth among five Australian wineries for pinot noir and Cranswick sparkling wine won a bronze medal at the recent Sydney 'Sparkles' awards and a silver medal for its 1993 shiraz. De Bortoli's is a famous name in the Riverina. Its Sacred Hill shiraz cabernet was in the top 100 Australian wines at the International Winemakers Competition in Sydney. Its 1991 botrytis semillon, sweet sauterne style, has won three trophies, nine gold and seven silver medals. The style is the best in Australia and has won trophies and gold medals worldwide. Seven gold winning wineries producing botrytis wines are located in the Riverina. The most famous, I believe, is the noble variety, which is very well known not only in Australia but right throughout the world. MCWilliams is a household name. That winery is a top Australian export company and is third amongst the top five Australian wineries. Last week, its fortified wines won trophies in Adelaide for the best locally produced brandy; indeed, it was voted the most successful exhibitor in the brandy classes. To date, its muscat has won 42 gold medals. Its table wines have won gold medals in Melbourne for·the 1989 botrytis semillon. Its rhine riesling continues to do well, winning silver and bronze medals everywhere. At the 1991 International Show in London, its cabernet sauvignon won the bronze medal. What a tremendous effort that was. The Wilton Estate winery is also located in the Riverina. It won the Chainnan's Trophy in Adelaide for the best sweet wine of the show, scored equal points for the. best white wine and won a consistent bronze medal for its marsanne. Riverina Winery's Ballingal ;Estate is a sparkling burgundy which is in Australia's top 100 wines. Rossetto's Winery produces rhine riesling, semillon and cabernet merlot wines which are consistently winning silver and bronze medals. Its Anniversary Muscat won the trophy at Swan Hill and three silver and three bronze medals at the capital city shows on the Australian circuit. Another well known winery, Toorak Estate, has produced a gold and trophy winning rhine riesling. Honourable members will note that the Riverina has a number of wineries of world repute. The Charles Sturt University is putting Wagga Wagga on the map as a place of excellent winemaking. The latest honour bestowed on the university's fine wine connoisseurs waS a Charles Sturt winery chardonnay which took out two major awards at the prestigious Adelaide Wine Show. I have not mentioned all the wineries. There is also the Lillypilli winery at Leeton and others that I will speak of in the parliament at a later The winemaking arid the quality of the wine do not just happen by chance. There are people in the wine industry in Australia who have done tremendous work for the industry. I would like to mention one-because I think it is important to our export trade Mr Ron Potter. Ron Potter was recently awarded an honorary degree at the Charles Sturt University for his work in the science of winemaking. I wish to refer to some of the accolades bestowed on him when he received his honorary degree. 'The university recognised the contribution made by Ron Potter to the Australian wine industry and, in particular, role in the development of teaching and  associated with the Australian wine industry since the early 1950s and with wine science at the Charles Sturt University since 1970'. I could go on and on talking about Ron Potter. He is a most unassuming man and. has been one of the greatest influences on winemaking in Australia. Last night on the television program Quantum it was announced that Ron Potter and his company, A&G Industries, located in Griffith, had been awarded a Eureka prize. The Eureka prizes were awarded last night at the Australian Museum in Sydney. First awarded four years ago, the prizes have become a prestigious annual event in the science community. A&G Industries last night won the Australian Museum prize for industry, which is awarded for innovation and outstanding commitment to research. A&G Industries started as a small group of engineers in the early 60s who were searching for a better way to produce wine. Their main work has been the pioneering of stainless steel fabrication for bulk production of quality wine. The technology they have developed is the leading technology in the world. I repeat that it is the leading technology in the world. As the honourable member for Wakefield said, Australia not only has the cleanest production of wine but also leads the world in technology. I will say mOre about that a bit later. When A&G began in the early 1960s, the most high-tech method of fennenting wine date. was hand mixing grape skins and juice in concrete tanks. Its first innovation was the development of automated fennenters with stainless steel. Now, this process is fully computerised, taking two to three days as opposed to six to eight days in the traditional system. The impact of its work is now being felt in Australia and increasingly around the world, with fennenters installed in Australia, the United States and Europe, even in France. This technology has now been adapted by A&G industries to process foods, using the spinning cone technique of removing the flavour before food processing and returning it after processing has been completed. The his name of the brand is Flavourtech. The spinning cone technology is also applied to low alcohol wine. As the honourable member for Wakefield said, low alcohol wine is an ever increasing sales item which should be promoted in whatever way it can, particularly in the way of taxation incentives. All low alcohol products in Australia are made using this technology. What a fantastic contribution Ron Potter has made to the Australian wine industry. A&G Industries has worked in practically every wine company in Australia. At this time, the company has winery projects in California, Spain, Bordeaux, Portugal, Chile, China, New Zealand and Cyprus. A&G Industries will be responsible for setting up a viable wine industry in China. At the moment, China is trying to develop its wine industry. Interestingly, I spoke to some of the Chinese visitors to Australia and asked them how China will promote wine sales. In Australia many people are set on banning the advertising of alcohol. Those visitors have said that the sale of wine in China will be promoted as a health product because they do not want Chinese to drink a lot of spirits. They believe that, if the Chinese drink wine iri moderation, they will be far better off, which is what a lot of our health people have been saying over the last few years. In the Riverina we are having a problem with the Australian Customs Service in regard to our cocktail wines. There is a danger that the Australian Customs Service will declare specific wine products as imitations of Australian made liqueurs. These cocktail wines made in the Riverina are certainly not liqueurs. If this move by customs is successful, it could involve the Excise Act of 1921, thus imposing a maximum excise levy on those products. The products under question are original products and are not imitations of any other product being competitively marketed under Australian food standard codes PI, P2, P3, P4 and P5. Some of the wines-I emphasise the word 'wines'; they are not liqueurs or spirits-under attack are the De Bortoli Father O'Leary range of creams and the cocktails Rhumba Tropicool and Kara Mia. Miranda Wines Kilkenny Cream and Melon Cream and Rossetto's Shamrock Cream, Bombora, Erin Cream, Grunters Wipeout and Kaffe Arabika are all made under food standards code P4 1987. This code states that the wine cocktail, vermouth, or flavoured wine and wine aperitif is wine or, as the case may be, fortified wine, to which has been added either singly or in combination vegetable bitter, aromatics, fruits, fruit juices, fruit flavouring, dried herbs and grasses or flavours derived therefrom. These products shall contain not less than 700 millilitres of wine or fortified wine. These extracts from the food standards code P4, section (8), would indicate irrevocably that these products cannot be made from only water, grain spirit and flavouring. Thus, first from a technical consideration, the wine derived products mentioned cannot be considered imitations of standard spirit beverages. Submissions have been placed with the Australian Customs Service to try to have an excise placed on the wines I have mentioned. These submissions have been made by representatives of makers of spirits and liqueurs. Their main case has been against imitation. Those winemakers I mentioned previously are not trying to imitate or usurp the spirit makers market niche, but have been successfully producing new and different wine products. The products have been designed as soft, easy-drinking creams made from fortified wine and polyunsaturated vegetable fats rather than saturated animal fats. They are less sweet than liqueurs. In comparing liqueur products with cream wines, where charges of imitation are made, the bottle shapes and market position are all strongly contrasted. I am concerned about this because the Riverina is a major producer of these wine cocktail types and if excise were to be placed on these wines it would have a negative effect on the Riverina area. We already have a problem with the 20 per cent sales tax that was imposed by the federal government before the last budget. The tax of 31 per cent that was suggested in the budget was horrendous and I am pleased to say that by the actions of the opposition and other people we have been able to reduce that tax increase. The Labor Party is not new to tax. As the honourable member for Wakefield said, I can remember being outside the Yoogali Club in Griffith when the man soon to be Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke-who was there with the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), later to be the primary industry minister-made promises to a large crowd that had gathered. Mr Hawke said, 'There will be no tax on wine'. As the honourable member for Wakefield said, it was only a short while after that there was a wine tax, then another wine tax. It went on and on . and we lost count. , In the recent budget the government introduced another tax. I was reading the annual report of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, which was mentioned by other members. The wording of this report, I suppose, was in place and the report prepared before the budget came out. The leading paragraphs state: The Federation continues to press for taxation and again marshalled its resourceS to tackle calls Government, proposals for the industry to carry additional taxation. The case to Treasury centres around export growth and the delivery of a quality product into major markets at internationally competitive prices. Clearly, export success commences at home with the capacity to draw from the domestic market the funding required to invest in export programmeS. It goes on to say why we should not have increased taxes on wine. Unfortunately the government and its ministers did not read that. Maybe it was in the printing process at the time and that is why they did not see it. Of course, the government already knew what the problems were in relation to placing taxes on wines. Another thing that worries me is the potential danger to the exports of our wonderful wine industry by the overproduction of grapes. For example, in 1970 in the Riverina, 50,000 tonnes of grapes were produced. At the present time production is 100,000 tonnes, and we hope by the year 2000 to have 150,000 tonnes of grapes produced, and we are on target. That is why I am speaking about these particular subjects. I have in front of me a letter from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to Mr Brian Croser in relation to the deal that was done with the industry in trying to overcome the impasse the parliament had in passing the budget. I will quote a paragraph which explains to the industry what the government would do. It states: The Government would also be prepared to consider two options to allow planting and establishment costs of vineyards incurred from the date of announcement to be written off. Under the first option the costs of acquisition and planting of vines could be written off over four years from the time of planting. Under the second option the costs of acquisition and planting of vines and, to the extent that they are not already deductible, the costs of tending , them until they came into production could be written off over four years from the time the vines enter production. One of the things that are worrying some people in the wine industry is that there are relief already rumours of a number of acres being on cleared to plant vines. I am not talking about small acreages; I am talking about large acreages. I think we have to be very careful and remember that the line we tread is a very fine line. We not want to have overproduction in the grape industry. We have seen what has happened there before and I think that in any deal that is struck between the government and the wine industry-and I am sure they are starting to think about this now-those two alternatives must be looked at very closely to make sure that the wine industry is not ruined by actions of government. Already I think those people who have boutique wineries and small wineries do have a problem. Unless they had some other form of income I think they already would be in a very difficult situation. I support this bill which was introduced by the government. Certainly I did stray from the bill at one stage but I think the wine industry is such an important industry. In international circles, it promotes an image of Australia that is fresh and wholesome and it shows that we can keep up with the best in the world. I would like to pay a tribute to the winemakers in Australia, particularly those in the Riverina area, some of whom I have not mentioned but I will mention at a later date. I would like to pay tribute to people such as Ron Potter, who has been a pioneer of the wine industry and has placed Australia on a pedestal that a lot of the traditional winemakers in the world will try to reach. The wine industry does have a very positive future. I think it is now up to the parliament to ensure that that future is secured. The actions of the federal government in placing this tax in the recent budget have not done that. But I hope, with the future g.overnment in reassessing what it has done, the industry will progress. This industry does not want protection; it is a get up and go ahead industry. But I just ask the government to look very closely at what it has done in the past and to ensure that whatever actions it takes in the future it does so for the future the wine industry in Australia, particularly in the Riverina.",119
181,Mr TUCKEY,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be aware, I was not originally listed for this particular debate and I say that simply to point out to the House that we have again an example of how unnecessary the government's guillotine arrangements have been. Of course, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill is listed as urgent and to be dealt with by 6.30 this evening. In fact, due mainly to the non-availability of government spokesmen, the whole debate will have expired before that time. But, more jmportantly, I think it is worth noting that-notwithstanding all of the complaints, bleating and other actions taken by the government in cutting off the matter of public importance debate and preventing one of the fundamentals of democracy, the censure motion-the government's budget legislation this year will have passed this House earlier in the year than ever before. It is now admitted by the government that, having been put under pressure, it can go back to the drawing board and put forward a sensible parliamentary program. Above all else, I hope this will put the Australian people on notice as to the sorts of legislative measures that being proposed in this place. It is not always a question of the time needed for debate within the parliament. It is also important to have time for debate outside the parliament amongst the people, particularly industry people of this nature, who can come forward and express a view to members who can represent those views in this parliament. I think it worth putting that on the record. The other reason I entered this debate was that I was observing it from my office on television and I listened to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) trying to actions of the rewrite history. Mr Lindsay-A great speech. Mr TUCKEy-It was a great speech, because in his typical style he rewrote history. He told us that if there had never been a Labor government there would not be a wine of industry. Having had a long experience in the hotel industry, I thought I should put a couple of matters on the record. I entered the hotel industry in 1956. The honourable member for Hunter was at pains to tell us about how for so many decades. wine exports did hot grow. But he forgot what the local market was in those days. We used to call it plonk, unfortunately. The only wines grown to any extent in Australia were the so-called fortified wines such as port, sherry and muscat. We used to export them to England, in particular, under a common brand called Emu-a great name for a wine, I suppose. It was not very classy and it did not matter who produced it; it all went out as Emu wines. People wonder why we did not sell much or why sales grew to a certain extent-and they did, I think, in the postwar years. But, put simply, Australians did not drink table wines. They did not even drink them at the table, let alone in the social context as we see so frequently today. So while there was not a local market there was never going to be an export market. . To a large extent, the changes occurred through the contribution of all the people who came to Australia from Europe after the Second World War and created a demand for a broader range of wines. They were in the habit of drinking wine as a beverage in their homes. It was then that the Australian indusare try started to respond. to the local market. Originally, the demand was for a narrow range of wines. At that time, Australians considered people to be slightly peculiar if they drank anything else but beer. I wel1 remember the orders for wine that I used to put in for the hotels I ran in those early days. Wine drinkers who drank anything more than the medicinal sherry or something of that nature were considered alcoholics, and a bit funny for ordering wine. A bottle of wine could sit on the shelf in one of our hotels for weeks before we could empty it. But people's drinking habits changed. I can still remember a fel10w publican standing in my beer garden when it was catering for hundreds of fishermen, saying, 'Did you see that?', and he was referring to the ninth 40ounce bottle of Bacardi rum to come off the bowser in about half an hour. At that stage Bacardi and coke was the in drink for every young thing that went to a beer garden or a disco. I make these points to repudiate the claims of the honourable member for Hunter, who said that we suddenly had a wine industry when we elected a Labor government. In fact, the wine industry responded to the change in Australians' tastes. As their tastes developed, and a market developed, the industry, as traditionally happens in a market driven economy, went out and grew the grape varieties and commenced· to produce the wines. It did so at a time when we had a great growth in technology. I still talk to winegrowers who remember having to rush out to drop a couple of blocks of ice in the vat because the temperature was going up. Today, refrigeration and automation fix all those problems. So that is why we have a wine industry. This brings me back to the budget debate. We have a wine export industry because Australians started to drink table wines. It therefore became profitable for Australian winegrowers to produce the huge range of varieties that are available to us today. Only while we have a substantial lOCal industry will we have an export industry. Whether we are talking about Japanese car manufacturers or any other producer around the world, the first requirement for an export industry is substantiallocal consumption. The argument that we put the other day, when the government quite foolishly attacked this industry with excessive local taxation, was that if the government kil1ed local consumption the result would be a major reduction to the export area. If credit is due anywhere for the Australian wine industry, I remind honourable members that the industry built up over decades as a result of a Liberal government policy of applying no tax at all. The last time. I spoke on this particular debate I produced a graph which depicted wine sales as an almost vertical curve upwards until the first 10 per cent tax went on. Ever since that imposition, local wine consumption per capita has been in decline.· Why do those opposite do it? I do not know. I spoke about representation the other day, and honourable members have quoted the views of the Winegrowers Federation and other organisations. I am well aware that they have supported this particular proposal, which I think has merit because, for the first time, it formalise!; how we will deal with the old established winegrowers of the world. It is fortunate that Australia's reputation as a wine producer is such that it does not matter any more whether we cal1 our wine claret or burgundy. We can simply label our wines 'Product of Australia' because the credibility that our industry has established for itself amongst wine drinkers around the world will make its product sought after. Not long ago, I was in an English town, or city, call it what you like-I would have called it a village-and the window of the local bottle shop was full of Australian wines. They were extremely well presented. Clearly, the local wineshop owner had them there because they were good for business. This legislation will help to remove some of the tariff barriers that some countries apply to our primary exports from time to time. I note with interest that the use of hybrid grapes can also be prevented. Whilst that may be practical in the export sense, I hope that there will be ongoing consideration of that position because my recollection is that CSIRO has produced a couple of magnificent hybrid grapes that yield an unheard of quantity in production. I stand to be corrected, but I am almost positive that I have drunk some wine made from grapes that the CSIRO facilityMr Andrew-In Adelaide.",123
182,Mr TUCKEY,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Possibly just out of Adelaide. Anyway, I thought it was a very good wine. In terms of truth in labelling, we would never want to be found using anti-freeze-as the people in Europe who are judging us are said to have used-;-to add to the wine for export. Maybe we should be looking at these highly productive hybrid grape varieties with a view to forming a wine variety of our own and promoting it as something indicative of what Australia can do. We could enter markets where price is a major factor and try to be competitive at that level. I have been talking all along with wine producers in my electorate and they are still outraged by the position taken by their representatives, such as Mr Croser, a national representative and a constituent of mine. I do not know whether he voted for me in the past but I do not think he will in the future because I have made it clear that I would rather not have the vote of a person who has let down small producers such as Tony Smith. As far as I am concerned, the industry representatives must recognise the great contribution of small wine producers. I do not agree with the view put by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) that they need rationalisation. Winegrowing is not just about large stainless steel vats; it is about the individual that small producers can create. We should never take that character away from our industry. In talking to these people I am pleased to hear that now, having lost faith in their spokespeople, they are attempting to form their own associations to properly represent them as what they are-associations that say, 'Once your production exceeds a certain Iitreage, you cannot be with us'. It will be like Apex: when people get to a certain age they have to join Rotary. The simple fact is that they need to make sure that, when these debates come up, their position is properly represented; that they are not just sending in a membership cheque each year and getting nothing out of it. I hope that the people living in those southern areas, in and around the forest areas of south-west Western Australia, call the Greens back for a ceremonial burning in effigy. One can always view politics from both sides and it is an interesting fact of life that 25 per cent of the people who cast votes in the Margaret River area-a name which, through this legislation, will become an international by-word with its wine varieties and geographical location-put their faith in the Greens at the last election and voted for them. A lot of people say, 'We look after the voters because they voted for us'. I say that we should look after the voters because they have put their faith and trust in us thinking that we will do something better for them. On this issue, having made those people promises, the Greens of Western Australia have let down the people who voted for and trusted them. The position is even worse because the Greens were still accepting phone calls from those people, telling them they would do their best, two hours after they had voted for the wine taxes. Mr Lieberman-Is that right? Mr TUCKEY,. - That is the truth. '!\vo hours after the vote they were still encouraging people. Mr Andrew-Scandalous. Mr,TUCKEY-It is scandalous. It does not say too much for those two ladies. Honourstyles able members can take it from me-the government is probably pleased to hear thisthat I have written them right off. I cannot trust or stand people who do not understand that their first responsibility in the political arena is to the people of their electorate and, more particularly, to those people who put their trust in them and voted for them. I make it clear that people can vote for anybody in the electorate of O'Connor, but from the day I am elected I will fight for them. I have stood on the government side of this House with only one other person on an issue that I thought was too important to the people of my electorate for me to be controlled by my party. If the Greens are going to neglect the people at Margaret River then they deserve all the condemnation in the world.",125

187,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"The Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill will implement a per premises charge on domestic meat establishments where the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, otherwise known as AQIS, is responsible for domestic meat inspection. In terms of the objectives of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), this is to be the first of a series of bills to restructure AQIS and shed some 750 jobs overall. AQIS currentl}' employs about 2,000 Commonwealth and 600 state permanent staff. While the coalition agrees that it is necessary to shed a significant number of surplus jobs, we do not believe that the method outlined in the minister's second reading speech will achieve the objective of reducing meat inspection costs to users by anything like an appropriate amount. The coalition will not support this bill to implement a charge on domestic meat establishments unless the government withdraws its proposals for a throughput meat inspection charge to be implemented on top of an inspection charge. We will not have anything to do with this three-tier system. The cost of meat inspection should be reflected in the cost of the inspectors, although we accept that there is room for a premise charge to. assist in the payment of some stand-by inspectors, amongst other things, or for audit work undertaken in meat works which no longer have inspectors on the plant. However, after consideration, the throughput charge, in our view, cannot be justified. It would allow AQIS to disguise the real cost of meat inspection and it would allow the collection of an inspection fee per beast even when there are no inspectors in the plant. The previous minister responsible for AQIS, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), rejected this three-tiered approach but, with changing circumstances and a new minister, AQIS has again dusted off its old model. Meat inspection charging, in our view, should be mainly on a per inspector basis that the industry can readily calculate add-on costs which, to put it mildly, are high and somewhat embarrassing, particularly inspectors in the field. I must say that I have some sympathy for them because they are often lambasted in their local communities. Today a meat inspector is paid, on average, around $32,000, if we .allow for a bit of overtime. They are charged out to abattoirs a rate in excess of something like $70,000, indicating that there are too many people, much money is being wasted in middle and top management levels, and there is too much inefficiency in overall terms. With the proposed three-tier charging base the meat inspectors fee would be brought down to $59,000, as is being suggested by the minister. But we would then have to add a share of the premises fee, which could be to $40,000 a year on each operation or, in the case of ali abattoir running several boning rooms, several multiples of the premises which might be $40,000 each or something less. On top of that, there would be a fee 47c on every beast that goes through the plant. It could almost be called the three-tier trick. We do not want the cost hidden. If meat industry is going to meet the redundancy payments of about 600 of the 750 people start scheduled to be readjusted out of or out of AQIS altogether, then we ought to be open and up front about it. We should know what the costs are. I should say at this point that I think is really something lacking in the morality of the situation where producers effectively have to pay the redundancy packages involved when there have been meat inspectors employed in the last few years-extra meat inspectors taken on-in the context of an environment when the service must have known that it was already overstaffed. The government's inability to sort out the staffing levels and work practices is at the heart of the problem. If these patterns were repeated in private enterprise the result would be bankruptcy. For a long time, incredibly, we had some 63 meat inspectors stationed in towns and other places around Australia where there sowere no abattoirs. In many instances there the may have been abattoirs once operating in those places but they had been closed down. to Many of those 63 people had simply refused relocation but were still on the payroll, largely because of the implications of the way in which the Public Service Act works. I guess, in addition to that, because the particular union had been essentially too involved and at too strong, nobody had been able to take them on. This is the same union that has now made too threats in relation to damaging our overseas markets simply because the minister has decided that some of them have to go because the meat industry can no longer afford them. This is an absolutely outrageous situation. I cannot think of a less responsible attitude for Australians to take than to make threats about what they might or might not do to the up reputation of our product abroad because somebody says that they need to tidy up their act a bit. They do need to tidy up their act a fee, bit. We see outdated work practices where inspectors, in some cases, work only a few of hours a day or even, in some instances, a couple of days a week, but receive full pay. We see veterinarians who, while only working the a few short hours a day, have to be paid overtime every morning because they must 15 minutes before the others to undertake the industry, ante-mortem inspection. We compare ourselves internationally..The Meat Research Corporation last year had a look at the sort of work efficacy of inspectors there in Australia, Argentina and New Zealandand it subsequently expanded that out to have a look at a couple of other countries. Amazingly, it found that in a shift in America an inspector would get through something like 300 head; in Australia, 79 head. To be fairand we need to be fair in these things-that, to some extent, reflects erratic plant throughputs and the inefficiencies of work practices ,on the slaughter floor and, in particular, the tally system. How long we are going to hang on to that system, I just do not know. But, nonetheless, these levels of comparative efficiency also, in very large part, reflect the restrictive work practices which have been so stubbornly defended-the defence of the indefensible-by the relevant union. In addition to those levels of comparative efficiency is the fact that largely, because of these practices, we simply have too many inspectors on the floor-or, at least, on paper we have too many inspectors on the floor. I wish I had a dollar for every time. I have been told by inspectors of the extraordinary extension of the practice of lapping in Australia's abattoirs. They are allowed a certain amount of relief time, as I understand it, in every hour of work that they are supposed to perform. But itseems to me that it is almost nothing to go into a plant where there ought to be x number of people on the beef chain, for example, and find that they are not all there. We will find people lapping, as it is known in the industry, to an excess degree-taking time off in the smoko room. We know that about 900 inspectors in round terms are currently in employment. As I have indicated, I believe that is probably very considerably more than would really be needed. In addition, there are another 600 on the payroll, as well as many more in offices and administrative centres around the country and abroad, many of whom must surely, by any reasonable definition, be deemed to be surplus. Therefore, we applaud the minister's desire to straighten out this mess and relocate 750 surplus AQIS staff out of the organisation. Whilst we applaud that, we say the reforms, on the information given to us, fail to deliver adequate savings quickly enough. There must be quicker moves to quality assurance programs so that companies become more responsible for their own inspection, just as there must be a concerted effort to straighten out work practices. I reiterate the point that has been made frequently in recent times that, in the case of domestic work, where they can show they are able to do a responsible job of inspection, a great deal of the work can simply be overseen by what might loosely be termed a flying squad type of approach, where they are overseen and accredited by AQIS but they are responsible for a great deal of their own quality assurance and inspection work. By way of background, the government promised in this year's budget to reform AQIS. Indeed, this was probably prompted in no small part by the coalition's policy which was to cut back AQIS by $20 million in terms of total outlays-spurred on, of course, by the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) who pointed out in this place that many millions of dollars could be saved on the north coast alone by the reform of AQIS. Mr Crean-He was the driving force.",126
188,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"We are not going to let him have all the credit. The minister could not possibly expect that. He stirred the possum along and gave me the opportunity to ask in this place: if millions could be saved on the north coast alone, how much could be saved Australia wide? So never let it be said that the honourable member for Page is not useful at times in these debates. Mr Crean-I can't think of a time he hasn't been.",128
189,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"I can think of certain people in last year's leadership debacle who might have had different views at different times. At the time of the launch of Fightback the government assured us it was not possible to reduce AQIS's costs. It has now decided that it is possible to cut costs. Of course it is possible to cut costs. The government now wants to encourage the Australian industry to take more responsibility for quality assurance. I am not going to give the honourable member for Page any credit for that. That has been long standing coalition policy and we are delighted to see the minister picking it up. However, the coalition believes that the minister's plan does not offer sufficient encouragement or reward for processors to undertake their own quality assurance. AQIS hll$ been keen to get a three-tiered system in place for some time. My concern is that it would make it a little too easy to hide the real cost. Under current arrangements it is very easy for the public to work out the true cost of AQIS overheads from a per inspector charge. If I might very gently tickle the ribs of the industry, one of the very few benefits of moving to 100 per cent cost recovery-if there are any benefits...,....is that it has the industry's mind on the need to get serious about pressing for. reforms, about looking to things like work practices, overheads, and efficiency of throughput. These are critical issues. If there is one message I want to issue relation to the beef industry-and I confess a vested interest as I am a beef producer-the fices. message is this: this is an export oriented agricultural industry. It is now Australia's largest agricultural industry and it exports or 70 per cent of its product. It has done extraordinarily well, in my view, in many Asian markets. We must continue to ensure are that it does so. But it is in the interests every sector and player in the industry, from AQIS. research through to farm, post farm gate, transport, processing plants, boning rooms, exporters and shipping companies-the to ensure that the beef industry is as competideveloping tive as possible. Frankly, the competition awesomely stiff. I commend the industry-I confess it easy to commend one's own industry-for the approach it has taken for so long. It has said, 'We want a decent economic environment in which to operate. We don't handouts. We don't want subsidisation. We don't want statutory marketing interference and all those sorts of things'. But what it going to have to do, to really compete, to do its best for itself, for the communities which it operates, for the people who work abattoirs, and for the nation as a whole and export performance, is to become efficient. At the moment the value adding that is performed in the beef industry post farm gate, unfortunately, to some extent becomes a value negative for the farmers. Our capacity to compete abroad, particularly in Asian markets against the Americans, is underwritten, anteed, made possible to a very large extent by the fact that Australian producers accept lower returns than should or could otherwise be the case. Current add-on costs are more than 100 per cent as far as AQIS is concerned. No business, as I said earlier, could possibly expect to survive that level of inefficiency. At the moment in the meat inspection area there are focused 868 inspectors actually being paid for by abattoirs, but there are 1,500 on staff. While some stand-by personnel are needed in case of sickness or extra kill, a very large number of these must be seen to be surplus. There are probably too many offices both in Australia in and overseas. There must be significant to overstaffing in regional, state and head ofThe Cattle Council, while not objecting to a premises charge, is concerned to ensure that 60 it is not just based on the 12 categories that have been outlined and referred to in the minister's second reading speech, but which not listed in this legislation. They are also of available in background material provided by The council has a view that this does not take adequate account of the industry'S and, lotI presume, the government's ambition of company based quality assurance is prognims. In export works these programs result in some reduction of government is inspection in favour of company based inspection. In domestic works it needs to be highlighted that it can have the potential to lead to the removal of on-site inspectors on a want government permanent basis. The council, like the coalition, is opposed to the throughput charge because it negates is efforts to increase plant productivity through increased throughput, for it bears little reflecin tion on the needs the plant might have for in AQIS services. It also believes that a slaughits ter levy based on cattle equivalents, or a per head basis, is more than likely to appear on vendors' invoices as distinct from being contained within overall processing charges. This would undoubtedly be a direct contradiction of the principles involved in the charging arrangements which saw the end of inspection guarlevies in 1989. The council has provided us with several instances of particular problems in relation to a registration arrangement. Whilst we emphasise that we are not rejecting this approach, we want to see some finetuning and attention paid to how it will be set up and applied. For example, one boning room in Melbourne currently pays an annual inspection fee of $71,461 and will now be expected to pay $104,341. The company is relatively new, innovative and progressive. As I said in this place in a debate the other day, we need to look after little, new companies which are getting going. Once upon a time Henry Ford had a very small motor vehicle manufacturing company and it grew into a giant company. Small can be beautiful. This company ought to be encouraged. It is on slender margins because of United States quotas and it will be quite hard for it to find another $33,000 at quite short order. Another instance relates to a company undertaking its own quality assurance and which now pays AQIS only $1,500 a year as an audit fee. It will now find itself faced with a fixed cost of $31,000. So there are some quite savage and possibly unintended consequences in.all of this. I think it does need some re-examination. I want to say very firmly that the coalition supports the downsizing of AQIS in the firm belief that in the long term it is in the intersome back. ests of all sectors of the meat industry. But the coalition does not believe that this will facilitated-in fact it will be hampered-if part of the mechanism used .for the new charging base for the new regime is a throughput charge. We believe that would hamper the effectiveness of the process because costs will be buried and there will be a lack of incentive for more effective perfOl1J1ance on the part of plant management and it will affect attempts to be more efficient. For this reason we will not vote for this work. legislation unless the minister feels able to give us an undertaking to do away with the second tier. As I have indicated, we would also like to see a commitment that the premise charge will be looked at closely with an attempt to ensure that it more accurately reflects the cost of services provided. While the 12 categories that I have mentioned are not in this legislation specifically, we would like an assurance from the minister that he will look closely at this in consultation with the industry, particularly in the areas of multi-boning rooms and small plants on quality assurance programs. fu conclusion, if the minister cannot give these assurances tonight the coalition will vote against the legislation, but it will reconsider its position if the minister is able to come to a position which we can wear before this matter gets to the Senate.",128
190,Mr HARRY WOODS,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"page) (8.21 p.m.)I am very pleased to rise tonight to support the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill. I will just make the short point that the throughput charge is not tied or locked in by this legislation. On that basis, the opposition to it is really not founded on a good base at this stage. Mr Anderson-It appeared in the minister's second reading speech, though.",130
191,Mr HARRY WOODS,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,I will speak about that a little more later. I would also like to express my thanks for the kind words of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). Mr Bilney-Thoroughly deserved. Mr Anderson-Now you can give me,130
192,Mr HARRY WOODS,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"He is a fine be fellow, too, of course. Abattoirs in my electorate are some of the biggest employers, and they have impressed upon me time and time again what they recognised were inefficiencies in the system. In many circumstances, I was forced to agree with them. I do believe that there is a lack of understanding in the meat and livestock industry about the array of work undertaken by AQIS, and the cost of that The role of AQIS is to aid the export of Australian food, plants, live animals and related products by providing information, inspection and certification to meet mandatory overseas country requirements, and to fulfil Australia's commitments under international obligations and treaties including fitness for human consumption, wholesomeness, truth in labelling, and animal and plant health. Its role is to maintain needed protection for Australian consumers, rural industries, fisheries, flora, fauna and the .environment generally against the entry and spread of exotic pests and diseases, while facilitating the importation of food, animals, plants and related products. Its role is to assist the safe entry and release of biological control agents aimed at combating existing pests and disease problems; to participate actively in the development of international sanitary and phytosanitary standards and procedures consistent with Australia's national interests; and to pursue Australian interests in such negotiations. A further role of AQIS is to ensure that meat and other food products consumed by Australians are wholesome and safe at the point of production, where such products are an AQIS inspection responsibility; to review and revise inspection and quarantine approaches continually to meet and anticipate contemporary and future marketing and trading needs; to develop and apply sound business practices in relation to planning, organisation structure, management practice and service delivery; and to encourage excellence in the application of professional, technical, administrative, management and leadership skills. I think there would be general agreement that AQIS does meet its food inspection and supervisory functions very well. However, it is in the last two areas that I believe improvements can be made to the operations of the organisation. Calls for changes to these last two measures have come from the expressed industry concerns about the on-costs of AQIS services and, once again, this government and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) are responding to the concern of rural industries. That will require a cultural change from the service and from domestic meat works. The bills are designed to encourage the development of quality assurance in domestic meat works that will lead to improved efficiencies and a better product. They will develop a management structure in the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that will have to be as competitive in terms of price and quality as services provided by the private sector. In future, it is likely that AQIS increasingly will be competing against the private sector for its domestic meat inspection services. If it is to compete successfully, it will have to be much more efficient than it is now. Already in Victoria we are seeing domestic meat inspection services being opened to competition, and similar systems are likely to start soon in other states. This will mean more open competition for services at domestic meat works, and that will mean that AQIS prices will have to diminish. The three-tiered charging regime proposed under this and associated legislation is part of a four-year government plan to reduce the costs of AQIS services to the domestic meat industry. It is one of many efficiencies implemented by this government. We only need to look at the consumer price index figures released yesterday to show how effective these measures have been. The falling cost of communications, Australian manufactured goods, motor vehicles, airline travel and major improvements in port efficiencies are all evidence of the success of .this government's programs. The objectives of the three-tiered charging system proposed in this legislation are to improve efficiency, equity, consistency, transparency and simplicity. One of the biggest problems industry had with the existing charging system of AQIS was the lack of transparency. It was this lack of transparency which led most to the question of efficiency. This and associated bills will improve both. They are part of a four-year program of reform of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The effect of these changes will be felt throughout the entire meat industry and through the community generally. It is widely recognised that Australian farmers are some of the most efficient in the world, and it is also widely believed-often incorrectly-that the efficiencies of these farmers are hindered by the government charges and regulations. These changes mean that we will retain the integrity of our food standards-and that is essential-but we will deliver them more efficiently to the industry and to the consumer, and that can be done transparently. Even the decision to go to full cost recovery of services will not impact on the cost to industry. This year we will reach 95 per cent cost recovery and will move to 100 per cent next year. But this does not mean there will be extra cost to the industry. Last financial year the cost to the meat industry of AQIS services was $80.6 million. Despite going to full cost recovery, it is likely that the cost to the industry will be the same next year as in the current year, but will fall to $78.2 million in the first full year of operation of these measures in 1994-95, and by 1996-97 will have fallen to $70.5 million. . These are significant and necessary reductions. They will result in the cost per inspector falling from $69,169 currently to $65,164 next year, and eventually to around $59,000 a year when the program is fully implemented. These reductions, unfortunately, do not come without significant reductions in the number of AQIS staff. As the shadow minister, the honourable member for Gwydir, mentioned, it is expected that the result will be a reduction from 2,000 to 1,350 of Commonwealth AQIS staff, a fall of about one-third, and a reduction from 600 to 500 state AQIS staff. That is a total reduction of 750 staff. Obviously this has concerned and angered members of the Public Sector Union who are threatening industrial action to jeopardise $4 billion industry. But it is important for the Public Sector Union to recognise that, without these efficiency measures, the jobs of its members will be under further threat from the competition posed by the private sector which, as I have already mentioned, is being introduced to domestic meat processing. In other words, if efficiency· measures are not introduced, it is likely that more jobs of more members will go. Yesterday I had some time to talk with members of the Cattle Council about this legislation. Generally it is supportive of the moves being undertaken by the government to reduce the costs of services. However, although it understood the time constraints facing the government, the industry was concerned about the amount of consultation that had been taken on with the industry on this and other bills. That is something for which we can thank honourable members opposite and their colleagues in the Senate. As we all know, the Liberal and National parties, in alliance with the ideologically different Greens and Democrats, imposed deadlines on this House for the introduction of budget measures in the Senate. These measures relate to the collection of fees and charges from the cattle industry. They are considered to be taxation measures, and they are subject to the same absurd deadline as other budget measures. It is a situation well recognised by the Cattle Council and other organisations faced with negotiating with the government on important measures over a very short time span. It is worth honourable members opposite noting that these organisations are not happy about these imposed deadlines. I think that there should be more time for consultation with industry. In my discussions yesterday with the Cattle Council, it gave broad support to the measures being introduced in the bill. The substantive objection to the measures was in relation to the proposed throughput charge. It claimed that the throughput charge may discourage establishments from pursuing efficiency gains. The government is carefully considering these concerns, and I am confident we can reach a position which is more than satisfactory to the this industry. It is important to note, as I said before, that this bill does not lock the government into the throughput charge. As I said earlier, the beef cattle industry is one of the biggest industries in my electorate. Figures from the New South Wales Department of Agriculture show that the north coast of New South Wales region has about 850,000 head of cattle. It is the region's biggest single income earner,. being worth about $140 million annually. It provides about 13 per cent of the total production in New South Wales. We have export abattoirs at Wingham, Macksville, Grafton and Casinothe last two being. in my electorate-and scores of smaller domestic works. It is recognised along the east coast as an important nurturing ground where cattle are produced for fattening in other areas of Australia. The beef industry on the north coast is spread over the entire region and is based largely on running breeding herds. About three quarters of these herds produce weaners, with the remainder selling vealers and growing-out or finishing steers. Store weaner producing herds are mostly run on native lower quality pasture areas and calves are in store condition at six to 12 months of age. My electorate of Page is also home to the largest meat processing plant in the southerri hemisphere.....:.the Northern Cooperative Meat Co. at Casino. The Casino meat works is capable of processing more than one million kilograms of dressed carcass each week. As I mentioned earlier, the legislative changes before the House tonight would require an attitudinal change from domestic meat processors .and from AQIS. I think that the industry is ready and keen to accept these challenges. This week the Casino meat works celebrates 60 years of meat processing. I will be joining the people of Casino to celebrate that event over the weekend. To mark the celebration, this week the local newspaper published a feature on the meat company. One article in particular illustrated how successful meat processors were likely to have little difficulty meeting the challenges presented by these changes. The article said that the expressions of international competitiveness and quality assurance may be today's buzz words in Australian industry, but when the Northern Cooperative Meat Co. was established in 1933 such concepts were really not known. Nevertheless, the earliest directors of the company set a clear goal for themselves and their successors-that the company would operate the most efficient abattoir in Australia. Their aim was a company that would supply customers with a product which exactly met their specifications-the essence of quality. The board was determined that the abattoir and its product should be second to none and should be a source of pride for its directors, its shareholders and employees. Quality through customer service and innovation could well have been its guiding principles. The company has always been at the forefront of innovation as a means of improving product quality and efficiency of production. The introduction of the Canpak system of carcass dressing dramatically improved production and productivity. Vacuum packaging of meat began in the 1960s and revolutionised meat marketing. Instead of butchers having to obtain carcass meat from centralised meat halls, retail butchers could now obtain high quality, fresh vacuum packed meat cuts direct from the company's operators. In the 1980s organochlorine pesticide residues and anti-microbial residues in Australian meat· posed a serious threat to our export market. The northern co-op pioneered the use of computer systems on the slaughter floor to more efficiently match each animal to the residue history of the property of origin. Cattle from properties with a recent history of residue problems could be sampled and checked. Carcasses with unacceptable residues were excluded from domestic and export markets to ensure that they did not reach consumers. As organochlorine residues were brought under control, European Community and Swedish requirements that the company supply its consumers with meat from cattle which have never been treated with HGP set a familiar challenge which the company met head on. The use of computer systems enabled the company to ensure that the requirements of these countries were consistently met. The company now produces meat which is among the safest in the world in its level of chemical residues. In the 1990s, control and prevention of bacterial growth on meat will become an important quality issue for the company as the expectations of consumers change. For yeats the company has been swabbing equipment used for the dressing of carcasses and the boning of meat to check the thoroughness of cleansing and disinfection. Prevention programs will need to involve livestock producers to ensure that the animals supplied are clean, healthy and adequately tested for slaughter. In 1991 the company took the first steps to formally document and implement a quality system. Training of employees and better communication at all levels has been essential in preparing employees and their supervisors for the changes involved. The company's quality assurance program, recently intensified in the boning room, will extend to even tighter controls on the slaughter room. It will form the groundwork for the adoption of total quality management and ISO 9000 in the future. The way the Northern Cooperative Meat Co. has approached the challenges it has faced shows that it, as well as many other meat companies, will be ready to accept the challenges presented by this bill. Those who are not willing to keep their quality high are the ones likely to get into trouble. Australia is an efficient producer of beef products, but it often has to compete in a world market corrupted by subsidies. As the beef industry understands, a small trading nation like Australia cannot compete with the giants in subsidies. Our choices are to Iiberalise world trade, which· we are doing through the Cairns Group and GATT; to become even more efficient; and to promote ourselves as being c1el,ln and green-a marketing program that is developing increasing relevance and impetus in world trade. It is a program which will have increasing relevance in the growing markets of Asia. As the wealth of the Asian nations is growing, so is the consumption of beef and beef products. Australia is in a prime position to take advantage of that growth and, with proper marketing and the right policy directions, that can be achieved. Tonight we are showing that we are capable of and willing to make the solid policy decisions necessary to improve the performance of our beef industry. The beef industry is just starting to emerge from a long period of severely depressed prices. But just as floods can improve productive capacity of farming land, depressed commodity prices often take out the uncompetitive producers and processors and place those remaining in the industry in a stronger position to take advantage of improving prices. With proper policy settings, they are more resilient to fluctuations in the future. The changes before this House tonight are about getting those policy settings right. They are not about reducing the level or quality of service provided by AQIS; they are about providing those services more efficiently. I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for taking note of the concerns I expressed to him about AQIS since he, became minister and for having the determination to set positive policy settings in place. I believe that this legislation will be well and truly appreciated by the industry. I commend the bill to the House.",130
193,Mr TUCKEY,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"I probably have the record in this House for the longest speeches on and the most contributions to the issue of the functi.ons of AQIS and meat inspection in general. I am reminded of the days of the Fraser government when AQIS-then called DPI-was fully exposed to the public gaze because the National Inspection Service was involved in fraud. The inspectors-for the mere handout each week of a basket of meat, et cetera-were up to their eyebrows in it. It wa,s called meat substitution. Anything would do as long as it could be put in a box and taken out of the country. It is an interesting situation because whenever we get into a debate about having a government inspection service, it is traditionally held up as being something better than the private sector could provide. It is always put to us that if we let the nasty old private sector do it, it is bound to cheat. But the evidence in the area of food and meat inspection is that all the bad things have been done by a government service. It has no credibility at all. I have seen Liberal government ministers stand up here and take a hiding on account of what has occurred with their public servants. But I have a further interest because the Western Australian government was not as silly as the governments of Victoria and New South Wales. Industry was fed up with multiple inspection arrangements. Whilst many states had two inspection arrangements-state price and federal-Western Australia had three: local, state and federal. The industry campaigned quite foolishly for one service. It is fairly logical that it looked to the one that could. cover export, local consumption and shire abattoirs. On the face of it, that was Commonwealth service. Anybody who would like to search the Hansard will find where I said at that time, 'You are choosing the worse st<rvice of three'. Of course, I did not stop at that point; I brought evidence before the parliament to that effect. It does Neville Wran and the Premier of Victoria, who might have been Liberal, no credit that they were too stupid to see it. Western Australia, which gets attacked so frequently for its conservative views, hung onto its three-tier structure. As a consequence, domestic meat processors, in particular, have had much cheaper and equally efficient services. . I could give an example of an isolated instance of corruption in that service. A local government meat inspector, qualified in or exactly the same way as a federal meat of inspector through the same tertiary process, participated in making meat stamps available to some abattoir operators. It is interesting note that the two abattoir operators are now $68,000. in gaol and I think the meat inspector got fined. I cannot work out the logic behind that. But, generally, the people of Western Australin is have been singularly protected from meat substitution at the domestic level. There have been no outbreaks of typhoid or cholera, and there is a very good reason for that, as I just explained. Meat inspectors are qualified through an education and training system. Consequently, once licensed to work for government, they should be able to work for anyone and have the integrity of other inspectors in the private sector. I still have a number of abattoirs in my electorate of O'Connor, which ged somewhat through redistribution. But I once had two in the Northam shire, both of which were-and still are-involved purely in the domestic service. One of them chose go into export. All of a sudden it started to confronted with the additional costs-this was long before we had all of these arrangements that are put before us today. I nearly died when I saw the comparative cost of the local service provided by a local government authority. The rates, which were both throughput rates in those days, the by law and one rate was about half the other. There was a huge drain on the taxpayer at the federal level and the local authority was in there fighting and scratching to maintain its the service which used to make a profit. One might ask me why this was so. As far as one could see, there were similar award structures. then People were remunerated and quite happy. a Each operation was equally qualified. I rang the local authority today to find out how much it might cost to service a head of cattle in that particular abattoir. I was told that it costs $3.20-no extras, no three-scale charges, no nothing. It is a good service provided happily and with efficiency. There are no strikes and no trouble. It goes through 35,000 head of cattle per annum-it is not exactly a little works. If it puts through less more than that, it still pays $3.20 per head cattle. That is $112,000 for a year's operation provided by the shire at a profit, compared with the cost of a single Commonto wealth inspector under the present scale of I am not sure who will follow me to speak this debate, but I made some remarks earlier today about the first responsibility of a member of parliament. That responsibility is to the people who put their trust in that have member. That is an unknown quantity on the vacant benches of the government. Government members, such as the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), sign a piece of paper which says, 'The Labor Party comes first'. That sort of requirement is not placed on members on this side of the House. If it were, has chanI would not. be here. It is no good questioning my integrity in that regard; the record stands for me. I remind the House of a vote I lost 118 to 2 when I, to with the assistance of one other member, be stood for some people in rural areaS who were about to lose the right to feed their children. We all know that that is not the way to get promoted in this place. But when it gets down to the services of our community, if we represent cattle growers and meat producers, let us ask ourselves: why can we not have the were set best possible service? This proposal does not give that to us. In truth, the Commonwealth would be much better contracting the shire of Northam to do its work, provided it was given a clean sheet of paper and told to run the industry in the way it should be run. There is another step in this process. I became, I thought, somewhat of an expert during the meat substitution inquiry. I had gained this knowledge in representing the interests of the people of Northam who, like the meat producers; were not at all interested in having the Commonwealth come on board and take over the service they were providing. So I decided to offer my advice to the royal commission. The royal commission met in Perth and I gave my evidence. My evidence was simple; I had established it in this place. I did not do that by correspondence with the department, because it lied to me. The head of the DPI wrote to me-I could produce the letter if it were demanded-and said that the importing countries, the people who buy our meat, obliged and demanded that the federal government of Australia provide meat inspection services and employ the meat inspectors. I put that question to the then minister. In those days, telling the truth in this place was considered to be the way to go. The minister could not confirm the advice I had received from the head of the department. He had to tell me that that was not the case-and I knew that. The responsibility of the Commonwealth is to supervise meat inspection. Yes, the Commonwealth signs the final certificate, just as it does for the aeroplanes that are inspected here for international travel. But the difference is that, in the case of aeroplanes, employee of private enterprise does the inspection. That employee is licensed and is referred to as a LAME-licensed aircraft maintenance engineer. There is a huge difference. The Commonwealth could provide, as many nations do, a supervisory service at no cost to the industry. That is a reasonable cost, in terms of our export effort, for the government to bear. We could have a tight and reasonable operation. The huge cost of employing meat inspectors, their supervision and the flexibility that would flow from such a system should be the responsibility of the works. Someone will jump up to speak after me, as did the QC or the barrister-which indicates the sort of funding that was involved in the royal commission-representing the meat inspectors union at the inquiry into meat substitution. He asked: was it not a fact that, if I let the nasty private sector get into meat inspection, we would have even bigger problems? . In response, I first had to remind him that I thought this royal commission, which was a pretty serious event, was into meat substitution condoned by government meat inspectors and that it was pretty clear where the corruption arose. Of course, the royal commission eventually established that beyond doubt. I then asked him-and I have intimated this already-how he had managed to arrive in Perth. He said that he flew by Australian Airlines, which was then called TAA. I asked him, 'Who do you think certified your plane safe for the journey-a government inspector?' He answered, 'No, a LAME'. Someone might want to jump up and give me the isolated example of this plane crash but I think history will show that, even on that occasion, all the right notes were put there. The operator just did not take notice of them. The inspector had done his job. Those inspectors-and I know, because I have held a private pilots licence-are as tough as nails. Do honourable members know why they are as tough as nails? It is because the inspectors know that if they were to allow the type of corruption which has been experienced in the meat industry, they would lose their licenan ces-licences granted by government only after they have demonstrated their ability. Surely meat inspectors also have to demonstrate their ability. Meat inspectors have something to defend. They do not take kindly to the boss saying, 'Slip a bit of kangaroo or something else into that meat pack. Turn your back. I will give you your weekly. meat supply'. This was the great tragedy of meat substitution. That was the level of the bribes. A whole national industry was at risk because someone got free meat on the weekend. These people do not have to fear that now. How many strikes have we seen because people have been caught stealing? They were dismissed, and the rest of the work force went on strike to protect them. There is no way that a Commonwealth meat inspector could get the sack now-not for silly little things such as corruption. That is the truth. And we wonder why the system stinks. This is what we are up against. We are not only up against the cost; we have also in this legislation and in the debate that has taken place an admission that the industry has SOO people more than it needs. I do not think the taxpayer should carry SOO people that are not needed, and I do not think the industry should carry those people. We, as the elected representatives of the people, have a responsibility to the people to do something about that matter. It is not all tied up with our philosoJust. phy or with what Bill Kelty or someone else says. Look at the people who, through drought and other things which we politicians cannot control, are in dire economic straits. We may have heard of the story of the woman who said, 'Next time you bring us out a parcel, could you bring us some boots for my husband because he is getting around barefoot?'. Yet veterinarians-the creme de la creme of AQIS-went on strike because someone had the temerity to question whether they were needed. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) tried to do something about that issue. As I said, we do not have to really worry about meat quotas in America. The local vets - re fixing that up. We are not producing any export meat this week. It is a tragedy and something which we have to address. A meat inspector receives $32,000, and there are, SO per cent oncosts in the works. That comes to $48,000; we charge $70,000. Of course meat inspectors-those hands-on peopleshould be employed in the works. They should be subject to the vagaries of the meat industry. They should not have public service permanency. The industry is just not like that. The poor old slaughts do not get that. Nobody else gets it in the industry. Hopefully, the remuneration recognises that-although, I remind honourable members that Paul Houlihan, who mayor may not be liked on the other side because of his role with the NFF in the days of Mudginberri, said at a conference where I was once, 'Most meatworkers are poorly paid'. He is right. 'But', he said, 'their productivity is lousy'. They are denied the right to earn a decent quid because their union officials refuse to recognise that it is 1993. They are still living in 1933, with the old tally systems and the like. Then politicians impose a public service mentality on top of that and create a situation where their working hours do not even line up. One guy is on penalty rates to start at the same time as the others. His holiday structure and all those other things are the same. They do not start at the same time because of their permanency. This is the reason that the industry no longer wants those SOO people. imagine that happening in any other major industry-the wine industry or the wheat growing industry. How long would BHP last on that basis? The steel industry was to be done away with in Australia until this government, to its credit, said that it could rationalise its employment structure. Those who remain have security. The industry survives and it holds a really high place in Australia. It i- silly, heart breaking, to impose on an industry costs that cannot be justified. The honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) carried on when he read another speech that I get the feeling was written in the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Why are we going to add complexity? The situation is bad enough now. I can say something for 100 per cent charges: it eventually exposed the industry to what the say, true cost was. If we are to have a premises charge, will it be higher if people are farther away from the city? Remember that the meat industry is established in the country, but the head office is always in the city. Will everybody be measured out? Will the premises charge be higher the further out they are-if they are in the worse possible situation out there? They happen to be where the cattle are, but that does not suit the public service mentality. I admit that in Northam, in my electorate, the throughput charge is $3.20. Everybody is happy with that charge-because that is the sole charge, and it is cheap. But the government will put a throughput charge on top of that. That means that the more efficient they are-,-the more they can push through their works-the more the government will charge them. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) made the point that our performance against Americans is so bad because, in truth, we do not give inspectors many cattle to look at. But those who can do a bit better will be hit. There will still be a charge placed per inspector. So at least there was something that people could complain about; now, the government will add two components to that because, we suggest, it might be more transparent. I do not mind how transparent it is. Then we get hit with emotionalism. Some organochlorines were discovered in meat the other day by inspectors. They were out saying that there would be three times as much as that if they were not around. They have nothing to do with it. The average on-thechain meat inspector would not have anything to do with the organochlorines discovery, other than when he might cut off the little sample of meat, which any slaught could do. It is a joke. I want to make the point to the government that it has not solved the problem; it is as bad as ever.",134
194,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"Capricornia) (8.59 p.m.)It is amazingly instructive to sit through a speech by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I certainly cannot hope, as anew member, to compete with his profound sense of history. But he has really managed to filibuster and go all over the shop for the last 20 minutes. I suppose that comes from experience and history. Mr Thckey-You weren't listening; that's the problem.",138
195,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"I was listening absolutely attentively. The honourable member mentions the matter of discipline on this side of the House and states quite proudly that he will represent his constituents. The problem for members of the opposition is that they have no discipline; they are all over the shop; and we do not know where they are. Let us compare the position of the honourable member for O'Connor with that of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who put forward a reasoned approach, with some criticisms of the bill. At least there was a basis for negotiation. But with the honourable member for O'Connor, one does not know where to begin because he wants to throw the baby out with the bath water. He suggests that we have no government inspection charges; that we let the meat producers do it. Although I do not have his intimate knowledge of the history of the meat substitution investigation, it is instructive to mention that there were two parties involved; inspectors and the meat processors. What has been missed by the honourable member for O'Connor, and possibly some other members on his side of the House, is that the world has moved on. We are not on about the past, but about the future. The future is about having an efficient, export oriented industry and an efficient industry for the domestic market. That will involve a number of players; primary producers, meat processors and workers in that industry. One thing that is quite clear from the election result is that our approach to change is to take all parties with us; to negotiate with producers, processors and· workers, rather than threaten them. In this bill and the industrial relations legislation that was presented in the House today we are seeing that this government is prepared to negotiate with all the stakeholders to move towards an. effective, efficient industry. It would be more helpful if honourable members with the experience of the honourable member for O'Connor would get back on track and start working towards an effective industry. The Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill will impose an annual charge on domestic abattoirs, knackeries, meat processing plants and animal food processing plants in all states where the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, currently undertakes meat inspection services for the domestic market. In imposing these charges, it is attempting to make sure that the industry starts dealing effectively with costs. This will mean that some meat processing establishments, which have not been paying their way, will have to do so. As has been made clear in the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), the annual charges will be $40,000 for abattoirs and, in descending order, $5,000 for meat processing plants, and $1,000 for knackeries and animal food processing plants. These charges will apply from 1 January 1994 and will be on a pro rata basis. The charge will be levied on the accredited operator. We will not make a lot of revenue out of this-$1.1 million for the first six months and $2.2 million for a full year. The costs of processors will be offset by the planned reduction in the per inspector charge for the current inspection services. As the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the minister made clear, this is part of a planned review and reform of AQIS to reduce costs to industry, while retaining integrity of the service and ensuring confidence in the quality of our export and domestic meat products. The restructuring will involve three major elements, bringing a stronger business orientation to AQIS and encouraging self-managed accountability to the industry-something the honourable member for O'Connor is interested in. One of the things it aims to do is encourage the industry to take responsibility for quality assurance, so that all the players in the processing end of the industry will be working effectively towards a better quality product. Inspection services will be reduced and more effective use will be made of in-house accountability. Mr Thckey-Do you really think we will get anything by the Olympic Games?",138
196,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,This is typical of the honourable member for O'Connor. He is such a clever person that I have to be very careful. about What I say.,139
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,I invite the honourable member to ignore the interjections and I invite the honourable member for O'Connor not to interject.,139
198,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"We will provide a restructuring of AQIS over a four-year period and reduce the numbers of personnel, resulting in improved efficiency. As opposed to radical, revolutionary change that would please the honourable member for O'Connor, we are going to do it in an orderly, structured way. In order to proceed with industrial change, we need to change the culture; the work practices and staff in the meat processing industry. There will be a cultural change and a shift by those operators in the way they handle staff. We cannot do something effectively in industry by radical change. We have to take people along. If one thing has been made clear, it is that the electorate likes to have change on an orderly basis. That is the way to get effective restructuring in this important industry. As the honourable member for Page indicated, the government has had extensive negotiations with public sector unions, the Cattle Council of Australia and the meat processing industry. In response to the honourable memthe ber for O'Connor, it should be noted that AQIS staff are some of the best-trained food technologists in the country. Mr Thckey-No they are not; they are about the same as everyone else.",139
199,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,They have tertiary qualifications. Mr Thckey-Where are the special qualifications?,139
200,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"If the honourable member for O'Connor would listen, rather than speak incessantly, he would hear that many of these people will be taken up within the quality assurance process. So rather than suggest that these people have no skills, he should understand that they will be taken up within the industry in a very effective way. We will thus overcome the inefficiencies by having people in areas where they are needed. As the honourable member for Page indicated, efficient, quality producers will forge ahead in both the domestic and export markets. Those groups that are not prepared to cope with the change will not do well. This will be particularly important for our cattle producers, who are always squeezed in these difficult circumstances. As the honourable member for O'Connor quite correctly said, we cannot control the weather; and drought has been a major problem for our cattle producers.· As we attempt to look at change, we have to involve our cattle producers in the negotiations. In that - ay we can have a very effective consultative process at all levels of the industry. Only one aspect of the three-tiered model that we are looking at is the focus of the bill-the annual premises charge. We are obviously interested in hearing the concerns of all elements of the industry the throughput charge and the third tier charge. The minister has a reputation with the industry of being prepared to negotiate and of wanting to get this industry on a competitive, commercial basis. The objectives are laudable and would be accepted by most honourable members-efficiency, equity, transparency and simplicity. These are. the sorts of things we need to do to make this industry effective. Mr Thckey-Is that your Olympic Games speech?",139
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,The honourable member for O'Connor should not interject and the honourable member for Capricornia should not respond to the interjections. She should ignore them.,140
202,Ms HENZELL,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"I would hate to ignore someone who has made such a contribution to this House. Whenever the honourable member gets up in question time he immediately becomes the focus of attention for the many irrelevant points of order that he raises. That is his greatest claim to fame; the number of times he participates in question timewhich does not further the integrity of the House. We want quality assurance. The basic aim of this legislation is to ultimately take costs off the industry and create a better quality industry. Over a four-year period we will see a saving of $10 million. This is very important in my electorate of Capricornia because beef production is our major primary industry. Through the meat works we are providing a major export meat processing effort for this country. It is very important for these meat works to lift their game and work with the employees and cattle producers. We will have to look at value adding and new ways of making use of this excellent resource. Central Queensland will be one of those areas that will be able to look at the clean, green and new initiatives that this government is promoting with the involvement of the unions. That is the great difference between the policies promoted by the government and those promoted by people on like the honourable member for O'Connor who was talking about cooperation and export orientated efficiencies. These initiatives also have to be undertaken in Western Australia where we see many idiosyncratic practices. It must be very difficult to be on the western side of this country. However, in Capricornia we have the opportunity to show the way. If the meat processors are prepared to enter into this cooperatively and involve their work force-unfortunately they have not been doing so in more recent times-we will see, as in northern New South Wales, very effective initiatives in this area. I support this bill. I hope that with further negotiations we will obtain the support of the opposition on these very important initiatives. I commend the bill to the House. I also commend the minister and his department for their efforts.",140
203,Mr VAILE,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"I would like to address the House tonight on the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill and cognate bill from the perspective of a very important group involved in this industry, namely, Australia's beef cattle producers. For the past 20 years I have had an intimate association with the. beef industry in my area through family connections. I know exactly what producers go through-the agonies, traumas and hard work-to get their product to the stage that we are talking about this evening, namely, the processing plants at the abattoirs. It takes a great deal of effort. They take a lot of financial, physical and mental risks. There are also problems with the weather and the banks. There is no protection from any statutory marketing and there are no subsidies; it all comes back to the producer. The charges levied by AQIS do not end up on the consumer's plate but back on the producer's plate. All of those things are accounted for before the producer gets his cheque for the stock that he has consigned to the abattoirs. At the outset, I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for attempting to address the problem that has been going on for so many years with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. This government has been in power for many years and it has taken it unti11993 to address a problem that has been there for a long time-an entrenched problem. I would like to open by quoting from my very first speech in this place back in May this year: I should like to mention a number of companies which have undertaken quality assurance programs in an attempt to improve the efficiencies of their businesses and move towards world standard practices. Anvic Meat Exports Pty Ltd of Wingham, which exports the majority of its throughput to Japan, America and Korea, and Port Macquarie Slipways Pty Ltd, have expended thousands of dollars on these quality assurance programs but are yet to see the real benefits from these improvements. The question must be asked: when will the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy undertake a complete review of AQIS and rationalise the meat inspection service in Australia? In my home town of Wingham, Anvic Meat ,exports operates a very modem export abattoir, employs around 250 people and is looking at the possibility of a second shift. I want to put it on the public record that this is an on-cost burden to that company's operation, which it should not have to withstand in today's very competitive export market. We have just heard the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) speak about a number of issues, a few of which I tended to agree with. However, the point is that the industry has restructured itself through discussions with unIons to get the process working properly. The only part on which there has been no discussion or consultation has been the meat inspection service, and I will come to that later in my address. It therefore pleases me greatly to see the rationalisation of AQIS on the agenda. It is pleasing to see that both sides of the House recognise the need for review and reform of AQIS. As I alluded to in my first speech to this House, the goal of the meat inspection service surely should be to move away from a public monopoly such as AQIS towards a much freer self-regulatory approach to quality assurance and quality control. The name of the game must therefore surely be to provide incentives and encouragement for companies to adopt inhouse quality assurance programs. While on the one hand it is pleasing to see this current government trying to push through amendments to AQIS, on the other hand I have many reservations about the government's approach and about the bill before the House tonight. It is worth noting here that, when the coalition launched its policy to cut $20 million out of AQIS, the government said it was not possible to reduce the costs of AQIS. At the start of his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said: I want to make it clear that AQIS fulfils an essential role in protecting Australia against exotic pests and diseases and inspecting food for safety, but I believe it can be done more efficiently at lower cost to Australian industry. I have to wonder what has changed to make the minister change his mind in just six months. Dare I say it, it may have had something to do with the government not wanting to be totally up-front at the last election. However, I commend the government for finally coming to the party and looking at restructuring AQIS. My understanding of this bill is that it will implement a per premises charge on domestic meat establishments where the Commonwealth's meat inspection agency, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, is responsible for domestic inspection. This is the first step in the government's attempt to introduce a complete overhaul of AQIS by the introduction of a three-tier charging regime. That three-tier regime that this and subsequent bills will lead to are as follows: the first tier is a fixed annual charge per premises at which activity is conducted. As alluded to by the honourable member for Capricornia, that premises charge must not exceed $40,000. I dare say that the major export abattoirs in my electorate at Wingham will probably have to withstand that $40,000 charge. The second tier is a throughput or volume charge on relevant products, which will be introduced in a later bill. At this stage unsure of that. That is the part of this whole exercise that the coalition is opposing, as outlined this evening by the shadow minister for primary industry, the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderless so-). The .throughput charge is a charge on incentive and efficiency. The more the an throughput is increased, the more is paid. T,hat should not be part of the spirit of is trying to be done generally to restructure the meat inspection service. In the minister's second reading speech he said: The second tier, throughput charge for export and domestic meat is not proposed for introduction until 1 July 1994 so its imposition has been included the full package of AQIS charging legislation to be introduced later in these budget sittings. We do not know what is involved. We are going to vote againstit. We do not believe it is in the spirit of what we are trying to do restruct\lring a major export industry. The third tier is a charge per inspector per unit of time or a charge per inspection, more commonly known as the inspection charge. From 1 January 1994 the base rate per inspecthe tor charge for domestic meat inspection is planned to decrease from $69,169, which is the current figure alluded to by the honourproach able member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), to $65,164, which is still well above actual cost for that meat inspector to be on that plant doing his job. While I commend the government for trying to bring in reform I have grave reservations about this bill as a lead-up to the three-tiered structure of ch,arging. My main concern with the second tier of this structure which is the throughput or volume charge on relevant products. In the first instance, a throughput charge would discourage establishments from pursuing urgently needed efficiency gains. hear about it every single day in this House. When we get anywhere near a debate about primary production in Australia we hear anecdotal evidence of the comparisons betheir tween the efficiency of throughput in Australworse is, whether it be in abattoirs or other primary industries across the wharves, and that of our trading competitors such as New Zealand, the we are United States and the South-East Asian countries. That must be at the forefront of our minds in what we are attempting to do in this reform because as throughput increases so would the throughput charge increase regardof that establishment's dependence on AQIS. SO an improvement in efficiency and improvement in effectiveness is only going to be discouraged by this throughput charge. what. It does not matter because we only get so many cents or so many dollars per kilo of beef when we sell it. The overhead is there. The more we put through the more we are going to pay. It is going to cause more distrust in the industry. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it in is a drive towards in-house quality assurance due and quality control that must be at the core of this restructuring package. By charging throughput the government is placing a disincentive on efficiency and this essentially in defeats the purpose of reform. I do not think anybody can really dispute that. Secondly, any throughput charge expressed in cattle equivalents is likely to appear on the vendor's invoice, which is quite contrary to charging principles of full cost recovery. It is quality assurance that is my main concern here today. With this three-tiered apto meat inspection charges my concern is whether there will be sufficient encouragement through lower prices for processors to undertake their own quality assurancewhether there is enough encouragement for them to spend the money on quality assurance accreditation programs in these works. I have spoken with a few of the local companies in my electorate such as Hastings is Meat and Anvic Meat Exports, which have both introduced their own quality assurance programs in an attempt to address the currently ridiculous costs of AQIS inspectors. I worry that under the proposed structures with We throughput charges the companies-which have done the right thing; they have spent the money, established their quality accreditation certification in their works and undergone own quality assurance-are going to be off. They have got it in place now; they are still employing the meat inspectors. They are still employing the AQIS staff. We are regulating the industry so that they must. We have along the way subtly encouraged these companies to get involv- in quality assurance and yet we are not providing them with the benefits that should flow on from that quality assurance. The Cattle Council highlights this point in the discussion paper that it has circulated. I will quote from it. It states: It is the Cattle Council's view that this charge, as it is proposed, would prove to be a significant disincentive for the adoption of quality assurance programs because the categories appear too restrictive to reflect efforts by progressive plant operators to pursue such programs. A number of establishments have reported that their AQIS charges are likely to almost double if the charging structure currently proposed were adopted. This would potentially mean the difference between survival and financial ruin. The establishments most affected appear to be those which have, to their credit, adopted significant quality assurance improvements or which are only small exporters at the cutting edge of technology and product development. These are the operators we wish to encourage, not penalise. These are important words because in my electorate I have those two operators who have been a bit forward looking and who have undergone quality assurance off their own bat at great expense. It is forward looking companies such as Anvic Meat Exports and Hastings Meat that must be supported under the current reform package which is before this House. I would like to give an example of the problems faced by these local companies in dealing with the current meat inspectors from AQIS. Hastings Meat at Port Macquarie has about 30 staff, with a throughput of about 160 a day plus about 50 bobby calves. They have one eight-hour shift a day which, from next week, will be from 7.00 a.m. until 3.30 p.m. Hastings Meat is currently in the process of introducing its own quality assurance package. On 1 January next year it will be appointing one full-time in-house quality controller. To do this, to cut back on the use of public meat inspectors from AQIS, it has had to cut back its kill number per hour. It is now down to 25 kills an hour so that if it is done in 45 minutes the inspector, crazily, has to make sure that the operation is put on hold for 15 minutes until the next hour comes around. In an age where best practice techniques are vital to survival in an extremely competitive marketplace, this is an extraordinary restriction on enterprise being placed on this company. Anvic Meat Exports at Wingham is no different, with a much larger throughput of around 480 to 500 head of cattle a day, with a staff of around 250 people. It exports approximately 85 per cent of its throughput to countries such as Japan, America, Korea, New Zealand and Mexico. Anvic has undergone a substantial internal quality assurance program. It currently has four in-house quality controllers compared with the nine meat inspectors and one vet supplied by AQIS at great expense. Yet its substantial QA program led to the cutback in only one meat inspector. So it was still faced with an extremely large bill from AQIS for a service that it had shown it could perform internally if given the right government incentives. The three-tiered charging system, and in particular the second tier of charging throughput volume, does not provide the incentives for companies to take on their own quality control. I agree with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that as a public monopoly providing regulatory services AQIS needs to be able to justify its pricing policies to its clients. I agree with the minister that AQIS needs to make its costs and recoveries visible to its clients. I also agree with the minister that taken together these two points imply transparency and simplicity in charging. But I do not agree with the minister that the three-tiered charging regime is the solution to these problems. This is due to the existence of the charge on throughput. We need to free up the regulatory nature of the current structure, and this will not occur by charging throughput. I am supportive of the Cattle Council's position of the two-tiered structure which clearly identifies a per food standards officer charge and a separate charge covering additional supportive services. The second of these charges must be devised to reflect individual establishments' measures and successes in adopting quality assurance programs and pursuing internal efficiencies such as have occurred at Anvic and Hastings Meat. Additionally, this charge needs to recognise the efforts by innovative exporters who commence trading at low levels. So while I am supportive of this bill here tonight I am very wary of the government's package and in particular the charge on throughput. I believe the government must address this issue for its reform package to have any substance and value within the cattle industry in which AQIS currently operates. In closing I will reiterate my comments about the local operators in my electorate. Back in the early 1980s when we had a major restructuring of the processing plant operations in the slump in the beef industry in Australia we saw a massive rationalisation and reduction in meat processing operators throughout Australia. We were very fortunate in Wing ham that what was a cooperative was bought by a local consortium of graziers and they managed, by scratching and scraping and working in the operation themselves over the years, to maintain their export licence and keep that plant operating. The staff-the members of the union; the people that the honourable member for Capricornia purports to represent-agreed with management to work through that period on three days a week on reduced hours, on set levels of pay, to keep that plant operating open so that, ultimately, one· day, as it is today, it would operate very successfully on a full-time basis, five days a week, and look to work a second shift. Those people all made a commitment to the industry. There are many people-the producers, the workers, the owners of the processing plants and the exporters-who have made major commitments over the years to this industry to make sure that it would survive into the 1990s, producing much needed export income for this Commonwealth of Australia. Those people who have made the changes have changed their culture, work patterns and their attitude to the industry. I put it to the House and to the minister tonight that AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, needs to change its culture, its attitude and the way it operates in this industry in the 1990s.",140
204,Mr SNOW,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"In reply to the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), we can say that AQIS is making very big changes. In fact, part of the change for AQIS has seen the prospects of big reductions in the Canberra area and the region in general. Mr Thckey-You wouldn't want your farm to run like AQIS.",144
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member for O'Connor was silent during the last speech. He should be silent during this speech.,144
206,Mr SNOW,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,It is interesting that AQIS is now looking for a new building in Canberra. Mr Thckey-They could rent one from the ALP.,144
207,Mr SNOW,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"No. I am pleased that it is looking at the Queanbeyan Technology Park. There it would be very close to the airportMr Hawker-Centenary House, Jim.",144
208,Mr SNOW,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"I am delighted to hear the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) support AQIS going to the Queanbeyan Technology Park, which is close to the airport and where there are no parking fees. AQIS would save millions of dollars if it leased the property at Queanand beyan. I would urge AQIS to look seriously at the site there. I know, as part of its restructuring, it will be as interested as we are in saving money for the government. AQIS is essential to our export markets at a time when we are selling $10 billion more to Asia than it is selling to us. Asia is an extremely important and expanding meat market. AQIS is important for the initiatives being taken in Europe. I recently led a delegation to Europe. The European Parliament had a draft resolution to ban all kangaroo product imports. We convinced them that AQIS, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Customs Service are able to check the quality of product exported from Australia and the types of species used in the exports so that the 10 or so species which should not be harvested-which are either endangered or under some threatwould not be allowed to be exported. Europe is now importing wild pig meat. France objected that Australian wild pigs were domestic pigs which had escaped. When one goes to France one finds that its wild pigs are farmed on farms; they are not even obtained from the wild. We were able to explain to the European Parliament what we thought the term 'wild pig' meant, and I believe we were able to persuade it to our view. I compliment not only my colleagues on the delegation but also the work of the embassies in Brussels and Strasbourg under Ted Pocock. Abattoirs have closed. Our abattoirs desperately need to be encouraged. When thinking of the abattoirs in my own electorate at Eden, Cooma, Tilba and the Mulligan abattoir just outside of Queanbeyan, it is quite evident they are having a fairly tough time. The proposals in this legislation provide for reduced costs. For instance, the annual cost of the staff is expected to fall from a base rate now of $69,169-about $45 an hour-to $65,164 by January 1994 and to $59,164 by July 1994. To meet industry needs, there could be $10 million in savings over the next four years from the effects of the legislation and the package being negotiated by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) with the industry. In considering the role and activities of AQIS, we need to remind ourselves that without AQIS there could be a substantial threat to our exports.' The role of AQIS is to aid the export of Australian food, plants and live ;mimals and related products, not just through inspection and certification but also by providing information and observing the treaties, including fitness for human consumption, wholesomeness, truth in labelling and animal and plant health. So the work of AQIS in the meat industry is very important. AQIS also maintains needed protection for Australian consumers and rural industries. It assists safe entry and release of biological control agents aimed at combating existing pests and disease problems. It participates actively in the development of international sanitary and phytosanitary standards and procedures consistent with Australia's national interests. It ensures that meat and other food products consumed by Australians are wholesome and safe. It reviews and revises inspection and quarantine approaches. It develops and applies sound business practices in relation to. planning, organisation structure, management practice and service delivery, and it encourages excellence in the application of professional, technical,. administrative, management and leadership skills. It is important also to consider the objectives of AQIS-efficiency, equity, consistency, transparency and simplicity. I think that is what the honourable member for Lyne was asking for. The government has the will, I believe now that AQIS management has the will and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and its staff have the will to meet that the objectives. Something has had to be sacrificed in order to get that determination to prospects meet those, objectives. What will the impact be on industry? It is expected that in 1993-94 and 1994-95 the larger domestic and export abattoir operators who have taken up existing opportunities to use AQIS meat inspection staff more efficiently-the honourable member for Lyne was giving examples of abattoirs trying to do that-will see their AQIS charges fall by about 10 per cent under the new charging regime. Some of the smaller, less efficient domestic and export meat pet food operators and processors may see their charges rise a littleagain, by less than 10 per cent. As the full effect of the reforms takes place beyond 1995, the falls in charges will become larger and they will spread to those smaller operators. The cold stores may suffer somewhat. Cold stores are exceptions to those patterns because the existing charging regime is unable to reflect recent changes to inspection practices in them. They have apparently been undercharged for the past few years. Industry consultation has occurred on the three-tiered charging regime. My opinion is that we do not need to be wed necessarily to the third tier, but consultation on the threetiered regime is continuing with both the export and domestic sectors of the meat industry. The approach to consultation is directed to better infonning industry about the three-tiered charging regime and to generating industry acceptance of it as part of the wider refonns of AQIS announced in the budget. The proposal has been discussed in depth with key peak bodies-the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council and the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia. As recently as yesterday, I learnt that the minister is still having discussions with the cattle industry. Naturally, the industry is guarded in its attitude and its response to what is happening. It is true that there is a degree of scepticism that the new charges represent genuine refonn· and are in the best interests of industry. That view, by the way, is more strongly expressed by the domestic sector than the export sector. But the Meat Exporters Federal Council and the Meat and Allied Trades Federation are often better infonned about proposals-I believe the same happened with the wine industry-than their memberships and have been pretty supportive. I do not propose to speak for much longer, other than to emphasise again that AQIS is a necessity within Australia. If mistakes are made, not only our rural industries but our local rural towns could have their economies crippled. They could be devastated by an outbreak of disease or by mistakes that occur if AQIS does not continually monitor the industry. It plays an important part in our export service. AQIS is particularly important outside Australia for the continued growth in our primary industry exports. I am pleased to support the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill and Export Inspection Charges Laws Amendment Bill.",144
209,Mr HAWKER,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"In joining this debate on the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill and cognate bill, I would like to start by reminding this House that yet again we are debating legislation under a guillotine. I think it .is absolutely outrageous. It seems the government is putting almost every bill that comes into this chamber now under guillotine. I believe our basic democratic rights are now being severely curtailed by the behaviour of this government. It has been made very clear that the coalition will not be supporting the throughput charge that is being proposed by the government. This is for very good reasons that have been outlined by my colleagues. I pick up a couple of points from my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) which I think are very valid and which the government has not even bothered to address. First of all, I refer to redundancy payments. It is pretty rich that the government is loading all these redundancy payments on to the industry. If we look at the treatment of other industries in AustraliaMr Anderson-What about the wharfies?",146
210,Mr HAWKER,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"Exactly; look at what the government did for the waterside workers. An amount of $100 million was loaded on to taxpayers for those redundancy payments. When it comes to primary industry, it seems that there are two standards yet again. No matter what other members of the government might say, it shows very clearly the priorities of this government. The other point that my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir brought up which I think is very valid-the government ought to be reminded of this; in fact, it is coalition policy-is cutting the cost of meat inspection. It is funny how after the election the government has found that savings can be made when beforehand it kept saying, 'No, no. We cannot do that'. I suppose we have got used to that sort of thing from this government. It again reinforces the sort of attitude and contempt with which the Labor Party treats not only this parliament but the people of Australia. In listening to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow)-I am sorry he has already left the chamber-I found it extraordinary how quick he was to praise AQIS. I am not saying that it does not do some good work, but let me assure him that I still believe there is a lot of room for improvement. While savings of $10 million may be suggested, when we look at the wider costs that are being imposed on the meat industry right now, I believe that that is just scratching the side. I will come to this in more detail because, in all seriousness, we have a long way to go before we start to match world best practice in processing meat. I must admit that the blind and uncritical support of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was almost nauseating. The reason this throughput charge will S? strongly - pposed by the coalition is quite sImply that It does not give recognition for efficiency gains. There are many meat works around now which have made dramatic - mprovements. It seems quite stupid to penalIse these meat works for making these improvements by saying they will still pay the same charges as everyone else, whether or not they have made those improvements. The other concern I have about this legislaYet tion is the way it deals with very small butchers. Some people in western Victoria operate very small butcher sheds and kill probably only half a day a week. Nonetheless, they serve the local communities very well. That local service should be given every opportunity to survive. If we look at some of the proposed charges under the three-tiered system, for a small butcher shed-which would come under category 2 with up to two hours inspection a week-we can see that the fixed costs will go from $1,812 up to $4231 in the coming year, and then to $4,693. That is a very dramatic jump; it is well over do-ble. If .we look at what the charges are betng proVIded for, we find that there is only 20 minutes of inspection-that is, when it is done-yet because of the location there will be a minimum charge of three hours at $45 dollars an hour. If a butcher kills on average about 18 sheep a week, two pigs and three head of cattle, that works out to nearly $5 a sheep, $5 a pig or something approaching $20 a head for. the cattle. That is an amazing impost on something that really ought to organised in a much cheaper way. In Victoria, a number of people have aled in Hansard. ready moved to cut that cost by adopting a slaughterhouse code. I think it is fairly important that the Minister for Primary IndusTABLE 1: COMPARISON OF NA 1.13 0.41 1.05 Source: Booz Allen, International Comparisons in tries and Energy (Mr Crean) take on board given that these people have now adopted thi-ode and have been tr-ined to operate it, that It seems quite stupid to be imposing this level be of charge. Clearly, it is way above any reasona-le amount for this type of service. Looking carefully at those costs, it seems that only the very big works will be better off under the proposed three-tiered charges. Again, I think this renects the sort of attitude that this government has. It really does not care about the small person. In fact, it has a pathological dislike for small business. The g-vernment will - o out of its way to try to Cripple small busmess at every opportunity. again we are seeing in the way this charging system has been set up small butch. ers being penalised. Clearly, everything that possibly can be done is being done to try to drive them out of business. I would like to tum to some of the wider costs - h-t are. imposed on the meat industry when It IS trytng to compete with the rest of the world. Part of those costs, of course, are government charges, particularly the cost of - nspection. I wish to draw on a very interesttng study undertaken by Booz-Allen entitled 'International comparisons in the beef processing industry' which was released on 25 March this year. That study looked at the best facilities in Australia and compared them with the best-in-class facilities in the United States New Zealand, Argentina and Ireland. We find virtually across the board that Australian hestin-class facilities are disadvantaged relative to our competitors when it comes to government charges, and inspection in particular. Some of the other Australian facilities .are at an even greater disadvantage. I have a document here be - hich sho-s the total meat processing costtn Austrahan dollars per kilogram finished weight, which I seek leave to have incorporatLeave granted. The document read as followsTOTAL MEAT PROCESSING COSTS (A$/KgFW) NA 0.86 0.72 0.61 . the Beef Processing Industry, 25 March 1993, p IV-4.

211,Mr HAWKER,TOTAL DIFFERENCE,"I thank the House. The first table shows that the total processing cost in Australia is about $1.13 per kilogram. If we look at the figure for the United Statesremembering that this comparison was done in order to compare apples with apples; a lot of work has been done so that we do have a proper comparison-we find that it is just 41c. So in Australia it is $1.13; in the United States it is 4lc. The figure for Argentina is $1.05; in Ireland, it is 86c. In New Zealand, in the traditional works it is 72c and under the new hot boning system it is 61c. So the cost in New Zealand is about half of Austra!is.'s - os-. Of course, i- the United States. It IS slgOlfi-antly less. T-ls s-ows .how much the Austrahan producer IS being dlsadvantaged by that cos- structure. The second table gIves a breakdown of the cost structure for best-in-class facilities in each of the countries. We find that the differences are even more significant in various aspects of the cost breakdown. For example, with regard to the labour component of the overseas works, in the United States there is an advantage over Australia of 42c per kilogram; in Argentina, 26c; in Ireland, 20c; and in New Zealand, up to nearly 40c a kilogram. ' Mr TUCKEY - That's nearly the profit margin.",148
212,Mr HAWKER,TOTAL DIFFERENCE,"It is more than the profit margin. This is the interesting one: when it comes to government charges and, in particuCOST ADVANTAGES OF THE UNITED STATES, NEW ZEALAND OVER AUSTRALIA (Ac/KgFW) NA NA 42.2 26.2 '20.6 27.3 39.5 7.0 (5.9) (0.4) 6.3 7.6 5.6 2.7 3.7 1.8 2.1 6.1 (1.2) 5.4 3.1 4.0 4.3 (1.0) 0.9 0.5 1.9 6.3 (13.2) (3.2) 2.0 (3.0) 71.5 7.6 27.0 41.0 52.1 muscle meat cuts, manufacturing and ground beef, and sold as meat (boxed), not by-products.) lar, inspection, we find that in the United States there is an advantage-in other words, a saving, if you like-over Australia of over 6c a kilogram. That is very significant. I suggest to government members and to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that we have an awfully long way to go before we start to match that figure. The figure for government charges and inspection in Argentina shows they are slightly worse off, but in Ireland and New Zealand they are significantly better off-up to 4c a kilogram better off, just in regard to government charges and inspection. The table shows that the total cost advantage to the United States over Australia is over 70c a kilogram. If we look at the figure for New Zealand, which has the hot boning works, we find that the cost advantage over Australia is over 50c a kilogram. Those figures are very significant. If this government were serious about trying to make our meat processing industry world competitive and making sure that our cattle producers were competing on a fairer basis, it would be tackling a lot more than just the cost of meat inspection. Even on that score, we are a long way behind world best practice and certainly a long way behind both the United States and New Zealand. It behoves all cattle producers-in fact, all meat producers-to look long and hard at this cost difference because it is very significant. Most of it cannot be explained away by governments saying, 'It's different in Australia', because the difference in Australia is the fact that we have not tried to aim for world best practice, and we have a long, long way to go. Just on government charges and inspection alone, our meat producers and meat processors are significantly worse off than our competitors. I venture to say this bill is going to do remarkably little to tackle the major problems in this area. I quote from a couple of parts of the Booz-Allen report: While Australian participants are aware of technology and its potential, it is far more difficult them to capture the benefits than it is for their ""Best-in-class"" counterparts due to the industrial relations system. Surprise, surprise! I am sure no-one in his wildest imagination believes the changes being proposed by the government at the moment are going to go anywhere in addressing that major cost disadvantage. There it is; we now have it; no-one can run away from it. It is very clearly defined in the Booz-Allen report just how far behind our competitors we are. The Booz-Allen report makes it very clear that it is possible to take on these changes if we want to. It states: New Zealand has demonstrated conclusively that change is possible. It continues: Anecdotal evidence suggests other countries, including the United States, New Zealand and Ireland are ahead of Australia in the rate of improvement ... Not only are they ahead, but they are ahead in the rate of improvement. Mr Anderson-We haven't really had any.",148
213,Mr HAWKER,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,"Well, we have not.",149
214,Mr TUCKEY,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,We're waiting for the Olympic Games.,149
215,Mr HAWKER,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,"I suggest if we have to wait until the Olympic Games we will be even further behind when it comes to being competitive in the meat industry. The quote continues: ... Australia needs to be progressing at a faster rate, not a slower one. Sadly, this reflects so much of the government's attitude not just to the meat industry but right across the board. I think we have made it very clear that we will not accept the three-tiered structure that the government is proposing. We also happen to believe that the government has not really been serious in tackling the overall costs that are being imposed on the meat industry by some of the other things, such as the industrial relations system we have at the moment, and the fact that Australian producers are being significantly disadvantaged when it comes to competing on world markets. If the minister is serious when he says he for wants to see growth in value adding, he ought to start with some of the existing industries and make sure they are up to world's best practice. Once we start doing that, I have no doubt we will not· only see the industry continue to grow from strength to strength, but also become world leaders. This meat inspection bill has considerable flaws in it at the moment, as we said. I think there is that wider issue and I believe it behoves this minister, if he is fair dinkum in some of the things he has said, to get down to tackling some of these individual problems that the industry still faces.",149
216,Mr CAMPBELL,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING," I was not going to speak tonight, but I will speak for a short time and then give the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) a chance to speak. I think it is rather interesting that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) was waxing eloquently about the gag and how terrible it was. It looks to me as though this legislation is going to be debated extensively by everyone listed to speak-not only extensively, but fairly repetitively. The honourable member for Wannon referred to world's best practices which were talked about in the Booz-Allen report. As is so often the case in these things, one is never comparing apples with apples. It is simply not true. There are many government charges in the United States which are simply not levied. They simply do not levy government charges. They take the form of a hidden subsidy. For that to be picked up as a description of efficiency is dishonest, to say the least. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) waxed eloquent about corruption in the AQIS system. There is no doubt that he is right about that. I think it is a credit Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that he has decided to do something about reforming AQIS, because it is certainly in need of reform. However, the honourable member for O'Connor has to realise that the world is corrupt, not just Australia. There is absolutely no doubt that most health inspections are of a political nature and have very little to do with health. I remember when our meat was being tested for organochlorines in the United States. Had American meat been subjected to the same level of tests as ours, its levels would have been much worse, naturally, because the US was using organochlorines in greater volume with less care for a longer period than we were. It was quite clear that it was a restraint of trade device, as are many European Common Market requirements. Might I also say in passing that I find myself continually amused by regulations at local government level. In many areas the killing of sheep on properties has been banned now, thereby forcing people to buy from butcher shops. I know several Aboriginal communities in my electorate who have been forced to buy frozen meat from Perth, which means there has probably been far less control from a health point of view than if they had slaughtered it themselves and eaten it fresh. That seems to be the nature of things. I want to dwell quickly on the throughput charges. Throughput charges are a marginal cost. It is absolute nonsense to say, as did one honourable member opposite, that abattoirs will refrain from extra killing because of the throughput charge. The more they kill, the cheaper the overall operation becomes. It is nonsense to suggest that throughput charges are anything other than a marginal cost in most production. I want to get back to this business about meat inspection. I have no doubt that the Northam shire meat inspectors could provide the service. The problem is that, in the corrupt world that we live in, the United States or any other country would simply target that and would subject the meat to all sorts of tests. It will always find some problem and put an embargo on the meat, in spite of the govern to the ment testing which gives some level of protection. So the need to do that is not just a product of our own ideas; it is something that we have to do because we live and work in this very corrupt world. I was going to talk more about the Booz-Allen report, but I am happy to defer to the honourable member for Murray and let him have a say.",149
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,"Mr Newell)I call the honourable member for BendigoI am sorry, Ballarat.",150
218,Mr RONALDSON,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING," It is Ballarat, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure my friend the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) would have been happy to speak tonight if the government had not gagged this Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill as it has done with bills for the last two months. The government is tossing democracy to the winds and it does not really care where it lands. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) talking about democracy and making some slight against the opposition about the number of speakers and what will or will not happen tonight vis-a-vis this bill. Quite frankly, I find it extraordinary that he should come in here and talk about democracy and make throwaway lines like that when night after night he comes in here and talks about abuses of democracy. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie runs a personal crusade, but we never see him attack the government on this sort of thing or cross the floor when the heat· is really on. I have never seen him do that in my four years here. This whole AQIS question has been going on now for years and years. I was interested to hear that this Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has a different view from the former minister. Indeed, the former minister was not too fussed about the tiered system, but this minister is, and he has been able to convince those in control that this is the approach to it. When we referred to AQIS in Fightback, it was regarded as an absolute no-no. I did not hear this minister talk about whether we should be patted on the back for our approaches in relation to AQIS or, indeed, whether we should be patted on the back for what we would have done in relation to this part of the industry. But all of a sudden things seemed to change. This is not the only example. We have seen this happening day after day since the election. Day after day the government runs around this country attacking the coalition about what we are doing and what our program is. But all of a sudden there appears to have been a change of heart about what the approach should be. AQIS is one in a long list of matters that this government attacked the coalition about, but all of a sudden it appears to have changed. I think the greatest change occurred this week when the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) talked about a. taxation surcharge for high income earners. In relation to this bill, the minister believes that the three-tiered approach will achieve the objectives of efficiency, equity, corisistency, transparency and simplicity. That is not a view that is shared by the industry, in my understanding. The industry believes there is not sufficient encouragement or reward for processors to undertake their own quality assurance. Indeed, if we listen to what the industry is saying, and the Cattle Council of Australia in particular, objections to this legislation are on several bases. Firstly, the slaughter levy concept works directly against efforts to increase plant productivity and to increase. throughput, and :bears little reflection on the needs that plants might have towards AQIS services. A slaughter levy based· on cattle equivalents per head is more than likely to appear on vendors' invoices as distinct from being contained within overall processing charges. This directly contradicts the principles and the charging arrangements which saw the end of the inspection levies in 1989. An establishmtmt fee based on 12 categories takes no account of the industry'S, and supposedly the government's, ambition of developing company based quality assurance programs. These programs result in some devolution of government inspection to company based inspection. There has been virtually no time for debate or industry wide consultation on the bill before the House. Indeed, the Cattle Council of Australia has given some quite extraordinary examples of what might flow from this. One boning room in Melbourne currently pays an inspection fee of $71,461 and now will be expected to pay $104,341. This company is relatively new, innovative and aggressive and is on a slender margin because of' US quotas. Obviously another $33,000 will make it extremely difficult for that company. In my view we are not really seeing here a genuine attempt to address what people have been saying, year after year, is something that is dramatically impacting upon the meat industry. Indeed, that impact is seen mainly in regional and rural centres, as you are fully aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is just another ongoing problem confronting these areas that is simply not being addressed. When we take that into account, and when we take into account other impediments faced by those regions-such as transportation-costsit will be seen that the impact is quite dramatic. It is the one area where regional rural centres should be making a recovery through the employment that should be generated by this industry. I can give a classic example. Ballarat used to have an abattoir-a meat processing centre. On my understanding, Ballarat is the largest market for sheep and the second largest for pigs, but we do not have a meat processing works. This goes back a long way. I will concede to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that this industry has been in trouble for a long time, but no-one has had the intestinal fortitude to address the problems that have caused it. Indeed, the union movement single-handedly destroyed the Ballarat abattoir. Through Mr Curran, it single-handedly destroyed abattoirs right throughout regional areas of Victoria. It absolutely destroyed them, and by doing that took away the opportunity for a large number of lowly skilled employees to have a job. Mr Curran just wiped out those jobs and took them with him. He used to brag about the fact that he had closed those meat works. I do not think that anyone, let alone the minister, would want to brag about the loss of employment in this country or, indeed, the loss of employment in his home state. I readily concede that I have seen the minister out and about in Victoria, and I give him great credit for that. I see him on a regular basis. Mr Crean interjecting",150
219,Mr RONALDSON,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,"That is right. There was an unfortunate incident where the minister came to Ballarat, but I have been promised that there will not be a repeat of that. Indeed, the particular eating establishment that he went to has now erected a plaque in his honour, I gather. To get back to matters of importance, this minister must stop tinkering at the edges and start addressing the real problems that face the meat industry. The meat industry is not simply about a group of farmers producing for a domestic or export market. It is a way of life fora very large number of people in rural and regional centres. The great challenge for this minister, and, indeed, for this government, will be to address these problems. I know that other colleagues-including the honourable member for Bendigo, whom you mistakenly called before, Mr Deputy Speak, er-wish to speak on this bill, so I give them now the opportunity to do so.",152
220,Mr WAKELIN,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,"This issue has been a bone of contention for farmer organisations for a long time. No doubt AQIS has contributed to the high cost of processing meat in this country. The intention of the legislation is to bring the base rate per inspecrestrictions tor down from $69,OOO-odd to $59,OOO-odd by 5 July 1994. I guess that the proof of this matter will be in the eating. I want to talk briefly about· Port Lincoln, where a small meat works is attempting to get going again. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) suggested that the problem with international trade was that overseas markets would select these regions and say that we were not doi'ng the job properly unless we had a national system. I am not in a position to attest to the veracity of that, but I can say that when we get to these smaller works and the viability is very narrow, if we can give accreditation to somebody who can have the meat passed to the various standards, we give those works and those communities a better opportunity to contribute. I do not know whether the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) actually looked· at it-I guess that he had been approached about it-but it seems to me that if we can be more flexible in this matter and maintain the high standard that is essential for export it would be a more positive situation for those smaller meat works. I understand that the potential is there to possibly have the costs, particularly in these smaller works. It is that little bit of extra efficiency which will get those works up and running. When people in a state like mine are 800 or 900 kilometres away from the main meat works, that is very important. I do not know how novel the approach has to be to achieve this sort of flexibility, but it is a very important issue in my part of the world. At the present time, meat has to be taken all the way to Gepps Cross-there is no other way of doing it-and I think that that is entirely regrettable. AQIS is essentially a national monopoly. I do not know whether anyone has ever talked about the range of options that are there, but I request that the minister advise me-perhaps he may care to respond tonight-on the reality of what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was suggesting: that we cannot leave ourselves open to the pressures of the international trading cartel or have trade based on other than fair dinkum measures. I do not want to say any more about this tonight, except to ask the minister to consider how flexible we can be, if not now then in the future, in relation to the accreditation of meat inspectors requiring various specifications in a range of roles. If we can give these smaller meat works an opportunity, it would be very mucr appreciated by many that I know of in regional Australia. .",152
221,Mr CREAN,US ARG IRISH TRADITIONAL BONING,"in reply-I thank honourable members who have participated in this debate for their contributions. I think that there is a genuine concern in the place about improving the efficiency with which our meat inspection service is undertaken-that - eems to be the thrust of most of the contributions tonight-and, more generally, to achieve the twin goals of ensuring that the integrity of our inspection service is maintained and, at the same time, doing it more efficiently so that the savings generated as a consequence are passed back to industry. It has been against that background that I have assumed specific responsibility within the portfolio to ensure the efficiency and better delivery of AQIS. I undertook to do that when the government was re-elected. I ensured that a number of decisions, commitments, goals and directions were included within the budget deliberations. The government made announcements within the budget context that will take us in that direction. We announced our commitment to review, to achieving some important savings, and the capping of the existing per inspector charge while continuing with the previously announced policy of moving to 100 per cent cost recovery. I think that the point has been made by others in the House tonight that a discipline has been associated with movement to 100 per cent cost recovery. I know that not everyone within the industry agrees with it, but it is a decision that the government took. As I recollect, it is a decision that the opposition also supported. Importantly, it has imposed a rigour on the part of those who bear the charges to ensure the delivery of the necessary efficiencies. Having said that, I indicated in the House earlier today in answer to a question from the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) that I was committed to major reform within AQIS. I do not think we should delude ourselves that the legislation before the House tonight is intended to do all of that. In fact, whilst the totality of the need for reform is shared, the legislation before the House goes to only one dimension of that. It is an important dimension because it establishes a means by which we can move to another basis for collecting the 100 per cent that has to be recovered from industry. But it is important to understand that, whilst there has been a lot of debate tonight in the House about opposition to the three-tiered structure, this legislation does not seek to impose such a structure. This legislation seeks simply to provide a basis upon which we can move to implement one of those three tiers, if indeed the three tierS are to be the preferred course adopted by the government. I have heard a nu-ber of comments about the three tiers and I have noted carefully opposition members' comments in this regard. But I am not wedded to a three-tiered structure for the charging of industry. It is a structure that has been put about for circulation and consideration by the industry and our discussions with industry have not concluded on that point. I am not in a position tonight to say, on behalf of the government, that we are prepared to ditch the three""tiered approach. But I hasten to add that my position is not locked into its adoption. I think it needs to be talked through more carefully with industry now that it appears to be solidly behind what the government is trying to achieve by way of the reform program for AQIS. SO I cannot give the opposition the specific guarantee that it is seeking. I expect that our position will become clear in the next couple of weeks. But my discussion with industry would be enhanced if it, in tum, were prepared to come to the party in discussions with us about the specifics of the establishment charge, because it is also a dimension of the reform program that has been alluded to tonight. There are a number of categories associated with the establishment charge. Again, I am not necessarily wedded to the 12 that have been circulated. I am prepared to accept that there may well be some properly argued cases that require us to re-examine that position, and I am prepared to do that. I know that is an important aspect of what the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has sought from me tonight. In response to the issues that have been raised by the opposition, I want to conduct the totality of discussions with industry about the appropriateness of the charging regime rather than locking into any specific ruling Adams, D.

225,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to speak about live sheep exports and, particularly, the tragic drought conditions that are occurring in many regions of central and western Queensland where, recently, about 12 to 15 towns have been recorded as running out of water.· Some of those towns are in their third year of drought. Graziers in those areas have two options: to see their sheep die because of the drought, or to sell them for live export. Unfortunately, there is little understanding by officials of the desperation of graziers caught in the wool price squeeze, the cash deficit situation and the drought conditions. At this particular time there is an opportunity for the export of live sheep through Abbott Point, near Bowen; Townsville; and quite a few other points throughout the north. I understand that opportunity at Abbott Point has the approval of the council and Mount lsa Mines. I also understand that the Queensland Livestock Export Co. has indicated it can take 1.3 million live sheep through there, and at the moment it has contracts to supply Indonesia. This could lead to a $56 million a year export trade. On the 4QN news this morning-that is the northern ABC station-it was reported that the company cannot export the ewes and the rams as only the merino genetic material is allowed out of the country each year. The company chief executive said that 40 per cent of the shipment was to be merino ewes and that this latest decision is one of the many setbacks which he has had to contend with. It is very important to understand that the current policy provides that when exporting the rams a statutory declaration must be provided with all the health and other export documentation to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. These controls are in place to ensure that rams designated for slaughter do not enter breeding flocks. The point I make is that if we can lay down guidelines to ensure that stock can be exported for slaughter, and have the conditions applying at both ends to ensure that that slaughter takes place, then surely the authorities that are in control should be able to make some arrangement through the current guidelines to release these sheep for export. Apparently there was a review requested through the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. That report is now available. I am urging that urgent consideration be given to that report, particularly in view of the desperation of the graziers in that area because of drought and the low prices, and because the guidelines are already in existence to permit live exports. I would like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to give a direction. I would also like to ask about the $40 million package for infrastructure in the sugar industry, which was agreed to by the Queensland state government and the Commonwealth prior to the last election. The sugar industry in Mackay and throughout the coast has had many years of bad weather, drought, bad conditions and bad prices-and there is a desperate need for this infrastructure money. Because of what is happening within the sugar industry-the drought, the deregulation that has taken place over the last three to four years, the reduction of tariff protection, and the corruption of international markets-it is imperative that this injection of $40 million take place as quickly as possible. Mackay industry is desperate for water. The TingOora dam site has been suggested. I have inspected it and it is a beautiful site. Also, Plane Creek requires a tramline to take advantage of a maximum crop. I would also like to know about the 12 per cent difference between the No. 1 and No.2 pools and whether Queensland has moved to have the difference, as was agreed prior to the last election. I would be obliged if the minister could answer both these pointsbecause it is vital to the sheep and sugar industries throughout central and western of Queensland. Turkish Immigration",155
226,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"This month Australia celebrates the 25th anniversary of an important chapter in Australia's history of immigration. Back in 1967, as a result of waning interest in migration from the traditional source countries of the United Kingdom and northern Europe, new sources were required. In October 1967, the governments of Australia and Turkey signed an agreement concerning the residence and employment of Turkish citizens in Australia. A year later, in 1968, the first migrants arrived under this agreement. Thus we celebrate the 25th anniversary of that event. this year. The importance of this agreement and the arrival of Turkish immigrants in Australia cannot be understated. This was an important st€;palong the road to Australia becoming a truly multicultural society. The Turks were considered to be the first non-Europeans to come to Australia sponsored by the government. It was an indication that Australia's immigration policy was becoming less 'concerned with ethnicity, religion and cultural background. Because of its membership of NATO and close interrelationship with the nations of the European Community, Turkey is seen today more as a European nation, but in the 1960s it was still considered by most Australians to be Asian. At that time, there was some concern about extending assisted passage to Turkish immigrants. Some felt that Australia's domestic peace and harmony had been brought about by ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Others held the view that diversity among Australia's immigrants would only enrich Australia's society. While not a result of abandoning the White Australia Policy, the agreement with Turkey did represent an important shift in attitude for Australia's future. The effects of the agreement were noticeable from the outset. There were 512 arrivals in 1967-68; 2,274 in 196869; 3,832 in 1969-70; and 3,809 in 1970-71. The first arrivals following the agreement came in mid-October 1968. They arrived at Essendon Airport in Melbourne. An excited group of people gathered that day to welcome them. The numbers far outweighed the expectations of the organisers of the welcome. The welcoming party consisted mostly of Turkish Cypriots who had been co-ing to Australia since the end of the Second World War and who were thrilled at the prospect of the strengthening of the Turkish community in Australia. These new settlers had to overcome enormous hurdles to take their rightful place in the Australian community. At first, the arrivals were housed in hostels in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows. The conditions in these hostels left much to be desired. It is often the small things that are the hardest to come to terms with. For example, without their own cooking facilities in the hostels, they quickly had to learn to come to terms with Australia's culinary delights-or otherwise. This was not easy for many. Entering a basically Christian culture, the first ments. question of many was, 'Where are the mosques in Melbourne and Sydney?'. During the preparations for migration from Turkey, some of the new arrivals had thought that they. were receiving. an assisted passage to work in Austria. However, the arrivals faced other far more serious problems. While the Australian government preferred skilled migrants, the Turkish employment service selected largely unskilled workers from the rural central and eastern parts of Turkey for assisted passage. The bulk of them had spent their lives in agriculture or in semi-skilled or unskilled work on the land. Most of the new arrivals had poor literacy skills and discovered that there were no interpreting or translating services available in Australia. They were unfamiliar with Western urbanisation, let alone the high level of Australian urbanisation. Those with skills discovered that many professional and trade qualifications were not recognised in Australia. A further difficulty for the Turks was their arrival at the end of a period of postwar economic growth and prosperity. Opportunities were becoming limited and many faced problems of retrenchment and unemployment relatively soon after their arrival in Australia. There were virtually no support services for them upon their arrival. Those that did exist had been set up for Turkish Cypriots and were extremely limited. The services were completely overwhelmed by the number and rapid rate of the new arrivals. Only about 2,500 Turkish people had been born in Australia by 1966. Services available were not specific to their needs. There was a general perception, as expressed by a ·former member for Wills, the late Gordon Bryant, that the Turks had been shovelled into ·the community by the Commonwealth government and left to fend for themselves. Yet the Turks in Australia had been able to develop a comprehensive network of social services in a relatively short time. They have founded their own cultural organisations to maintain their traditions. This has led to the establishment of community and welfare associations to deal with their specific requireDespite these and many other problems, the Turkish immigrants- as with so many other groups before and after them, came to see Australia as their home and to have a commitment to their adopted nation. For the Turks this was perhaps more difficult than for other groups. The Turks had worked as guest workers for many years in western Europe where the pattern had been to go to a foreign country for a limited time to earn money for a better life in Turkey. Many had come to Australia with the same intention, but overcame all difficulties-and. in many cases worked in several jobs-to be able to remain here permanently. (TIme expired) Bicentennial National Trail",156
227,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to refer the House to an outstanding national asset and to pay tribute this evening to a great Australian. That asset is the Bicentennial National Trail, the longest marked route of its kind in the world, stretching over 5,000 kilometres from Cooktown in tropical North Queensland to Healesville in Victoria. It was the inspiration of one of my constituents, the legendary bushman and businessman, R.M. Williams.. It follows historic coach and stock routes, old pack horse trails, brumby tracks, bullock trails, fire 383501. trails and country roads. Wherever possible along its length the trail has been designed to be a living history of our country, following the routes of our early pioneers and highlighting historic sites and artefacts along the way. The trail links 18 of the country's national parks and reveals some of the most spectacular scenery in Australia. It traverses lush tropical rainforests, rugged mountain valleys and gorges; remote dry plains, alpine meadows, snowfields and wilderness country. It gives access to some of the wildest, most remote country in the world and provides endless fascination for those interested in Australia's unique fauna and flora. . While still being developed to its fullest, the trail's enormous potential is now being tapped by people involved in all sorts of activities, as well as, the horse riding and bushwalking for which it was initially established. Camping and fishing,. fossicking, canoeing, bird watching, orienteering, survival training, mountain hike riding and travelling in horse drawn vehicles are just some of the activities being pursued along its great length. The trail lies within four hours drive of 11 million Australians and its length and variety ensure that it can be all things to all people; a wilderness or weekend ramble, a place for the experienced trekker or the first time adventurer. Age is no barrier to enjoying its pleasures. All people, from young children to those of advanced years, will find areas suited to both their fitness level and their interest. Experienced trekkers will find as many challenges as they care to confront, while the less experienced can choose a section of the trail which will give them more easy-going adventure. To help enjoy the trail, there are 12 separate guidebooks covering each 400to 500-kilometre section. Navigation along the trail is by the maps and directions provided in these guidebooks and the trail is' also marked with red and yellow striped triangles attached to trees and posts along the way. For the benefit of the House, details are available from the Bicentennial National Trail at post office box 2235 in Toowoomba, telephone number 076Everyone who loves the Australian bush and its unique attractions will find the trail a profoundly enjoyable experience, as many have on the sections within my electorate. From time to time we hear biased comment from the conservation movement that, while it welcomes people on the trail, it does not welcome horses. Clearly, this is an unreasonably narrow and myopic environmentalist view. Here is a national trail which is part of the real Australia that more Australians need to see and to appreciate. I commend its use to all, as R.M. Williams and others intended. Population Program Expenditure · Mr HOLLIS (Throsby) (10.50 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, I wish to return to a topic I raised briefly earlier today during the 90-second statements, that .is, the government has put on hold expenditure not already committed on the population program while a study into the links between population growth and development is carried out. This was done as a result of some deal with Senator Harradine. Late today, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) issued a statement saying that all funding for population activities in the aid program has not been suspended and that the vast majority of funds under the government's $130 million four-year population program has already been committed and will not be affected by this decision. A total of over $95 million has already been committed covering the period from 1993-94 to 1996-97. All of those projects will proceed as planned. The government has no intention of moving away from any of those commitments. I welcome the statement by the minister and I do not question his commitment, dedication and sincerity in this area. But I do question giving Senator Harradine's views any credibility and I strongly question the need for a study. There is abundant evidence of the link between overpopulation and poverty. Earlier this week I was in Malaysia attending a conference on population. The delegates there from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific had little doubt about the link. They experience it every day. Access to information about family planning for everyone is a basic human right. How dare anyone, especially a male, deny this basic human right to men and women anywhere. One of the most al>palling realities in many Asian countries is the widespread incidence of illegal abortion resulting from unwanted pregnancies. In developing countries where abortion is illegal, it is done secretly under crude conditions, using methods reminiscent of medieval torture such as the use of rubber catheters, coat-hangers, and corrosive douches-methods that often cause massive infection, haemorrhage, sterility, excruciating pain, and sometimes death. Those who survive this harrowing experience become permanently disabled or ostracised by their families and friends. If anyone doubts my word, he or she should speak with the women of Asia. In this place we hear much about morality. Where is the morality of condemning women to death, condemning men and women to live in poverty without hope? Where is the morality or indeed the christianity in that? This issue is too important and too urgent to remain silent. I appeal to the government: if it must have this study, it should at least the programs continue while it is being carried out. I appeal to those people who feel strongly about this issue to contact Senator Harradine and let him know how they feel about his attempt to impose his morality on so many others with such tragic consequences. I am appalled that in this House tonight honourable members would try to interject on a matter that is of vital importance to so many people. Mr KaUer-Kennedy, get the name in Hansard.",157
228,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member for Kennedy is so proud to take such a medieval view, that is his prerogative. But it is a great tragedy that, on a matter as important as this to Australia and to many thousands of women, we have that sort of medieval comment. Organ Donors  this year, a young constituent of mine-a brilliant young man with his whole life before him-died because a suitable donor for a heart and kidney transplant could not be found in time to save him. Sadly, the tragedy of this young man's story is not an isolated case. There are currently more than 3,000 people on the waiting lists for organ transplants in Australia and some 20 per cent of them will die before a suitable donor can be found. Only 216 transplant operations were performed in Australia in 1992, with 3,000 on the waiting lists. Organ transplants save lives and are a cost-effective treatment for many illnesses, providing a much improved quality of life for recipients. Australia has one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the developed world, with 12.4 donors per million population each year, compared with 15 per million in Britain and 20 per million in the USA. Despite TV advertising campaigns and the availability of registration of intent to donate organs on some states' drivers licences, the numbers of donors are decreasing-ironically, in direct ratio to the fall in road accident deaths. However, it is also lack of community let awareness and a widespread reluctance in the community to discuss the issue of organ donation with other family members· which has led to the scarcity of suitable donors. Family members in a distressed state often find it hard to make the decision to donate organs, particularly if they are unaware or unsure of the donor's wishes. It is essential, therefore, that potential donors discuss their wishes with their families while they are well. There is at present no national register of potential organ donors. There is one being set up in Victoria, funded by the private sector, which will give hospitals computerised access to a central databank of names of people prepared to donate organs after death. People who register with this databank will formalise their wish to be an organ donor. Although the final decision on whether to donate organs will rest with the donor's' family, they are more likely to agree when an person's wishes are formalised in this way. An indication on a drivers licence, or the completion of a donor card, is less likely to convince relatives of a person's wishes, unless he or she has discussed his or her intentions with the family beforehand. The Australian Kidney Foundation believes that the most effective way to increase the availability of suitable organ donors is to increase community awareness through education, especially at secondary school level. The foundation has produced a kit for schools which covers all aspects of transplantation and which has been acclaimed overseas as a unique educational tool. This kit does not receive government funding; it is sponsored by donations from private sector organisations, including a pharmaceutical company. Much of the education about transplants and the importance of organ donation is being undertaken by volunteers. 'Individuals who have been affected by organ donations in some way are making great personal efforts and sacrifices to lift community awareness by speaking to schools, colleges, community groups and the media. The parents of the young man I spoke of earlier are two such people who have personally experienced the tragedy of the lack of organ donors in Australia. They are doing all they can to remedy the situation. Amongst other projects, they have been successful in gaining the support of their local council to distribute 17,000 donor cards. They are also working with the South Australian Royal Automobile Association to publicise the need for donor registration and to distribute donor cards. Educating the community is an enormous task and it cannot be done by volunteers and privately sponsored organisations alone. The fact remains that much more needs to be done to reduce the gap between the number of patients on the waiting list and the organ transplant operations being performed each year. The Australian Kidney Foundation, perhaps the largest and best known organisation associated with organ transplants, receives a measly $50,000 a year from government funds. The accord national public awareness and information program set up in 1989, with the aim of increasing the Australian organ donor rate, will receive $500,000 a year for the next three years to fund its promotions budget. That is about the same amount that has been spent in and on the residences of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) since he took office. Making more people aware of the need for organ donors is a benefit to the whole community and should be perceived as such in government circles. As the Australian Kidney Foundation points out, organ donation is literally a gift of life. Question resolved in the affirmative.
