4,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"On 7th April the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) asked the following questions :1. What alterations have been made in the priginal plans and specifications of HMAS. Adelaide from the time its construction wns first entered upon 7 2. (a).What is the actual cost of sueh alterations, and (b) on whose recommendation were the original .plans. and specifications departed from? 3. On what date was the keel of B.MA.S. Adelaide laid? 4. What new construction work. bas been entered upon since that date, showing names of vessels, tonnage, and actual period of construction of each vessel? 6. If the dockyard was able to complete the work on the above vessels in the time stated, what reasons are advanced for the lengthy period of construction and delay in the completion of the HMAS. Adelaide up t ill the time of the recent dismissals of workmen T fl. (a) How many naval experts, shipyard Cockatoo dockyard at the present time, and whose duties evre on ship construction, and (b) how many were employed twelve months after the'keel of theAdelaide was laid? 7. What is thetotal amount of salaries paid to the experts and managers per month ? 8. What naval construction work, if any, is being proceeded with at the dockyard at the present time? 9. Does the work warrant the retention of the services of tbese experts, shipyard managers, and foremen? I informed the honourable member that the information desired was being obtained, and would he supplied at the earliest date practicable, but owing to the large amount of work which the preparation of answers to some of the questions entailed, it would 'be necessary to postpone a reply until a later date.

Material was available to enable each one to be completed within the time stated, much the Adelaide, materials and fittings are almost wholly to import through Admiralty contractors who for the vessels were considerably fewer in number, from the Ship Construction Branch, it not being bodying war experience. It may be pointed out that undergo a constant process of evolution, and when of essential parts, a greater number of modifications gained in the meantime is involved, and this in turn items of equipment, which, owing to their particular firms on the British Admiralty list who specialize gunnery, torpedo and electrical equipment, and in additional electrical items mentioned The first delays in the construction of HMAS. when important items of structural material were not delay, would have been experienced if the Dockyard materials from stock. Supply of this material from plates being greater than were required for the particular increased cost would be off set by the time gained. girders, plummer block seats, auxiliary engine seats, tight frames were not ordered by Chatham Yard from were not delivered at this Dockyard before July, on 27th July, 1918, and it is quite obvious that, from stock, the vessel would not have been in the livery of the material in question was requested by this Yard as early as December, 1917, and a cable was accordingly despatched from Navy Office to High Commissioner.

June, but this does not agree with the eopip.s of tha stated already, the date of acceptance of order is not of the Naval Board to the very serious effect which the work of building this vessel. If the contract dates some of the most important parts of the main turbines when the time required for the necessary work to be months to prepare the turbines for installing, it will on board cannot be commenced for nearly another 2 years, expected to be for at least 3 years from this date. extremely long dates for the forging of the rotor ports Admiralty for war purposes, but the effect, so for lamentable, as, of course, the length of time taken to to delays at this Yard, observing that it is considered wheels, & c , appear to be absolutely unreasonable. the machinery will not be ready for installing to commence the erection of the hull on the ship of time that the vessel will be under construction, continue as the materials arrive. in London may be requested to make a special report with a view, if possible, of the contract dates being possible the probable dates of their delivery in order (Sgd.)

46,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Hunter ) [3.22]:-In the course of my remarks on Friday, I in timated that I intended to move an amendment tp have this matter submitted to investigation by a Committee of both Houses. A f t e r iurther consideration I have decided not to adopt that course. One reason is that I understand that the Acting Prime Minister (Si r Joseph Cook) will make a statement in regard to the wool position at an early hour today. This matter is one of great i m portance and requires deep consideration at the hands of honourable members before we enter into an arrangement with Bawra or anybody else in regard to the disposal of the future production of wool. It is well to refresh our minds regarding the history, of the industry during the last , few years. Throughout the war the British Government bought the whole of the Australian wool clip at a flat rate of Is. 34d. per lb. Of the wool so acquired and paid for at that rate, there remains an accumulation of, approximately, 2,500,000 bales.",29
47,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"There are 1,700,000 bales of Australian wool accumulated in England and in Australia. The other 800,000 bales are New Zealand wool.",29
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That is so.,29
49,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I accept the honourable member's figures. For those 1,700,000 bales of Australian wool the growers have been paid Is. 3^d. per lb., and by the agreement made with the British Government they are to get, in addition, half of any profits made on the re-sale of the wool. It appears to me PAPERS. that,.during the war, the British Governpre- ment have been guilty of profiteering. I am sorry to have to say that. Ever since the outbreak of war, people all over the world have complained of the dearness of woollen goods; and whilst it is said that 7 lbs. of wool should be in a good suit of clothes, I understand that not more than B$ lbs. is put into any suit today. Thus the purchaser is getting less wool in his suit than he should get, and at the same time he is paying double the pre-war price for the article. We must be careful to insure that, in any scheme now adopted, we do not place a further burden upon the people. Prior to the war, the average price of wool was lO^d. per lb., and if the growers have already received Is. 3^d. per lb. for all the wool they grew during the war period, .they have received .a very good return. But because the British Government charged a higher price than the flat rate of Is. 3£d., there is now a big accumulation of unsold wool. The market is. overstocked, and, in view of the British Government's desire to dispose of the carry-over wool, it is difficult to see how Australia will be able to market tuis year's clip. If the new clip remains unsold, Australian interests will be detrimentally affected. The more I think over this question, and the more I read of the views of men who have a knowledge of the subject, the more am 1 convinced that, as the British Government and the Australian growers have already had a good return for the wool, it would be better, in order to stabilize the market, to keep the Bawra wool in store. The British Government would be doing only a fair thing if it agreed with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), on his arrival in England, to keep the Bawra wool oil the market. We .are assured that it will not deteriorate very much; even if it does deteriorate a little, it has already yielded a fair profit. If this suggestion is adopted, the market will be left clear for the future production, there will be a chance of getting back to normal conditions, and people may be .able to get their clothing cheaper. Commercial men tell us that they cannot reduce the price of suitings because they bought stocks in England at high prices two years or twelve months ago which are being delivered now. Those high prices were caused by the action of the British Government in charging so much for raw wool during the war period. If the Commonwealth Government agree to give Bawra an official status-and if they use the Customs Department for the purpose of controlling exports they will be doing that-Bawr a will be able to regulate the whole supply of wool for some years to come, whilst Parliament, which gives them the power, will have no say .at all. Throughout the war, people were complaining of the growth of bureaucratic control. New trading Departments* were formed, and Boards were given control of various commodities which they administered behind the back of Parliament. The representatives of the people were treated .as mere ciphers. The Boards fixed the prices to suit themselves. We have been urged to restore normal conditions, and to resume control of the reins of government; but if we agree to a proposal such as has been outlined to us, shall we not be giving Bawra a power which it can exercise in defiance of the jurisdiction of this Parliament? Undoubtedly we shall; and, therefore, we must be careful of what we do in this matter. I desire that all the facts should be placed before the House. Certain information has been handed to me by the wool-buyers. This is a copy of a l e t t e r sent by t h o secretary c f the W o o l B u y e r s ' Association to the Act in g P r i m e Minister We have up to now received no invitation to offer our advice, although we are as vitally interested in the stability of the trade as wool growers. This is our excuse for approaching you. The following facts should receive full consideration:1. We recommend that B.A.W.R.A. stocks should be put aside for a definite period, say, two years. The withdrawal of B.A.W.R.A. 2,500,000 bales would concentrate competition upon the present clip. B.A.W.R.A. being all profit, no hardship is entailed. 2. Any fixation of reserves will automatically reduce sales, and cause the stocks to accumulate, and will also drive orders to markets where no regulations exist. 3. We fchink it necessary that a sufficiently low basis should be reached in order to induce the factories to lay in stocks, and to stimulate consumption. Free competition alone will fix the basis. 4. Government restriction will hamper the trade, and buyers of cloth throughout the world will not operate freely while restrictions continue; they really make the price of wool. The average prices ""received in Australia for this season's clip are much above pre-war years. We think and hope that the lowest level of prices has been reached , and therefore claim 1 tliere is no necessity for artificial reserves or restrictions. 5. We, as buyers, very strongly object to being compelled to apply for Customs permits to carry on our lawful businesses. Buyers have already suffered serious loss through the dislocation of the sales, some have already left for Europe, and many others will be forced to leave if harassing restrictions are imposed. . 6. Goodwill aiid co-operation 'between buyers auctioneer's box, "".Wurruk,"" a and sellers is a necessity of the trade, and should be encouraged. . 7 - Should the proposed legislation be --it-will form a .dangerous precedent for any other Government in power. ' I .agree with very much that is contained - in that letter. I hold that the Customs Department should .not be used nexion with this particular . matter, but .that the wool business should be l e f .free .as possible. I have another .statewas so arguing on 'Friday last. .ment to submit - to the House in order that honourable. members may know the ""facts from the other side. Jowett, a Bradford manufacturer, writes as 'follows: As a Bradford commission .wool buyer and ""Their top maker of twenty years' standing, I strongly therefore ^support the ' Prime Minister's suggestion that commission Bawra"" wool-should be put aside for a defi- (i.e., that portion Jiite - period,. say, .two years growers, along with the selling brokers and the second time at auotion.appraisement, banks, will have every-chance - own solvation, - as they have 'done in the past. I think this would enable the whole of the .wool to be sold. "" Bawra"" will come into its own when - markets of the world become more normal. "" Bawra"" wool is all profit, and therefore, hurt.no one to be dealt with in that - manner Have we evidence that the 'British Government ' have - refused to .put ' "" Bawra"" aside,'or is it just Sir ""Arthur Goldfinch arid - Sir ""Jolm Jiiggins - who .wish or demand '""'Bawra'-""-must be sold? : I .emphasize'.that paragraph - We (evidence that-the British Government - are - not-prepared to . put the Bawra wool aside except the statement from 'Bawra itself, ipendulum. .at the..head .of - which.are the two.gentleturers men named. ' Mr ' Jowett continuesI »strongly think the British Government - have made no <-such - refusal, as their attitude .to traders has and always will be friendly. Growers of free wool .should be in the position to-sell in a free-market,-without -"";Bawra "" is'the chief bug-bear, and if that 'wool was 'withdrawn from competition against free iwool, this .would help ' considerably stabilize prices. "" Bawra "" wool stands at thing in the!b-oka, therefore, if ""Bawra"" is - forced on-the-market, it .ofrfree wool. 'Is - Sir .John' Higgins. :quitecandid .when he says'"" he has the best interests - growers at heart,"" or does he seek sole control of the whole output of the wool-of Australasia? Jfo Government should offer any realization company iany such . power. -- Senator Guthrie - commenced members of the Senate and House of Representatives by saying he has "" no axe to grind."" Opposition or criticism of a scheme is quite right and lawful, and I strongly condemn .refute his statement that speculators - are ing or wanting to take large stocks of wool .the-present time. At the last sales in Geelong, 9th .'March, when Senator Mr Charlton. -.good comeback .bred finequality clip, was. sold at 31d. per lb. ""for one lot of '22 bales.

If any - restrictions - as to .exportof wool, are made .under the'.Customs or any .other Act, then the woolselling brokers know that.no wool can be sold, or dealt with, that does not go through their hands, and that is equal to a ""corner"" in'the in con- . wool-selling. business. t as 'There can be no escape from that fact. I We should leave' this particular Combine' to regulate the-wool 'business of Australasia Mr H . W . without any control by this Parliament. Has this position been pointed out to the wool-selling houses by the chairman of Bawra,"" in order to induce - their support? support was not 'given without demur; the woolrselling brokers - will have the of selling "" Bawra"" wool twice of it which is still in 'AusThen the wooltralia) once under and the Is that the sop to the to"" work out their brokers? free If - there is any wool in Australia it-'would r the have-to be put up to auction-again, and the wool brokers would get something 'for it - would, selling it a second time. . In discussing this proposed scheme the buying section of the trade wish ""to help 'the igrower - and deal with facts, ' and ..the Prime that Minister, .when he mode the statement - that .wool was only-bringing at .auction, lid..to . l i d . per lb., evidently referred to Jocks,.not to - any have .no fleece wool of any quality.

51,Mr RICHARD,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"FOSTER - The- ' honourable' day of member does not"" understand th© question. The Bawra arrangement is thesmall man'so n l y hope: Mr Charlton , - I recognise-thiat"" if . about I shared 'the'honocaWe member's-views,. 1 1 I should be perfectly right. He has a habit of interrupting those who can throw more light on the particular subject under discussion than he isable to do. When interrupted, I was referring to the position of returned soldiers who have taken up land during the last few years, and have devoted their attention solely to sheep-farming. If wool brings a low price, as it will , no doubt, they will be the chief sufferers, and those who have mortgages on their holdings will have to submit to foreclosure in a year or two unless the State comes to their aid. I would remind the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), who thinks I know nothing of this subject, that already 15^d. per lb. has been received by the growers of the Bawra wool, and that, in addition, they will get one-half the proceeds derived from the sale of the 1,700,000 bales of the carry-over. If we allow one bale of Bawra wool to be put on the market for every two bales of the new clip, or two bales to three bales, and 9d. per lb. is secured for it , the growers interested in that wool will get, not morelv 9d. per lb. in respect of their present clip, but 4^d. per lb. in addition, as their half share of the proceeds of the Bawra wool so sold. The small farmer, however, who has only recently come into the industry will receive only 9d. per lb. Mr RoDGEKis - The honourable member is arguing from only one side of the question.",32
52,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am putting the question in all its phases before the House. The Bawra wool-growers will be getting 9d. per l b . for their new clip, plus 4£d. per lb. in respect of every bale of Bawra wool that is sold.",33
53,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,And they will entitled to it . They have a half share in i h e Bawra wool.,33
54,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I know that ; but I am putting the position of those who axe not in the Pool.,",33
55,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,They w i l thing out of the Bawra wool.,33
56,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That strengthens my contention that the Bawra wool should be kept off the market.,33
57,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,But for the arrangement the small man who is not in the Pool would get nothing for his wool.,33
58,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable member deals in wool, and, in common with every other man interested in the Bawra wool, has already received 15£d. per lb. for it . That was a very good price, was it not f",33
59,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,A tip-top price.,33
60,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Quite so, and in addition to that those interested in the Bawra wool will ultimately get half the proceeds of the sale of the carry-over. My coutention is that the man who has already been paid handsomely for that wool might reasonably be Expected to stand out of .his money for some time in order to give a chance to the poor man who has no interest in the Bawra wool.",33
61,Mr RODGEHS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The small sheep farmer's wool is being sold in the open market in Australia. He has no Bawra competition here whatever. Mr ""CHARLTON - But the honourable member knows that there is a very poor market at the present time.",33
62,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Not at all .,33
63,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"If there is nothing wrong with the market, why are we wasting the time of the country in discussing this question ? The Prime Minister told' us last week that the bottom had practically fallen out of the market, but now we are told by honourable members interested in wool that everything is all right. If that is so, let things go on as they are. If the honourable member's contention is correct, then we are defaming the credit of the country and protesting when there is no occasion to do so. It is strange that everything appears to be all right with the wool market as soon as one begins to put the other side of the Bawra arrangement.",33
64,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,There are - more small men interested in the Bawra wool than in this year's clip.,33
65,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I know that many be small men are not interested in the Bawra wool.,33
66,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I do not know any sheep farmer in Australia who is not in terested in the Bawra scheme.,33
67,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,We have in the l get noHouse a remarkable lot of sponsors for that scheme. I am merely stating a common-sense proposition. I am trying to analyze the situation as it presents itself to me. Bawra Sir JOSEPH COOK - But the honourable member is against the.union.,33
68,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am against the union or, rather, the combine that it is proposed to create to regulate the price of wool. This Parliament should shoulder its own responsibilities; it should not transfer them to some other hody. the Government propose to take over this matter, I am against it . Mr LIVINGSTON. - Why not Acting. Prime Minister make a statement, and then reply to it ?",33
69,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I should not have the right to speak again. During the war I supported several measures in regard to which I subsequently regretted my action, and I do not propose to vote for anything else that I may think wrong. The Government should not continue the spoon-feeding of outside combinations. We are getting suggestions from everywhere. On Monday the . Gisborne Farmers' Dnion- a New Zealand Unioncarried a resolution suggesting that the Imperial authorities should purchase this year's wool clip at 50 per cent, below the commandeered prices, and that this bu pooled with the balance of the commandeered wool in hand, and disposed of at the mean average price of the two clips. It is urged that if this were done it would probably save a loss on 740,000 bales of commandeered wool, that it order would stabilize the market, and that it inquired into. would safeguard £8,000,000 profits. The proposal might well considered.",34
70,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Who , is it suggested, member's view ? 1 would buy the wool ?",34
71,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,-It is suggested that the British Government should take it.,34
72,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Everyon e knows that the British Government would not buy it. .,34
73,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Everyon e seems to know what the British Governan ment would do, although it has not been consulted,, and the Prime Minister has asked for a respite of two months so that sold. he may consult the Imperial authorities.",34
74,Mr RICHAHD FOSTEB,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That is quite different matter.,34
75,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"This is another suggestionTo get rid of a big block of wool (a bales, or the whole of the "" B.A.W.R.A."" wool, if possible) to the European nations be the best possible move at the present time. Now the "" B.A.W.B.A."" are the only woolfighting holders in a position to sell off big lines, I would like to see that wool sold at the best price we could get, with liberal terms of payment. I read these suggestions to show that various opinions are held by persons interested. If Sir JOSEPH COOK - The suggestion just read raises the big question, should preference be given to those whom we have let the recently been fighting]",34
76,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That would be for Parliament to decide. Here is another suggestionIn view of the fact that both the sellers (Australasian, &c, squatters) and the buyers (British Government) of the.remaining unsold Bawra wool (3,400,000 bales) have already been fully paid for same, at very satisfactory prices-the British Government, by selling a. portion of their purchases at a sum sufficient', to recoup them for their total outlay on same - ii t is suggested that, as the experts have failed to find a' solution of the trouble on the lines of limiting the sales, and fixing reserve prices, the following proposal should be considered. The proposal is that this remaining Bawra wool, which is blocking the way to the resumption of reasonably normal conditions in the wool industry, should be given away absolutely free, in such a way as will prevent it from coming into substantial competition with the current or future wool clips. These suggestions are all from men interested in wool, and I mention them in that the whole matter may be full y I think that no harm surplus would be done if a decision were deferred' be until the Prime Minister got home. .",34
77,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,What is the honourable,34
78,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I think that the British Government should keep the accumulated wool off the market, and let the new wool be sold in the ordinary way.",34
79,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,But there was the undertaking to supply the British people.,34
80,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,".'The present here trouble arises from the fact that there is. over supply of wool. We are told that if the Bawra wool be put on the market, last year's and this year's clips cannot be",34
81,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"There is very little a wool in Great Britai n now, except the Bawra wool.",34
82,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,My opinion is that it would be a good thing if the British million Government were asked to hold that wool.,34
83,Mr WIENHOLT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Is not wool hoarding seems to as bad as food hoarding?,34
84,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"We have been to raise the living conditions of and the workers in accordance with the in time crease in the price of commodities,' and have not been able to do that.

If I 1 thought' f b r amoment' thatthat was the object that is now beingsought by honourable-members'interested in the wooi-iirdustrv, they would get no support' fromi this'Government*, and certainly'none from me. The honourable member hasset* up two or three contradictory positions- - To begin with , he commiserated the men who : have to pay a heavy price for suits of clothes: It is.quitetrue that clothes are very dear:",36
101,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Robbery! Sir JOSEP H 'COOK - That , however,is not' due to ' the cost' of thewool that goesunto the clothes. Even Bawra itself; undiluted, uninterrupted, and uninterv fered with , only suggests a'reserve which) will practically mean saying to thebuyer of clothes, ' ' Yiou. must* pay at least 5sy for theiwool that .goes, into them:"" That is-all; andimy honourable friends opposite,therefore; see that . the interest of the wearer of clothes , in this connection is a very slight one, as compared with the in-, terests* of the-industry itself, and as a- whole. No more unfortunate illustration could, have been selected than this idea that anything we do to. regulate and control the.price-of'woolivery seriously affects , the. price, of garments, as we wear them today. For. that, we mustJcck to other causes. I do not wish to say any more . about the honourable member for. Hunter (Mr Charlton) or. his speech, except that this question has a.very slight local application. I understand that about 2'A per cent., certainly not more, of the wool that is produced here is consumed, in Aus- tralia, as the honourable memberwill see if he gets the figures f b r himself from - KniVbs. During the wartime we con> 1 sumed about 15',000,000 lbs. of wooli n Australia-eve n when we had our heavy commitments to supply the troops with warm clothing-and that wasout' of - the - r total productiono f 600,000,000 lbs.",36
102,Mr FENTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Is that all the wool we should-require in Australia if we manufactured' for our own requirements ?,36
103,Sir ROBERT BEST,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"We manufacture only 10 per cent, of our requirements.",37
104,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am merely - pointing to the figures in Knibbs. The point I take is that our interest is in the selling of this wool overseas, and it will be our interest for some years to come. Nobody more than I will welcome the time when we. shall be able to make this wool into clothing and consume it ourselves, as far as possible; but it is idle to talk about the paramount interest of the dwellers in the cities-consumers of wool in Australia-when , as a .matter of fact, they take only 2 per cent, of our total production. Clearly, therefore, we have to look overseas in connection with this industry. I should like to call attention to one other point concerning thi6 industry. This is the greatest of all our industries, employing, as it does, 80,000 people directly in the growing of wool, and, I suppose, at least two or three times that number in collateral industries. As to this free wool spoken of so much by the honourable member for Hunter, his remarks apply to only 4 per cent, or 5 per cent. of the wool-growers of Australia, the balance of 96 per' cent, being all in this union, if I .may so call it . What is suggested, I understand, is that the Government shall assist this union by giving "" preference to unionists "" to the extent of a reserve which. has been definitely suggested.",37
105,Mr CHARUTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I think the honourable gentleman will see that there is a difference between the "" union "" in the wool industry and a union such as that of the miners. H ad the coal-miners and the proprietors got the world's parity they would have made infinitely more than they did.",37
106,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Of course, there is always a difference-this is the "" other f e l l o w ' s "" union, and not the honourable member's. There was one thing which struck me as being rather inconsistent in the honourable member's speech. He began by complaining that wool is not cheap enough for the people who have to buy suits, and he finished up by suggesting that all wool should be got off the market, with a view to making it a still higher-priced article.",37
107,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"No , I did not.",37
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Bot h these bales of, wool. views cannot be right-som e reconciliation is, I think, needed. shall say no more on that point, but pass on to consider what I regard as a very serious situation. It is a situation which I should have very much liked to escape had it been possible, and I confess I am approaching a task which is somewhat uncongenial. I should not mind so much if I could see my way clearly through; but no man can dogmatize-on a question of this kind. A f t e r balancing everything, we have to make up our minds as to the course we think will ultimately"" prove to the advantage of this country- I wish to say clearly that the Government have no further interest than that-no t merely to the advantage of the wool industry, - but to the advantage of the country as a whole. It is from that point of view I shall approach the consideration of the matter. I have listened very carefully to the debate as it has proceeded so far, ""and one or two things seem to me to have emerged. The honourable member's speech is a further confirmation of the fact that everybody is agreed that the present condition respecting wool is abnormal, and very serious, indeed. Some effort is necessary to combat the special difficulties surrounding the conditions in the wool trade, though opinions may differ as to methods. So far we are on common ground. The speech of my honourable friend discussed the question, and suggested various methods to cope with the difficulties, which, as I say, everybody recognises. One thing is pretty evident by this time, and that is that the Government itself must take some"" attitude towards this very important question. What that attitude is I shall indicate in a littl e while. I do not think it amiss to remind ourselves of the elements of the question; as I see them they are these': Whereas in the last three years the average realizations of wool have been £48,000,000 per annum, this year they will be considerably less than £20,000,000. During those three yeaTS the British Government came to our assistance. It was the British Government, let us never forget, that kept our prices up and enabled us in this way to shape our attitude to the war, with far less serious consequences than would have been the case had we not been possessed of the means of finance. The British Government purchased from us 7,127,000",37
109,Mr BLAKELEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"And made huge However, I profits out of it !",37
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The British Go the vernment paid for that wool £160,000,000 sterling; let us never forget that aspect when discussing this question. British Government made profits during the war, they were all expended in the prosecution of the war.",38
111,Mr FLEMING,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It is only fair to say that other people got a higher price for their wool at the same time.,38
112,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"My own imaffecting pression is that every other country a higher price than the British Govern The ment charged; hut that fact, apparently, is lost sight of in sonfe quarters. British Government did not profiteer wool; on the contrary, it was generous Australia in the purchase of it, and that we ought to remember. Why is it that we are not getting more than £20,000,000 now for our wool? The answer is, first of all, that England is no longer purchaser of our wool she was during the war. Other countries could not chase; there was only one purchaser, and now that one has failed us for the time being, and the wool is left on onr hands. The fact is that today Europe is paralyzed, and that is why our stocksof wool are so heavy. In the season before the outbreak of the war, France, Belgium and Holland bought from the Commonbales. wealth 669,000 bales, of wool; Germany, 425,275 bales; the United Kingdom, 318,661 bales; the United States, 90,265 bales; Japan, 23,800 bales; and Italy, 13,200 bales. To-day that demand is absent-the demand on the Continent' negligible. It is not that the Continent does not require wool more badly than ever. Honourable members will have read in their newspapers the other day, did, that today the Germans are still - ing paper underclothing, as I saw them - doing during the war; indeed, oftener than not, in the later stages of the the German soldier had nothing beneath, his tunic but his bare skin. Europe Tiungry today for wool, but eannot buy them. it from us, and so we have our wool here, though it is badly wanted abroad. The would. result of all this is that natural law is operating, and there has been a tremember, mendous land-slide in the values of The wool boom that we had during the war, though it was only a mild one, .slumped to the extent of 60 per cent, case of our better wools, and as much as 80 per cent, in the case of some of our cross bred wools. In other words, and this If the is the national aspect I desire to stress, Australia is confronted today with the possibility of receiving, on account of wool, an income of £3 per head of population, as against £9 and over per head during the last three years. I am pointing out how this is most profoundly our finances, as well as the got stability of many of our undertakings. carry-over . wool has heen fairly stated at S50,000 bales of Australian The wool, 850,000 bales of British wool, in 800,000 bales of New Zealand wool, and to 200,000 bales of South A'frican and other wool, making a total of 2,700,000 bales.' By June next there will be 750,000 bales of new wool to be added to the former total; some people say that there will be the large an additional 1,000,000 bales.",38

114,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Including South African and New Zealand wool, we shall have, by June next, 4,500,000 bales of carry-over wool, with the new season well under way. Altogether, we have to anticipate a mountain of wool comprising between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 The average price of greasy wool for the three pre-war seasons was 9id. to 9fd. per lb. After all, the jump from 9fd. pre-war to 15$d. during the war s was no bigger than was the rise in every other article that enters into the cost of is living. During the control period, the Australian growers received 15^d. per lb., plus 50 per cent, of the profit on resales; that was the profiteering with as I which the British Government has been wearcharged.

'.""During this debate it has ' been sugthe gested that we should sell this carry-over Comwool on long .credits to the Central The proposal.is .all very well, but.is. full of .danger. . If we.giv.e. credit ; .,to these .powers, we have ;not..tt>jirid ,any ..capital, hut we must take care, that .duriing the .currency ,of these long-dated of the credits we are not giving.to.Germjuay.and Austria, our erstwhile enemies, an imrnenso advantage over countries which, during the war, were our staunch allies. We must take the greatest care to see that by the adoption of such a proposal, the markets, not only of our Allies, but also of the Imperial Government, are not swamped. But as there are so many interests to be served in Great Britain, I think we would be extraordinarily lucky if we could induce the British Government to go out of this business. have so many interests at stake and so many obligations to their own manufacturers which we, in turn, have made ours that it seems to me we ought to regard Bawra as a compromise and work it as such as far as possible. There is another proposal-to keep Bawra off the market for two years. am not an expert, but my information is that wool will not last indefinitely, and that as a good deal of the Bawra wool was shorn three or four years ago the keeping of it off the market for a couple of years more in a climate like that of Great Britain would lead to very serious deterioration.  worse when we realise that this wool is in a dumped condition.",40
137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Then there is the question of the minimum reserve price suggested by Bawra to the Government. In that regard we .must have some respect for the cost of production. If the average cost of production is 9d., it does not seem to be an undue reserve to suggest in connection with an industry whioh is passing through such ' critical days. Of course, it must be borne in mind that the average takes in our drought years, aa well as our good years. We can only deal with these matters by the law of averages. The proposal is to sell in England one bale of ourcurrent clip to two bales of the carry-over, which, is about the proportion of our merino wool to our cross bred wool, though I do not know whether there is any relation between the two facts. In fixing a reserve price, there is no suggestion of prohibition. It is not suggested that we are to stop the small men, about whom the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) was so anxious this afternoon, from selling their wool anywhere they please. - Dr EARLE PAOE - But Bawra has announced its willingness to give tbem cash from the Pool.",41
138,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The/smal l men need not go into the Pool. So long as they subscribe to the minimum reserve they are free to sell in any part, of the world at a price above that reserve. In fixing on a minimum there is no regulation of price in the strict sense of the term. The small grower will be able to They get as much as he can for his wool in any part of the world and in any market. The more he can get the more power to his elbow. My colleague, Mr Rodgers, reminds me that the small men will be perfectly free so far as onr internal market is concerned. As a matter of fact, they deal with no other market. They sell to the man who takes their wool as near to I their door as they can get their money.",41
139,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That has not been the case within the last six years.,41
140,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That used to bo the position, and I fancy that a lot of this wool is even yet gathered up in country districts in the way I have described. At any rate, no restriction is imposed so far as the local market is concerned. The grower oan sell - his wool for I d . per lb. if he chooses to do so. These are the conditions which the Government have to meet today, and after very careful consideration of the whole question I propose to state, in very few words, the attitude of the - Ministry. The case is altogether abnormal and special, and as we have seen so often during the war and all over the world in every country as well as in Australia, these abnormal conditions have to be met by means which are not in themselves normal.' Special cases require special treatment. The question of whether we are justified in any interference in this matter is arguable. One cannot lose sight of the fact that the world is still upside down. Markets are smashed up, exchanges are smashed up, people cannot buy; they cannot turn themselves around' economically and industrially; no market is normal; the condition of the world industrially and economically is very far from normal; all our processes for the disposal of our primary products are deranged and out of joint; great gaps have been made in the former lists of eager' buyers in the markets of the world. Thiscondition of affairs has prevailed in other industries. It is evident in Engthe land today, where the latest proposal of Mr Lloyd George to the miners of Great Britain is that he shall make a direct tribution from the British Treasury to Miners' Pool. Even in that country, to which we are supposed to look for examples of all that is sane and wise in matters of government-and we .do not look fo in vain-thing s are so abnormal that carrv-over wool."" Can we do that? many of the industries, including the great coal-mining industry, are subject control. We have our Wheat Pool, our Butter Pool, and our Gold Pool. gold is not permitted to be sold except through a Gold Producers' Association, which sells it at a premium of about £1 103. per oz.",41
141,Mr FLEMING,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,So that an evil is Our made good hy multiplying it?,42
142,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I do not see the relevancy of the honourable member's interjection. When we have an abnormal ?et of circumstances, we must make best of them, and do the best we the can to cope with them. We have felt tremendous effects from the war. haps owing to our isolation, we have fered more than have other countries. Indeed, we are feeling the effects today, and the Government have already been obliged to step in for the purpose of endeavouring to assist our great primary industries to tide overo abnormal conditained tions. That is all I am suggesting now. There is nothing novel in the proposal that has - been made regarding our greatest industrial and financial concern. The Government have had a great deal of conflicting advice. Even in connection with the wool trade, there are conflicting wool position. views and conflicting interests. are the buyers and the sellers within wool world as well as outside it ; and I have been very much amused at the letters which have lately appeared in the press signed by "" To m , "" "" B i l "" H a r r y , "" or ' ' W . "" One writer that stabilization will only by regulation. Another says that the way not to stabilize the market is to adopt this system of regulation. Another says that we can only stabilization ultimately hy having a free market. Another says-and this is the many proposal of Bawra- "" T r y to stabilize market without sacrificing our wool."" If that can he done, it is what every one wants. It is easy enough to stabilize the conmarket by destroying the Bawra wool. a The Bawra propceal, as I understand it , is a compromise of the Imperial Government's interest in this wool and our own. Bawra says, "" Try to stabilize the marr it ket, aud at the same time to save the I am not here to say that it can be done; to but while these conflicting interests put their arguments from day to day we must Our always keep in mind the fact that our selling interest is paramount to our buying interest. We are the sellers .of wool; other people are the buyers of f t . We use here only 2 per cent, of our wool; the rest has to find a market overseas. interests, therefore, are exclusive regarding 98 per cent, of our total wool output. That is the point which we must always keep in mind. It has been said (that some interests have not been consulted. It is a pity if that is so. I have the made inquiries, and am informed that reason why the buying interests here have not been directly, consulted by PerBawra is that Bawra has been, and is tosufday, in close communication with the actual buyers in London who are represented by agents in Australia. I cannot help feeling, however, that it would have been well had Bawra consulted the agents here. The Government has tried to consult some of these buyers, and has obfrom them one or two useful suggestions. Even when we have consulted the whole of them, and have tried to balance the very conflicting interests, I shall have some doubts as to the success of the Bawra proposal. A man would be foolish in these days to dogmatize on the There Mr BOWDEN - At th© best the Bawra the proposal is but a palliative.",42
143,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It is. It is a 1 some of choice of two alternatives.,42
144,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I would sooner trust l , "" to the Bawra opinion than that of the says Acting Prime Minister (Sir'Joseph Cook) be reached on this question.",42
145,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,And so would I .,42

147,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Quite so; bub one does not need to be a wool expert to .know that-when you--embark upon a proposal which cuts into first principles you are incurring grave risks.

What happened was that galvanized'iron was,passed from one purchaser to another beforei t found its wayto the user; and in the city of Rockhampton as much. as. £80 per ton was paid, for second-hand galvanized iron. There was only a limited supply and. a' very big demand, and. thus the law of supply and demand, operated, to keep the price, up. It ispossible for huge trusts and combines, to regulate prices,, and they do so; but I doubt, whether the Government, though it might do -. a; little in war time, can do anything in peace time in thisdirection. Where there is competition like that of the Commonwealth Bank with the private banks, rates may be kept down; but, generally, Government interference in attempts at regulating prices fails. The Commonwealth Parliament is now asked to take action to prevent the wool-growers from selling their wool for les3 than an average of 8d. per lb. In other words, we are asked to compel them to join the One Big Union. This is a project for unionism made compulsory by Commonwealth law, and, if adopted, will be a precedent for compelling the farmers and dairymen of the Commonwealth to join a union, and for compelling the wholesale merchants of all kinds to join another union. ° Mr JOWETT --Hav e they not done so?",44
153,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Whateve r has been done wealth has been done voluntarily; what is now of proposed is compulsion by law, which is years, quite a different thing. The course now proposed to be taken will he a precedent whole clip. for compelling the retail houses-the grocers, drapers, confectioners, and others - to join a union for the regulation j)rices, as well as a precedent for comstation pelling the miners, waterside workers, transport operatives, shearers, mechanics and labourers of the Comnioiiwealth to join One Big Union. These men have their labour"" to sell, and do not wish sell it below a certain price. Are Ave them. justified in saying to the in, "" You must join one big union, because if you do you will compete with one another, and the bottom will fall out of the labour market."" It is proposed to limit the - comat. pulsory unionism of the wool-growers to a period of six months-the Prime Minister suggested two months; but it get seems to me that if the arrangement is be successful it must last for five or years. Like the Prime Minister, I doubt that it will succeed. As a political to economist, I question the wisdom of what is proposed, and as a member of Parliawill, ment, responsible for the operation of laws he votes for, I. am not prepared take the blame of the failure that may result. Representing, as I do, a pastoral constituency, I know the value of the toral industry. According to the last issue of the Gommonwealth Year-Booh, the valuation of Commonwealth productions of wealth in 1918 was as follows:£ Agriculture .. .. 58,080,000 Pastoral .. .. .. 98,297,000 Dairy, poultry, and bee-farming .. 33,738,000 Forestry and fisheries 7,137,000 Mining .: 26,156,000 Manufacturing (a) ... 75,261,000 Total .. .. ..£298,669,000 Pastoral production includes living animals-horses , cattle, sheep; frozen beef, frozen mutton and lamb, hides, and sheep skins, tallow, wool, &c. It is stated thatThe chief contributing factor to the pastoral wealth of Australia is the production of wool, the value of the output for the season ended 30th June, 1919, being about £42,490,000. The bulk of the wool produced in the Commonis exported, but with greater activity the local woollen mills there bas, in recent been an increasing quantity used in Australia, although even now the quantity so used represents only about 3 per cent, of the Some pastoralists have done very well of recent years, and good luck to them. of The men and women who have taken up life deserve to do well, and there are few city dwellers who would not, if they knew all the hardships, the toil, and the risks that have to be faced by those on the land, hesitate about changing to places with even the most successful of A proposal affecting one of the main innot dustries of the Commonwealth should receive our best support and consideration, and we should also endeavour to do justice to the people of the Commonwealth large. As I understand the position, the Commonwealth sold our wool on the understanding that the ""growers should not less than Is. 3Jd. per lb for it , to to gether with half of any profits over and six above that. The deal was so successful that the British Government paid for all the wool at Is. 3£d., and there remains be sold 2,700,000 bales. Fifty per cent, of the profit of the sale of this wool after expenses have been deducted, the go to the Australian, New Zealand, and to' South African growers of it . So much has been said of Bawra-the British-Australian Wool Realization Associationpasthat it is of interest to ascertain its origin. I understand that the association was formed because the buying and Belling of wool was one of the last trading operations of the British Government, and that Government wished to get rid of it. It decided, therefore, to form a company with a nominal capital of £44,000,000. This company is really an assets realization institution.",45
154,Mr FLEMING,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I do not think that the suggestion for the formation of this company came from the British Government.,46
155,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Whereve r it came from, a company was formed with a capital of which only £5 was paid in cash, the £44,000,000 being represented by the valuation of the 2,700,000 bales of wool which were to be controlled, 4 valuation based on the prices of the boom period, which must now go by the Board. Nominally £22,000,000 of the capital of the company belongs to. the British Government, and £22,000,000 to the wool growers of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It is proposed to issue £10,000,000 of the wool-growers' share of the capital in priority certificates or warrants, bearing no interest, but negotiable by banks and other institutions, and to issue £12,000,000 in share certificates, which are to carry a dividend, if there is a dividend. This may suggest a way out. What is to prevent the directorate of Bawra, . five of whom are in England and six in Australia, from negotiating with the British Government with a view to its accepting from the wool-growers' section of the association-the Australian, New Zealand, and South African growers of the wool-priorit y certificates or warrants, to be redeemed when the wool is sold - The wool-growers could then determine what should be done with the wool.",46
156,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,You suggest that it should be purchased by the Australian Bawra ?,46
157,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes , and that thS Australian Bawra should negotiate with the British Government for the acceptance of priority certificates for it.",46
158,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The undertakings given to the British public and to the British trade by the Imperial Government stand in the way of that.,46
159,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The question is, can this be done? Can the price which the Acting Prime Minister^ said should be fixed be fixed with success? Can'Australia control the wool markets of the world? To ascertain this it is well to know where the sheep of the world are.

160,Mr FLEMING,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"In 1919 Australia had only 75,000,000 sheep. . Mr HlGGS - The figures relating to foreign countries were taken by our Com-' monwealth Statistician from the Tear Book of the United States of America Department of Agriculture. It would appear that the approximate number of sheep in the world is in the neighbourhood of 550,000,000 to which total Australia contributes nearly 16 per cent. I notice that no mention in this record is made of the number of sheep possessed by Japan, and I have not had time to look up the figures.

163,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Has the honourable member got the United States production and consumption in his mind f,48
164,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I take my figures from the Commonwealth Year-book, and my point is that if 3,000,000 bales is the sumption for anaverage year, the world cannot take the 7,000,000 bales, except its sale is spread over a period of years.",48
165,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Has the honourable member taken into account the consumption of locally-produced wool in the various countries ?,48
166,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes . For our purposes this table shows' the destination of our wool, and the wool of Cape Colony and Eiver Plate. I ask honourable members what would be the effect of .our having 7,000,000 bales of wool on hand, with the price fixed at 8d. per lb., below which Australian growers may not sell. I doubt - ihe wisdom of the mtion of the Government in this regard, if that action be taken. We shall have to bear all the odium if - there be a failure; and later on I propose to ask honourable members to consider the position of those at present engaged in the industry. It appears to me that if the Government are to take control of the wool in the interests of the industry, it would be better to leave the fixing of the price from time to time to the directors of Bawra and the wool-growers associated with them. Suppose that the directors decide that, on account of the market, 8d. per lb. is too much, and Parliament is not sitting. Of course, if Parliament were sitting, an alteration in the price could he made in anhour.",48
167,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The prico can be reviewed and altered by Executive aot.,48
168,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I do not agree with those who say that it would be wise to hoard these millions of bales of wool. In the true and permanent interests of the pastoral industry and the general public, that wool should be put into use, although not at a sacrifice price. The' gentlemen who form the directorate of Bawra comprise the very - best brains in the pastorarinduatry, and we understand that the graziers and others interested in the production of wool are all agreed that the course proposed is the proper one. If they are united in that opinion, I suggest to them that, rathor than come to the Government for the assistance of the lawmeaning, of course, the military, police, and Customs officers-the y should go in for voluntary co-operation, which appears conto be a great deal more successful than Government compulsory co-operation.",48
169,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,But they are not all agreed upon this proposal.,48
170,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The majority of tbemare. I do not believe that, if the Government fail to fix the price, the. people engaged in the industry will rush their wool on the market, regardless of the quantity that may be bought, and so bring the price down to a low figure. The best plan I have heard suggested is that the British Government should sell the 2,700,000 bales of Bawra wool to Germany and Austria. I heard one honourable member say that that policy would mean that our late enemies would turn the wool into textiles, which would compete unfairly with the products of British manufacture. !No doubt they would, but the suggestion iscoupled with a proposal that the Government should accept from Germany and Austria, for the wool, gold bonds redeemable in five years and carrying interest at 6J per cent., and that the wool should be only for consumption within thoso two countries, and should not be exported. We know that the Allies have not been able yet to arrange for the payment of the indemnity by Germany, and that there is a great deal - of unrest in the world; but that matter may bo settled at any time. There can be no doubt that the .people of Germany and Austria require wool. During the war they were compelled to use paper instead of wool and cotton for underclothing. Much of this accumulated wool, being cross bred, and of. poorer quality, could be used hy the German- - and Austrian people for the manufacture of the-clothes they require, as well as earpets, rugs, and other textiles of that character. As evidence of what Australia is losing by not trading with Germany, I submit the following table, which has been furnished to BIO by Mr G. H . KnibbB, acting for the Commonwealth Statistician:COMMONWEALTH or 'Exports of Wool to Germany. Greasy Wool. Scoured Wool.

Germany was buying Australian wool to the value of £8,000,000 pier annum-fort y million sterling in five years-and I have no doubt that as soon trading conditions become settled that volume of business wil l be restored. There must be, - in our own in terest, a time limi t to international hatreds; the pastoralists and other primary producers will suffer so. long as there is a refusal to trade freely with the continent of Europe, Germany and Austria included. I sincerely hope that the. payment of the indemnity will be made as soon as possible, in order that the world may get back into its stride and that the people who are unemployed in all the big cities throughout the world may be provided with work. I read the other day-aud this bears upon the capacity of the wool-buyers of the world to pay an average price of 9d - that there were, 3,000,000 unemployed in the United States of America; 2,000,000 in Germany; and in February last 1,300,000 in Great Britain .",48
171,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,And contribution. Mr Higgs.,49

Mr HIGGS - We are passing through the crisis that inevitably follows every £ £ war in everv country. There was the 14,583,296 1,052,709 6/106,623 boom period during the war, when all the mills, factories, aud workshops were 10,641,771 780,561 5,050,974 producing at their maximum, material which was just as rapidly being destroyed on the battlefields. Then, when the armistice was signed, there was a boom, and competing buyers of wool forced up the IDS. 3,008,817 * 128,792 prices. That boom soon ceased, and to35.068 .. 2,308 day nearly all the wholesale houses are 131,100 stocked with goods which they bought at high prices during the war or during the boom following the armistice, and there is naturally a poorer demand for commodities, and unemployment. One diffiTotal culty connected with the wool position Valua. is that wool iB not like copper and other metals. When the price of copper £ £ slumped the mines closed down; but the 255,560 3,275,200 262,500 8,106,000 wool is growing all the time, and the erower has to get rid of his.product. If the House endorses the Government scheme to fix a flat rate of 8d. per l b . , below which wool must not be exported, pounds what will happen to wool-growers who own the sheep at the present time and as the will own the 1921-22 clip? There are 4,000,000 bales of Bawra and free wool to be sold. What will be the outlook of the wool - growers 1 They will not be allowed to sell under 8d. per lb. flat rate for export. If the whole of the wool-growers were in a huge co-operative body and all were-to share in the benefits or diminished profits, the position: would be bad enough, but they are not all included in the Bawra scheme. What is to happen to those men wbo cannot sell their wool under a certain price ? Will they shear their sheep ? And if the .wool is shorn, where are we to store it? An honourable member said the other day that some pastoralists were burning their wool because it did not pay them to take it away.",49
174,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I have not heard of any one burning wool.,49
175,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"T heard one honourable member speak of it . However, it onlywe have our own shows the great difficulties of the position. If the Government say that they will fixthe price at Sd., I shall support them,, but will accept no responsibility in so doing. I have given my views of the position from a political economy standpoint.",49
176,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"If the time indicated by the Acting Prime Minister is the period fixed, it is not likely to apply to the new clip.",50
177,Mr HIGGS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"As to the period, the buyers will say, "" This is only to last for two months, and then it must break down""; or, ""We have only to wait six months, when this scheme will break down."" Therefore, it would be wise to provide that the terminating date shall be fixed by proclamation, thus enabling - the Government to be advised by the directors of Bawra when the time arrives for this control 6*f wool to cease. Mr EonoERS - That will be the position. The Government will, during the time, have an opportunity of reviewing the situation.",50

200,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Exactly . I am would have fallen. satisfied that the House will do well to support the Bawra scheme. The position has been put in a nutshell by the Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). The honourable member Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) was the first working classes. to propound in this House the proposal that the Imperial Government's interest our stock of carry-over wool should be bought out, and that we should gradually dispose of that wool. He made that sugworkers gestion by way of interjection, and later on the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) stole his thunder, put H forward as his own scheme._ thought at first that it would be well the pastoralists of Australia could financed by the British Government, the 'Commonwealth Bank, or by any of the Associated Banks, so that they might buv up that wool.",53

202,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"No ; but sell it on long terms to the poverty-stricken peoples i of Europe.

203,Mr CUNNINGHAM,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable memGovernment scheme? ber would not suggest ""giving the people of other countries better terms than we of them. are prepared to give our own.people 1",53
204,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"No . The Actanswers Bawra's request. ing Prime Minister and the honourable member for Capricornia have exposed the fallacy of that proposal. I am willing to ""carry the baby"" so far as this scheme is concerned. It is important, not only to the pastoralists, but to the small sheep-farmer, the grazing upon wool-growing. homesteader, and to the workers genewool rally. What would become of Roma, Charleville, Rockhampton, and other cattle. Queensland towns, if , following upon practically the collapse of Mount Morgan, we had a collapse of the pastoral industry ? The country would not recover during our lifetime frgm such a financial shock. For that reason alone, if for no other, I would welcome the Bawra scheme. I have every confidence in the men at its head.",53
205,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"So serious was the position created that sales were called off. all If the prices then ruling had continued, rural credits would have fallen, and wages",53
206,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Credit s would have stopped, and we all know what Acting would then have happened. .",53
207,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It is interesting to observe honourable members opposite alfor most shedding tears on behalf of the,53
208,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The Assistant in Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) knows what effect a total collapse of the pastoral industry would have on all the who depend upon it for a livelihood. Every man with a heart, whether he be a Conservative or Labour man, must and sympathize with the people who are deI pending on the industry. I feel for if them; and I may also say that I do not be want to ""go broke"" any more than I ' by want to see any other man ""go broke."" Prosperity is good for all of us. When the country was prosperous we raised our own "" screws"" as members of Parliament because we thought we deserved it ; but there is no means by which those dependent upon wool-growing can raise "" screws "" if the bottom falls out of",53

213,Mr RODOEES,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Governm'ent scheme,53
214,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is so.

215,Mr WEINHOLT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Do not forget the,53
216,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Quite so. I am not too sure about the position of the cattle-raising industry. The tallow market is falling, and meat is going down in price. ' Some eighteen months ago a man in Charleville, in my presence, offered 35s. per head for ewes in lamb and nearly fully fleeced. The person to whom that ' offer was made would not take it.",54
217,Mr WIENHOLT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Tw o fools met.,54
218,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes . same sheep can now be bought for 8s. 6d. The price of cattle has gone down, and is still .going down. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) spoke of price fixing. Nothing fixes prices better than supply and demand.",54
219,Mr FOLEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,What about the few who control supplies at certain times?,54
220,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"It is not the few who are controlling supplies in Queens-, land. Some of the run-holders are not getting full value for their cattle; many of them are not getting the market value.",54
221,Mr FOLEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That is because a few can control the supply or the demand.,54
222,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"If the honourable member wants a few thousand head of fat cattle, he can get them within twenty-four hours. Any demand he might make could be supplied very quickly.",54
223,Mr FLEMING,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Cattl e are just half the price now that they were twelve months ago.,54
224,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That shows that the law of supply and demand is regulating the price of stock.,54

229,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The mantle of the Jeremiah seems to have fallen on the burly shoulders of the Honourable member. He is usually an optimist.,54
230,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Notwithstand ing the pessimistic view of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), I have sufficient faith in my country, and in the pastoral industry, to think that it will pull through. I have implicit faith in the pastoral industry.",54
231,Mr FLEMING,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"And in the men who , are running it.",54
232,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes . I have Those alsoimplicit faith in Bawra, because those who are running it are tried and experienced in the wool business. The picture painted by. the Prime Minister iast week was an awful one.",54
233,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable member has painted a similar picture, though he fears not merely the collapse of the pas(toral industry, but the blotting out of it. The Prime Minister did not go so far as that.",54
234,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is what I do fear, and if the honourable member was interested in wool he would think as I do. Bawra is throwing out a life-line to the industry, and I am satisfied that it will pull us through. Had the honourable member fulfilled the mission on which he was sent Home, these difficulties would not have occurred.",54
235,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Why ?,54
236,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Because you would have financed things so that the collapse eould not have occurred.,54
237,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That was not in the proposition.,54

We do not wish to diminish.the Naval'Estimates, or those for naval shipbuilding;, but. we did' noti give: the Government! carte blancKe to. permit such a fiasco as we have witnessed at Cockatoo Island. M f . EODGERS - It isonly fair to say1 that the land referred to'by the honourable, member was bought on the recommenda-r tion of the Suiveyor-General of the Commonwealth Dr . EARLE P.AGE - That may be; but the Government must take the"" responsibility-no t the individualmembers of. this House-and I throw it back.on.the Government. I . now: wish to deal with the wool question,- which overshadows all others by-reason, of . its importance and its influence on the ultimate financial position of the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that the position now is very serious. The only newspaper that seems to regard it, as not serious is the Age, and in the leader of this morning, the writer apparently takes that view because it does not affect the city interests of Melbourne.",56
257,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Age says that the scare is exaggerated.,57
258,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The Age suggests that it h merely a bogey scare. I - should like to deal for a few moments with .the argument uor.d against the views expressed by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) and by other graziers outside this House. I do not wish to dogmatize in any way. I recognise that any proposition put forward is purely tentative and experimental. The view thar I desire to put is that the proposal by Bawra, though offering grave objections, is the one which holds the field against any other yet publicly made. The position is made doubly difficult of discussion and solution by reason of the conflicting interests that are involved. But one may be helped to arrive at a correct conclusion by looking at the way in which. the various conflicting interests are pulling. When we find that the wool buyers, who admit that they represent the manufacturers in Australia, Great Britain, America, and on the continent of Europe, strongly advocate a certain course which is in opposition to the unanimously expressed wish of practically all the graziers and wool brokers throughout Australia, one is justified in treating their advice with a certain amount of suspicion, and, looking for some reason which is not apparent on the surface, why it should not be carried out. In their letter, published in the Argus today, they "" let the cat out of the bag ' ' when they sayAustralia should not attempt to. force European manufacturers to purchase here, as, in the unsettled state of affairs, sufficient wool present requirements can be secured elsewhere. Australian wool is not the acme of perfection assumed by the member for Maranoa. "" The finest wool in the world "" is grown in southern Europe. That is the first point I wish to make. In the second place, I wish to correct the impression sought to be created both outside and inside the House, that the wool-growers and the whole pastoral industry are in a state of prosperity and free of hardships. That is not so. There have been pastoralists in favourably situated districts who have had the good fortune to do well, but throughout the whole of northern New South Wales the present position of every pastoralist is very precarious indeed. I know of one man who had 110,000 sheep, and who has had to spend during the last eighteen months £70,000 in actual drought costs; .his sheep are reduced to 30,000, he is up to the limit of his overdraft, and cannot get further assistance from the bank to even pay wages. He has withdrawn his three boys from King's School, Sydney, and has discharged all the other men on his place, while he seeks, with the help of his three boys, to handle the station. The sole reason for this is that the. bank has said that, whilst it will not call up his overdraft, it will not advance him any more with which to carry on. There are many other men who, if they are able to pay for the shearing of their sheep, will not be able to pay the freight to send the wool to Sydney, to enable it to be offered at auction or forwarded to England. It is proper that the true position of the pastoral industry should be rightly estimated by the public of Australia. Throughout northern New South Wales there is a universal inquiry as to the possibility of introducing a moratorium in that district in order to enable the wool-growers to tide over the present trying times.",57
259,Mr GABB,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Were the two men whom the honourable member mentioned in the industry'before the war?,57
260,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"They have been in this industry for the last thirty vears. I know of one man who was worth £50,000 at the beginning of the war, but who went out of the pastoral industry a year ago, and today is working for wages at the Newcastle steel works. In those circumstances I repel the statement that the pastoral industry is not in need of assistance at the present time. It is for in the interests of the men who are creatinthe wealth of Australia, and enabling the Government to raise taxation, as weil as in the interests of other associated industries-the selling agencies established in Australia as the result of many years of work and co-ordination-rathe r than to assist the interests that are represented by the Wool Buyers Association, that I am prepared to support a scheme that receives the unanimous support of all the growers and the brokers, except one, and all the banks, except two, which by a strange chance happen to be institutions the bulk of whose capital is found in London.",57
261,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,And they are interested in London credits.,58
262,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I cannot speak as to that.' I desire to examine the various remedies that have been suggested to meet the present critical situation, for, I think, even the Age will admit that the situation is critical. Four alternatives have been suggested. The first is that the whole of the Bawra wool should be thrown on the market with the present clip and that there should be a free auction. What - would be the inevitable effect of that course? We have seen that when portions of the Bawra clip have been thrown on the market during the last year the prices at the first sale sagged from 10 to 20 per cent., and at the next open sale a further 20 per cent. The effect of putting the whole of the Bawra wool up for auction would be that the market would fade away, there would be general bankruptcy in the pastoral industry, and there would be no assets with which the pastoralist could finance himself, whilst outside speculators would be enabled to acquire the wool at a very low price and hold it in such a way as to unstabilize the market for some years. That is a fair statement of what would happen if the whole of the wool were thrown on the market. The second - alternative suggested is to persuade the I m perial Government, as half owner, to hold the Bawra wool off the market. That idea has a considerable number of supporters. Of course, the difficulties in the way of that scheme are that half the wool does belong to the Imperial Government, and, as Sir John Higgins has said, it was only with considerable difficulty that the British Treasury officials were induced to permit the Bawra wool being placed on the market in the proportion of one bale to"" two bales of the fresh clip. Quite apart from that it seems to me that holding at the back of the market this huge accumulation of wool, which with the carry-over this year will amount to practically two years' clip, will create a spectre which will keep the market continually unstabilized. Even if it did not have any effect on the market at all I am one of those who hold that the principle which has been suggested of dumping the [328] wool into the sea or burning it would be an international crime, when the bulk of the people of Central Europe are threadbare. I express considerable surprise at the attitude of Labour members of the House who, apparently, think only of a few interests in Australia and neglect altogether the interests of the British consumer and the wearers of the goods at the other end of the world, who have a right to such treatment as would insure them clothes at a reasonable figure. The third alternative suggested, and it seems to be the most popular in Australia, because, apparently, its authorship is claimed by two members on opposite sides of the House, is that we should buy the British Government's share and still hold the' wool off the market. The principle of holding back the wool is vicious. The idea of a Government cornering a commodity of this nature, and keeping it entirely out of consumption for the purpose of keeping up prices is altogether wrong.",58
263,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That is exactly what the Bawra scheme means.,58
264,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"No . It will allow the wool to go into circulation, provided that there is a fair price assured. The Government cornering of a necessity in the way suggested must inevitably lead to a mental conception of Australia in other countries which it does not deserve after the efforts made by our people during the war. But apart from this aspect, the main difficulty in the way of purchasing the wool from the British Government is that it would involve from £4,000,000 to £8,000,000, according to the value which the Imperial authorities place on the wool. And who would find that money? We cannot ask the public to find it. We cannot expect the Australian Government to further tie up development, as it is being tied up at the present time simply because State Government after State Government is unable to borrow inoney to carry on national works. The purchase price would have to come out of the realization of the present clip. But my objection to the proposal is greater than that. At the present time, the Imperial Government is a partner in this Bawra wool. If we buy out the British Government, it will lose .all interest in the wool; but it being able to give extended credits to European countries, and being on the spot always to advise us as how to get the wool away, is the best factor in helping ns to get the wool sold. We would be acting against our own interests if we bought out the British interest. There is a further reason why it would be unwise to hold the Bawra wool off the market, and that is the great risk of deterioration of a considerable portion of it. From 7 to 10 per cent, of the total is scoured wool, which is liable to moth. The burry wool., also, is liable to deterioration. But my biggest objection is this: That when a shrewd organization like the Wool.buyers' Association is so very keen to have the wool held off the market, I can-not be convinced that it is in order that the price may be kept up: The buyers say that as they are paid by commission it would he against their interests to bring about a reduction in the price of wool; but can any one imagine that if they are able to get wool at a low rate they will not get something better than commission from their employers? What would be the other effect of holding Bawra wool off the market. It comprises about half of cross bred and half of merino. There is no doubt that there will always be a fairly decent market for merino wool. The difficulty will be in disposing of the cross bred wool. very fact of keeping the Bawra cross bred wool off the market will simply make it easier for South America, with its surplus of 300,000,000 lbs. of cross bred, to sell at better prices. America will unload her wool while we keep the market up for her. If South Africa comes into the Bawra scheme, there is no reason why Bawra should not control the whole market, and an Empire Association will be able to make other countries which grow cross bred wools to come to terms. So far as merinoes are concerned, the Argentine produces only a small proportion compared with Australia, while South Africa, which grows a considerable amount, will be in the Bawra scheme; therefore, in that regard there should he no trouble. Other countries in Europe and America which grow merinoes are not likely to compete with us in the London market, because they will find use for their own wools in their own manufacturing Dr Earle Page. centres. The following figures will bear out the contention of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) as to the destination of merino wool:-In 1913,. Australia sold to the United Kingdom 102,500,000 lbs.; to France, Holland, and Belgium, 214,000,000 lbs.; to Germany and Austria, 164,000,000 lbs.; to Italy and Switzerland, 6,500,000 lbs.; to Russia, Norway, and Sweden, 3,000,000 lbs.; to the United States of America, 16,000,000 lbs.; and to Japan and China, 6,500,000 lbs. We have not been able to utilize these Continental markets as we might have been able to do had wool been cheaper, and if credits could have been arranged much more readily. With a return to something woollike pre-war conditions, there is no reason why the matter of holding the carry-over wool up for two years should be considered, quite apart from the moral aspect of the question, to which I have already alluded. Then we come to the fourth suggestion. From the beginning I have regarded the whole principle involved in the request of the Bawra Directorate to use the Customs Act as very shaky; but this fourth proposal is the least objectionable of them all, and offers the greatest hope of success. Whether it will The be successful remains to be proved, but nevertheless, in the circumstances, it is well worth trying. If the Government propose to take action to give Bawra power in regard to the restriction of reSouth serve prices, I think they have a right to the complete inspection, supervision, and control of Bawra's books, in order to make certain that there is no inside speculation in this private corporation to the detriment of the wool-growers of the Commonwealth. Mr CoNsmiNE - Is that not provided for?",58
265,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Nothin g has been provided for up to the present. T understand that there are 22,000,000 £1 shares in Bawra, of which 5,000,000 aTe to be redeemed before the 31st July next, leaving a balance of about 17,000,000; and it seems to me that, for the protection of the wool-growers, this scrip ought not to be gambled in, as wheat scrip was during the early period of the Wheat Pools. No hardship would be entailed by this restriction. Already Is. 3£d. has been paid on this wool.",59
266,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,And there has been also a substantial division of profits.,60
267,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is so. There should be no hardship in the Government insisting on the control of these points. The absence of these two safeguards would remove Mr Falkiner's objections to the scheme. The Bawra scheme is doing its best to assist the small man. There are 149.000 separate account? in the scheme, and, of these, 59,000 cover individual amounts of less than £100. The small .man is being assisted by the arrangement the scheme is making to pay off all these small holders in cash at the earliest possible moment, this involving an outlay of £600,000.",60
268,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Accordin g to the honourable member's statement, there is no machinery to safeguard these small graziers.",60
269,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"There is no Government machinery at the present time, but tliere is always the machinery to be found in every such corporation.",60
270,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"In the wool trachj, the brokers are the financiers of the graziers. Any refusal to negotiate scrip would mean cutting off the security of the brokers which enables that financial aid to be given.",60
271,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It is all right to give security as long as we do not give the right to traffic in it.,60
272,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is my meaning. I do not imply that the scrip is not to be convertible, but I claim that it ought not to be transferable. Bawra directorate has definitely laid it down that, because some owners may require financial assistance, it will strain every nerve at its disposal to make that assistance available, and that is really the sentiment which actuates the whole scheme. There is only one other matter I wish to speak upon in connection with the actual fabric .of the Bawra scheme, and that is the quantity of the new clip which will be saleable in proportion to the Bawra wool. Two bales of the new clip is to be sold overseas to one bale of Bawra. wool. I think that if the proportion were made three to one it would be a help.",60
273,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"What will be the position Of sheep-owners who have just started. to. produce - wool during the last '[32S]- 2 f year or two, aiid can only place a proportion of their wool ab 8d. per lb. ? Will they not be at a considerable disadvantage, having practically nothing coming, in, whilst the other growers have the dividends from the Bawra scheme coming to them, in addition to the realizations on their new clip?",60
274,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The proportion being two of the current clip to one of Bawra there will be only a difference of one-third of the total amount which they might get otherwise.,60
275,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,But that difference may mean ruin to them.,60
276,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Without a definite scheme of some sort, it will mean ruin, because the wool clip cannot be financed in any other way, and wool of any clio may have no value. The whole object of the Bawra ""scheme is to attempt to stabilize the market to enable our wool to be sold at some price. With no Bawra scheme the saleable price of wool will immediately fall to nothing.",60
277,Mr JASIES PAOE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The small man can get an advance from Bawra which he cannot get from the banks.,60
278,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes . The capital value of the Bawra scheme is £22,000,000, and there is to be a dividend of £5,000,000 before the 31st July next, while as further realizations take place tliere will undoubtedly be other dividends. I understand the position in regard to Bawra is that the actual price paid .by the British Government was Is. 3£d. per lb., and that the British Government have handed the 1,700,000 bales of Australian The carry-over wool and £13,000,000 still available out of profits to the BritishAustralian Wool Realization Association for equal division between the wool growers and the British Government, with the request that the scheme should market this carry-over on condition that half the profits from the sales should go to the Imperial Goverument ",60
279,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Hal f the realizations.,60
280,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is the point. .There may be no profits above Is. 3^d. per lb. .Dr EARLE PAGE - At any rate, the Bawra scheme seems to have - definite advantages over other suggestions. I am not-wedded to it, but it is the best alternative ofiered. We are up against desperate passes, which need desperate expedients, and this scheme will stabilize. the market in some degree, thus enabling sales to take place of wool which, may deteriorate, and which, if not sold, will come a permanent loss to the pastoralists of Australia. As I have already pointed out, a proportion of it must be totally lost if it is not sold and used at once. The scheme will permit of a dividend being distributed to many persons who have no wool in the present clip. Two or three years ago many pastoralists in the north-western district of New South Wales, who have suffered heavily from droughts, had decent clips. They have big drought burdens to pay off at the present time, but have practically no wool in the present clips. A dividend from Bawra would enable a better distribution of money to he made throughout the Commonwealth than would be possible if only the present clip were taken. The scheme under present conditions will tend to keep the wool trade within ordinary channels, and will enable the Australian brokers to maintain their connexions. In addition, a definite minimum value will be put upon the clip, and to some degree this will enable it to be financed, because wool will have some value in the eyes of bankers and financiers.",60
281,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Who is to find this £22,000,000 to which the honourable member is referring?",61
282,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is the value put by the Imperial Government npon the 1,700,000 bales of carry-over wool. It may realise less or it may be more.",61
283,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable member has said that the Bawra scheme proposes to pay £5,000,000 within a certain period.",61
284,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes , from profits. It is out of the £22,000,000..",61
285,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Is it proposed issue certificates for the balance of £17,000,000?",61
286,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Yes .,61
287,Mr CONSDJINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Will those certificates be negotiable on the market? ' Dr EARLE PAGE - I am asking that they should not be trafficable.,61
288,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Then you are cutting the ground from under your own feet. The desire is to create a negotiable asset that will help the pastoralists substantially.,61
289,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"It will clear the minds, of honourable members if I read he- the following extract from Mf. Murphy's speech:It is fully realized that in asking growers, to protect their own interests by sitting tight and holding their wool for a reasonable reserve some owners may require financial assistance to carry on the working of their properties, and in order to assist all growers the directors of Bawra have undertaken under resolution "" E "" to redeem £5,000,000 of priority wool certificates on or before 31st July, 1021.. What further assistance may be required or may be available remains to be seen, but I can. only assure you that Bawra will strain every nerve to support the wool-growcrs by every means at their disposal. Definite promisescan not be made, but everything possible wilt be done.",61
290,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"This £17,000,000worth of certificates will be issued against the wool that is in the Pool.",61
291,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes , pro rata to the holdings - of wool in the Pool. If the Bawra scheme be adopted, four or five years will probably be occupied in working off the accumulation of wool, but. one result of its adoption will be that, manufacturers will know immediately exactly where they stand, and will be induced to get busy in making up their stocks. It is said that the greater portion of a year's clip is generally held in manufacturers' stocks throughout the world. At the present time there is a considerable excess unmanufactured. With a return to the ordinary conditions of trade a great proportion of what is now held in an unmanufactured state will be made into woollens. The stabilizing of the market in this waywill lead manufacturers torecognise that noadvantage is to be gained by holding off; they will be induced to enter upon the making up of their stock ini the same way as before. The Central European countries are undoubtedly bare of wool, and under the to scheme we shall be able to get rid of some of our surplus. The carrying out of a scheme of this character will do something, although it may not be very much,, towards inducing Germany to settle down to business in regard to the payment of its indemnity. At present, Germany is marking time in the hope of securing the best possible terms. The Germans do not intend to set to work too vigorously, feeling that the production they show may be used against them in the determination of what, indemnity they should pay. I am afraid that the higher we fix the demnity the worse the position will ultiwith mately be, since we can only hope to take payment in labour or goods. We do not seem to be too anxious to use their goods; bufc if this scheme be adopted Germany will be able easily to get to work and to use up our surplus. In the last place, I think that this scheme should be supported, for the reason that I gave in support of the propartment. position which was put before us on behalf of the coal miners; ih, other words, the wool-growers know their business best. Graziers' associations in every State have telegraphed to us that they are practically' unanimous in their approval of the position. Not only the associations, the great bulk of individual graziers, are unanimously in favour of it. That being so, I know of no reason why outside person should say that the scheme should not be given a trial. The people who own the wool ask that the scheme tried, and for that reason I do not know why the .Victoria Wool' Buyers AssociaFinally, tion, or any outside body having no promembers perty in this wool, should be allowed to dictate what should be done with it.",61
292,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That would be a very good principle to apply also to the owners of labour power.,62
293,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is a matter some which we may discuss at some other time. have been There are two suggestions that I desire up of the prosperity to put before those who will control wool. The first, which - emanates from liament to accede to theirmay the honourable member for Indi (Mr. Robert Cook) is that if we cannot obtain cash for this wool an effort should be made to exchange it, or a portion of for machinery for the manufacture woollens, as well as for hydro-electric other machinery. Having regard to sent condition, I think that suggestion worthy of consideration. If we were able in that way to secure power-production plants, and machinery for the manufacBawra, ture of woollens, we should be able to solve a good portion of the difficulty manufacturing a great deal more than 2 per cent, of our wool which we, at preunfortunately, 1 sent, turn into woollen goods. Another point which is emphasized by the various grazing associations throughout the Comvoured monwealth is that, although it has been found necessary to try to secure the ap1 proval of this House to the view that owners of wool should not sell at a lower price than the majority of their neighprinted."" bours desire, still as' little political in0 influence as possible should be associated the handling of our wool. They are not anxious, therefore, that a limitation of only two months should be - made in order that the Prime Minister may deal with the whole matter in England; they start desire to be free to do' their own job without political interference.",62
294,Mr CHARLTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,But they are ready to use the machinery of the Customs De,62
295,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"They approve of the use of such machinery; but they do not want the actual business of buying and selling to be subject to the interference of outsiders. Our desire is, not prothat the Customs Act shall be strained but to enable the scheme to be carried also, out, but that having regard to the present circumstances, separate legisany lation shall be passed for the pur- pose. We do not desire that for the purposes of this scheme an interpretation be shall be given to the Customs Act which has not hitherto been applied to it . I would impress upon honourable the fact that practically every association of pastoralists throughout Australia-has asked that this scheme shall be given a trial. Failing that, they consider the position hopeless. Withfcheapproval of this echeme they think there will be own hope for them; and surely those who the wool, and who, to a large extent, responsible for the building of Australia, are enthis titled to a fair deal, and expect Parwishes. - I l r . WATT (Balaclava) [8.52] - I followed the last speaker (Dr Earle Page) it , with very great interest, but must of confess as a student of this proand blem for some little time that I prewas left in doubt as to whether he is an entire supporter of the proposal of the Government. He has told us what he thinks of the objectives and designs of but I do not know whether he .proposes to vote for the motion to show by that the Government scheme is approved the by his party. I had not the advantage, of hearing the statement made today by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook), but I have endeato glean from him and other honourable members what the effect of it was. presume that we are still discussing the primary motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), "" Thafc the paper be Sir' JOSEPH COOK - Yes .",62
296,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That motion applies, as honourable members are aware, to the three principal matters to which the Prime Minister devoted his attention. Although the wool problem, because of the Acting Prime Minister's subsequent statement, has naturally been singled out for special treatment, we ought not to lose sight of the other two problems to which the head of the Government directed his attention. The first of these was that of finance. The Prime Minister, as I read his speech, first of all deprecated wild statements that had been made. In the country and in the press about the expenditure of the Government: He implied-in fact, he almost expressed the idea-that to criticise the outgoings of the Commonwealth was unpatriotio and dangerous at this juncture, aud likely to imperil the credit of the country. Unfortunately, however, after the right honourable gentleman had administered that rebuke to indiscriminate critics in the country and the press, himself uttered statements which, I think, coming from His responsible lips, are more calculated to shake the financial fabric of this country than anything, which has been said by outside critics. I lament the fact that the right honourable gentleman, in the obvious hurry in which he made his explanation to the House, was not better advised, because I can conceive of nothing calculated to damage the Wool credit and the money credit of this country abroad more than the statements made by him. Already, as-I shall have occasion to remark later, private finance in this country is causing those responsible for its guardianship the gravest possible concern. I shall go no further than that, but with sliding values lor almost all assets upon which bank advances have been made, it is obvious that bankers must deal with the situation with the greatest delicacy and tenderness. situation ought not to be aggravated by any words of ours, or of responsible leaders of the Government, making the task of private financiers, which is closely connected with public finance, more difficult. I watched with interest the right honourable gentleman's efforts to convince the people of this country that the Government was doing its duty in relation to finance. He, first, of all . earmarked quite, a number of items on the disbursement side of the balance sheet of the Commonwealth as being unalterable. They were statutory obligations he said, and therefore, nobody could lay unholy hands upon them. I do not know whether any other honourable member was satisfied with that statement, either as an analysis of the situation or as an assurance - of economy and wisdom in the future, but I candidly confess that I was not. The way in which responsibility was transferred by the utterances of the Prime Minister from the shoulders of the Government to those of members of the Committee of Supply, and of this House, struck, I think, a blow at the base of responsible government. It is true, as the honourable member who has just spoken said, that each of us has his individual share of responsibility as a holder of the purse strings; but for the Governor General's message originating all items of expenditure here, whether out of revenue or loan, the Government is primarily, and, up to a certain stage, is wholly responsible. I do not desire, at any time, to shed my rehe sponsibility as a private member, and the Ministry can never shed their responsibility.",63
297,Dr MALONEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable member shed it when he went "" into the void "" in England.",63
298,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I did not.,63
299,Dr MALONEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Where is the"" void ?",63
300,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Stud y holy writ. I am not going to bandy words with the honourable member. We have sat together in Parliament for twenty-three or twenty four years, and during that period have had our quarrels, but have remained friends, and if the honourable member will permit me, I shall pursue my ordinary course, and discuss' public questions regardless of personalities. The expenditure of the Commonwealth this year ip, in round figures, £98,000,000. No amount of juggling can get r i d of the fact that this country desires that every item that The can be eliminated' from the expenditure list shall be cut out. The responsibility for that work rests upon M in isters. The right honourable gentleman who presides over the Treasury suggested, in the letter which the Prime Minister read, the appointment of accounting officers who, under a new system, will exercise some check in the Departments. I do not believe that that arrangement would be evil or costly, but I do not believe it would be effective. The appointment of a committee of management of the Public Service, as recommended by the Economy Commission, for which the Government became responsible last session, would, I believe, .be more effective. But even that is not likely to be as effective as this House and the country would desire. The more you study the history of the alternating periods of prosperity and depression in each of the various colonies or States of Australia, the more you become convinced that there is only one power that can cut down expenditure, and that is the Ministerial power. The officials cannot do it ; responsible Ministers are the only persons who can do it . In 1894. Victoria re-organized her expenditure of her public services. The honourable member for Kooyong was a member of the Government to which, under the late Sir George Turner, was intrusted the task of squaring the account. The public officials did not do the work; it was done by Ministers themselves. After two years of incessant toil, the Treasurer and Premier of the State was able to announce that the ledger was balanced. It is going to be the same in Australia with - whatever Government may be in power, when the coming crisis really arrives; and I beg the right honourable gentleman who presides over the Treasury with a much longer experience of public life and Ministerial office than I can hope for, to remember that he cannot shed responsibility, or give to any one else the"" power to do work that Ministers alone can do.",63
301,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I do not wish to shed a tittle of responsibility; but the right honourable member, as an ex-Treasurer, knows that while certain Statutes have force the Treasurer must finance them. That is what is meant by statutory obligations.",64
302,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is"" so, and it is hot so, to speak quite frankly. The House,, in Committee of Supply, at the request of the Governor General, appropriates votes either out of revenue or out of loan money. The Crown is given authority to spend that money; hut it is not obligatory on a Government to spend it. and it has often been the boast of Treasurers in the Commonwealth and in the State to Parliament, ""You gave me so much money, and I have succeeded in saving so much.""",64
303,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Tak e shipbuilding, for instance. Mr WlATT - It may be that, backed with the authority of f-upply or loan appropriation, the Government has committed itself to contracts for certain classes of work. If so, it must meet those commitments to the ful l amount. Butwith regard to the vast bulk of our estimated expenditure-£9S,,000,000-the House expects-at any rate, I , as an individual member, do-that the Ministry will save as much as they can without impairing the usefulness of the votes. It is idle to say that honourable members can lay their hands on only 3J per cent, of that sum. Every detail ought to be scanned with the view of cutting out every penny of unnecessary expense, and to see, as the Prime Minister said, that we get 20s. worth for every sovereign expended. \",64
304,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable member is misrepresenting what was said and what was intended if he suggests that it was intimated that in regard to £3,,500,000 only could discretion be exercised. The Prime Minister told the House that there were certain unavoidable expenditures which had been authorized by Parliament. For instance, Parliament voted so much for Defence, and so much for the Post Office. It says now that what was voted for Defence is not too much, and that what was voted for the Post Office is not enough. The Government' must have respect to those obligations or go out of office.",64
305,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I - am afraid my right honourable friend cannot, by this dialogue, bring me to his point of view. I have always held it to be the duty of the finance Minister, and of any Minister, to regard his vote as the maximum authority of Parliament, and to save everything possible without impairing"" the usefulness of the appropriation.",64
306,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I do not dissent from that. »,64
307,Mr WEST,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Do we understand that 20s. in the £ 1 of value has not .been got by this Government?,64
308,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am not making that assertion, though there are obvious reasons for suggesting that, in some cases the Government has failed to get 20s. worth for. a £ 1 of expenditure. I allude to recent statements made before Royal Commissions. The Treasurer will pardon me .for dwelling on two other phases of this question. He knows better than any one else that he is facing new conditions in regard to Customs revenue. The Customs revenue has held up wondrously during the first nine months of the financial year, but it cannot hold up right through the year, and is now sliding ' heavily.",64
309,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Not heavily;- it is keeping up wonderfully at present.,65
310,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Thos e who know the figures of importations now and to come have reasons for believing that the right honourable gentleman cannot, next year, depend on the same returns from Customs and Excise, especially from Customs, as he has had this year, and Customs and Excise duties are the main source of in direct revenue. How much this revenue will fall I will not presume to predict; the right honourable gentleman, with liis staff and the officers of the Customs Department are. best able to do that. There will, however, be a substantial difference between the Customs and Excise revenue for 1921-22 and that for the year ending on the 30th of next month.",65
311,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,There is no doubt about that.,65
312,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Revenu e from income taxation will also f all . I am not abusing a confidence when I say that I know of a company in this country, engaged in a mercantile business, which has already written down the value of its stock sum of £200,000 . That vast sum off one balance-sheet in reduction of the assessed value of the assets of the corporapromise, tion. Honourable members will see, if that ie symptomatic of what is being done generally by the holders of stock the conductors of wholesale and retail businesses, that the income tax paid next year on the profits earned this year w i l be a substantially diminished one, and I am sure that the Treasurer is not comnecessity fortable in the cushioned chair that adorns, when he thinks of next year's income from direct taxation.",65
313,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I have never been comfortable.,65
314,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The right honourable gentleman has disguised his embarrass-ment with characteristic aplomb. drives me to one conclusion' about the financial outlook, and I suggest to the fact. r i g ht honourable gentleman who presides over the affairs of the Government, it is gravely necessary to introduce Budget as early as possible in the coming financial year. I noticed the promise in the Pirime Minister's speech, but the Tariff discussion . will consume a vast amount of time, and members will naturally desire to rise as soon as that work is over, so that, probably, we shall not be summoned to meet again u n t il reasonably late in the spring. If , in addition, the presentation of the Budget is to await the return of the Prime Minister, it is possible, and 1 think probable, that we may not have the financial statement until November.",65
315,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Budget will be introduced before the Prime Minister returns.,65
316,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I am satisfied with that promise. The Prime Minister spoke of it being delivered as early as possible.,65
317,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Treasurer has already promised that it shall be delivered in September.,65
318,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I hope that it will be delivered not late in September, and I trust that the right honourable gentleman will keep his promise if the House is meeting then. We shall then individually share with the M in is try the responsibility for scanning carefully all the proposals for expenditure, and for financing them out of the pockets of the people or with money raised here or abroad. Mr RIOHAE D FOSTEB - And the M in istry will then have an opportunity to by the redeem its promise to considerably is taken diminish expenditure.",65
319,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I have not heard that though I should like to hear it .,65
320,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Prime M in ister said that no expenditure should be and undertaken which could be avoided.,65
321,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The Prime Minister has said that this Government is not extraval gant. I do hot wish to canvass his speeches in his absence, but I am sure that stern will with in the next year or he two drive whoever may be at the Treasury to the most economical living. It it does not, the conviction of the people of Australia-certainl y of those in this part of Australia, will do so.",65
322,Sir ROBERT BEST,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,There will not be This much to spend.,65
323,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That I believe to be the Now I come to wheat. I am that not one of those who say that the the Government is doing wrong in selling wheat abroad at the prices it is now getting and charging 9s. for it here. If , as the Prime Minister has shown, the Australian consumer is, on the average, getting wheat cheaper than the f.o.b. price of exported wheat, I am satisfied. I think that the parity should be kept as nearly as possible in all these transactions. Difficulty, has occurred through , what I think to be the cardinal blunder of fixing the .price for-twelve months. The Government disclaims responsibility for that.",65
324,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It looks as if we were going to come out all right. The. price of wheat is up again.,66
325,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Judgin g by today's quotation, ""Yes;"" hut the price of 8s. 6d. in New York is a much lower one than we are charging here.",66
326,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It would represent well over 9s.,66

328,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"It is against the purchaser of every American product. If this Government had wished for a monthly or quarterly fixation pf price, it could have arranged for it.  the product all the time?",66
329,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That was adjustable. Technically the Government might have had no constitutional power, but it held the finance end of the advance, the effect - of which was to regulate anything, it chose to regulate. I am not raising the cry of town against country. I think thht parity should ""be maintained as far as possible; but in regard to a commodity which fluctuates - generally very quickly, and which in the yeai when the fixation, was made would - obviously rise or fall, a perilous risk of misunderstanding and injustice was taken in fixing the price for twelve months. How the matter will end none qf us can predict; all we can say is that so far the - average has not been unjust to the consumers.",66
330,Mr RIOHAED POSTEH,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Did not State Premiers buy the wheat for the year ?,66
331,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That was done in Victoria, and probably in the other States, hut I think it was a mistake to allow no mobility in the price, giving a relative parity in any menth or quarter when a shipment was made. Now I wish to discuss the wool question as far as I understand it , and I take it to be, in the strictest sense of the word, a non-party question. For example, I listened to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) today, flatly contradicting the treasonable old statement that no true blue Labour member could advocate the claims of the rich squatter.' He endeavoured to see through the mist of party prejudice, and advocate the pastoral interests of his electorate and of the great northern reaches of Queensland, and he gave us a very interesting exposition of his views. I regard this as an entirely non-party question, which is grave or gay, according to the temperament of mam. The optimist is not so frightened of the situation. The pessimist, arid the honourable member for Maranoa assumed that role today, is right down in the depths of anxiety and tribulation. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) unfortunately encouraged that view, and as I hope to be able to show, gave us too gloomy a picture. I speak as one who lives. in the town, bufc has endeavoured to understand the country, interests, and who, for a considerable time during the Prime Minister's absence in Europe, was the Minister handling the . wool scheme. It was my duty then to try to understand this question, and I have since continued my studies as far as a private member can. I do not think this is a time when a man should tie himself hard and fast . to any dogmatic reading of the facts. The wisest and best informed amongst us may make an error of judgment. We ought all to enter the discussion of this matter saying that we cannot see much further than our noses. Conditions may improve much faster than the most hopeful minds anticipate, but on the other hand they may become blacker.",66
332,Mr WEST,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The man who does not take that view is not fit to be a member of the House.,66
333,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am glad to hear that statement, because we are all too prone the to follow our own individual view of the facts. I hold fairly strong views upon this question, but I am. willing to adjust them if my facts are wrong or my reading of them is faulty. I desire to express some opinions which take a different 8056 Ministerial track from those which have been expressed to-night. T t is no good to burk a serious position. We should frankly acknowledge it . But it is just as unwise to overdo it , because of the indirect con.sequences that flow from such an action. And in over-stating the case, which I am afraid the Prime Minister did, we are likely to place undue importance upon a temporary set of conditions affecting a great staple industry. I am willing to concede the importance of the pastoral industry of Australia, but say that Australia is not on the back of a merino sheep. It has other bearings bases, and although disaster may f all upon the pastoralist, and that disaster.be sympathetically reflected in every walk of life, still Australia is not ruined, because we have seen men engaged in the pastoral industry pass through worse times than these. The position of the carry-over wool with the oncoming clip, making that tower of wool of which the Prime Minister spoke, is nothing like as bad as the great droughts which ruined scores of thousands of the big pastoralists, and imperilled the in terests of hundreds of thousands of those dependent upon them. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page), and the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), will admit that the blighting effects of the drought were in finitely more jeopardising to the interest of the graziers than is the present economic position in regard to wool.",66
334,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,But some of - pastoralists have experienced drought in addition to the other trouble.,67
335,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I sympathize very much with those men whose circumstances were referred to by the honourable member for Cowper. Because of the drought, in addition to the difficulty confronting them with the carry-over wool, all their profits and much of their capital are lost this year. That is a double infliction, but the position of the wool industry generally today is not so' bad as it is when a great drought strikes the pastoralists. Yet the big-hearted men, have struggled to their feet again and won through, and other sections in the community have been unable to help them although they have sympathized with them. Realizing that we have passed through crises of [EEPEE SENT ATIVES. ] Statement. that kind, let us take a more hopeful view of the present situation. We are' justified, even when looking on the grave facts, in not taking a Jeremiah's view. The Prime Minister said that his reading of the wool facts of the past had shown a clearer vision t l an that of the pastoralists, and he, therefore, suggested that the advice of the Government, in relation to the remedy now proposed, should be taken. I do not think that statement is fair either to himself or to I still the pastoralists, who have been interested poised in the control of wool ever since the Pool started. I remember that, when the right ancl other honourable gentleman was last in Europe, after the extension of - the first wool contract had been made early in 1918, it became possible to discuss with the B r i tish Government a still further extension of five years. That first extension was for two years and a full wool year after the termination of the war. It happened that, as the war terminated in November, 1918, the contract ran for one and a half years after that date, and finished on the 30th June, 1920. We were just able to draw up for consideration a further contract of five years, which would havelasted u n t i l 30th June, 1925, when I , , as ' Acting Prime Minister, was stopped, by the Prime Minister, then in London,, from proceeding further. I say this, because, if that contract had been drawnand signed, as I have every reason to believe it would have been but for the Prime Minister's retarding influence, we would have been getting a flat rate of Is. 3 | d . for our wool t ill the 30th June, the 19.25, and I think the Prime Minister,, no matter who advised him-whethe r English or Australian views gathered in his mind-mad e a blunder from which the pastoral industry of this country will take many years to recover. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett), as a prominent member of the Central Wool Committee, knows all this,, and he, I think, was doubtful whether we should sell for a further period of* five years.",67
336,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I had no doubt about it. pastoralists, Mr Watt - At any rate, there were some large pastoralists who said that they did not agree with the projected sale, but not many of them, so far as I can recollect. The general desire of the Central Wool Committee was f w the extension of the wool contract ' 4",67
337,Mr JOWEITT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,We were unanimous. I think I may say that. *,68
338,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"It would have been a priceless benefit to this country if we had been permitted to make that contract as we proposed, and, I believe, the British Government were; prepared to buy at that time-April , May, or, at the latest, early in June, 1918. The war was still raging, arid the British Government were making preparations for a long campaign. Ifc is not quite f a ir to close this phase of the argument by saying that we wish that had been done, because the B r i tish Government would have had to pay through the nose, and there might have been talk afterwards of some release from the contract after a year or two. But , at any rate, the pastoral industry would have been stabilized in an indescribable way if we could have made a more extended contract.",68
339,Mr LIVINGSTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Does not the honourable' member think that five years was rather a long term?,68
340,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I do, but I . was prepared to make such a contract on the advice of those who understand the in dustry.",68
341,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It might have led to a i o t of trouble.,68
342,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes , in the way I have described. The Britsh Government might not have been content to go on with the contract for the full term, but it certainly would have been better for us than the position in which we are placed now. The scheme produced by the Prime M in -. ister last year, and which I believe was not assented to by the Central Wool Committee, was for the suspension of sales in England for about six months, and for auction sales of the new clip to be held in Australia only. There were two features about that which shook the confidence of British folk interested in wool, as I , who was in England, was able to observe. Pirst there was the difficulty as to the time at which the prohibition of further sales from the carry-over wool started. If the proposed dates had been assented to by the British authority there would have been a famine period for Australian wool in - London, which would have enabled those who held stocks to exact their own price u n t il the new clip arrived. That was a very bad calculation, which Bradford and London and the interests which study the Australian wool clip fro m the points of view of manufacture and finance, pointed out at once. The British Government assented to the suspension of sales for six months and allowed us to carry on sales of the new clip in Australia without competition; but the system broke down. One of the chief causes of the breakdown was this: - It was almost impossible, in some cases, frankly impossible, for French, Belgian, and Dutch buyers, who had operated in Australia in pre-war times, to establish credits in Australia for their purchases. At that time it was - impossible to find exchange for anythingbut very small sums of money, or to transfer credit or sterling fro m London to Australia, and those people, however much they wished to buy our clip, could not finance their purchases. But if some sales had been conducted in England and some in Australia it would have been possible to establish, a market which, I think, would have prevented the debacle from which we are now suffering. I point fco these facts because I agree with the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) in his statement that however able and talented a politician is, he cannot understand a highly technical and specialized business of the importance of the wool industry as well as can a man who has spent his life in it . And I would, therefore hand over to the men - who had charge of the Wool Pool and now have charge of Bawra, whatever control is necessary so long as we are assured that the public interest will be protected. The honourable member for Cowper has suggested a means by which that might be safeguarded by a free access of governmental or auditorial authority to the books of Bawra in order to enable Parliament and the Government to know exactly what is being done by this huge corporation which is handling one of our basio commodities.",68
343,Mr WEST,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Auditor-General would be a good man.,68
344,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes ; but I am not prepared now to suggest by whom this supervision, should be carried out.",68
345,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Will you make it compulsory ?,68
346,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I would say that that ought to he a condition, and I should think they would assent to it . Honourable members are dealing with this matter as if the proposal of. th© Government were the Bawra scheme. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) did so. I asked the honorbe able member for Maranoa (Mr James Page) which proposal he favoured-th Bawra scheme or the Government scheme.",68
347,Dr EAHLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The Government's amended scheme.,69
348,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Is that the amended Bawra scheme?,69
349,Dr EARLE PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Practically .,69
350,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Ver y well. What I understand by the Bawra scheme is the original proposal with which it started its life. When the British Government and the Australian Government consented tp the creation of the British-Australia Wool Realization Association it was be a voluntary proposition. Those who wanted to come in could come in. Those ing in. who wanted to stay out stood out. I think I am right in remembering that about or 97 per cent, of the wool-growers inclear timated their willingness to come in. That is the Bawra scheme; and, although interested. it has iiot met with all the success that was hoped for, no amendment that the Government suggests seems to me to validate the wisdom of that provision. I there had been no attempt to prevent wool being flooded on to the markets, either in Australia or in Europe, values might have been a long way lower for all grades of wool than even they are today; and it was wise prevision on the part Sir John Higgins and his associates on the su-eh a scheme. Central Wool Committee to attempt to create such a body for the purpose preventing the incoming clip from sharing in the general downfall. The Goand vernment say that the conditions altered very much-at least I assume that is what ' they ' say-sinc e Bawra was originally created, and that it is necesloquially sary to fix a minimum price below which wool shall not be sold outside Australia.",69
351,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"There is 10 per cent, of free wool in London now.",69
352,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I understand that' 8d. per lb. is an irreducible minimum and plain flat rate, which does not deal with grades.",69
353,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,No ; it is an average.,69
354,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,What is an average?,69
355,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I take it that it worked out in much the same way as price of Is. 3£d. per lb. was arrived' at.,69
356,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"If appraisement is to continifed, it will be possible, but is that part of the scheme Ministers and e Bawra have in their minds?",69
357,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Yes .,69
358,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Ver y well; it-will be an average price, and certain legislation may be necessary to give it authority, possibly by the passage of this motion or by. some subsequent motion or a Bill.",69
359,Mr RODGEHS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"We cannot agree with the honourable member's statement as to what constitutes Bawra. The BritishAustralian Wool Realization Association was an assets' realization trust in respect a to wool in the joint ownership of the to Commonwealth and British Governments, and does not represent any one else com",69
360,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I knew that quite well, 96 and thought that I had made it quite that it related only to the carry-over stock in which the two Governments were Mr Rodgers .^-The honourable member suggested something about coming in involuntarily. No one comes into Bawra f voluntarily. It is-a realization trust in this respect to the carry-over wool.",69
361,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,I* remember that the opinions of the organizations of the pastoral industry were solicited as to whether of they were in favour of the formation of,69
362,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The original of framework has not been altered. . Mr Watt - The original framework structure are the same, but an addenhave dum has been proposed.",69
363,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The honourable member for Maranoa explained the position colwhen he said that Bawra was sending up SOS messages asking the ; Government to take this action.,69
364,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Bawr a may have done that, but I do hot know that it is as well qualified as this Chamber is to analyze all the facts, direct and indirect. It may a be well qualified to speak as to the outlook of wool, but there are certain constitutional, legal, and political principles for the consideration of which this House must make itself responsible. I want to look at some of these principles, and inis vestigate the other remedies to which rethe ference h-as been made by various' speakers. First of all, there is the proposal made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), in answer to the SOS. message from Bawra, that the period should he limited to two months, which would enable him to go to London, and by the swift interchange of cablegrams settle something with the British authorities; but now, according to the Acting Prime Minister, the period must be six months. Did Bawra ask for two months or six months?",69
365,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"For six months. Mr ""WATT - But the Prime Minister left us with the suggestion that the period should be two months.",70
366,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"He said that that was his opinion, and he asked the House to discuss the matter from that point of view.",70
367,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The period of six months or two months, as the case may be, must be purely temporary. What is hoped to be achieved by„this temporary prohibition and fixing of a minimum price? How is a solution of the difficulty to be arrived at by the Minister in charge of this wool scheme ?",70
368,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The directors Bawra say that they can stabilize the market within six months.,70
369,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,In what way do they hope to do so?,70
370,Mr JOWETT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,B y not allowing Australian wool to be sold during that period at a price lower than the minimum fixed.,70
371,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is all right so far as the keeping up of the price is concerned, but it does not make that much difference to the stock. There must be some other reason in their minds. As one honourable member has said, although this may be a wise and necessary provision, at the end of six months we will be just as we are today. We may have sold some of the new wool, but we may not have been able to reduce our carry over stocks. I would like to have an explanation from a Minister.",70
372,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I will give an explanation, but not by way of an interjection.",70
373,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The Minister will admit that he has been endeavouring to do so. Unless some distinct or salutary vantage is to be derived it will be a dangerous expedient to apply compulsion to the remaining wool which is now free. It is proposed to condition those to whose wool compulsion is being: applied. The honourable member for Maranoa claims that, the proposal is to prevent certain men from "" scabbing "" on the trade. That is compulsory union? ism.",70
374,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes , pure and simple.",70
375,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The honourable member for Maranoa did give the "" show away "" when he said that. It is not a healthy principle. Some of my friends opposite seem to think it is, but honourable members on the Ministerial side have frequently denounced it . Any attempt to force men in a time of peace, even although there are trade or economic'difficulties in existence, into a line of conduct of which they do not approve with regard to their own interests, will always be regarded as dangerous by men who hold the principles for which honourable members on the Ministerial side stand That is a feature they ought not to lose sight of. It can only be defended because some substantial and undoubted advantage may be achieved by it . of Mr RICHABD FOSTER - A big advantage will be achieved by it . It will declare a minimum value. That is what, all the banks demand.",70
376,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"No . I have discussed the matter with some representatives of the banks, and I do not think their name ought to be brought into the matter. Some of them think it a good scheme; others do not.",70
377,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Quite a number of them do.,70
378,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I have not polled them, and I do not know the. proportion in favour of the scheme. If it is helpful to the banks, it may be an advantage or a disadvantage; but we have to see how it will help, not only the operation of a public principle, but also the stabilization of a great industry. I do not think much advantage will be obtained by the postponement of the operation of a sliding price. Unless I can see that it is going to have some effect on the ultimate destination of the carry-over wool, it does not seem to me to be worth considering.",70
379,Mr RODGERS,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Hear, hear!",70
380,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I trust that the Minisadter will be able to show that. This proposal is also a precedent that may also be used by any political party in this country to suit itself, and whenever, the trade cf it likes to do so. 8960 Ministerial",70

A f considering the matter, the Government decided that the export of newly-won gold v/as quite a sound proposition in demic. order to save some of the fields that were struggling, but we would not allow the export of our reserves against note issue or bank holdings, and we drew up conditions to show how we could fairly permit the export of newly-won gold. said to the producers, ""' You must for m yourselves into a gold producers associapoints tion. An y one who likes can stop side it , but he cannot export his gold less he does it through the association.""",71
387,Mr JAMES PAGE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,That is what is.to be done in connection with export of wool.,71
388,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austi n Chapman) complained at the time that a great ber of . men had remained outside Gold Producers Association.,71

394,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am a f r a i d not. I was not in the House when that legislation was passed. Indeed, I have always been extremely doubtful-thoug h it has not the been m y business to express my opinion upon the matter-as to whether the machinery adopted for the applieatioa of proarbitration has not brought about the downfall of the system. It is an .arguhave able matter; but, in any case, I am not in favour of compulsory unionism, and I do not think that many outside the ranks and of Labour are in favour of it . There is another phase of this question t e r which I wish to put before the Minister in charge of the House. It is quite apart from objections which are largely acaMr RICHARD* FOSTER - Hear , hear!",71
395,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"They are academic, but they are important.",71
396,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The honourable member has been straining points. I,71
397,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"On e does not strain when he analyzes reasons. If the outhonorable member is not influenced by unacademic considerations, of course he will miss many points , in this House. I alexactly ways endeavour to take them into acthe count. Where they are too t h in I drop them out; but some of them are important and pertinent, although theoretic There is, however, a practical point to' which the numhonorable member for Cowper refersthe the effect upon the South American holder of cross-bred and other low-grade wools. If we f i x the price at 8d. per lb. will be just the opportunity for which this man is looking in order to unload. not If we keep our goods off the market, it will be his chance of a market, not free r o m competition, but with very little",71
398,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,It will not be an attractive price for him .,71
399,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That all depends upon comthe grade of wool he may have. He may have wool which is worth more, and may able to sell it ; but in competition with o -' us he may have difficulty in doing so. I I^do not pretend that either the Treaof surer or myself is the best man to analyze that question; but the heads of Bawra, who know and see precisely what is going to take place if we grant this six months' immunity to them, should consider it .",71

403,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I admit that some of my friends of Bawra are matchless optimists, and I am afraid they w i ll meet with difficulties that they did not foresee when they launched the Bawra finances without full consultation with the hanks.",72
404,Mr CONSIDINE,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Hello ! Is the honourable member in with the banks now ?,72
405,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"No ; I merely witnessed from the outside some of the causes which have been operating against the complete success of the Bawra markets. I do not know any more than do honourable members opposite what consultations took place; but I certainly believe that it is impossible to operate such a scheme as this, involving far-reaching conditions of finance,' without the co-operation of those who control so much of the finances of this country. Sir. JOSEPH COOK - I thin k we should have the support of the banks.",72
406,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"It is said that, so far, Bawra has not had the unanimous support of the banks.",72
407,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,They have not the unanimous support of the banks One could hardly ever hope to get that.,72
408,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"The right ' honourable gentleman knows that it was obtained by the Treasury as the result of a free and frank consultation with the banks whenever any big operation was intended during the war period. The righ t honourable gentleman had it , and so did the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs), the honourable member for Grey  indeed, all who as Treasurers of the Commonwealth conducted big operations in connection with the war. certainly have been a wise procedure to continue. , This may be a partial remedy, it may enable us to escape some of the disadvantages to which I have endeavoured to point, but it is perfectly clear'that it is only a temporary expedient. The real work before us is to get back some of our , old customers. Mr RICHA HD FOSTEB - The scheme is really experimental:",72
409,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"It is. . The real duty point before us is to endeavour to get back some of our old customers. The antipathies formed during the war have found - expression in perfervid oratory on both sides of the House as to f u t u r e trade relations with enemy countries. The Prime Minister from the time he moved or helped in the creation of the Paris Economic resolutions, took his stand against any future trade with Germany. It is perfectly plain that however utterances have prejudiced men, or ' committed them, we have to take our * choice between two courses, and to determine which is the better to adopt. Wie have either to trade with Germany, or to see her remain in her present helpless state, unable to pay reparation as long as we cease to trade with her. I am speaking now, not of Australia alone, but of the rest of the world. If all the nations were to say to Germany, "" We will ^ o t trade with you; we will not, buy from , or sell to y o u , "" then Germany could not be restored to anything like her pristine vigour, and her reparation payments would become i m possible. In the enemy countries of Middle Europe, there are between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 people who formerly did a more or less considerable trade in wool with Australia, but who had are not now doing anything substantial in that direction.",72
410,Dr MALONEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Franc s is taking some of our wool.,72
411,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I am not speaking, of"" France or Belgium; they are taking aportion of our wool. I am speaking of Germany, Czecho-Slovakia r",72
412,Dr MALONET,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Is not Poland taking some?,72
413,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Possibly . France is getting some of our wool; .Austria has had a parcel, but has no regular trade with us; and Belgium, Holland, and, I think, a It would portion of Poland, are using some of our wool. But the whole of Czecho-Slovakia, the whole of Germany, and the newAustria, which is a very much shrunken State, as well as the whole of Jugo-Slovakia, representing between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 people potential or actual customers, who traded with us before the war, are not dealing with us now.",72
414,Dr MALONEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Czecho-Slovaki a is not now recognised as an enemy of the Allies. Rumania was with the Allies and so was Poland. Mr Watt. - I am not speaking of the at what we speak of as Is., Is. l d . Balkans. Poland is now friendly, but was not so until - she broke off from Russia. Bohemia, which is in the area which I speak, was. formerly a part Germany. All the middle of Europe, which was formerly alien and enemy not doing with us the business that i before the war. How then can we get back some of our old customers? There are four difficulties in the way, should be glad if honourable members would pay particular attention to them, as' they consider the subject. There are actual practical difficulties the way of the resumption of this trade. The first of these is the question of fixation of prices. That is not insuperThis able. . The second is the question of termining exchange. The last quote in respect of the German mark given in our Australian papers was 260, instead of marksfcothe sovereign as before the war. The German mark ie worth about f d . according to the quotation which appeared in the newspapers of yesterday or the before. For two or three months the German mark ran afc 24*0 to the £ 1 , which meant that the former German shilling was worth I d. The exchange difficulty is reach of practical business."" undoubtedly great. Then we have the question of credits, or, in other words, the question of payment. Supposing you fix prices and get over the exchange difficould culty, how are you to arrange for payBy ment? Finally, we have a difficulty th is likely to influence the English mind ""more than that of Australia. I refer the competition of exported textiles result of the purchase of our raw material.",73
415,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,In that respect an advantage to have Great Britain still hurdles. connected with Bawra. .,73
416,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I . desire to give brief attention to these four problems-no t to tempt to solve them, but to contribute the subject a thought or two which may bring some fruit to the efforts that ought to be undertaken to secure the return this trade. I am assuming that we want to resfcore the prestige and stability our pastoral industry as best we can, we want reparation from Germany, and are not above selling some of our wool to the enemy provinces of Middle Europe if the business can be put on a stable footfore, ing. The question of prices is one that the bargainers between the two peoples should be able to fix. They shonld be able fco decide whether the wool is to be sold a Is. 2d., or Is. 6d. per lb. That is a question upon which the buyers, the wool of experts of both countries, can arrive at of an agreement.' The most difficult question of all to determine in tha early stages is will be that of exchange. It has been t did .suggested that we should barter. That means that these countries, in exchange for our wool, should immediately hand and I over certain goods produced by them upon some arbitrary basis of so many articles for a bale of wool. That would be impossible. Eirst of all the equation in could not be established. Secondly, we do not want the manufactured goods of the Germany in direct payment for that wool. is a problem on which I am not dogdematizing, but rather wish to offer suggestions. It is, however, possible for the British and Australian Government to say, 20 ""We will hav for the purposes of this e transaction .an arbitrary fixation of the , mark value. We will not take any notice of the 260, the 220, the 212 value, or whatday ever may have been the value of the mark during the last year or two, but we will fix a 50 or 60 mark value to the sovereign, and so bring the whole matter within the s If that were done in the most arbitrary fashion by the authorities of both nations, aided by their selling and buying people, we register a transaction in these wools. that means, instead of keeping this at mountain of wool, which will always be liable to fall on us as long as it does not to pass into consumption, we could pass, the as a lower grades into Middle Europe, where they are so badly needed. If that could it is be done it would carry us over two",73
417,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"That is a big "" if . """,73
418,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,-It is not so big in its porattents as is the preservation of this mounto tain of wool year' after year.,73
419,Mr FENTON,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,Bot h parties are anxious.,73
420,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes , we are willing sellers of and they are eager buyert, provided we can determine upon a common denomiof nator of value on which we can operate. that I suggest pow a means by which payment could be made. We are not going to get anything for this wool, if we keep it , for some years. In the circumstances, thereI would be prepared to - take the credit notes of' the country to which we sold. In the one case it might be the credit notes of the new region of Czechoslovakia, in another it might be those of Austria, - im a third case it might be the credit notes of Germany, and in the fourth case it might be the credit notes of Poland. I would be prepared to take those notes, with a currency of three to five years, fixed on an arbitrary valuation of the mark per sovereign. In that way we could do trade with these countries.",73
421,Mr BOWDEN,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,The honourable member suggests Government notes against private security.,74
422,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Yes . The Governments of those countries, - judging by their literawould ture and the press, are eager to get on with business.",74
423,Dr MALONEY,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"Would the . honourable member fix the value of the German mark at twenty to the sovereign, as it was before the war ?",74
424,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"If we fixed it 'at twenty we would have to lift the prices, and prices and exchange ratio bear an intimate relationship. As to the re-exportation of the finished textiles, I say, with great respect, that too much is being made of the possibilities by Bradford and the English manufacturers generally. Judging by the clothing conditions of the people of these countries, to which I have been referring,' they will not have much to export for a few years. Those people, who are using cotton and paper goods, if given the means of restarting their - textile manufacture will, as far as possible, bite into the supply, and, I believe, there would be very little left for immediate export. But even if a proportion of their textiles was exported, neither the Bradford nor the Australian people could expect to ""have it both ways."" They cannot expect to pass this mountain of wool into consumption and not to get the kick of it when we reach the point of competing with woollens manufactured from the re-exporting countries. The British woollen makers have been up against such competition before from all parts of the world, and will have to get used to it again, just as the Australian grower, stepping out of the shelter of tire protection of the Pools formed during tl*e war, has to compete with the fierce forces of unrestricted international competition. Extension of time granted. I very much appreciate the consideration which the House has shown me, and will not presume.'upon it. The prime necessity of the next few months is to endeavour to' arrange a m'odus vivendi for the disposal of a substantial proportion of our carry-over wool to the customers we have lost, and every effort of the best business brains/and of the Executives of the countries concerned, should be bent to that end. I think there are in the service of the British Government, and I am certain there are at the disposal of the Australian Government, brains which can supply their portion of such a scheme. I have no doubt that Germany find the same type of men to organize that triangular understanding which alone will remove the impasse, make for stabilization, and for their proportionate consumption of the wool that we have. I am endeavouring now not to show the futility of the two or six months of _ immunity suggested, but simply to point out that the whole objeet of any delay or prohibition is really to get breathing time for the creation of a consumption scheme. You have to get your consumption scheme in operation by soma such means as I have endeavoured to outline. I do not hold dogmatically to any feature of the scheme I have advanced.; but if it were put powerfully before the British Government, I believe it would win approval, and that there would be negotiations in support of it. The disturbing factor in relafton to exchange today is surely the reparation question. France's exchange has become better within the last three months as the Prime Minister of France has got nearer what the French people think a settlement with the German people, and the currency of Germany has equally receded by depreciation. If we were to settle the reparation question, exchange would tend to right itself very quickly. It would' right itself far more quickly than the exchanges and Bourses of Europe appear to believe possible. We can have no hand in the settlement of that question at this stage - It has to run its course. But if an arbitrary relationship between the pound sterling and the mark could be fixed for a large transaction of this kind, extending over three or four sections in the next two years, it would do much to hasten an improvement in the Continental exchange position. That in itself would induce the trade which it appears necessary to stimulate hy this artificial means. It would improve the exchange business enormously if it were known that Germany, in respect of her great textile operations, was again afloat; and if a reparation settlement of the tentative kind which it is thought may be brought about by the middle of the year, were effected, trade would resume in a much more rapid way its normal flow. Then, in stead of legislators being bothered with problems of this kind, business men and financiers would have almost the whole consideration of them. I hope that the right honourable gentleman in charge of the House wil l consider this"" last matter, whatever he may think of my first criticism, and endeavour to have a consumption scheme considered, formulated, advocated, and, if possible, approved. ' I think we are entitled, also, to know if the Government proposes to secure approval of this proposal by a Bill or a resolution. The mere authorizing of the printing of a paper, and the operation of this technical sanction by the Minister for Customs under the Customs Act , seems to me a slovenly way of establishing such an important departure from principle as is intended.",74
425,Sir JOSEPH COOK,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"There methods of procedure available. AB ill could be passed; but that seems to me too r i g i d a process, though it has its advantages. You could not lift any restrictions imposed by an Act except by passing a repealing Act , or providing for the tion of its operation by a proclamation. The advantage of a resolution, and the operation of it under the Ciistoms Act , is that it would allow of the removal of the restrictions whenever that might seem necessary.",75
426,Mr WATT,UNDERGROUND CABLE AT,"I agree that rigidity would result fro m the passing of an Act , - whether it were temporary or permanent, though a measure might be made operative by proclamation. But what I desire is an opportunity for Parliament, to review all the circumstances, not only to vote on this distinct issue, but to condition it if the majority of members believe that it should be conditioned in some way. The mere saying of "" aye "" to the proposal to p r in t a paper eould not provide that. I ask the Acting Leader of the Government, therefore, to consider whether a resolution or a small Bill would not afford the opportunity which I think members should require.

At present, that reserve is the worse eye-sore in Melbourne, and a blot on the credit of this Parliament, because we are blamed for its condition. . In the slums around about there are many poor littlp kiddies who have nowhere to play, and their running over this ground would at least keep the weeds down, and""to that extent improve its condition. I do not suggest the removal of the iron fence, though I would take away that abomination if I had the power; but the wooden fence, from Albert-street to Spring-street, might be removed to the advantage of the children and their parents.

However, as cessahe has raised this matter, I would in form him that I am not sure that we have any authority over the reserve? which is separated by the temporary right-of-way from Albert-street to Springstreet from the premises of which we are the tenants. The honourable member is aware that representations have been made by the President and myself as to the desirability of improving this ground, and we have offered to expend as much as £1,000 on it if we can get the permission of the State authorities to do what we propose to do. I shall have the honourable member's suggestion placed before the Joint House Committee, and perhaps representations from them to the State Government may have the effect he desires.
