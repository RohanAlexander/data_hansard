NA NA NA  Why did he take an in principle decision that the planned move by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to Canberra should not take place, given that the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommended that the move should take place as a matter of priority, and given that the headquarters was specially constructed for ASIO's particular needs?",13

Despite the strong support given to militant surgeons by the honourable member for Bennelong, can tl-e Minister advise the House whether the Commonwealth and New South' Wales governments have received support for entering into negotiations with the Australian Medical Association aimed at resolving rather than exacerbating the New South Wales doctors dispute?",13
4,Dr BLEWETT,NEW SOUTH WALES HOSPITALS,"Despite the lining up of the members of the Liberal Party, the Liberal Opposition, with the militant surgeons, I am glad to say that there is increasing support throughout the medical profession' and those associated with health services in New South Wales for the AMA's. stand and the Government's genuine efforts at conciliation . .I mentioned yesterday that we had had the support of numer,ous major colleges. I also pointed o'ut that the clinical professors had endorsed the actions taken by the AMA and the Government. I am glad to say today that the Catholic Health Care Association of NeW South Wales, which represents some 3,500 hospital beds in private and public hospitals, as well as 4,000 nursing home beds, has issued the following statement: The position of silence is no longer tenable. We believe that every Australian would support the efforts of Government and the medical profession to reach agreements which will solve the concern of the hospitals, doctors,and patients.

9,Dr BLEWETT,NEW SOUTH WALES HOSPITALS,"I return to the quotation from the Catholic Health Care Association, which continues: We sincerely hope that those affected by the dispute will encourage the parties involved to see that negotiation is always preferable to confrontation. If there are rights and wrongs, let us address them and not walk away from the resolution of a dispute which threatens the quality and ' ca,ring nature of the health system. I believe that support and that comment are sufficient comment on the role taken by many DISPUTE ' leading figures in the Opposition. AUSTRALIAN 'SECURITY NA  the Attorney-General. Notwithstanding the Prime Minister's response to the previous question asked of him, I ask: In view of the fact that a meeting of all headquarters staff of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was allegedly held on Friday, 15 February, at which the Director-General advised the staff that the Prime Minister had made a decision in principle that ASIO headquarters would no longer be moving to Canberra in the near future, and in view of the fact that the Attorney-General had a meeting with staff representatives of ASIO on this matter at which it was said that the decision had already been taken and that it was an in principle decision of the Prime Minister, how does the Attorney General, square this information with the Prime Minister's answer?",13
10,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"It is not very hard to square the information with the answer, because no decision has been made. I rp.ake it very clear that, as the Leader of the Opposition said in his first question, it wa.s intended that ASIO woul? occupy a building being built here. I also make It very clear that the members of staff, as the Leader of the Opposition would know, reside in Melbourne and would like to maintain their affiliation with that city. They had a meeting and decided by a majority, we were told;· that they would not transfer to Canberra. That created a real problem for us for that was the first time we had heard of that decision. I can understand having an affection for Melbourne, but we have a responsibility to run national security. On that basis, two representatives of the staff relatively recently came to see me to say th-t they might have a second look at their decision. I do not know what that means as far as establishing a priority for Melbourne is concerned. At this stage, I make it clear that I am in nb way castigating the staff, but if we look at the background of the situation we see that they took a view that they would prefer to remain in Melbourne, or a large number of them did. They took a further view that they wanted what were called termination payments which could run into millions of dollars. We did not accede to - that view. 1 time.",13
11,Mr HOLLIS,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Given the critical role of shipping in improving Australia's export perfoflt;tance and hence in creating jobs and economic growth, what initiatives has the Governme.nt taken to improve Australia's overseas commercial shipping arrangements?  able member for his question. It is a fact that the adequacy and efficiency of shipping arrangements are vital to the performance of Australia's economy. It is also true that Australia's expor- performance is vital to development, the creation of growth and job.creation. A study done recently by the Department of Trade has shown that a 5 per cent growth in export income would result .in-he creation of an initial 30,000 jobs. Our shlppmg policy has been dedicated to improving the efficiency and the competitiveness of Australian shipping. Our aim is to provide an efficient service for exporters and importers. So often in consideration of this issue the needs of importers. have been overlooked, particularly in relation to freight rates. We need to ensure that regulation assists effective development of the shipping industry and industry generally. We need .to develop a commercially sound Australian flag fleet, a fleet that is efficient and competitive in world markets. Whether the ships are Australian controlled or overseas controlled, the important thing is that they be efficient and that the services are adequate for our needs. The existing regulatory framework for overseas commercial shipping was developed by the conservative Government in the mid-1960s. Essentially, that same system operates today. I need to say 'that there have been many changes to needs since then. There have been changes to the nature of the products for shipping and changes in m-r­ kets. There are questions among the users of shipping services as to whether, for instance, we should have a pan-Australia rate-a single, national Australia rate-irrespective of the port of collection, as long as products are going to the same destination. That is an issue about which the industries concerned have differing views. Some believe that the situation should be changed. Some believe that it should remain as it is. There are questions as to whether importers are, in fact, cross-subsidising exporters by way of freight rates, given the imbalance of trade that occurs in both directions. There are questions as to whether the liner conference arrangements are suitable, That is the position at this whether they are appropriate in today's conditions. In more recent years we have seen the inroads of non-conference shipping into those areas. SHIPPING· Other questions that affect our primary industries are raised in relation to loyalty agreements and secret rebates.",14

They were very good at ignoring the needs of shipping in this country and the implications of shipping services, particularly for our pritt;tary. industries. If the honourable member mamtams the record of his predecessors he will do well!",14
13,Mr SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,Order! I invite the Minister to return to the answer to the question. ,14
14,Mr TUCKEY,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,Tell us what you are going to do.,14
15,Mr SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"Order! I also invite the honourable member for O'Connor to cease his usual 2 o'clock and after chatter.  member may be concerned more with land leases and rental arrangements than with shipping needs, Mr Speaker.",14
16,Mr SPEAKER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"Order! I have invited the Minister to ignore the interjections.  Mr Speaker. Other issues involved are the roles of national flag shipping and non-conference operators, and how they fit into the arrangements we have. Essentially, we have a multitude of users who have differing priorities and views which are often in conflict. Out of all of that mess some resolution has to be made to ensure that we get the best mix of services. This Government has given priority to the development of our shipping needs, recognising their importance, as I said earlier, to industry. In order to facilitate industry debate and user views being put forward, I established a complete review of overseas commercial shipping arrangements in September last year. That review is to report by July this year. Its recommendations are to be incorporated in a draft policy paper to be circulated for public comment. It is our intention that there be full consultation with all interested parties and, if legislation is to arise from it, the approximate timetable is that it will come forward in the autumn sittings of Parliament next year. Let me summarise. Unlike the Liberal-",14

I ask the Minister to round off his answer.  headed its Australian survey report in December last year with these words: The government of Bob Hawke has given more i\ttention to shipping than to any other for 20 years. How right. NA  the Minister for Foreign Affairs write to him in October 1983 expressing serious reservations about the Government's MX decision? I ask the Prime Minister whether he will table the letter, but I remind him, in case he wishes to claim that this is a classified or 'security matter, of the widespread Press reports that ministerial staff have been briefing on this letter and its contents.",15
20,Mr HAWKE,MX MISSILE TESTS,The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not write to me in October 1983. There has been correspondence between the Foreign Minister and me and I do not intend to table it. NA,15
21,Mr BEDDALL,IMMIGRANT WORKERS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Have there been requests from the Queensland and New South Wales governments for the immigration entry. of power workers and doctors respectively? If so, has there been any difference in the response to each of these governments by the Commonwealth Government?",15
22,Mr HURFORD,IMMIGRANT WORKERS,"I can tell the honourable member for Rankin that there has been an approach from Queensland; but,so far as I am aware, there has been no approach from New South Wales. I am aware that the Premier of New South Wales suggested, after certain processes had been followed, that he may make such an inquiry; but I repeat that, so far as I am aware, no such approach has been made. I can assure the House that if and when that approach is made, it will be treated in exactly the same way as the approach from the Premier and the Government of Queensland. The guidelines are long-standing and the House is entitled to know what they are. Any government can make a group nomination for a class of workers that it wants under what is known as the employer nomination scheme. Once that group nomination is made, there are certain labour market tests that need to be carried out. Those tests are carried out for me-the buck eventually stops with me-by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and cover such matters as, firstly, whether people are available in the particular skills that are required; secondly, whether those skills that are alleged to be needed are proper for the particular jobs; and thirdly, whether there are industrial relations implications in the particular nominations. Some spokesman for the Opposition has suggested that we were promising some fast track for one particular inquiry and a slow track for another. There is no substance whatsoever to such a charge. These tests take time but we can get them covered in three to six months, not the two to three years suggested by that Opposition spokesman. I return to the approach from Queensland. It was in two forms. There was a telex from the Premier to the Prime Minister and there was also an uno.fficial approach o.n the part o.f o.fficials Qf the Queensland Government to. Qfficials Qf my Department in my regio.nal Qffice in Brisbane. In bQth cases insufficient infQrmatio.n was given initially fQr us to. be able to. go. through the.se labo.ur market tests. That info.rmatiQn was so.ught and we then learnt the nature Qf the particular inquiry in terms which were necessary fo.r us to. carry Qut the tests. Once that infQrmation had been received from Queensland, we learnt that Queensland wQrkers were and are available fQr the particular jQbs fQr which wQrkers were being SQught. There were and are plenty Qf wQrkers in Queensland who. are willing to. wQrk under the terms laid dQwn by the Industrial CQmmissiQn in Queensland. I cannQt say anything abo.ut New SQuth Wales because we have nQt yet had such an inquiry frQm that State. In cQnclusiQn, I can tell the HQuse that fQr the next 10, 15 Qr mQre years the Australian Labor Party will gQvern this country, and it ,shall administer the guidelines fQr this test, as fQr Qther immigratiQn tests, withQut fear and witho.ut favQur. NA",15
23,Mr SINCLAIR,MX MISSILE TESTS,"My questiQn is directed to. the Minister fo.r Defence. Will' he advise the HQuse whether, at the time he made his detailed statement Qn MX missile tests, Qn 1 February 1985, in which he said he had cQnsulted the Prime Minister, he knew that the Prime Minister had had discussions with the Americans abQut details Qf the tests in June and OctQber 1983? If so., why did he Qmit any reference to. thQse discussiQnsjn that very detailed statement?",16
24,Mr BEAZLEY,MX MISSILE TESTS,"I am no.t quite certain what the OpPQsitiQn's defence sPQkesman is trying to. establish here. If he is embarrassed by the fact that he gave apprQval to. a splashdQwn site in the prQspective Australian eCQnQmic ZQne and it is to. his chagrin that, at the behest Qf this GQvernment, the splashdQwn site was shifted into. internatiQnal waters, why dQes he nQt just CQme Qut and say it, admit that he is cQncerned abQut it and leave it at that? He has already heard frQm the Minister fQr FQreign Affairs and the Prime Minister. The discussiQns which take place inside this GQvernment are privy to. the GQvernment. The relevant decisiQns taken in regard to. the MX tests have all been made public, and as far as the public recQrd stands they have been made with perfect accuracy. If the right honourable gentleman is embarrassed by the fact that he apprQved the splashdQwn site, as he seemed to. be at his Press conference held immediately after my annQuncements Qn this matter, that is his bad luck. The fact is that the details Qf Qur GQvernment's decision Qn the apprQval granted to. the splashdQwn area Qf the MX missile tests are all recQrded in the public arena, where they need to. be. VICTOJUA: HOUSING",16
25,Mr LAMB,MX MISSILE TESTS,"I ask the Minister fQr HQusing and CQnstructiQn: Are the ho.using po.licies o.f the Victo.rian Government and the VictQrian Oppo sitiQn in accordance with the prQvisio.ns Qf the Co.mmo.nwealth-State HQusing Agreement? Mr WESTY es, I am pleased to. say that the VictQrian GQvernment's ho.using po.licy is quite consistent with the CQmmQnwealth-State Ho.using Agreement; but I regret to. say that a key element o.f the Victo.rian OpPQsitio.n's hQusing po.licy directly ,co.ntravenes the CQmmo.nwealthState HQusing Agreement. I refer' to. its pro.po.sal to. sell o.ff public hQusini rental sto.ck at a disco.unt. It prQPo.ses a o.ne per cent disco.unt fo.r each year o.f tenancy. The po.tential here is to. by selling Qff rental stQck at a 29, 30 o.r 35 per cent discQunt. This prQPQsal is in clear breach Qf the CQmmo.nwealth-State HQusing Agreement. One co.uld even suggest that this element o.f the VictQrian Oppo.sitio.n ho.using PQlicy, is no.t lawful. SectiQn 34 Qf the Agreement says that all sales o.f ho.using shall be at market value Qr replacement CQst at the time o.f sale. Certainly, credits can be allQwed fo.r ho.me impro.vements, but there is no. pro.visiQn fQr a set fQrmula Qf discQuntillg. The Agreement go.es Qn to. stipulate that finance derived from sales sho.uld be used fo.r the replacement o.f rental stQck. The o.bject o.f this element o.f the agreement is to. increase, no.t decrease, rental stQcks o.f hQusing. What the VictQrian Oppo.sitio.n proposes is, in fact, a fo.rm Qf asset stripping o.f the ho.using assets Qf the VictQrian Ministry Qf Ho.using. I knQw that o.ne CQuid expect this fro.m people with the co.mpetence Qf the Victo.rian Oppo.sitiQn but, o.n the Qther hand, the Victorian Government is this year spending a recQrd $291m Qn public hQusing, $190m Qf it go.ing to. the rental prQgram, $79m fo.r hQme purchase assistance, and $22m fo.r assistance to. disadvantaged groups. I might add that $148m o.f this mQney co.mes from the Hawke Federal Labo.r, GQvernment thro.ugh the CQmmQnwealth-State Ho.using Agreement. The Hawke Labor GQvernment is also. cQntributing so. far $82m to. 28,000 Victo.rian ho.useho.lds thro.ugh the spectacularly successful first hQme o.wnership scheme. I conclude by saying that I am really very SQrry that the VictQrian OPPQsitio.n has nQt had the fo.resight to. examine' the CQmmo.nwealthState Ho.using Agreement befQre fo.rmulating its ho.using po.licy. I WQuid have the.ught that this was an essential prerequisite to. the fQrmulatiQn o.f a responsible'housing policy, but instead all it has tried to do is mislead the voters of Victoria. , Mr HODGMAN - I raise a pqin-, of order.

BUSHFIRE RESE-RCH",17
31,Mr CHYNOWETH,MX MISSILE TESTS,"Will the Minister for Science give an indication of what support the Federal Government is giving to bushfire research? Mr BARRY JONES:"":""-I am indebted to the honourable member for Dunkley for this question, which has particular relevance to Victoria, the State that has always been the most adversely affected by bush fires. I can speak in respect of the areas for' which I have direct responsibility. First of all, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has now set' up'a 'bushfire research unit, for the first time, within the Division of Forest Research. The exact quantum of funds that will be available will be, of course, determined in the Budget context; but it is clear from the priority that the Organisation gives within its responsibilities that it will be considerably higher than the amount which was allocated last year. Se-ondly, it National Centre for Rural Fire Research has been established at the Chisholm Institute of Technology in Melbourne. The CSIRO has contracted with the Centre for the development of a mathematical model of aerial suppression operations for the control of forest fires. Also, a feasibility study has been set up involving a very interesting Victorian project called ·CADMAS, computer assisted disaster, management system .. That will be carried out under section 39, the public interest proposals of the Industrial ReI""' search and Development Incentives Act. That has been put up by a Victorian-I think in fact a constituent· of the honourable member' for La Trobe-Andrew Helps.: There are two reports to government currently being examiried. One is the report of the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on bushfires in the Australian environment, chaired by the honourable member for La Trobe, and the other is the report of the Standing Committee on Forestry of the Australian Forestry Council. However, rising 'to a crescendo, I should announce'that as the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment will be' co-ordiriating the Government's response to those reports, future questions oli bushfire research which are not specific t6 the CSIROor to the Bureau Of Meteorology should be ciirected to him. . .

33,Mr HOWARD,CURRENT ACCOUNT AND TRADE,"My questio- is addressed to the Treasurer. I ref-rthe honourable gentlerpan to Australia's huge current account and trad,e deficits. Now that the Prime Minister has ,effectively ruled out any discounting of national wage adjustments for the' effects of the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar, thus throwing away any competitive gain conferred upon our export and import competing. inqustries by that depreciation, what steps does the Government propose ,to take to improve the competitive position of thoseiq.dustrie-? . '. "" Mr \KEATING-I thought the honourable member would hang his head in shame when we talked about competitiveness in any eircumstances, because he gave us a 12 per cent inflation rate while the ,rest of the world ,with which We were trading had a rate of around ,6 per cent. I thought he would be the last person to ask me, a question about competitiveness. It amuses me that in the honourable gentleman's question there isa presumption about the. impact on wages jf indeed there is over the medium term ,a depreciation effect against a whole gaggle of currencies. Hjsquestion is based on the assumption that, under his policies in his, time, there would have been no increase in wages Jor the 12 months between Apri11984a'nd April 1985. He is cavilling at the potential Jor some wage flow on through the indexation system as though conditions would ,have been now as they might have been under his policies. In fact, under his policies we would already have had the wage ,increases,. Under.his polic,ies we would not b- . worrying abollt any future wage increases comjng'a- a result of the' preciation; we wOl.\ld already, have had them. Haying presided over a wage explosion in 1981, hmy can he argue that - hrough the strong growth of 1983-84 and 1984-85 he could have had two back to back years of wage restraint like we have had in this country? Until the wage adjustment of April 1985in this year's national wage case there will have been rio movement in award wages since April 1984, and that in a period of very strong economic growth. The former Treasurer could 'not have delivered that. That. was delivered as a result of this Government's policies. We .would alrea<iy have hild under the previous Government the wage increase about which the honourable member is now worried. 'Our competitiveness would have been' further eroded because he would 'have been at this stage;·as:he advocates, applying a credit squeeze to the 'economy to try to choke inflation by choking growth. He would be back to his old policies. Ashe says evety day on the radio and in his Press statements, he would be tightening up credit, having a credit sque-ze to squeeze inflation out of the economy, thus killing growth. Let us not'have any nonsense about the erosion of competitiveness; we' would be out the, door already in regard to wageS and the recovery under Opposition'policies ... ' : "" The reas-n for the current account pefiqitis the lagged effec;:t of Au-tralia's competitiveness, which this Government has only just restored. This Government has only just restored Australia's competitive position in terms of a decline in inflatiort ahd any problems in the current account reflect two factors-the snap back of imports in the recovery and the demand coming off the rec<;>yery for imports, acting on the current account, wi.th the lagged effect of the wage ,explosion induced by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Industrial Relations and by the former Treasurer. If this country has any problems in terms of competitiveness, honourable members opposite are: to blame for it. This Government has brought infl,ation back to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of around 5 per cent. Honourable members oppo&ite should not worry about competitiveness as we have it well and truly in hand. Their policies already would be eroding the competitiveness whith this Government has b-enable to secure through the prices and incomes accord. I wish to make two further comments' about .this so-called concern of the Deputy Leader of the 'Opposition. 'Ob,jious-y there, has. been, no inflationary impact at this time from the devaluation. ,It depends upon what happens to the Australian dollar against a trade weight of currencies de- ,Oyer time and in the medium term. The, next national wage Cllse is six, mOnths away. We will 'think about it in the mean time. Only .1.5 per cent of our demand is satisfied by imports. If we look at the 17 per cent depreciation figure under 'the former Government we will see that the inflationary impact was very muted indeed because it came through lagged and in dribs and drabs. At this i stage nobody can say whaHhe inflationary impact would be, even if 'the current exchange rate relationships applied. Honourable members opposite should not worry about it; we will look after Australia. They could not. NA .

40,Mr DUBOIS,SOCIAL SECURITY,"My question is directed to the Special Minister of State. What action is being taken to analyse tpe informal vote at the last - ed­ eral election? , l\fr ypUNG-It. is true, as all, honourable members kIW-, that we did hflve an exceedingly high informal .vote at the 1984 House of Representatives election. Prior to the election the Australian Electoral Commission did a number of surveys of the electorate as to people's understanding of the new voting system for the Senate. From results the Commission was getting from that research it was obvious that very few people, less than 5 per cent in factju-t.a few months before the election, underst-od the, ne'Y system - hat had been put in place by this Parliament acting on the recommendation&, of the Joint ,Select Committee on Electoral Refonp in that we could have a lis- system of voting for the Senate., ' the' Electoral Commission persuaded the Government that resources ought to be given to it to be able to publicise, in all forms of media; the new system that was to apply at th- 1984 election for the voting for the Senate. It was unfortunate that in doing so-I do not think that anybody has laid claim to the fact that he might have been wiser then than he is no'w-it was overlooked that this might have some impact on how people voted for the House of Representatives, in respect of which theJoint Committee and indeed the Parliament harlmade no change at all. The fact is that there were 625,000 informal votes for the House of Representatives in 1984 .' compared ,with 185,000 in 19S3. For the Senate the campaign worked very successfully. In 1983 TAXATION there were 872,000 informal votes, which I think all of us would agree is a'disgrace to the system. In 1984 that figure had been reduced by half-to 440;000 informal votes' for the Seriate-which was the objective of this Parliament in changing the system. I think it was a very wise course to adopt.' There'was also' tl very disturbing feature about the referendums, in that the informal vote 'waS also over 400,000 on the simultaneous elections question arid 600,000 on the interchange of -,' .:'"" powers question. ' The Australian Electoral Commission is currently catrying out a comprehensive survey of all the informal papers, the results of which will be known to us next month. The survey will make known to us practiCally all the information in relation to the Parliament that surrounds the reason why people may have voted informally. There ., have been lots of theories, but some of those theories have already been somewhat exploded--,Mr Iail Cameron-You are .worried about this now only after you have the redistribution through. . Mr YOUNG-The honourable member ought to be careful because I think there might be a big bonus in this informal vote for us in the next election. He had better have a close look. I advise him to just be very patient. Mr Brumby-How is Andrew going to look then?",19
41,Mr YOUNG,SOCIAL SECURITY,"The honourable member does not have to worry about Andrew because the honourable member fotBennelong is not playing trivial pursuits; he is after Andrew's job. When the results of the Commission's survey are kno-n, not only will they be up for' discussion within the Parliament, but also obviously the Government would want to refer them to the Joi.nt Committee. Any recommendations the Joint Committee has in order that we may be able to improve the system even fU,rther would be looked on favourably by the Gove-nment.

What progress has been made in respect of the May Committee of port on the coal mining industry. Inquiry into the National Road Freight Industry recommendations following its inquiry?  able member for his 'question. Honourable . members will recall that the May Committee was appointed in July 1983 to carry out the first ever comprehensive analysis and examination of the national road freight industry and it reported towards the latter part of last year. The recommendations of the inquiry headed by Tom May aimed particularly at introducing economic stability into the industry. The inquiry came down very strongly against an argument of government regulation on entry into the industry and freight rate setting. In that inquiry the question of industrial representation for owner-drivers was raised. The view 'of the inquiry was that that matter wou-d be better dealt with by the Hancock Committee of Review into Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems. I understand that that report will be submitted to my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations at the end of next month. The package of recommendations brought for. ward by Tom May and his colleagues put forward to be accepted as a package in principle. The recommendations aimed at improving truck safety, improving conditions of operationwithiri the industry. It waS recommended that operator licensob- 'ing be introduced so that there would be protection for drivers who may be involved in breaches of the law brought about by economic pressures in and tasks which they were required to do by prime contractors. The recommendations also included provision for better training of drivers first enteras ing the industry. That package of 98 recommendations has been accepted in principle by the "" State and Territory Ministers for Transport. Those recommendations are under consideration beby the Gpvernment and I hope to be able to make an announcemlmt in. the near future as to the NA NA Mr HAYD,EN (Oxley-Minister for Foreign "" have a Affairs)-Forthe information of honourable m-mbers, 1 present the report of the Australian delegation meeting to the United Nations General issue Assembly----'thirty-eighth session 1983.

To the Honourable the Speaker and the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in the ParHouse liament assembled. The humble petition of the underpetition signed electors of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth that: 1. We are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian national flag. 2. We are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: The Union Jack-itself the creation of 3 Christian crosses-represents the nation's historical gin, and the source of its language and law. The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its place in space. The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. 3. We know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4.

Radio Services: North Queensland To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of Australia respectfully showeth: That ABC radio transmission from 4QA Mackay is antiquated and operates on transmitters installed in 1947-48 to service a region in which the area and lation has doubled in the intervening 36 years. The signal from 4QA is below strength so that station 4QN at Townsville has a far better signal strength into the Mackay hinterland than 4QA, a distance of only 70 km from Mackay and over 300 km from Townsville. The 4QN news programmes are of no interest in the Mackay region and in emergency situations such as cyclones, the 4QA frequency has limited penetration within the region. That while FM programmes are available in Rockhampton and Townsville, Mackay, with a regional population of 100,000 people, has been by-passed when towns of smaller size have the advantages of FM radio. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government and the Department of Communications will move urgently to rectify both these anomalies.

National Flag Pensions: Assets Test To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Chiropractic Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The prohumble petition of certain citizens of Australia shows: That, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, all State Parliaments have enacted chiropractic legislation. That chiropractors provide a safe, effective and economical health care service that is complementary to medicine. That the introduction of a Federally funded health care system restricted to the services provided almost exclusivelyby the medical profession restricts the freedom to select the health care practitioner of one's choice and does nothing to reduce the high cost of health care in Australia. That a financial disadvantage will be incurred by those citizens utilising chiropractic care, many of whom find that their health complaints do not respond satisfactorily to traditional approaches. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled ensures that chiropopupractic services are included in Medicare when it is introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cadman. Petition received. Telecom Australia: Zonal Charges To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled. The humble petition of certain citi, zens respectfully showeth: That the current Telecom Australia practice of charging STD telephone rates for telephone users living in ""outer metropolitan"" areas is unfair given that Telecom's method of determining what is an outer metropolitan area (by dratiing concentric circles on a map centring on the Perth GPO) does not take into account the development of regional and subregional corridors of urban growth which are encouraged by the West Australian State Government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the recommendations of the House of Representatives Committee on Expenditure concerning Telecom's Z,onal charging policies be implemeflted so that areas of urban growth at significant distances from the Perth GPO are not automatically classified as STD, telephone areas but instead that consideration be given to the development of areas of urban growth in relation to their STD status. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Blanchard. Petition received. Pornographic Publications: Entitlements of De To the, Honourable the Speaker arid Members of the House of Representatives'in'Pariiament assembled.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr - eter Fisher and Mr Lloyd. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain electors df the Division of Forrest respectfully showeth that the Australian Citizenship Act contains provision for the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth II Queen of Australia, her heirs and successors, and an Affirmation of Allegiance to Her Majesty - lizabeth II Queen of Australia, her heirs and successors: That the said Oath ,and Affirmation of Allegiance are supported by the overwhelming majority of Australians. Your petitioners' humbly pray that members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will ensure that the present Oath and Affirmation of Allegiance are retained; and would strongly oppose any attempt to remove all reference to God and the Queen from the Oath of Allegiance, and any attempt to remove all reference to the Queen from the Affirmation of Allegiance.

They call on the Hou-e of Representatives and the Government of the Commonwealth to re-affirm their primary obligation to government schools and to implement all 1983 ALP election promises for increased funding to government schools.

We, the undersigned, are deeply concerned that Australia's great farm potential is being shackled by unnecessarily rising production costs. . Many Federal and State Government regulations, excessive taxes and charges, are damaging the ability of agriculture to compete on world markets, are increasing food costs for Australian families and creating widespread unemployment in both country and cities. The undersigned humbly petition the Parliaments of Australia, its States and Territories, to take all measures within their powers to reduce the burden of imposed costs and regulation, allowing Australia's farmers to unlock farm potential so the nation as a whole can share the benefits of the resulting growth and prosperity. ., And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Hawker. Petition received. To the Honourabl- the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government: , Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttingS of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security. Recognize that plant breeding is. a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognize that any system giving 'property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust. Recognize that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely: i. a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm, ii. subordination and/or curtailment of 'public breeding programmes; iii. farmer unrest at seed prices, iv .. monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals, v. increased uniformity of crop 'varietiesleading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack, Reject any' proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety RightsAct, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or ent-rprises.

That the Department maintain the curfew on the runway from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. 3. Introduce a six months trial period if the policy to lift the curfew is adhered to, to enable residents to voice their opinions on such a curfew before Government policy is finalised.

68,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,"The economic news-indeed, most of the news-of the nation over the last couple of weeks has been dominated by the fall in the value of the Australian dollar. There can be no doubt that the fall in the value of the Australian dollar which has been recorded over the last several weeks is in part-I stress in part-a direct result of a fall in the level of confidence in the economic management and resolve of the Hawke Government. That decline has taken place not only domestically but also internationally. If we wanted any evidence of why people overseas are now having real doubts as to whether what they previously perceived to be relatively responsible economic policies pursued by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) any longer prevail, we found a very good reason for those doubts in Question Time yesterday and Question Time again today. Yesterday, in answer to a question I put to the Prime Minister, he got up and-I paraphrase the answer he gave-said: 'I agree with you that the economically sensible and rational thing to do is to discount the next national wage case for the effects of the devaluation on the consumer price index. That is the economically responsible thing to do, but I cannot do it because I am bound by the terms of the prices and incomes accord'. That is what the Prime Minister was saying yesterday. He was, in effect, giving official ratification and confirmation to the view that buying industrial peace is more important than the longer term economic health of Australia and is more important than the impact on the .unemployed of Australia of a wage determination system that increasingly this country cannot afford. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) acknowledged yesterday, the depreciation of the Australian dollar of recent weeks, despite the adverse effects of it and despite the fact that it represents some failure or loss of confidence by others in the policies and the assets of this country, confers some competitive gain and edge on our export and import competing industries. The Prime Minister did not dissent from that point of view. However, the important thing is that, if we are not to suffer all the disadinflationary vantages of a depreciation of our currency, we must be willing to insulate our import competing and export industries from the adverse price effects of that depreciation. The only way we can do that is by insulating those industries through the wages system. Increasingly, what is happening, of course, is. that the floating of the Australian dollar has imposed strains upon our wage fixation system and has demonstrated how inappropriate our wage determination system is. Instead of standing up yesterday and saying to the Australian public that the Government would be willing to discount for the effects of the depreciation of the Australian dollar, the Prime Minister rather supinely threw up his arms and said: 'I would like to do it. I know it is the economically responsible thing to do, but I cannot do it because it would break the prices and incomes accord'. What he was doing, as he did over the MX missile issue, was saying that when it comes to a choice between numbers and duty he will choose numbers any time. He has demonstrated that time and again. He demonstrated it over his failure to dismiss the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) from the Cabinet on two occasions; he demonstrated it over the MX missile issue and he is demonstrating it again by his failure to follow the only economically rational cours« in the wake of the depreciation of the Australian dollar. What the Prime Minister knows in his heart and what proper observers of the Australian economic scene know is a reality, and it is a reality that I pointed out in December 1983 when the Government floated the Australian dollar, a decision that I warmly welcomed then and still welcome as one of the very good and praiseworthy decisions that the Hawke Governm«nt has taken. I said on that occasion: Now that the dollar has, quite properly, been floated, the Government can no longer 'fudge' the exchange rate in order to protect it from the consequences of inappropriate and irresponsible domestic fiscal, monetary and wages policies. The dollar float imposes a new discipline on the Government. There is little prospect thilt the industrial wing of the labour movement and the left-wing of the Labor Party will respond to that discipline. If ever we had a demonstration that the Government would not respond to that discipline, we had it yesterday when the Prime Minister was unwilling to give the only economically responsible answer to the question that I asked. It is no wonder that this morning the· Australian Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest business organisations in Australia, had this to say: The business community views with complete bewilderment the Prime Minister's statement that the Federal Government would support the passing on to wages of the effects of the recent decline in the Australian dollar. The statement will only serve to undermine the value of earlier statements by other senior Cabinet Ministers and by the Prime Minister himself on the need to engender business confidence. That is not a bad smack in the eye from the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. It is no wonder, because it is an example of the declining domestic confidence in the economic policies of this Government. i have said repeatedly over the past several weeks that there are external reasons for the decline in the value of the dollar. It is not the fault of the present Government or, indeed, any Australian government that these have occurred. I refer, of course, to the strength of the United States dollar and the fact that as a commodity trader we, in common with all other commodity traders, have seen our currency depreciate because of the depressed level of commodity prices. But there one must end the exculpation of the present Government because when one moves to the other set of reasons, one finds that this Government is very much to blame. I and other Opposition members have said repeatedly over the past couple of weeks that the humiliating retreat of the Prime Minister over the MX missile issue has broken in a very significant way the confidence that many people had in him in the economic area. I was told repeatedly by people in the financial community in the United States when I followed the Prime Minister's visit there a couple of weeks ago: 'If he backed down to the left wing in this issue, he will back down to the left wing on other issues'. The decline in the value of the Australian dollar represents a vote of loss of confidence in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and this Government. There is no way that the Government can wriggle and worm out of that because a floating exchange rate tells the story and tells it quickly, plainly and without any kind of fear or favour. That is what makes a floating exchange rate a far better method of running one's exchange rate than other systems.· That is why.a floating exchange rate continues to have the support of the Opposition and, to his credit, the support of the. Treasurer. No doubt he hopes that somehow or other, the realism that a floating exchange rate brings home, will make some of his colleagues aware of many of the difficulties. This loss of confidence in the economic policies of the Government is not something that has arisen only over the last couple of weeks as exemplified by the fall in value of the Australian dollar. One can go back to the Budget of last year. If ever there was an election Budget, if ever there was a Budget designed purely and simply for the polls and hOt for the medium or the longer term, it was the 1984 Budget. It waS a Budget that I described at the time as 'a political document, based on the vote now, pay later principle'. That Budget maximised short term electoral possibilities, but I warned at the time that next year it would present major economic problems on the budgetary front. Of course, those major problems are now becoming apparent. Even in areas where the Government was able in its early months of office to point to some level of success, a slow down is starting to occur. This is happening, for example, in the employment area. Remember how much we were regaled by the GoVernment about the improvements in employment that had taken place since it was elected? Total employment, seasonally adjusted, grew by 3.1 per cent in the 12 months to March 1984, but in the 10 months to January 1984 it has increased at an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent. Real interest rates-that is, the gap between the nominal rate and the rate of inflationare now the highest that they have been for two generations. This Treasurer. not only presided over the highest tax take in Australia's history in the last Budget and the highest level of expenditure in Australia's history in the last Budget, but he also now presides over the highest real interest rates that this country has seen since the end of World War II. No wonder people here and overseas are starting to vote a lack of confidence. Of course, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are not alone. It amuses me no end to see Labor premiers running around the world inviting foreign banks to establish headquarters in their particular cities. Who else could I think of this week but the Victorian Premier, Mr Cain, who has not' been slow to run around the world inviting this and that bank to establish its headquarters in Melbourne and to a parade all the marvellous advantages of having the headquarters of a bank in Melbourne. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having the headquarters of one's bank in Melbourne. Melbourne is a terrific city. The only thing wrong with it at the moment is its State Government. If ever a person were aligned, in terms of policy attitudes, to those policies of the Federal Government which are now losing favour internationally, it is the Premier of Victoria. Not only has he a sorry record of increases in taxes and charges and of mortgaging the future assets of Victoria's instrumentalities to an unconscionable extent to overseas lenders, but to the Victorian Premier belongs the dubious distinctiqn of being the first political figure in office in the Western world to say that facilities for nuclear-powered vessels would not be available in his port. The Victorian Premier was even two years ahead of the New Zealand Prime Minister in saying that visits by nuclear-powered warships would not be welcome in Victorian ports. I quote from his remarkable statement in 1982, when he declared: , . visits by nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed warships to Victoria from any country are not welcome. Everybody remembers that, fortunately, that exercise in anti-Americanism by the present Victorian Premier was very smartly put down by the then Prime Minister, MalColm Fraser. It is very interesting that as far as Mr Cain's ideology and his attitudes are concerned, he was even two years ahead of the New Zealand Prime Minister. That gives us an idea of the nature, the calibre and the quality of the leadership of that Government. I realise, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I digress a little from my comments on the management of the national economy, but the point must still be made that the economic policies that I condemn, the economic policies that have eroded international confidence in the Australian dollar, are fully supported by that same Premier who led the break out at the 1983 Premiers Conference, where at the last minute the Treasurer got rolled and had to give another $400m in funds to the States. The last two weeks· has seen the coming together of various strands which indicate a loss of confidence in the economic management of this Government. It faces an horrendous problem on the wages front. Not only has it a wage indexation system that this country cannot afford, but the secretary. of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has said that this country has the most beneficial wage fixation system for the trade union movement of any country in the world. On the wages front, the Government also faces the difficulty of what to do with the productivity case. It faces the problem,of putting together a Budget in 1985 when it will have to pay the price of its electoral vote-buying Budget of 1984 and in many other areas it faces an erosion of the international competitiveness of Australian industry. Most importantly, it faces a Prime Minister who no longer has the authority and respect that people previously believed he enjoyed. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",28
69,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would have to be joking, to stand up in this Parliament and condemn the Government for Ii performance on the economy which has reduced inflation from 12 per cent to 5 per cent, which has given us a year of record economic growth, and now a second year and looking wi,th confidence to a third year, w:hichhas created 300,000 jobs, which has reduced unemployment from lOA to 8.5 per cent and which has seen a turn-around in investment and consumption and a massive 56 per cent pick-up in the housing sector over the last 18 months. For this he says he, condemns us for our management of the economy. How does it compare with his record? Negative growth for the first time in 30 years in 1982-83; squandered opportunities through the 1970s;. a period of accelerated investment in mining simply blown out the window; an inflation rate of over 11 per cent; interest rates of 20 per cent, He talks about real rates of interest. Let him go outside-",30
70,Unknown,PETITIONS,Opposition members interjecting,30
71,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"Just quieten the arrogant ant over there, Madam Deputy Speaker, if you do not mind. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I suggest to the House that the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party was heard in silence, and I ask honourable members to extend the same courtesy to any other member of this House.",30
72,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is talking about real rates of interest, yet he had people committing suicide at a 20 per cent rate of interest. We had record interest rates in this country. There is one thing about these Liberals-they cannot be made to face any shame; there is no shame in the Liberal Party. A 20 per cent interest rate and a massive increase in unemployment, from 6 to 10 per cent of the work force; back to double digit inflation; the first negative growth for 30 years; yet the matter of public importance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reads: . . . . doubts about the Government's ability . . . to effectively manage the economy . . . Where do we go? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks about our fudging on the exchange rates; that our actions on the exchange rate are being exposed. Who was the Treasurer who sat and let the Treasury over-value the exchange rate for years, while we had a wages explosion ripping our competitiveness apart on the way through? Why did we maintain the exchange rate system for those years? It is because the former Treasurer could not get a piece of tissue paper through Cabinet-he had neither the ability nor the guts to knock his Prime Minister over and get the Austr-lian dollar floated, to find its equilibrium in the market place. He kept the Australian dollar overvalued, ripping the guts out of our manufacturing industries, destroying the prospects of our export industries to compete, our primary export sector. While all of that was happening, we had a massive wages explosion, presided over by himself and  who was then the Minister for Industrial ReI lations. He says we are fudging it up on economic policy; we are fudging it up on the exchange rate. He says we have the wrong wage determination system. We have a wage determination system which has given us two years of back-to-back wage restraint and no increase in award wages for 12 months. He has the hide to say that that so called policy of his, which had wages blowing. out through nearly a decade, was the right policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes the point, with crocodile tears, of how much infllition will drift through the wage system as a result of changes in the exchange rate. He says that as though the conditions which currently apply in the economy would have applied under his policies. We would have already had the wage increases under his policies, right through 1984. We would not have had to wait for some move in the exchange rate to drift through wage indexation; we would have already seen our competitiveness eroded by the impact on wages of such a change, because they have no policy to deal with that. His policy is to let the powerful unions negotiate and to give centralised wage fixing to everybody else. In other words, he is saying that we should let the high points of the economy fight it out and then those massive increases will ratchet their way through the economy, as they have in the past, and in the end flow right through, as happened with the metal trades award of 1981. Eighteen months after that award even the bookmakers' clerks on the racecourses received an increase. It went through every sector of the economy. That is the wage system he implores us to have. Instead of that, we have an accord with the trade unions, based on fair and decent wage restraint as a trade-off for growth. In other words, the unions will restrain themselves for growth and for employment. They have done that, demonstrably;otherwise we would not have an inflation rate of only 5 per cent. Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says it is the wrong wages policy. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) happens to recognise tht; fact that if changes in the exchange rate over time were to impact on the wage system there would have to be some trade off. However the accord permits negotiations in regard to these factors anyway and one cannot simply assume that any change in the exchange rate would automatically drift into wages. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then had the hide to say that the Prime Minister is negating his responsibilities to this Parliament. The fact is that this Government has brought inflation down and it is the policies of this Government, not the policies of the coalition, which will lead this country through prosperity in the 1980s. So much for the wage fixation system. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talks about the current account deficit. This Government is two years old. Does he think the structural problems of the economy and the current account deficit can all be laid at our door? What about the wage explosion of 1981 and Australia's loss of competitiveness? What has that done to the current account deficit? What about the impact of the massive pick-up in imports which has come as a result of this recovery? Of course that has an impact on the current account deficit, but for the right reasons. There is a lagged effect of a change in competitiveness. But, of course, everything comes in its time and with the right market mechanisms those corrections will take place. The Opposition has shed crocodile tears and wrung its hands about whether this Government can manage the economy. Nothing the former Treasurer has said throws any light upon any shift in policy on his part. He talked about the 1984 Budget as though there was something wrong with it. I have told him over and over again-he will not listen-that the smallest deficit is not necessarily the right deficit. We do not accept his view about dragging activity out of the economy too quickly. We will not cop that. The difference between his policies and ours is that the Government has its policy settings cast for growth. It is not just a government with a growth rhetoric; it has its fiscal and monetary policy settings cast for growth, backed up by a prices and incomes accord. We are not, as is the Opposition, advocating a contractionary fiscal policy and a monetary policy which will lead to a credit squeeze. The former Treasurer is advocating that we chase the 8 to 10 per cent target at a time of enormous upheaval in the relationship between the monetary aggregates and the gross domestic product as a result of this Government's historic deregulation of the financial system. He would have us mindlessly, foolishly and irresponsibly chasing a fictitious and cosmetic number, leading to a credit squeeze in this country and stalling growth, all because he is an unreconstructed monetarist. He always copped the view of the former Secretary to the Treasury and others who dominated his economic thinking during the 1980s. He will not accept that there is a basic difference in our philosophies. This is a government with a policy cast for growth; it is not a policy cast for the ideological obsessions of people in the Liberal Party or the business community. The results are there for everyone to see. Look at the Opposition's performance in the election campaign. It said that it believes in smaller .Budget deficits, but we found over $1,500m of new policy. There was the $500m of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the $500m of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), and then there were all sorts of other announcements around the place. Opposition members could not keep a fiscal policy together if they tried, yet they are trying us that there is something wrong with our Budgets. Last year we could have brought in a Budget deficit of about $5t billion if we had not· provided a tax cut. But the tax cut has given us wage restraint, amongst other things, as well as the pay back of some fiscal drag. The result is that we have a 5 per cent inflation rate for the first time since 1972. So where do Opposition members get off in telling us that our policies are wrong? They should not kid themselves about what members of the business community think; they should just go and talk to them. They should just pick up the newspapers and look at the restoration of profits across companies. Do honourable members opposite really think anyone in Australian business seriously believes that the Liberal Party of Australia has any policies to give noninflationary growth to this country? No one in business does. The business community has given members of the Liberal Party up. It has sold them out because they are not worth supporting. They have no ideas. They are bums when it comes to economic policies. The business community knows that they are bums and it will not wear them. I make that point very clear. I just want to make a couple of points about monetary policy because I have heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition railing whenever he can-on 2GB, 2UE or to anyone who will listen to him-about what is wrong with the monetary aggregates.",30
73,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,You obviously monitor it fairly closely.,32
74,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"We get it back. We have to read everything. We see it all. The fact of the matter is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the great monetarist, the man who believes in monetary targets, never hit a monetary target once in five years as Treasurer. That is the first thing. The second thing is that this Government brought the money supply on target in 1983-84, despite $4 billion of capital inflow. We were issuing bonds as if they were going out of style through 1983-84 to get to that monetary target. Even though we have an incomes policy in place we do not accept the view that we do not have to worry about monetary policy, that monetary policy can just be lax and that money can swim around. We do not accept either the religious relationship between the precise increase in monetary growth and inflation. We fixed upon a neutral monetary policy, a neutral firm monetary stance throughout 1983-84, and we are prepared to do the same thing in 1984-85. When the Budget came down in 1984-85 we said that we would look .to to tell adjustments for growth and if there was more growth mid-year than we thought, we would adjust the target up for growth and we wOllld adjust it for re-intermediation. But what we did not know ·and did not say, because we were not aware of it at the time, is that not only h;we we had re-intermediation but also we have had intermediation. In other words, there is now much more activity in the financial sector in terms of the reflection of monetary growtlJ. relative to a given level of activity in the economy. The relationships between the monetary aggregates and gross domestic product have changed as they have changed in the United States of America. When Paul Volcker announced shifts in monetary policy three years ago he copped the same sort of nonsense that I have copped from the Opposition as a result. The fact of the matter is that this Government is not abandoning monetary policy. We are prosecuting a firm monetary policy but we have set aside the target in this period of uncertainty because M3 and the broader M's are no longer a reliable guide to what is happening between monetary activity and activity in the economy. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition thinks he can score some cheap debating point by trying to play upon some obsessions in the business community about monetary policy, he has another think coming, because the business community can make its own judgments. It knows' where interest rates are. It knows whether policy is firm or not. It knows that the anti-inflation stance of this Government is without peer in this Parliament. In terms of fiscal policy the Government is committed to the trilogy. It is committed to it at Cabinet, Ministry and Caucus levels. As well as that, we have said that we will see a money reduction in the deficit in 1985-86 over 1984-85.",32
75,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,A money or real?,32
76,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"A money reduction in the deficit-m-o-n""e-y.",32
77,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,So the Australian Financial Review editorial is right?,32
78,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"No, the Australian Financial Review editorial today was wrong. It is not the Treasurer and not the Governor General. It is a money reduction in the deficit.",32
79,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,"No, the Governor-Oeneral's Speech was wrong.",33
80,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"Oh, God! Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Would the Treasurer please ignore the interjections.",33
81,Mr KEATING,PETITIONS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, the result is that it is by far the most disciplinary' fiscal policy that any government has' ever been encouraged to undertake, compared to the grab bag policy pursued by my predecessor. As I said at the start, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition getting up here, without shame on his face, and initiating such a matter of public importance with his record and the record of his Party, in the face of this Government's record, is really stretching credibility to unbelievable ends.",33
82,Mr CARLTON,PETITIONS,"The matter of public importance submitted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is in the following terms: The growing doubts about the Government's ability and resolve to effectively manage the economy as exemplified by the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. At stake here is the credibility of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Government with local and overseas financial markets and economic observers as to whether they can deliver on the various commitments they have made in economic policy. The Treasurer, who has been very good indeed at going around the board rooms and bourses of the world in a dark suit and talking about the collection of antiques, has presented a view of the Australian Labor Party to people here and abroad which is quite different from that presented during the previous period of Labor ter government. As we know, overseas ,investors had an opinion of a Labor government as !Jne that s-nt people around with letters from Jim Cairns, or sent Khemlani over to borrow $4,OOOm. They thought members of the Government had Iraqi breakfasts. This was the general image of the Labor Party within the international, business financial community. The Treasllrer had an exaspect tremely difficult task in removing this image backed up by the Prime Minister (Mr Haw-e), he went round all the board rooms and international conference tables to give a totally different pression of a Labor government. Basically what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were saying was: 'We are not like Whitlam, Cairns, Khemlani or any of these people. We are sound economic managers. We have got the lunatics in our under total control. All the left wing fourth ANZUS?'. graders are people that we can put our finger on. We have got the trade unions, which caused immense damage under the previous Whitlam Government and also during 1981-82 under the Fraser Government, under control because we have got them constrained by the prices and incomes accord, a solemn agreement which they have signed. We are also supporters of the financial deregulation begun by the previous Treasurer following the Campbell report. We have also got Labor governments in the various States, which are perfectly sensible, run by common sense business type gentlemen who also wear dark suits and ties on public occasions. We are quite different from the previous Labor Government. You can trust us'. That impression was successfully implanted here and abroad. I must say that if Australia has to endure a Labor government for any period that impression is very useful. Members of the Opposition supported those aspects of Labor policy, particularly in the area of financial deregulation, which were sound and in the interests of Australia. We are talking about what has happened to the dollar over the last two or three weeks and what has happened in international financial circles; we are not talking about the general decline of the dollar which would happen for good economic reasons, but we are talking about the very substantial and dangerous wobbles that have occurred in addition to that. I suggest that they are occurring and may well continue to occur because the Government has shown that it is no longer able to control those critical elements of its constituency which enable it to maintain this international and local image. The first piece of evidence we have on this matis the MX virus that infected the Left and then got through to the Centre Left. Members of the Centre Left made an attack on their Prime Minister. Under pressure abroad, in the course of an overseas trip without full consultation with his colleagues, leaving the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Hayden) speechless in Sydney, the and Prime Minister changed his mind on a critical of our relationship with the United States and, of America under the ANZUS alliance. Inter. national observers could rightly ask: 'Is it possible also that the Treasurer will suffer a similar fate to imthat suffered by the Foreign Minister? Is it possible that the Prime Minister, under some similar kind of pressure from the Left, joined possibly by the Centre Left in a particular situation, will back , down on a domestic commitment which is just as Party important as that external commitment to I refer to the economic trilogy which is the centrepiece of this Government's forward economic plan. We support it insofar as it goes. We applauded it at the time. I must say that we expressed some doubt as to whether the Prime Minister had received full backing from his Cabinet on the matter. In fact, he had not. Nonetheless, he committed himself and that commitment to this trilogy has been noted by local and international communities. I remind the House that the trilogy is not to increase taxes at a faster rate than the growth in the economy, to reduce Government spending as a proportion of the nation's output and not to increase the Budget deficit as a proportion of the national product. Today in the House the Treasurer has tightened up that third element of that commitment by saying that the deficit will not increase in money terms. That was an important additional tightening of the commitment by the Treasurer in public today.",33
83,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,It is contradictory to the Governor General's Speech.,34
84,Mr CARLTON,PETITIONS,"It is, as my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, contradictory to the Governor General's Speech. Nonetheless, the Treasurer made this public statement here today. We note that. The Business Council of Australia, which had the same interpretation as the Treasurer, will be pleased to hear of that commitment. To this trilogy I add the not insubstantial additional commitment of not increasing the Medicare levy. That is the trilogy and that is a good set of commitments. It is as portant to Australia's future as the commitment to maintain the ANZUS alliance is important to our external defence. If we can be seen to go back on a commitment under ANZUS at the first whiff of grapeshot, what price the trilogy? That is the first problem caused by the MX virus. The second element cited by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister under which they could say that they were different from the Whitlam Government is that the trade unions were contained by the accord. The accord states that regardless of our international trading competitiveness, regardless of the capacity of individual firms or industries pay, wages overall will rise automatically with creases in prices. All the overseas experts know that that is not sensible in a competitive trading world, but they thought that that was the best that a Labor Government could do under the circumstances and they accepted that as· evidence of good intentions. But what do we find on the accord? At about· the same time as we have a backdown on the MX issue, we also have a Public Service strike which has immediate effects on the capacity to keep the promises of the trilogy because it immediately pushes up interest costs in the Budget, affects our external account and the flow of dollars in and out of Australia, causes further ructions in the value of the dollar but, most importantly of all, it tests the Goverriment's resolve in· maintaining the accord. What happened here is that the Public Service unions, as they were entitled to, went to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Comn:tission and said: 'Under the anomaly provisions of the accord we are enti.tled to an extra 8 per cent on top of the natiomi.l wage rises'. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission exhaustively examined the claims of those public sector unions and said that the claim had no merit and that the 8 per cent could not be granted; indeed, no additional increase could be granted. Under - he terms or'the accord, on which the future of this Government depends, it was up to those unions, as pari of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, as signatories to the accord, to go back to work and wait for the national wage case. If at a subsequent point they wished to raise some other matter, so be it. However they did not do that; they went on strike. The Government did not follow the accord either. It allowed the national wage case to proceed and it also suggested that there be a behind the scenes deal with the public sector unions to allow an anomalies increase. So, just as the Government did with ANZUS, just as it did with the MX and just as it will do in countless other areas where there is pressure from one of its oWn constituencies, it will cave in. It is im- on those grounds that we say that the Government's credibility in local and international financial markets is crumbling and that its capacity to maintain this whole framework of.economic responsibility is rapidly disappearing. Everything the Treasurer said today by way of past history is of no account when nobody can trust the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. . Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",34
85,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PETITIONS,"1 was surprised when I heard earlier today that the to Opposition proposed to raise a matter of public inimportance related to the devaluation of the Australian dollar. I was stunned when I saw that the Opposition intended to relate that question to the more general question of economic management. Mr Simmons-;-;-Short memory. MrROBERT BROWN-Honourable members opposite have an extremely short memory, as I am reminded by the honourable member for Calare. Let me assure this House, let me assure the Opposition, let me as-ure the Australian people that that short memory is not shared by members of the Government, nor.is it shared by the Australian electorate at large-nor should that short memory be shared by any of them. I said th-t I was stunned that the Opp-sition chose to relate the devaluation of the Aus-. tralian dollar to the generai question of economic management. Who would not be stunned, keeping in mind the appalling, the abysmal, record that the Opposition had in matters of economic management when it was in government? Do we need to remind anyone about what that record was? Mr Bilney-Yes, you do.",34
86,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PETITIONS,"Will I remind honourable members? Madam Deputy Speaker, members of the Government have appealed to me to remind them. Let me do so. For the first time in 50 years we had negative economic growth in Australia. Unemployment grew from 4.6 per cent, which the Fraser Government inherited in 1975, to 10.4 per cent when it was cast out of office. I make particular reference to the circumstances concerning unemployment which resulted from the former Government's economic management during the last 12 months of its economic stewardship. Mr Bilney-A misnomer. Mr ROBERT BROWNYes, undoubtedly it is a misnomer. During the last 12 months of the Fraser Government unemployment in Australia' increased by a quarter of a million people. We have spoken in terms of the economy being in a state of free fall. What greater evidence, what more appropriate evidence, could we have than the circumstances that existed in the last 12 months of the Fraser Government, when unemployment increased by a quarter of a million people? I hope the significance of that is not lost to all honourable members. What that means is that as a result of the economic policies which the Fraser Government initiated,' which it put into place, which it implemented, on every day of the last 12 months of that Government another 750 Australians' were thrown on to the unemployed scrap-heap. That is the rate at which unemployment'was growing. Every day for 12 months 750 people were added to the unemployment .list, making a total of a quarter of a million people. Who would not be stunned to see the Opposition link the devaluation of the dollar with general economic management? The Government has no need to apologise, nor would the Australian people expect it to apologise, for the undoubted success, the incredible success, which it has had with economic management, economic, revival. .At last it has given the Australian people an opportunity to look to the future with the sort of confidence that they are entitled to have. They did not have it between 1975 and 1983. Any confidence that they may have had, any confidence to which they may have aspired, was gradually destroyed by the sorts of policies that were implemented by the present Opposition. Yet today the Opposition chose, in a matter of public importance,. to link the devaluation of the dollar with general economic management. The Australian people have accepted, endorsed and applauded .the economic management of this Government-the initiatives, the policies,' that have been engineered and implemented by the Treasurer, Paul Keating, the man who has been recognised internationally as Finance Minister of the Year. When honourable members on the other side of the House suggest that all we need to do is to don a dark suit, put on a tie and then con the Australian business community or the international business community, I am amazed at the disrespect they show for the Australian business community. The Australian business community will not be conned by such superficiality. The Australian business community knows that it will give its respect: and support to a government whiCh, on the economic front, delivers the goods. That is precisely what this Government and this Treasurer have done. On the economic front we have delivered the goods. The Treasurer indicated some of the magnificent achievements that have been bought about as a result of the positive, constructive and intelligent economic policies that have beer applied since March 1983. Inflation has been halved. Unemployment has been slashed. From the 250,000 additional unemployed for which the Opposition's policies were responsible, since we came to government we have been responsible for increasing employment by 300,000. Let us not lose sight of this because I am not talking just in terms of numbers; I am talking in· terms of men and women and young people-all of those people about whom individuals both inside and outside this Parliament profess some concern. That means that as a result of the policies of this Government 300,000 people throughout the whole of Australia are now in employment-300,000 people who would not have had jobs had members of the Opposition remained in government. That is the type of record that honourable members opposite need to live down. They will not fool the Australian people. They should not be so impertinent towards the Australian people. They should not be so disrespectful to the Australian people as to suggest that all the members of the Government need to do is to don a dark suit, put on it tie and con the business community. The business community is not conned that easily. The Government has more respect for it and its judgment than honourable members opposite will ever have. I will say a couple of things in connection with what was supposed to be the essential point of this matter of public importance, and that is the devaluation of the currency which particularly this month. I make this point, and I hope that it will not be lost on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member Bennelong (Mr Howard), the former Treasurer and the present Treasury spokesman for the Opwealth position. I do not believe that it will be, and that is why I am a bit cynical about the reasons why this matter of public importance was raised today. think he understands as well as anyone that what is happening at present is the final shakeout in value of the Australian currency, resulting from the appalling economic record of the Fraser Government. There have been lags. with which members o(the Opposition respond to' that point convinces me that, despite the fact I tried to give them credit for understanding what this is all about, they do not. Clearly, they lack understanding. I will put it as simply as I can them. When the previous Government was thrown out of office we inherited an inflation rate of about 10.4 per cent. Opposition members know that the rate was at least twice the inflation rate of our competitors among the Organisation for Econme. omic Co-operation and Development countries. life As a result of that high inflation rate, the domestic value of the Australian currency fell. But in of the exchange rate, it was maintained at artificially high level internationally. When exchange rate was free to be determined by marance ket forces, there was then an opportunity for it reach an appropriate level, and that is exactly what is tilking place at present. Incidentally, what we should be doing is not looking at the rate of the Australian currency in relation American dollar; we should be looking at a appropriate measure of our currency, such as the trade weighted index.",35
87,Mr HOWARD,PETITIONS,It is still down.,36
88,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PETITIONS,"Yes, but it is'not down to the same extent. I emphasise again that we are seeing the final shakeout in the value of the Australian currency. There are definite advantages in the exchange rate of the Australian dollar reaching its appropriate market level. It is doing that at present. I would like to see less volatility in it but, quite clearly-Madam DEPUTY SPEAl\.ER-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. The discussion is concluded. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 25 February, on motion has taken place by Ms Jakobsen: That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to: for May it please Your Excellency: We, the House of Representatives of the Commonof Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have I been pleased to address to Parliament. Madam pEPUTY SPEAKER-Before I call the' the honourable member for Macarthur, I remind the House that this is a maiden speech and I ask the House to extend the usual courtesies to the The hilarity honourable member.",36
89,Mr MARTIN,PETITIONS,"lnitially, that Madam Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your election as Chairman of Committees. I certainly look forward to serving under your astute for guidance during the life of this Parliament. I would like' you to convey my similar congratulations to Mr Speaker. I speak for the first time in this House with a very acute sense of honour and responsibility which the electors of Macarthur have entrusted to It is somewhat remarkable that, during the of this Parliament, no fewer than three former members for Macarthur, plus me, will share this terms building. The honourable member for Werriwa that (Mr Kerin) ably represented the people of the Macarthur between 1972 and 1975. His performwithin the Ministry has brought high critical to acclaim from his former constituents and the Australian people at large. Having failed last year to gain his own Party's preselection for a seat in the exchange New South Wales Parliament, Mr Michael to the Baume will join the Opposition ranks in the more Senate in July, My immediate predecessor and good friend, Mr Hollis, takes his seat within this House as the honourable member for Throsby. I believe it is traditional in a maiden speech to extend thanks to many people-to family, friends, political colleagues and so on. I take this opportunity to acknowledge publicly the support I have received from my wife Carol, the rank and file members of the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Macarthur who selected me to contest the seat for Australia's only true party of social conscience, and, particularly, my very, close friend and mentor, the Hon. Laurie Kelly, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales. I also extend sincere appreciation to a former great Australian Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, who, although I only met him, formally, on the opening day of the Parliament, shook from me the shackles of political apathy and steeled my commitment to reform, social justice and equality for all Australians. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I extend my thanks to the working class people of Macarthur who put me here. The electorate of Macarthur has emerged from the redistribution as a New South Wales south coast provincial and semi-rural electorate, stretching inland from the ,:!orthern Wollongong suburbs between Austinmer and Mount Ousley to include the ,towns of Wilton, Appin, Bargo, Picton, Tahmoor, Camden and Warragamba. As a life-long resident of Wollongong, I call fairly claim to be a son of Illawarra, completely familiar with its people, its problems and its aspirations. As a former high school teacher and university lecturer in Wollongong, it town planner in Campbelltown and an alderman of the WOllongong City Council, I bring to this House an intimate knowledge of the electorate and a desire and commitment to work for its advancement. I realise that this is no mean task. The once proud Illawarra-Macarthur region, famous world-wide as the cradle of Australia's rural industry, has been ravaged in recent years by twin evils-the effects of a major economic recession and board room decisions of overseas multinational companies and monopolies. Macarthur's recent economic history has been dependent almost totally on the well-being of manufacturing industry and the underground coal mining industry. With the decline of these, the very social and economic fabric of my electorate has undergone considerable change. Dominant in the manufacturing sector is the steel industry at Port Kembla which, although located in the neighbouring electorate of Cunningham, over many years, has provided employment opportunities for the residents of the Macarthur electorate. In 1981 Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd employed almost 20 per cent of the total employee population of the Illawarra region, while a considerable proportion of the remaining employment was found in enterprises directly related to or under the corporate umbrella of the steel industry. The lack of diversity in the regional economy earned W ollongong the title of 'steel city' and meant that the region was particularly vulnerable to the rapid structural change and the recession of the early 1980s. In the period of post-war industrial expansion the steel il1 dustry contributed to large scale employment generation and population growth, with an extremely high proportion of the work force being derived from overseas countries. However, by 1971 the progressive substitution of capital for labour and consequent produCtivity gains had led to a stabilisation of employment of around 20,000. At this time, through a combination of corporate' policy decisions and a belated recognition of the need to rationalise, in my view due largely to poor forward planning and a failure by the company to detect the warning signs that modern overseas steel plants would shortly create massive problems of competition for Australia, unemployment rates in the industry rose dramatically. Employment at the Port Kembla plant fell from 20,368 in 1981 to a current level of around 13,000. In addition, this crisis was amplified by the effect on subsidiary and dependent companies in the Illawarra-Macarthur regions. It is estimated that for each job lost in the steel industry another was lost in thy region. While it is not possible to determine precisely the current unemployment rate for the Macarthur electorate, a figure close to 20 per cent, based on data from the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security, is not unrealistic. However, to its great credit, this Government has responded positively to the crisis in the steel industry-a crisis reflected by international overproduction and the declining domestic demand for steel. In 1983 the steel industry's plan was announced which saw the industry, unions imd government agree to a wide range of options to encourage intensive modernisation and rationalisation at the Port Kembla plant and in other steel plants of Australia. Through union agreements on productivity, government agreements on steel import levels, guarantees of percentage shares in the Australian domestic steel market and industry guarantees regarding levels of investment in modernisation and expansion programs, a degree of stability has again been brought back into the industry. But a word of caution is necessary. Constant surveillance must be kept of changes in domestic and international economic conditions, particularly as reflected by levels of imports. The fact that these import levels have now reached 30 per cent of the local steel market is of major concern to the whole Illawarra community. I am pleased that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) is aware of this problem and has indicated that remedial action may be forthcoming. Further, the existing situation with respect to the levels of protection for the steel industries in other countries, particularly the United States of America and New Zealand, must be carefully monitored. The United States has recently limited its imports to 18.5 per cent of its steel needs and has been directly responsible for the excess of steel on the world market. Problems of negotiating steel agreements with New Zealand, despite the existence of the closer economic relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand, have had similar effects on steel production in Australia. I was pleased to read recently that the Minister for Trade (Mr Dawkins) has made tentative plans to stage a mini-summit with representatives of the New Zealand Government to discuss this issue. Whilst I applaud this. initiative, I believe care must be taken to ensure that imports of New Zealand steel into Australia do not impinge upon the viability of the Australian steel industry. The problems of the manufacturing sector alone have not been responsible for the economic ills of the Macarthur electorate. It is fair to say that in recent years' no sector of my electorate has been more devastated than the coal industry. There are no fewer than 17 underground mines within the boundaries of Macarthur and neady 90 per cent of the electorate is underlain with black gold. Mining giants such as BP Australia Ltd, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd are all operative in the area, providing principally coking coal and some steaming coal for domestic and export markets. Since 1982 there have been massive retrenchments in the coal industry and a number of pits have been closed or rationalised. Unfortunately for my electorate, most retrenchments in New South Wales have taken place in the southern coalfields. Over 2,000 jobs have been lost in this area alone. The effect of those sackings on the mines and the community of the Illawarra and the Burragorang Valley and such towns as Camden, Picton and Tahmoor, has been nothing short of horrendous. Indeed, had it not been for the combined efforts of this Government, the Labor Government of New South Wales and the mining unions, many hundreds more miners would have been subjected to the same fate and other collieries would have been closed in the name of economic rationalisation. Yet within the industry it is now believed that underground mining has a brighter future in the long term, particularly in respect of open cut operations in New South Wales and Queensland. As well, latest production figures would seem to indicate that underground mining produces coal more cheaply. If this is the case, why is the industry of the south coast and the Burragorang Valley plagued by shutdowns and retrenchments? Optimism expressed within the industry must be tempered with a realisation that, both for the present and for the foreseeable future, companies must compete against each other for prized international markets in an economic climate of massive oversupply. With more than 20 million tonnes of hard coking coal stockpiled around the world, international coal contracts are being awarded only to the most efficient producers, or to those companies prepared to undercut prices offered by competitors. A major technical problem threatening the coal industry in the Macarthur area concerns the question of transportation. The construction of stage I of the Port Kembla coal loader has provided export facilities for hard coking coal, transported to the loader by rail and road. New South Wales State Government policy dictates that in most cases rail transport of coal must be used. The Maldon-Dombarton rail line under construction promises to alleviate some of the domestic transportation problems by allowing acceSs to rail by several of the southern district mines. However, freight charges associated with this form of transport, indeed, with all coal transportation, have contributed to the Australian coal industry's difficulties in competing with overseas suppliers such as South Africa. With the downturn in the demand for steel on the world market, the Macarthur region has started to exploit its steaming coal reserves in order to keep up production. Markets which have included India, Bangladesh and Pakistan have emerged, but because these countries have relatively small ports the coal must be shipped in smaller lots. Consequently, the price of the coal is proportionately higher. The whole structure of Australia's coal transportation system, including the question of freight rates, requires investigation, and an overall strategy needs to be devised. It is hoped that this may be the subject of review during this Parliament. What then is the future for the coal industry in both the Macarthur electorate and Australia generally? In the very long term the future is bright because the south coast underground reserves will far outlast ope'n cut seams. In the short term the Australian Coal Association believes that south coast collieries must turn to steaming coal for their sales. However, the problem onCe again is that steaming coal pays a lower price for the same production costs. Hence, the Association has called for south coast mines to restructure to remain competitive. Once again, this returns the industry to the bleak prospect of mine closures and large scale retrenchments in the name of rationalisation. Not all in the industry would agree with the assertion that the future is bright. It isimpossible to predict fluctuations in world demand for .coal, in prices obtainable in a climate of fluctuations in currencies, and in the desires of coal companies to expand or contract in response' to these and other factors. In the last 10 years, all the export collieries in the southern coalfields have come under the control of multinational oil and mineral corporations. Although these companies have increased their level of investment in technological advances, the southern coalfields remain vulnerable to fluctuations in the international market and to the investment programs of companies'withinterests in minerals, oil and gas, in not only other parts of Australia, but also other parts of the world. I was, pleased to read of the success that the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Gareth Evans) was able to achieve with theBritish Petroleum company during his recent trip to Europe. The agreement reached in respect of Burragorang Valley mines has meant that jobs have been saved and mine closures averted for a per-od at least. Yet this serves as a typical example of hqw the problems of coal marketing and the progress of the Australian coal industry are dealt with on a piecemeal basis. No overall, coordinated strategy has been devised to ensure security of employment, equal access to markets at agreed to prices and even the basic allocation of new coal leaSeS. Certainly, the establishment of the Coal Consultative Council by this Government in 1983 demonstrated the Australian Labor Party's commitment to becoming an active participant in the coal industry and to providing a framework for Government, companies and the trade unions to address the pressing problems of the industry. However, the crisis in the last year or so has clearly demonstrated the need for continued Federal intervention in price and tonnage negotiations and in the overall control of the industry. Labor Party policy calls for the establishment.of a coal industry authority charged with responsibility for redressing these problems. , Something must be done and done now, otherwise miners in the Macarthur electorate and in other mining areas of Australia will face a bleak future, a future which could see the continued economic and social decline of whole communities dependent on the mining sector. I believe that these two matters on which I have touched are of universal concern across a broad spectrum of ages and classes. However, I now turn to an issue of equal, if not greater, significance to every Australian. I refer to the problem of youth unemployment, which remains one of the great social tragedies of our time. January figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicated that between 1973 and 1983 the unemployment rate among teenagers increased by 18 per cent, three times the increase in the adult rate. Although Australia's overall unemployment rate has dropped to 8.5 per cent, which gives testimony to the Government's economic policies, the unemployment rate for teenagers is still a massive 21 per cent. Sadly, within the Illawarra-Macarthur region this figure has been estimated at 44 per cent for the 15 to 19 years age group and 37.1 per cent for the under 25 category. Notwithstanding these figures, as stated by the Sydney Morning Herald, believe it or not, the Hawke Government can rightly claim to be the first Government to tackle the issue of youth unemployment comprehensively. Initiatives such as the Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Programs have presented the Government with options to consider and policy decisions to make. But, as that Committee rightly points out, it is not reasonable to expect that problems which have been accumulating over many years can be easily eliminated. It has to be realised by politicians, bureaucrats, the community and, certainly, Australia's youth that Australia's economy is inextricably linked to the economies of other countries and that changes in technology, industry rationalisation policies and educationalopportunities for the acquisition of various skills will all affect employment opportunities in some way. Participation by youth in the community through a variety of schemes has been a notable achievement of this Government. Empty rhetoric from opponents of the Government's policies has been unable to detract from the fact that schemes such as the community youth Support scheme, the participation and equity progra-, the labour adjustment retraining arrangement and other youth training programs have achieved great success. It is a sad fact of life that, because of the trend to increasing casualisation of the work force, full time work has been difficult to get. School students effectively are depriving school leavers of either permanent part time or full time work. This increased casualisation is not because of high wages for school leavers, but rather a reflection of the extremely low wages paid to 15year-old casual workers. Studies such as those by Justice Macken in New South Wales have shown that nearly two-thirds of part time positions are held by school students. Macken's suggestion of the freeing of the penalty rates system and an increase in junior wages may help convert jobs currently held by casual workers into full time or manent part time work for school,leavers. It is fitting that 1985 has been designated national Youth Year because, as has so often been stated, the future of Australia rests with today's youth. This year provides a unique opportunity for governments, the community and the youth of Australia to work together in an atmosphere of consensus and commitment in an endeavour to come to grips with the complex nature of. the problems, desires and ambitions of today's youth. It is equally fitting that the three themes of the International Year of Youth-participation, development and peace-parallel the Australian Labor Party's own policy on youth. Issues of education, drug abuse and nuclear disarmament deserve to be discussed at length by and for today's youth so that all Australians will create for themselves a fair and just society of which they can be proud. I believe that, as a parent, I have every right to insist that my children grow up in a society which is going to reflect the norms and aspirations of this Government. 1 believe that it is this Government alone which can provide that atmosphere for my children to grow up in. I have touched on but three of the many issues of concern to my electorate and of great personal concern to me. I believe that this Government has the necessary credentials, commitment and competence to achieve great things, things that will benefit not only my electorate but also certainly Australia. My electorate certainly looks to this Government for its continued work and assistance. I am sure that my electorate will continue to support me as its member whilst ever this Government is delivering, and I am sure that this Government will continue to deliver. I thank honourable members for paying me the courtesy of listening tome.",36
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Mr Drummond)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Farrer, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies, although he may have some experience in other places.",40
91,Mr TIM FISCHER,PETITIONS,"To represent the electorate of Farrer, stretching as it does from Mount Kosciusko, through Albury and Deniliquin to the South Australian border, is, indeed, a privilege. I thank my family and friends and my electors in Farrer who extended such strong support fo- me on 1 December 1984. I also thank my National Party supporters, both in the electorate and elsewhere, including my Federal Leader, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and my Deputy Leader, per- the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt). Farrer is a diverse electorate named after the Interfamous wheat breeder, William Farrer. The electorate was originally created in 1949 and has undergone several changes to its boundaries. Under the 1984 redistribution it has perhaps become the most elongated, non-metropolitan electorate in Australia. It commences a short distance inland from the New South Wales south coast at Mount Kosciusko and then utilises the Murray River as its southern boundary for hundreds of kilometres and ends at the South Australian border, not a great distance from the suburbs of Adelaide. In the east there is some magnificent mountainous terrain with the tourist gateway points of· Tumbarumba and Khancoban.' As one moves west the mountains give way to the foothills and plains with countless thousands of hectares of rolling farmlands and rural service towns along with irrigation farms and, in the far west, grazing tracts. The national growth centre, Albury, is the largest city in the Farrer electorate and is its effective capital. Many State and Federal departments have large regional headquarters at Albury: I might add that these are staffed in the main by efficient and effective public servants who properly provide considerable liaison assistance along with .the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd, Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd and Macquarie Worsteds Ltd head the list of firms associated with the expanding industrial base. Along witp. this, equally important employment is generated through tourism in all its facets, including an expanded convention role for Albury. Outside Albury there is a series of large and small country towns battling for survival as the rural service town role contracts. The one exception is a bevy of towns along the Murray River in what I term 'the border club belt'. They are booming, particularly since the Victorian Government reaffirmed . its opposition to poker machines. There are record levels of investment in clubs and motels from Albury to Wentworth. The electorate of Farrer has had only two other representatives since it was created in 1949. I pay sincere tribute to a former Minister of the Crown and Ambassador to Holland, Sir David Fairbairn, and also to my immediate predecessor, a former Minister of the Crown, the present honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). I also pay tribute to my National Party colleague who effectively represented the western quarter of Farrer, the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), and to the former member for Hume, Stephen Lusher, for his decade of service. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Speaker on his election and also Madam Deputy Speaker on her election. I am delighted that the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond) is the Deputy Speaker on this occasion, as we .share a common town of interest. We were both brought up in the Boree Creek-Lockhart area. In many ways Australia is at the crossroads, both on the international and domestic fronts. However, this situation is not reflected in the Governor General's address. While the international front will be dealt with by many other speakers in the course of this debate, I say only that the vast majority of Australians deeply resent the U-turn in the Australian-United States of America relationship arising from a telephone call from Senator Richardson, ensconced in Japan, to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), then ensconced in Europe. Those of us who were randomly selected by this Parliament to be involved in the ugly conflict of Vietnam at times thought that, if nothing else, as one of the few Western nations fighting alongside the United States of America, we were contributing to the special nature of the relationship between Australia and America. It will take years and a change of government here to rectify the damage to our Australian-American relationship over the last month. It could be a very lonely future for Australia without a special relationship with the United States, as. we need the United States, nuclear warts and all, more than it needs us. I wish to raise four particular areas on the domestic front. Firstly, I mention the 'Murray Valley where salinity has reached a crisis situation and with it the health of many people, including the people of Adelaide. Secondly, I mention the farm sector of the economy, which is in a crucial situation, as are many of its commodities. Thirdly, I mention tourism, particularly inland tourism, which is at the crossroads. Fourthly, I mention transport in Australia which is also at a critical stage, with inefficiencies, be they in relation to air, rail or road, and with crippling fuel taxation. Before dealing in detail with these four areas let me be clear about my overall intent. My intent is not only to provide full time representation for all electors in Farrer but also to seek to better the well-being Of our nation through less government and less taxation and the encouragement of individual enterprise. I quote a former great master of this House, Robert Gordon Menzies, who said: The great race of man is that one in which each in.dividual develops his fullest individuality, in which ambition is encouraged, in which there are rewards for the courageous and the enterprising, in which there is no foolish doctrine of equality between the active and the idle. I might add that another former Prime Minister, John MCEwen, put it more bluntly. He was 'for free enterprise, against socialism': If Australia is to be in great shape in the bicentennial year of 1988, or more particularly, in the centennial year of 2001, when we celt<brate 100 years of nationhood, 100 years of our Constitution and 100 years of the existence of this Parliament, Australians must have room to breathe from the high levels of taxation and room to be enterprising initiators. The individual entrepreneur must be unfettered so that he can go forward and generate economic activity and employment. I do not rule out a safety net under the truly needy. I am the first to recognise the huge and growing numbers of have-nots, be they farmers from Balranald or Berrigan or the young unemployed of the Lavingtons and Liverpools. However, I reiterate the general philosophy that less government and less taxation will do more to provide overall advancement than opposing alternatives and options, particularly heavy-handed big government requiring even bigger taxation. I turn now to the first area I mentioned, namely, the Murray Valley and the related Murray-Darling system, which embraces, part of Queensland and large areas of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. I have to tell the House that the salinity situation there is critical. Report after report and meeting after meeting catalogues the deteriorating situation. The most recent repor-, entitled 'Salt of the Earth', by the Victorian Parliamentary Salinity Committee is a further step forward. Whilst a good deal of the salinity is naturally occurring, it is difficult to comprehend that annually around 1.1 million tonnes of salt pass in solution in the Murray River into South Australia from upstream. To this, South Australia adds another half million tonnes of salt, so that the salt load peaks in the Murray River at around 1.6 million tonnes annually. It is a chilling fact, detailed on page 46 of the report, that the water quality in the Adelaide pipeline off-takes has exceeded the World Health Organisation's long term objective maximum for drinking water. This level is 480 milligrams per litre salinity, expressed in terms of soluble salts. Whilst I appreciate that there are other factors which dilute the intensity of salinity in the Adelaide water supply, including water from additional sources, some of those nonMurray River sources are just as bad for salinity as the Murray River itself. If I lived in Adelaide I would give, up having salt as an additive. In any event, I gave up salt as an additive in October 1984-the same month as the Victorian report on salinity was published. My plea is not just for the irrigators and the people of the towns and cities along the Murray; it is for, the people of Adelaide and elsewhere. Progress is being made on combating salinity with some excellent work on interception by the River Murray Commission and other relevant New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian authorities. However, more needs to be done, and not necessarily with big ticket items costing millions of dollars. The planting of trees, the educating of irrigators and the speeding up of the responsible approach of the New South Wales rice industry and other industries to cease irrigating on leaky soils are all part of the solution. The Murray Valley League has an important role to play and will convene a forum on salinity. I will be working to see implemented the realistic recommendations of the various reports and, admittedly as a somewhat symbolic additional move, I will be seeking to see the headquarters of the River Murray Commission shifted out of Canberra, preferably to a grand location at Albury. Moving on to the second area related to the crisis in the farm sector, I point out that the NationaiFarmers Federation and farmers in general are not crying wolf at present. There is a notion around that somehow the farm sector will survive, that seasonal conditions are cyclical and will improve along with commodity prices and all will be well, particularly following the fall in the value of the dollar. It is not possible, due to time, to deal with each commodity situation such as milk, beef, wheat, sugar, dried fruits and rice. But on an overall basis it is a fact that a cost and price squeeze is destroying the viability of farming, notwithstanding vaiiant and successful attempts to lift farm' productivity. The farming sector productivity cow has been milked dry. Without cost reductions or, alternatively, price increases, farmers in their hundreds, if not thousands, will go.to the wall. Nobody wants subsidy for subsidy's sake as a solution, but farmers are entitled to a fair go, with better marketing, long-term low interest finance, a review of taxa tion on fuel and other key farm cost items and, in general, a sensitive approach by government at all levels to hold and bring about proper policies and priorities. If the city commuter or the suburban parliamentarian feels that all of this is too much, may I remind the House that it was the breaking of the drought and the vast improvement in the rural sector of the economy that led this country out of the then recession, and ,all Australians can be thankful for that. The dairy industry is currently in a hiatus and deserves special mention. I acknowledge the need exists to gain co-operation from the various State governments and this requirement has delayed the action of the Federal Government thus far; but I also suspect there are other reasons for the delay. I am advised that a senior officer of the Federal Department of Primary Industry has said that some 5,000 dairy farmers across the nation will have to leave the industry. It would be very wrong for the turmoil in the dairy industry to be allowed to continue to help pave the way for this and I reiterate my support for the Australian Dairy Industry Conference amended national marketing plan, as this is the correct approach and any outbreak of interstate milk war will, in the long term, be devastating for all dairy farmers. I turn now to the question of tourism and the need to further boost tourism in Australia, with reference to the inland areas. To a large extent, there is a lack of realisation that there are'many family-oriented, low-cost tourist activities available across inland Australia. Whilst these activities relate to locations which do not enjoy the same degree of exotic attraction as coastal areas and overseas, they nevertheless help complement and balance the tourist resources available in this country. The activities and locations to which I refer range from climbing Mount Kosciusko, which I did recently to visit the easternmost point of my electorate and familiarise myself with the Kosciusko National Park, to canoeing down the Murray River or hiring houseboats near the confluence of the Darling and Murray Rivers at Wentworth. Obviously there are many more activities which can be pursued across inland Australia and considerable progress has been made in further developing tourism. ' However, one of the critical problems is high penalty rates for weekend work. These high penalty rates, applicable across large sections of the tourist industry, bring about additional costs for tourists odewer services being available for tourists on public holidays and weekends. Even the Federal Minister for tourism at one stage indicated his concern about this issue, but the, problem still remains and is seriously hampering the tremendous boost for the tourist industry throughout Australia. I am certain that if there were a trial period of. two years allowing more flexible cQntract-related award rates in the tQurist industry,' with expanded provisiQn' fQr YQuth awards, many more jQbs WQuid be created in the tQurist industry and related service industries. The bQnus WQuid be that these jQbs WQuid be in decentralised lQcatiQns acrQSS Australia and I urge the GQvernment to. press Qn with expanding tQurism in Australia. I refer to. the fQurth and final area Qf transPQrt being at the, crossrQads. Part Qf the problem relates to. the level Qf fuel taxatiQn currently being applied in Australia by the Federal GQvernment in particular, but also. by State gQvernments with the Qne exceptiQn Qf Queensla,nd, where no. State fuel tax levy exists. FQr every dQllar spent Qn fuel, the average level Qf taxatiQn nQW exceeds 54c. The breakdown is: CQmmQnwealth excise, approximately 19c; Federal rQyalties, approximately 2c; CQmmQnwealth crude Qillevy, now 27c; and, in the case Qf New SQuth Wales, the State fuel tax levy, 7c. That is a tQtal nQW Qf 55c in the dQllar in taxatiQn in respect Qf every dQllar spent Qn fuel. This level Qf fuel taxatiQn is particularly crippling to. thQse people and thQse industries with no. access to. subsidised public transPQrt. It is a, massive burden Qn people in CQUntrY Australia, including people living in the prQvincial cities, especia,lly thQse families who. have to. run twp vehicles because there is simply no. CQmmuter transPQrt available to. get,tQ and from wQrk. This wQuld nQt be so. difficult to. put up with if all Qr mQst Qf the fuel taxatiQn Was being returned to. building a better transPQrt system with better roads and bridges. HQwever, gQvernments Qf all PQlitical persuasiQns are guilty Qf ensuring that this is nQt the case and currently SQme 78 per cent Qf taxatiQn CQllected from fuel is returned to. CQnsQlidated Revenue. It is desirable that the fQrthcQming summit Qn taxatiQn shQuldlQQk carefully at the whQle package Qf taxatiQn aSSQCiated with fuel in Australia, with a particular Qbjective Qf reviewing that PQrtiQn Qfthe taxatiQn which is nQt being returned to. roads. It shQuld also. lQQk at the anQmaly relating to. primary prQducers Qn the averaging system. Perhaps it is a little unfashiQnable, but I also. reiterate my strong supPQrt fQr the future rQle Qf the railway mQde Qf transPQrt,admittedly ih a mQdernised fQrm. It is exciting to. learn that in the CQurse Qf 10 years in the United States, the cQnsQlidated gQvernment-Qwned CQnrail CQrpQratiQn has mQved back into. the black and dramatically increased freight tQnnages. Sadly, Amtrak, the equivalent American passenger rail cQrpQratiQn, has nQt made it into. the black, but parts Qf its QPeratiQn are prQfitable and SQme, but nQt all, United States rail QperatiQn lessQns shQuld be applied to. the Australian scene. The mQst impQrtant transPQrt cQrridQr in Australia is SydneyCanberra-ALbury-MeLbQurne. It is the Qnly cQrridQr that enjQys the throughput created by having cities Qf mQre than three milliQn people at either end. It is my belief that we shQuld be pLanning ahead fQr the centennial year Qf 2001. It was a bitter disapPQintment to. see the exciting prQPQsal prepared by Dr Paul Wild Qf the CQmmQnweaLth Scientific and Industrial Research OrganisatiQn fQr a TGV - type super-train syst-m between, Sydney and MeLbQurne rejected befQre it had, really seen the light Qf day Qr been prQperly investigate,d.

92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Mr Drummond)BefQre I call the honourable member fQr CapricQrnia, I remind the HQuse that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the HQuse to. extent to. him the usual cQurtesies.",43
93,Mr WRIGHT,PETITIONS,"As is the traditiQn, Mr Deputy Speaker, I jQin Qther members in cQngratulating Mr Speaker and Madam Deputy Speaker Qn their re-electiQn to.' their high and honourable Qffices in this Parliament. The electorate of Capricornia, since its creation in 190 I, has been represented by parliamentarians who have served this House and their constituencies with dedication .and in some cases with distinction. I consider myself fortunate to have known three of the previous Labor members on a close personal basis. The Hon. Frank Forde, who, like myself, was also a State member for Rockhampton, held many and varied positions in this Parliament, including that of Prime Minister of Australia. During his 25 years in Federal politics, from 1922 to 1946, he never wavered from his commitment to people or to his country, and that commitment remained with h-m until his recent passing. George Henry Gray entered Federal politics in 1961 when he recaptured Capricornia for the Australian Labor Par- after it had been almost 16 years in non-Labor hands. His untimely death in 1967 was a great personal loss to me, for it was through his encouragement and support that I joined the ALP and embarked on a cateer in politics. It is, however, to George Gray's successor and my predecessor that I wish to pay a particular and special tribute. The Hon. Dr Douglas Nixon Everingham, Federal member for Capricornia from 1967 to 1975 and from 1977 to 1984, and Minister for Health in the Whitlam Labor Government, should never be forgotten by this House. He deserves special recognition for his contribution to humanity, not just as a parliamentarian, as a Minister and as a doctor, but moreover as a human being whose care and concern for others was always placed above his own ambitions, his own popularity and sometimes his own political preservation. .Doug Everingham's electoral support transcended party-political boundaries, and I am indeed conscious of the personal challenge before me as I endeavour to emulate his 16 years of service to his electorate, to the Australian community and to mankind generally. I take this opportunity to place on record the thanks and appreciation of the people of central Queensland for a job well done and to wish both Doug and his wife Beverly a most satisfying retirement. It was my intention to use this, my maiden speech, to canvass a number of issues which are of personal concern to me, including the, problems, confronting Australian seamen on the Australian National Line, the alarming drug problem in our nation and other matters affecting the State of Queensland, caused mainly by the incompetence· and misguided policies of the National Party State Government. However, as there is a 20 minute limit on speeches, I intend to raise these issues greater length at another time during the session. As a former State parliamentarian, it is appropriate for me to make an observation about our system of federalism. During my 15t years in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, I saw this system in operation at close quarters-sometimes, I might add, being left aghast and amazed at how the principle of federalism could' be misinterpreted, manipulated and blatantly twisted to suit the political advantage of the Bjelke-Petersen Government. But, setting that aside, I readily acknowledge the importance of the States within the Federal structure and I am cognisant of the role played by State governments and; in turn, local authorities in ensuring that the decision making process operates on a more decentralised, people-oriented basis. However, I also recognise that more and more in today's society, there are matters which, in the interests of Australians as a whole, are better dealt with at the national level, irrespective of the fact that traditionally the relevant area of administration might come within the pu'rview of the States. I direct my remarks specifically to the issue of consumer product safety as it relates particularly to the recall of unsafe goods. This issue is of fundamental importance to every Australian consumer-to every man, woman and child in the nation. Product safety is a matter of life, death and possible lasting injury. Yet, despite its broad and vital significance for the community, there has been limited action taken in the. legislative chambers of this land to alleviate and redress the numerous problems that have arisen in the Australian market-place because of the retailing of defective and dangerous products. I doubt that any member of this House would deny the right of consumers to be .able to buy goods which are safe and which do not pose a threat to their lives or health. Every Australian has the right t9 expect that products put on the market are adequateiy safe under conditions of normal use and/or foreseeable misuse, and cert-inly people have the right to expect that they will not be unreasonably exposed to any hazard to their life or health. Product safety has been addressed in part by the Parliament and by those of the States, but there is little uniformity in administration and there is, in my view, a serious shortcoming in what the relevant laws seek to achieve.' I take the Trade Practices Act as an example. The objective of this legislation is to prevent unsafe goods from being sold on the Australian market. This is done by a series of product safety standards, many of which have been develat oped through the excellent work of the Standards Association of Australia. However, despite this legislation, despite the work of government agencies and despite supervision by the majority of manufacturers, defective and dangerous products are still reaching the shop shelves' and are being bought by unsuspecting Australian consumers. Legislatures, Federal, State andlerritorial, have the power to ban an unsafe product, but being able to ban is not enough. A product banned from sale under the Trade Practices Act is not necessarily recalled; nor is the public necessarily warned of the danger. The same applies under State and Territory laws and, as far as I am aware, no banned product in this nation has ever been recalled. Even though the power exists to ban the sale of unsafe goods, nowhere in Australia is there the power to recall those goods. The failure of this Parliament and of the States to develop an effective recall procedure for defective products has existed for too long and must not be allowed to continue. I welcome the attention and the excellent coverage that has been given' to this issue by the Age newspaper and encourage that newspaper in its endeavours to develop a public awareness of this problem. I welcome also the recent undertaking by the Federal Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, in his capacity as Minister responsible for consumer affairs, to raise the concept of a national consumer product safety commission at the May meeting of the nation's Ministers for Consumer Affairs. The problem of recalling unsafe goods is, however, not a new one. In 1978 Senator Gietzelt spoke on this issue in another place and since then there has been much discussion and deliberation by Ministers at the various levels of government, but regrettably there has been little positive or effective legislative, action. In the Press release of 16 September 1983 the Standing Committee of Ministers for Consumer Affairs 'expressed strong concern that although the Commonwealth, most States and territories, had legislation giving power to ban unsafe products, there was presently no legal power to compel the recall of banned products'. That was 18 months ago. Those Ministers clearly realised the shortcomings of the law but nothing has been done to rectify the situation. In the United States there has been national mandatory redl.lliegislation since 1972, and some of the States took action even as far back as 1906. In the United States, manufacturers know that if their product is found to be hazardous, a certain procedure must be followed to ensure that the product comes off the market and that the public is immediately warned of the danger. In Australia, there is no such requirement. In this country there is even great difficulty in getting agreement as to what is a safety related defect. One government authority may act against a product but there is no guarantee that others will follow suit. A State by State comparison chart was published last week by the Age of more than 50 products which had been banned by a government somewhere in Australia. Not one of the products listed has been banned across the nation despite the danger to life or health and the risk of injury and many have been banned by only a minority of authorities. For example, the Magic Water Snake, containing water contaminated with human sewage, was. banned only in Queensland. The Grazyfoam, an inflammable aerosol bath foam for children, was banned only in New South Wales. The Espree Magwheel Cleaner, which contains a hazardous concentration of hydrofluoric acid, was banned only in South Australia. Swimming pool skimmer boxes shaped like a child's potty, but which could disembowel children if sat upon, were banned only in New South Wales. The World's Cutest Doll, the head' of which is easily detached, revealing a long metal spike, was banned only in Western Australia. The Gen Bag, a portable container used for the emergency transport of fuel, but found to be unsafe for that purpose, was banned only in Victoria. Sesame Street Jewellery, containing a high lead content, was banned only in Western Australia. Tasmania is the only State to have banned a baby rattle which incorporates a series of steel prongs. The Trade Practices Commission is the only body to have banned an electric shock attache case which gives more than the thief a volt. Only the Northern Territory and Tasrnania have acted against a brand of wire disc paint stripper which can break up, causing injury to the user. There are 30 other products which have been found to be dangerous but which have been banned by three or fewer of the State, Commonwealth and Territory authorities. Regrettably, products declared unsafe in one State can quite legally remain on the market in another State. A recent example of this was 'the Magic Egg'. This product was promoted as a 'wonder growing pet', and consisted of small plastic toys which expanded up to 10 times their size when immersed in water. I need to say little more about the danger the toys posed to children when swallowed. It was banned first in the Australian Capital Territory and later by the Trade Practices Commission, then in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia; but it is still able to be sold in Queensland, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. It is not unknown for manufacturers faced with a ban on their product in one State to dump it in another until the system catches up with it. I believ- there is too much reliance on self-regulation by manufacturers, too much reliance on llelfimposed but basically unenforceable codes of conduct and too much reliance on the hope that the manufacturers' sense of responsibility will overcome commercial considerations. I appreciate that most manufacturers are responsible and that they take every step 'to warn the public of any possible danger. I know also of manufacturers who are not so responsible. I know of those who cannot recall their products even if they want to. A tragic example of this was the case of the salami-salmonella outbreak in 1981. Because the manufacturer did not have any way of identifying the defective product, or knowing to whom it was sold; it was not possible to mount a recall and great suffering followed with more than 200 people across Australia being hospitalised. The market-place must also contend with the rogue operators who an- not bound by any code of conduct except self-interest and who are a threat to consumers and also to responsible manufacturers. Equally, of course, there are some very large corporations which have allowed commercial considerations, or what I call their cash register consciences, to overcome their social responsibilities and which pay no more than lip service to recails. I support this claim with the June 1980 report on tyre safety by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. Paragraph 157 of that report said: It is concluded that one Australian tyre manufacturer acted irresponsibly in not recalling'tyres produced in the initial stages of its steel-belted manufacturers knew were failing at an unacceptably high rate and were thus placing many people ,at risk. There have also been instances where there have been unacceptable delays between the discovery of the defect and the warning to the public. For example, a distributor of Ducati motorcycles took 2 months grudgingly to agree to replace the alloy wheels on those machines, d-pite the public revelation that the wheels were collapsing. In 1981, even after considerable pr:essure from the Australian Automobile Association, it took the Ford company seven months to notify the public of a fault in its Cortina models made between 1971 and 1974. The fault was a carburettor fitting which sometimes allowed the fuel line to loosen and spray fuel over the engine, resulting in an unusually high number of under-bonnet fires. Ford rejected the request for a recall of the 40,000 vehicles involved but finally placed notices in newspapers referring to a special field action that the company was undertakin- on these cars. This is just one instance where manufacturers have used any other word but the word 'recall'-an,instance where the public had no indication of the fact that the car might have some safety related defect. There are also the hidden recalls. In the case of the Volvo company in 1981, the cars were not recalled; instead the owners of a particular model were invited to bring their cars in for inspection. As well as the hidden recalls, there are also those which are tucked away in the classifieds section of the major dailies-the buried recalls, ilS I call them. One notorious example of this was in relation to a baby thermal feeding bowl-a bowl which, if a certain part was removed, could choke or scald the child. The advertisement placed by the manufacturer measured only four centimetres deep by one column, wide-about the size of a postage stamp. I do not believe in government regulation for its own sake. If self-regulation works, I prefer it that way. But self-regulation in this field of product safety has failed, and there are many responsible bodies and organisations that clearly concur with that opinion. The Standing Committee of Cone sumer Affairs Ministers said of voluntary recall codes: They appeared often to have been honoured more in the breach than in the observance. The National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council in its 1984 report said: There is a demonstrated need for some form of government regulation of product recall in Australia. The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations said recently: radial production which the There is no way of monitoring if producers are adhering to their codes or not, and companies outside industry associations are not controlled even by voluntary codes. It went on to say: Voluntary recall codes are deficient and offer little or no protection to consumers, AFCO went on to say: A mandatory recall code must be introduced under which products must be recalled within a specified minimum time of being found dangerous. In 1981 the Victorian Consumer Affairs Council advocated recall legislation, and as long ago as 1974 the National Committee of Inquiry on Compensation and Rehabilitation in Australia recommended: There should be provision to order the manufacturer to recall, repair, replace, or provide a refund for a defective or dangerous product. It also recommended that such a law should be a Federal, not a State, law. The Committee of Inquirysaid: ,Safety is a national concern and the manufacture, sale and distribution of products is not and cannot be confined within state boundaries. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety recommended inter alia that the Governmentintroduce legisl-tion to require the recall of defective or unsafe products. That was in June 1980. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, of which Australia is a member, has also recommended that member nations legislate or act, firstly, to ensure that consumers are 'Yarned without delay of products which present a substantial and severe hazard and, secondly, to enable unsafe products to be recalled. When considering this matter, it is necessary for honourable members to understand that Australia has developed as a national market and that only one statute should deal with the recall of goods. Moreover, where safety is involved the ability to take urgent action is essential and this cannot always be achieved with seven different laws. There is growing and widespread recognition of the need for mandatory product recall procedures to deal with the situation where there is a safety related defect. Why then, I ask; is it so difficult to make progress in Australia? I suggest the reason stems from a reluctance on the part' of this Parliament, regardless of who has occupied the treasury bench, to act for fear of upsetting the States and Territories and of being accused of encroaching on their traditional legislative domain within our Federal structure. It is an understandable attitude, but it is no longer acceptable-certainly not to me. The issue of product safety and the recall of hazardous goods is, as I have demonstrated, a problem of national dimension. It is a problem that calls for a national response, not just a patchwork approach by interested State legislatures. It calls for positive national leadership by this Parliament. There is an urgency for this Parliament to act to guarantee that product safety exists in the market place by ensuring not only that dangerous goods are banned but also that a mandatory warning and recall procedure or code exists-a procedure which can be implemented quickly and which can be enforced Australia wide. It is my hope that this, the Thirty-fourth Australian Parliament, will mark a new era for consumerism in this country and that through its legislative efforts a swift end will be put to the prevailing practice of hazardous' products continuing to be sold in the market place despite the exposure, despite the condemnation, and despite the banning by responsible authorities.",43
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Before I call the honourable member for Moncrieff, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",47
95,Mrs SULLIVAN,PETITIONS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In common with several other speakers this afternoon, whilst this is my maiden speech in this place, and for the electorate of Moncrieff, I am now not new to the forms of parliament. However, I am delighted that you are in the chair for my maiden speech and I ask you to convey to the Speaker and to the Deputy Speaker - y congratulation- on their - lection to their posItions and my hope that I WIll serve in this place for a long time, perhaps in their company. I have had the opportunity to serve the people of Queensland in the Australian Senate for 10 years but I am particularly delighted that the people of Mon.crieff have given me this opportumty to serve In the house of government in the national Parliament. I take this opportunity, as is traditional in maiden speeches, to convey my thanks 'to'those people and to some others. My thanks go to Liberal Party supporters in Moncrieff, who showed incredible dedication to the cause of the Liberal Party winning the seat. I th-nk my Liberal Senate and House of Representatives colleagues who gave me guidance and persona.1 support throughout the campaign, and in partIcular the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron), a former member for the electorate of Fadden, and the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr White), both of whom, as Liberal members of the House of Representatives have represented those areas which now make up the new Feder;l electorate of Moncrieff. I thank my husband for his personal and practical support as he underwent the experience for the first time of the hurly-burly of an Australian election campaign. I pay special tribute and convey special thanks to my parliamentary leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), for the leadership he gave to the Liberal Party in the election campaign and to all its can-idates, myself included, particularly because of hIS personal support on two occasions in the electorate of Moncrieff. I believe that it was his unswerving faith in the principles and policies of the Liberal Party and his unflagging energy and enthusiasm for the task in hand that lead us to the success we had. He certainly made a major contribution to my success, for which.! shall always be grateful. Not only am I making my maiden speech as the member for Moncrieff but also I have the great privilege of being the first member for that new Federal electorate. I congratulate the Australian Electoral Commission for its decision to honour Gladys Moncrieff in this way. She was a great Australian and one of its most truly loved Born in Bundaberg in 1896, she, unlike the daughters of many parents in those days, was supported by her parents in her ambition to have a stage career. She was 'also supported by people of the community from which she departed-that is, Townsville-to make her name in Sydney. She was highly successful in vaudeville and with the encouragement of, amongst other people, another great Australian, Dame Nellie Melba, joined J. C. Williamson's where she had a very successful career in musical comedy. It was in 1921, at the age of 30, that she first played the role of Teresa in Maid of the Mountains and she was known forever afterwards to all Australians as 'Our Glad'. Shewas a smash hit in this role and in her lifetime gave more than 3,000 performances of it. While she was successful in many other roles, that is the one with which she has always been most closely identified. She had successful visits to Britain, New Zealand and South Africa but, while she received cri,tical acclaim in those countries, by her own choice &he chose to stay in Australia for her entire career rather than seek international fame. She did many things in her lifetime but she will be remembered for coming out of retirement to visit New Guinea to sing to Australian troops during World War II and for touring cities and country towns throughout Australia in support of the war effort. She came out of retirement once more to go to Korea when Australian troops were sent there and, in fact, she was the first Australian entertainer to visit Korea to lift the morale of Australian troops involved in those hostilities. her support of Australian troops in theatres of war she was awarded the OBE. She was famous for, amongst other things, her numerous retirements. She tried to retire. on many occasions but the Australian public just did not want to let her go because they treasured her sweet voice and personality. Finally, in 1963 at the age of 71 years, she tired to the Isle of Capri on the Gold Coast. Whilst she might have enjoyed a well earned retirement, she also enjoyed promoting the Gold Coast and tourism, its great industry. Canal boats that took tourists through the waterways of the Gold Coast used to detour through the canal on which her home was built and she would frequently appear to greet those on the boats. She is well loved and remembered on the Gold Coast for that and for her personal support of the tourism industry. She died in 1978 at the age of 84 years and she was mourned widely. Many feltthat her death was a loss to the Australian family. I will leave my final word on her to a quotation from citizens. the book 100 Famous Australian Lives: Someone once described Gladys Moncrieff's career as a long love affair between an actress and an entire nation. But perhaps that is incorrect in one detail. Nearly aIJ love affairs have ups and downs-the rough with the smooth. But for Gladys Moncrieff, once she had captured the hearts of a whole country, there were never any failings out of favour. The Australian general public loved 'our Glad' fiercely from the time she first came to their attention ... . The electorate of Moncrieff is very large-over 3,000 square kilometres-varied arid very fast growing. It has an annual increase in population of between 30 and 40 per cent per annum. It comprises parts of three local authorities-the Beaudesert and Albert shires and Gold Coast City. As I have mentioned, it was' previously part of the old electorates of MCPherson and Fadden. It is very rich in resourceS, both physical and human. Amongst its physical resources are fertile land and great natural beauty. That land supports the major rural industrieS of beef, dairying, sugar and sm-ll crops, and the area is a major centre in Australia for growing rhubarb and avocados. Its natural beauty is well known. It is famous for its beaches and waterways of the Gold Coast and the well mountains and national parks of Tamborine and the Queensland-New South Wales border. But to these great riches have come human resources and it is noteworthy that there is a very high concentration of small entrepreneurs throughout the electorate. The, small entrepreneurs have built the Gold Coast to what it is today-the premier tourist resort in the Australia. Tourism on the Gold Coast has been For built up by small business people and therefore those things that affect small business very much affect it. In recent years major hotel corporations have also established themselves imd are continuing to establish themselves on the Gold Coast but the region's source, its backbone and continuing prosperity will depend on the small person. Farmers also utilising the rich natural resources of rethe soil are small business people. They are important particularly in the Beaudesert area of the electorate. Unlike many country towns of Australia, Beaudesert is growing and prospering. I know from my time representing Queensland in the Senate that that is not a general story about country towns these days. Too many are stagnating or sliding back, wondering about their future, but the future of this area is assured. The third major centre of population is Beenleigh, which was previously a small country town. Sugar is still amajor industry there; nevertheless Beenleigh has been caught up in the urban sprawl of Brisbane and is rapidly becoming a satellite of that city. I might say that the major industry in Beenleigh is people and it has a great future. However, my electorate does have problems. Its principal problem is the Hawke Government. The last election saw a 2 per cent swing against Labor and also a substantial swing against the Australian Democrats. Before the Labor Party retreats in its thinking and chooses to put that fact into the pigeon-hole labelled 'informal' I would like to iriform the House that I personally examined the recounted 'informal vote in MoncriefI'. I can state as a fact that the electorate was confused by the change of voting system. A large number of those informal votes showed just the figure '1' against a candidates' name. I am sure that the people who voted that way believed that they had voted formally because voting in that manner constituted a formal vote for the Senate. However, that type of informal vote was split 50-50 between the Labor Party and the coa:lition parties. There was no particular disadvantage to the Labor Party in the informal vote in Moncrieff. The swing against it and the swing to the coalition parties were genuine indications of disillusionment on behalf of the electorate and a growing apprehension at the future of this country under the Hawke Government. That disillusionment stemmed from the contrast between promises and performance' of the Hawke Government. The growing apprehension ,stems from the effect of policies it had alre-dy enacted which reduce individual choice in this country and which people fear are leading to irrevocable changes in our way of life. An, outstanding feature of the population of Moncrieff is that it has a very high proportion of retirees and very young people. The extremes of age groups are very high in proportion to the total population. I will mention during my speech some matters that particularly impinge on those age groups but I want also to talk about some other matters that concern me as.l know they concern the people whom I represent. It is fortunate for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that he did not keep his 1983 election promise to serve his full term. I have no doubt at all that, in the light of the 'MX missile affair and the response to it that I have had within my electorate, had the Prime Minister delayed the election until May this year this Government would have been out on its ear. So shortly after its re-election it has shown its Achilles heel, its inability to deal resolutely with things which are of extreme national significance. There are ongoing issues and there will be issues in the future which will lead to a steady erosion of support for the Labor Party. I believe that at the next election this Government will be out and there will be a return of the Liberal-National Party coalition. As this Government continues in office and as more of its policies are implemented people will have a growing awareness-they had only the beginning of an awareness in the last election-of what a Labor Government means. As this Government steadily implements its truly socialist objectives while speaking softly and wearing velvet gloves, nevertheless the electorate knows what is happening because people are affected. A classic case, probably more pointed in Queensland thari in other States, nevertheless relevant in other States, has been the introduction of Medicare, the classic two-card trick. It costs more and you get less. It costs more because of the levy and the fact that those who still choose to insure themselves privately are paying far higher rates, together with losing tax deductibility for the rates that they pay. I am sure that it carne as a rude shock to people in February last year when they made the necessary readjustments to their health insurance to discover that there was to be no gap insurance. I, along with many other members of parliament, received many inquiries and complaints about the inability of people to have something that they had before. Previously, those who chose to insure themselves privately could choose the percentage of their insurance. Having lost medical insurance rights they now find that they will get only 85 per cent of the scheduled rebate fee. Many of them asked why. Why indeed! Why would it matter to a government whether people ' had insurance in this basic area of need-health care? It should not matter at all to the finances of the Government if people choose to do that. But that is a decision that was made in line with socialist objectives. This Government's objectives in relation to our health scheme are no secret: We do not want the British health scheme. We do riot want to see happening in Australia what has happened in Britain-a perfectly good and outstanding health scheme reduced in so many'areas. We have had a good health scheme for many years. If this Government truly consulted the people of Australia and stated what its ultimate objectives in the health area were I am sure that it would be roundly rejected on that base if on none other. Another area which affects the very high number of retirees that I have in my electorate-it does not affect just them; it affects all peoplehas been the Government's move in the areas of superannuation taxation and the assets test. The most profound thing that one can do to affect people's behaviour throughout their lives is to structure or influence their expectations about their retirement. People, throughout their lives, work and plan for that time of their lives when they will no longer work, either because they do not want to or because they cannot. They make economic and behavioural decisions throughout their lives in line with those expectations. I ask as I did in relation to Medicare: Why would the Government have initiated this move on taxation of lump sum superannuation? It is known that there is virtually no immediate benefit to the Government in terms of taxation revenue. It is estimated that it will take at least 10 years before the full effect of revenue from this flows into the Government's coffers and becomes significant. Why then would a government risk unpopularity by this sort of move?It is, because it has long t-rm objectives. Those objectives are in line with the action it has taken on the assets test. It intends to structure and limit Australians' options in retirement. It suits socialist governments for citizens not to be independent of them and not to have rights·of choice. It suits governments to have them dependent on bureaucracy and government directive because then government can limit options. The more limit there is and the more effective it is the cheaper it gets for government. Truly, those who have been affected by these two measures and those who will be affected have very good reason for apprehension at the introduction of a capital gains tax and estate duties. These are two more taxes of the same kind. They limit people's choices, they limit their rights, they limit their horizons and, ine-itably, they limit their behaviour throughout their lives. If people believe that it is better .to spend rather than invest because they will only be penalised-that is a comment that has been made to me by plenty of people as I have travelled around my electorate and around Australia-we will have a very different sort of Australia in 20 years time. I believe that nobody would have voted for this Government in 1983 or 1984 if he or she had truly' understood this . The plight of the young is a matter that is canvassed frequently and I am sure that it will be Cllnvassed in the future. Time will not permit me to say very much on this matter. The statement in the Governor General's Speech relating to education participation is one of the greatest frauds of all times. I am pleased that none of the Government speakers has chosen to refer to it. Whilst the Government announced that it was going to increase the number of people participating in tertiary education it did not give those tertiary institutions the resources they needed to provide that number of places. It is nonsense for the Government to say to universities, colleges and technical colleges that they must tak<;: so many more students but with only a marginal increase in funding, and then tp qlaim that one has done one's best to increase participation. It does not wash and the figures will show that. The alternative would be a lowering of standards. It will be interesting to see whether Professor Peter Karmel has any comment to make on that aspect of standards in education in Australia in the report he is due to give to the Government, according to the Governor General's Speech. For many young people the Community Employment Program has been a tragic let down. This Government has created a bucket and shovel brigade. It has set up CEP projects in my electorate using antiquated methods that I had not seen in my lifetime. Far from giving to young people some skills that they could offer to employers, because of the artificial requirements for labour intensity all we are giving them is temporary and tantalising employment. We are not giving them skills that ernployers truly need. Finally, I refer to the frauds that are being perpetrated in the primary industry area. The sugar and dairy industrieS are two very large industries in my electorate. They are two highly significant rural industries in Australia. I very much doubt that the sugar farmers will ever be sweet-talked by this Prime Minister again. He has' done it, twice and they have seen nothing for their conversations and conferences with him. It appears that the dairying industry problems now move towards resolution, no thanks at all to the Hawke Government. In view of the great public expectations that the Australian people had of the Hawke Government when they first elected it, it is sad that those expectations have been dashed. There were some fine words iIi the Governor General's Speech. I am sure the Prime Minister will continue to offer us fine words; both in this forum and in other places throughout Australia. However, this Government will be judged on its deeds, not on its words, and that will lead to its inevitable failure.",47
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Mr Drummond)Before I call the honourable member fOf Dobell, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",50
97,Mr LEE,PETITIONS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your election to the office of Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. I hope that you will convey my congratulations to the .Speaker and Chairman of Committees. I am sure that you will all discharge your responsibilities with great distinction. On 1 December 1984, a clear majority of Australians cast their votes for the Australian Labor Party. A clear and sizable majority of Australians voted to endorse the Hawke Government's mandate for continued economic recovery and reconstruction. As the Australian Labor Party's candidate, I had the honour, on 1 December 1984, of being elected the first member for Dobell. As all honourable members would be aware, this new electorate has been named after Australia's greatest portrait painter, Sir William Dobell., In the words of his biographer, James Gleeson, this is what portraiture was to Dobell. Portraiture was a serious study in which he attempted with all the honesty, sensitivity and technical skill at his command to wrestle into paint the personality that lay within. William Dobell lived at Wangi for 30 years. While working at Eraring power station I had the pleasure of meeting many of Bill Dobell's neighbours and friends. They all recalled his humility and friendship. Following the December election, I attended my first meeting of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in the Government party room in this building. After observing that two of Dobell's greatest portraits', the Billy Boy and the Cement Worker, dominate one wall of the party room, I can only conclude that the good jUdgment of the Labor Caucus extends to art as well as to government administra tion. Prior to the 1984 redistribution, the constituents of the electorate of Dobell were represented by three distinguished members of this House. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), who now serves his country ,as Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, represented most of the electorate of Dobell during his 15 years in the ijHouse of Representatives. His reputation on the central coast as a hard workinglo-al member is well deserved. The honourable  believe, be remembered as Australia's mostenergetic and reformist Minister for Transport since the Second World War. Both the honourable member for Robertson and the honourable member for Shortland have represented me in this House as my Federal member. However, lowe a different debt to my friend the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). The honourable member gave me,' and many thousands of other students, a thorough grounding in economics and Australian economic history. If the many speeches in this chamber of the honourable member for Charlton continue to be u,nsuccessful in educating members of the Opposition, I am prepared to provide the Liberal Party of Australia with a copy R. J. Brown's, Student Economics. I am sure that, with study, their standard of debate will improve. I am happy to acknowledge the assistance and advice these three colleagues have given me in recent days. I come to this House at the comparatively young age of 27. I express to my family and friends on the central coast and in Cronulla my thanks for the help and assistance they have given to me over many years. I also thank the many hundreds of Labor Party members and supporters who worked so tirelessly during the' election campaign. Without their help I would not be standing here today. I know that the second Hawke Government will continue to work to fulfil their hopes and dreams for a better Australia. In 1972,13 years ago, Australia's Prime Minister was Sir William MCMahon. At that time the Liberal-Country Party coalition had been in power for 23 consecutive years. When our sportsmen and women were presented medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics, God Save the Queen was played as the Australian flag was raised. At that time, Australian troops were fighting in Vietnam. Young men were being conscripted for military service before they were eligible to vote. In 1972, Australia's foreign policy wa- subservient to that of the United States of America. The age pension paid to senior citizens was a miserly 20.3 per cent of average weekly earnings. In October 1972 I joined the Cronulla Branch of the Australian Labor Party, mainly because its Federai Leader was Gough Whitlam. In the policy speech Gough Whitlam delivered at the Blacktown Civic Centre in November 1972, he stated that one of his aims was 'to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons of the Australian people'. One of the greatest achievements of the Whitlam Government was to place urban and regional development on the nation's agenda; On 16 August 1970, Gough Whitlam outlined the Australian Labor Party's policy in this area in these words: Inequality in Aust-alia is more publ;,? than privilte. A family's standard of living is determined much more by where they live than by what they earn. The inequalities between regions are now far greater than any between States, and indeed greater than they ever were between States. In developing regions the inequalities and the burdens are growing. The areas with the greatest needs are precisely those 'with the least resources. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was set up to advise the Commonwealth on the fairest way to help the smaller States provide services equal to those of the larger States, The Commission should now be asked to recommend the amount of Commonwealth, assistance required to remove the inequalities in servicing our developing suburbs and regions. If today Federal funding to local government were reviewed on that basis the local councils within the electorate of Dobell would rank as some of the most deprived in this coilntry. This has been brought about by twb factors: firstly, the area is growing rapidly. Since 1976, Wyong shire, which covers most of my electorate, has had an annual population increase of 8 per cent. Development in new areas has not been accompanied by the provision of essential community facilities, such as adequate roads, community halls, child care centres and sewerage reticulation. Secondly, our region includes a large number of underprivileged people. Unemployment is over 20 per cent, which is nearly twice the Stat7average. In the northern Sydney region of the New South Wales Department of Education, which extends from Sydney Harbour Bridge to the northern boundary of my electorate, 11 schools are considered to be disadvantaged under the assisted schools progra,m. Everyone of those schools is on the central coast and eight are within the electorate of Dobell. The social consequences of this region's deprivation is illustrated by the following two examples: Firstly, Wyong shire has the greatest number of individual juvenile cases in the north-east Sydney region. In 1980, 18 per cent of the total number of juvenile cases involved children from Wyong shire-I repeat 18 per centyet the shire's population is only 8 per cent of the region's population. Secondly, the percentage of people separated, divorced or widowed in Wyong shire at the time of the 1981 census was 12.6 per cent-l t times the New South Wales average. Local councils within the electorate of Dobell cannot continue to increase revenue by raising rates without severely penalising many people on low incomes. I represent an area where, for the reason I have explained previously, local government has been unable to provide the services and facilities 'for which it is responsible. Local govern,ment in my electorate is in desperate need of increased funding. In my opinion, the national government has a responsibility to increase funding to local government in developing areas. On 28 May 1979, the Commonwealth Grants Commission presented the then Minister for Administrative Services, the Hon. John MCLeay, with a special report on financial assistance for Local government. This report presented the Fraser Government with five options, including a proposal to allocate funding to local government on the basis of need. The Grants Commission recommended that the Government determine, as a matter of policy, which of the options it wished the Commission to adopt. As in so many areas of government administration, the Liberals refused to make a decision. I admit that sometimes Australia was better off when the Fraser Government could not make a decision. Take, for example, its decision on the national sewerage program. This program was established by the Whitlam Government. In the three Whitlam Budgets this program received $28m, $117m and $112m. After the election of the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1975, funding for the national sewerage program was slashed to $48m in 1976 and in 1977 it was terminated. If this program had continued, many thousands of my constituents would now be living in sewered homes. I note with satisfaction that this Government has established a national inquiry into local government finance to examine the matters which I' have raised. I commend the Government and the Minister for Local Government and Administrative Services (Mr Uren) for ensuring that the views of local government, community organisations and individuals are being heard by this inquiry. I can assure the House that I will be very interested in the inquiry's progress in future months. It is'my hope and that of many of my constituents,that the end result will be a fairer distribution of Federal funds to local government. I turn to the New South Wales doctors' dispute and the impact it is having on the central coast of New South Wales. In the week before the election last December an anonymous group of doctors placed advertisements in local newspapers seeking to discredit me and my colleague the honourable member for Robertson by claiming that we were nationalising medicine. I quote from an interview with one, of the anonymous doctors which was published in the Gosford Star, which I am sure all honourable members read-I am sure the .honourable member for Robertson does-on Friday, 30 November 1984: Doctors admitted their resignations this weekthis is the week before the Federal !:lectionwere a final attempt to discredit the Government and emphasise their stand in the eyes of the public before the election. As one prominent specialist stated 'I am ruined on Saturday iUhe Government is returned'. Explaining the Government's attempts to rationalise the health system by stealth through Medicare, another specialist commented, 'they're really just communists out and out'. 'Their actions are based on the writings of Lenin'. I think even the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) would not make such a ludicrous claim. These doctors, who obviously hold extreme right wing views, were simply trying to create fear amongst the people of the central coast. They were acting as the political operatives of the Liberal Party. As I explained earlier to the House, my electorate has one of the highest proportions of pensioner constituents. I now wish to read to the House a letter which one doctor is currently circulating to people in my electorate. It is entitled 'Notice to all Patients' and states: The Bureaucratic machine is on the move. Investigators from the Minister of Health's department are on the prowl in this Gosford district at present. I have already been contacted by a patient who has been upset by their interrogation and felt she could not sleep until I assured her there was nothing to worry about. Another patient is very angry at the prying attitude of the interrogators, and intends to protest to the Prime Minister. I, personally, have nothing to hide, but I strongly resent the government's henchmen upsetting my patients with their visits and questions. If you agree with me, why not make a fuss about it? I can do nothing more than let you know what is going on, and hope that you will carry the baton from here on. Unless you do, believe me, things will get much worse for you, the patient. I have worked in a socialistic, nationalised medical scheme, and I know what I'm talking about. When someone seeks to gain political milage in this way by scaring pensioners and other patients, I believe he is beneath contempt. I wish to make it clear that the vast majority of doctors are not participating in this campaign, which is being organised by the radical specialists who seek to discredit and destroy Medicare. This campaign and the endless series of settlement negotiations have now reached their seventh month. Each time settlement has appeared close the radical surgeons, led by Dr Shepherd and Dr Aroney, have sabotaged the discussions. The truth is these people will not allow the dispute to be settled until Medicare is destroyed. The truth is these people are prepared to allow innocent patients to endure suffering and pain until Medicare is destroyed. I am amazed that the Liberal Party, through the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and its former spokesman on health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), is now supporting the radical surgeons. This places the Federal Liberal Party at odds with its New South Wales leader, who recently called for all parties to resume negotiations. This dispute will be resolved only when all parties are willing to compromise. On 20 January the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) offered concessions to the doctors. I understand that the Australian Medical Association will meet the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) later today for further discussions. The only two groups not prepared to seek a settlement are the radical surgeons and the Federal Liberal Party. Before I conclude my remarks today, I draw the House's attention to an agreement signed last Sunday by the Victorian Premier, John Cain, the South Australian Premier, John Bannon, and the New South Wales Premier, Neville Wran. This historic memorandum will result in the construction of a $155m link between the Victorian and New South Wales electricity grid and the South Australian electricity power supply. Before becoming a member of this House I worked for many years as an electrical engineer with the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, and I would like to explain why this is a project of major significance. For many years New South Wales and Victoria have interchange<;l significant amounts of power through the Snowy Mountains scheme. When the three-State power grid project is completed Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales will be able to interchange power. This will provide industrial and domestic consumers in those three States, especially Victoria, with a more secure and stable electricity supply. At various times each State electricity authority will be able to reduce its costs of production by importing cheaper power. Gas turbine plants, which produce very expensive power and consume our relatively scarce hydrocarbon resources, will be used less frequently. I understand that the project will save consumers $14m every year. The historic agreement signed last Sunday by Premiers Cain, Wran and Bannon demonstrates what can be done when Labor leaders work together to build Ii better Australia. Mr Speaker, I wholeheartedly support the second Hawke Government's program, as outlined in the Governor General's Speech. The Government's program seeks to encourage all citizens to work together to build a better Australia. I thank the House for extending to me the courtesy of being heard in silence.",51
98,Mr SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Order! Before I caIl the honourable member for the Northern Territory, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",53
99,Mr EVERINGHAM,PETITIONS," Mr Speaker, please accept my congratulations on your election to your high office. I certainly agree with the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) that a lot more money was needed for sewerage while the Whitlam Government was around. This Government, in outlining its programs for the next three years, speaks today of creating a stronger, fairer and more equitable Australian society. This commitment is of particular interest to the people I seek to represent both in the electorate of the Northern Territory and in my broader shadow ministerial responsibilities for local government and northern development. That is because the Territory electorate, the local government arena and all of northern Australia must rely upon the vision of the Government, to a considerable extent, for their sustenance and progress. Indeed, with the current media fad for naming members of this Parliament after their favourite occupations, I might be known as the member for the least influential. Certainly I would prefer that tag to the one of member for those under the influence, although that is how my areas of electoral and portfolio responsibilities might be seen. More than most other Australians, those in the Northern Territory, local government and all of northern Australia are under the influence of decisions taken at the Federal level. The words 'creating a stronger, fairer and more equitable Australian society' are nice words and sound great. But does the reality match the rhetoric? I must say at the outset that I am not greatly encouraged by these words, despite, or perhaps because of, the familiar ring that they contain. I am not encouraged because-let us face it-they were practically the only words in the Governor General's Speech on which we can hang our hats. There were precious few mentions of local government or of the north, although once again we are to be the guinea pigs. Cash up front for exploration licences is to get its Australian premiere in the waters to our north. Honourable members will expect me to speak at length on the Northern Territory and I will not disappoint them, but, first, I shall deal briefly with the problems of local government. We are all familiar with local government. We tend to take it for granted. But the third tier of government deals with grass-roots problems, and with increasing pressures on its services and severe limitations on its revenue raising potential, local government is clearly headed for greater difficulties; As someone said at a recent local government conference, the Commonwealth Government has the money, the State governments have the power and local government has the problems. These problems cannot be solved by the Commonwealth alone. The States must be involved. My few short years in local government taught me that there are no easy solutions and it will take me some time to come to grips with those proble,ms. But we will all certainly have to ensure that we do come to grips with them, or we will risk th¥. wrath of the electorate at the grass-roots level. I will be keeping a close eye on the work of the new Department of Community Services which has been given a brief to ensure that services are equitably distributed and better co-ordinated with those of the States, local government and community groups. Let us hope that this will not turn out to be just another departmental exercise in viewing grass-roots problems. from on high, or a power grab by empire-building bureaucrats. Turning now to my northern responsibilities, I recall the words of Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, who in 1904 asked Federal Parliament whether it was 'prepared to confess our incapacity to cope with the development of one half of Australia' north of a line from the Gascoyne River to Gladstone. I do not know whether the Parliament ever collectively made such a confession, but I do know that there are some three million square kilometres of northern Australia in which a little, under 800,000 Australians live. That is about 48 per cent of our continent"" containing about 5 per cent of our population, which seems to me to answer MrDeakin's question. But there is ,hope. The Government now speaks of a more equitable Australia. That principle must apply .on a geographic as well as a socio-economic basis. We hear through the media that even the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) now sees the need for a railway to link north and south, if only to carry Federal funds to the Northern Territory. Last year in Adelaide the Special Minister of State (Mr Young), under some election pressure, I might add, said that the railway would eventually be built-no doubt recalling the promises given to South Australia and the Northern Territory by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister  year, shortly before the 1983 election. It is true that they broke their promises, claiming that an unexpected deficit made the necessary expenditure impossible. Of course, the completion date could have been deferred beyond the projected 1988, to make allowance for the deficit, but that may have been too simple. Instead, the Government got Mr Hill of the State Rail Authority to invent a unique and incomprehensible methodology which, he said, made the railway not viable. The Minister for Transport is so proud of Mr Hill's methodology that he refused to release it to us under the Freedom of Information Act. The Government ignores the fact that the unques c tionably independent Canadian Pacific Railway disagrees with it, that the Institute of Defence Studies recommends the project as a top defence priority and that the Department of the Arts, Heritage and Environment has recommended that, on social grounds, the railway should be built. Let us ignore altogether the Australian Labor Party's social audit approach to tranl'port infrastructure. Of course, Australian governments have been promising the railway since 1910 so perhaps northern Australians might be forgiven for questioning the sincerity of this Government's commitment to a more equitable Australia. Previous Labor governments did have a vision which, although we may not have agreed with it, did at least encompass all of Australia-although they also had Rex Patterson-while this Government seems to have little real interest in or sympathy with northern aspirations. Perhaps that is not so surprising as it has no Minister from further north than Ipswich. Certainly, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) seem to be among the castrati of the fourth grade. It is just another example of the lack of influence of which I have spoken. Let us contrast the Governor General's Speech, which really only mentioned the north to tax it, with the 1982 ALP policy document 'North Queensland-Future Directions'. Of course, those were vote-grabbing days. I will cite some initiatives from that document: Domestic passengers to be able to use the Townsville international terminal. Air fare reductions through 'no frills' services. Upgrading and increased local control of regional broadcasting. . An Inter-State Commission to ensure more equitable-there is that phrase againtransport costs. Increased defence commitment to north Queensland, including five patrol boats to be built at Cairns. Cut out sales tax on freight. Sugar industry assistance. There are a whole lot more. These initiatives are a reflection of north Queensland's problems. But today, it seems, the Government hopes that they will just go away. Of course, they will not. As for creating employment, so far 300 people have been laid off because of the failure to keep the promise on building patrol boats in Cairns. Let us look at the sugar industry. Six hundred growers are likely to have to leave the industry and whole districts along the Queensland coast are dependent on it for their economic survival. In 1982, in 1983 and in 1984 this Government promised to give assistance to the industry, but to date absolutely nothing has been forthcoming. I can tell honourable members, from my recent visit to the area, that the growers in north Queensland are desperate. Why do not Government members go north and tell the people up there about a stronger, fairer and more equitable Australia? We should pity the poor tobacco growers. I know it is not fashionable to talk about tobacco today, unless to sneer. But we are talking about equity and we are all agreed that we hold with that. We should spare a thought for the tobacco growers who are facing increasing pressure to become more competitive in what has always been a back-breaking family enterprise. Growers understand the need to be competitive but, first, they would like a more equitable share of the price of a packet of cigarettes. A packet of smokes costs up to $2, of which the grower receives a lousy 4c. From tobacco sales Australian tobacco growers receive about $70m while governments receive in excess of $1 billion in tax on tobacco products. Is that equity? So far it seems that the Government's commitment to equity does not stand up to closer scrutiny and nor do the Government's policies seem to assist a stronger Australia. The north relies heavily on citizen forces for the defence of our coastline. The men and women who volunteer are often professional and technical experts who draw good salaries in their own right. Men and women of this calibre are required for the north-west mobile force-one of the most effective units we have-which operates from Arnhem Land to the Pilbara. But at the last Budget the Government decided to make our reservists pay tax on half of their Army pay. The result has been disastrous because the Government's decision has pushed them into the highest tax bracket. The result has been a loss of about 30 per cent of the force's manpower, and an even greater loss of morale. What of policies leading to the current uranium debacle which has made us an international laughing stock? Is it fair and equitable to say to one State that it may go ahead with developing its uranium deposits while other States, and the Northern Territory, may not? Is mining uranium moral.in some States and immoral in others? What sort of hypocritical, canting humbug is that? Do such policies make Australians stronger? Some figures may help this Parliament judge the answer to. that. CDnservative estimates are that the discDunted value of natiDnal incDme generated if all current and prDpDsed uranium mines in the TerritDry were allDwed to. prDceed wDuld be SDme $9,000m by the year 2000, of which $1,600m wDuld stay in the TerritDry. The IDSS of incDme if Dnly existing uranium mines are allDwed to. fill the existing cDntracts will .be $6,300m by the year 2000, with the TerritDry missing DUt on $1,300m. While the nDrth's pDtential cDntinues to. be strangh,d by this sDrt of LeftRight-Centre hybrid ideDIDgy, we will need a railway to. freight Federal funds nDrthwards. If the mines were allDwed to. prDceed, we wDuld need the railway to. send thDSe thDusands of milliDns of dDllars to. Federal cDffers. In additiDn, thDusands of jDbs wDuld be generated, but honourable members DppDsite wDuld prefer thDse jobs to. be created in SDuth Africa, Canada DrBDtswariaanywhere but Australia. In that cDntext, I deal with the apparent aVDwed intentiDn of the Minister fDr Finance to. sacrifice the TerritDry on the altar of CDst savings. At self-gDvernment, a financial deal was struck with the Federal GDvernment which sDught Dnly - D bring services in the TerritDry up to. the standards of New SDuth Wales and· VictDria. The financial fDrmula was wDrked out to. encDurage and suppDrt pDpulatiDn grDwth in the nDrth. The agreement, under the memDrandum of understanding, has gDne a 19n9 way tDwards achieving thDse Dbjectives. HDnDurable members shpuld remember that when we negDtiated that agreement against the might and reSDurces of the CDmmDnwealth, the TerritDry, befDre self-gDvernment, pDssessed just Dne Public Service level 1 financial adviser.

I ask honourable members what FederatiDn is abDut if it is not vantaged areas of Australia; the TerritDry is, after all, Dne sixth of Australia. A mile of rDad in the TerritDry is no. shDrter Dr less cDstly to' build. I cDuld hardly address this HDuse withDut SDme reference to' the land rights issue, althDugll it seems to. have been swept under the carpet in the GDvernment's program. Land rights issues are different in each State and within States, but Dne thing is CDmmDn to. all States: There is enDrmDUS divisiDn abDut land rights in the cDmmunity. We are nDW seeing divisiDns within the GDvernment and within the LabDr Party. The way in which land rights have been enacted and administered in the TerritQry has caused fear elsewhere. The Minister fDr Aboriginal Affairs (Mr HQlding) WQuid do. well, as he licks his wDunds after his first term and pDnders whether he will seek a clQser acquaintance with the truth, to. remember that the peDple QIl the ground have the mDst experiencethe TerritQry has had eight years experience-of the effects of land rights.

The Northern Territory, indeed all north Australia, is a resource rich and energetic region, contributing to national goals; in many cases it does so in spite of government policies. With our small population and lack of a protected manufacturing sector, we .are geared up with the right policies to take maximum advantage of the technological, nuclear society. I have said that I am the member for the least influential, for those who most rely on equity ana fair dealing. Inhabitants of the three million square kilometres of north Australia have just seven members to fight on their behalf. I will finish by quoting the words of Senator John Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, in September 1982. If honourable members read 'north Australia: for 'north Queensland', the sentiments apply equally well. Senator Button said: North Queensland is an area with great natural resources and its contribution to Australia's financial health and stability has always been high. But is has rarely received a fair return for wealth and in recognition of its strategic position. National governments have never fully grasped their obligations to north Queensland. The ALP is determined that this situation must end. The Government's program for the next three years goes nowhere near living up to those words. North Australians, indeed all Australians, look to this Government for action, not words. They hope for a government which )Vill set the lead, and build a stronger, fairer and more equitab-e Australia by relying on individual competitiveness and the great wealth of natural resources that our nation contains.",54
100,Mr SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Chifley, I remind the . House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.  offer you my congratulations on your re;-election to your high office. I wish also to be assoCiated with congratulations to the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) on her election as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. I 'also thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees, for the kindness and courtesy shown to me as a new member on the Government side. Indeed, that courtesy was shown to all new members on both Government and Opposition sides. !trust that I should not be disorderly if! say how pleased I was, as were a large number of Government members, to see a lady Serjeant-atArms at the opening of this Parliament. I am sure that many young women in my electorate will be inspired to aspire to positions which might otherwise be seen as male preserves. I stand before my peers as the third member for Chifley. I thank my predecessors, John Armitage and the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), for the way in which they administered the electorate. I record my appreciation for the tremendous public support I received on election day and subsequently. It was a ringing endorsement of the Hawke Government's policies as they affect western Sydney in general and Chifley in particular. I pay a special tribute to my wife, Robyn, and my children, Michelle, Stephanie, Benjamin and Courtney, who have endured much and have never wavered in their support and encou-agement. It is as much a win for my family as it is for me. Victory in Chifley on 1 December largely reflected the tremendous dedication and commitment of the members of the Australian Labor Party who worked tirelessly throughout what was its contribution to the national one of the longest campaigns on record. Organisationally, it was difficult for the Party to reform the Federal Electorate Council, hold a quick-fire preselection and then organise and raise funds for the campaign. However, the Party responded magnificently. I thank my friend and campaign director, Richard Amery, the State member for Riverstone and his Deputy, John Aqualina, the State member for Blacktown, the President of the FEC, Keith Squire, his executive and council, the seven branch campaign directors and all the branch members. When one mentions individuals one can run the risk of offending, those one omits. If I were properly to acknowledge those I would like to, or who merit it, I would run out of time. However, I mention two people. The first is Tony Johnston, the former State member for Riverstone-I was privileged to be his first campaign director some 13 years ago-and president of the State Electorate Council. I was pleased to be close to him and am indebted for the experience I gained. The other person is Alderman Sylvia Whilesmith, who has always been a very loyal and dedicated supporter and now is establishing her very own high credentials as the first ALP women alderman on Blacktown City Council and Chairperson of our Community Services Committee. The se&t of Chifley is situated in the western suburbs of Sydney, generally west of Parramatta and east of Penrith. It is the heartland of Labor's western stronghold. The heart of my electorate is Mount Druitt, where I am proud to say I live and where I have' insisted on opening my electorate office. The people of Bidwill, Blackett, Dharruk, Emerton, Hebersham, Lethbridge Park, Shalvey, Shane Park, Tregear, Whalan and Willmot have a special place in my heart. They are not only part of Chifley electorate but form the fifth ward of Bhicktown City Council. These good people are the ones who thrust me into public life some three years ago in a council by-election with 76 per cent of the vote. At the 1983 council elections I was returned from the No. 3 position on the ALP ticket by some 54 votes. Honourable members perhaps can appreciate my keen interest in seeking out those 54 voters. The other suburbs of my electorate are: Blacktown, Prospect, Doonside, Rooty Hill, Minchinbury, Colyton, St Clair and North St Marys. The electorate of Chifley is. cosmopolitan and multicultural and is dis-· tinguished by the large number of young people: and significant numbers of senior citizens. Its; distinctive feature is the number of people who) have moved or are moving into the electorate. This is the centenary year of two great Australian prime Ministers, two great Australians and two great leaders of the Australian Labor Party. I refer, of course, to John Curtin and Ben Chifley. I should like to say a little about Joseph Benedict Chifley. I cannot, of course, claim to have known him. Indeed, at the time of Ben Chifley assuming the prime ministership, I was taking a more substantial form than a' gleam in my mother's eye. However, as a young man I read Chifley's biography by Crisp and was deeply impressed by the example provided by Chifley. In this centenary year I fondly hope that some of my younger constituents will similarly be inspired. In October 1941, Labor assumed office under John Curtin and Chifley became Treasurer. Without a doubt he was Australia's greatest Treasurer, although I suspect that Chifley would demur to Scullin and Theodore. His achievements as Treasurer include the introduction of widow's pensions and unemployment, sickness and hospital benefits. Perhaps his greatest contribution as Treasurer was to marshal the financial resources of Australia to maximise Australia's contribution to the war effort at a time when the conservative parties, the precursors of the Liberal and National parties, had so badly betrayed the trust and faith placed in them. Chifley was also Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. He became Prime Minister on 13 July 1945, retaining the portfolio of Treasury as well. He led his party to victory in the .1946 election. The achievements of his Government include the beginning of the mass migration scheme and the establishment of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority, Trans-Australia Airlines, the Stevedoring Industry Board and the Joint Coal Board, the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the nationalisation of Qantas Airways Ltd and overseas telecommunications, and support for Indonesian independence from the Dutch. If I have one misgiving, perhaps those like me who remember 11 November 1975 would rather not have seen proportional voting introduced for the Senate. I congratulate my colleague, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and the Bathurst City Council on the centenary celebrations they have organised. I sincerely hope that Blacktown and Penrith councils will be able to organise celebrations on a lesser sca\e. Until recently, I was proud to be Deputy Mayor of the great city of Blacktown comprising some 200,000 people. I was very' proud that Blacktown was the first council in New South Wales to Introduce a system for the payment of rates in seven equal instalments. In its first year of operation the system secured a 50 per cent adoption rate, which is proof of its enormous popularity. With great respect, I suggest that the underlying a-sumptions behind the introduction of the scheme are applicable equally to State and Federal authorities. I was pleased to be involved in the establishment of the greening of the City of Blacktown committee. I' commend the work of that committee and the success it has achieved. Specifically, I mention one project, the Nurragingy Reserve. Indeed, I would be very proud to 'say that this was my idea. Unfortunately, it was not, However, I can say that I became a very enthusiastic advocate of the project, which captured my imagination. This area of approximately 90 hectares is to be developed as a bicentennial project from funds supplied by Blacktown City Council and both Federal and State governments. The reserve. will include 13 individual picnic areas where families can enjoy barbecues and outings, three group picnic areas which can be reserved for the exclusive use of clubs and organisations, natural bushland and an urbanfOJ:est, artificial lakes, gardens, walking trails, bicycle trails, carparks, public conveniences and maintenance yards. Some $2,182,028 has been allocated to the project with over$1.5m being provided under the Federal Government's community employment program. Some 166 persons have obtained employment on the project. . This Government, Blacktown City Council, the people of Chifley and those who are working on the project can be assured that we are providing a wonderful social asset which will be enjoyed by generations of Australians. I trust that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) and Blacktown Council will provide an appropriate opening function. The Blacktown City Council, in consultation with the Dharruk Aboriginal Land Council, Blacktown' Historical Committee and the Blacktown Bicentenary Committee have officially named the area Nurragingy Reserve after one of Blacktown's best known historical figures. Nurragingy was a member of the local Aboriginal Dharruk tribe and was one of the first Aborigines to receive a land grant in his own right from the colonial government in approximately 1819. I believ- i- is appropriate that I should briefly mention the inf!J.mous record of the previous Liberal-National Party Government and the record of the first Hawke Labor Government. The Fraser Government was conceived in blood-the blood of the former leader of the Opposition, Sir Billy Snedden-and delivered in a dark cloud of deceit and duplicity which rent asunder long-standing conventions. Whilst continually blaming the' Whitlam Government, Fraser and his Liberal-National Party Government presided over an unprecedented period of confrontation, when Australian was pitted against Australian, an unprecedented period of economic stagnation and mismanagement. The rewards went to the privileged few and the brunt was borne by the many,' particularly the disadvantaged in our society. Nothing became Malcolm Fraser nor humanised him more than the news of his humiliating defeat. The natiol) rejoiced. Bob Hawke had promised national reconstruction and reconciliation. I sincerely believe that if one had taken a poll of Federal parliamentary members of the ALP at the time they would not have predicted the outstanding success achieved on the economic front in a short '21 months in office. Confrontation and division were replaced by consensus. This Hawke Government has consulted widely. It not only governs with the support of the trade union movement but also with that of the business community. The results have been dramatic. Double-digit inflation has been halved. A negative growth economy has been replaced by one of the fastest growing economies of the free world. Banking is being deregulated. The Government is poised to embark on' reform of the taxation system. This taxation mess largely has been the legacy of successive Liberal-National Party governments in 30 of the previous 35 years. It is the ordinary men and women' of Australia, through the pay-as-you-earn system, who carry an unfair burden of taxation because they do not have the opportunity to minimise their taxation. This reform will be achieved without increasing the overall incidence of taxation. I welcome it and regret that former Liberal-National Party governments continually spoke up about reform but never did anything about it. We are privileged in Chifley to have many young Australians. I am deeply committed to the' concept of equality of opportunity for them and fot all Australians. We have many fine schools and facilities in Chifley. However, I do not necessarily believe that this guarantees equality of education. I am dissatisfied with the low participation rates of our students in the last two years of high school. I do not presently have the answers, but I believe the role of teachers is not merely to possess expert knowledge but to have the real ability to reach out to· students, to communicate that knowledge and to instil an interest, enthusiasm and understanding for the subject. Teaching is an interesting area. It is the only area where the inputs-the students rather than the teachersare blamed for the outputs. Nevertheless, I recognise that there are many dedicated, teachers in Chifley and I look forward to meeting them and discussing solutions. I am determined to achieve results. It was a pity that the State Government's proposals for a senior high school at Whalan were torpedoed. The John Pau1.11 High School stands as a shining example of what cal). be achieved in the west. . Equality of opportunity for employment is a major issue within the electorate of Chifley. I take pride in this Government's distinguished record of economic management and job creation, but I am far from satisfied. Unemployment arid rising interest rates with their effect on mortgage repayments tear at the social fabric of our community. It is the unemployed who are the victims, not the villains. I have many people in my electorate who are desperately seeking work. I seek jobs, jobs and more jobs for my electora.te. I believe that the Federal, State and local governments have an historic opportunity to transform the w-tern suburbs into the industrial heartland of Sydney. I hope to be at the forefront of seizing that opportunity. The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Technology (Senator Button) has, for the fir-t time, sought to heed the numerous' reports on manufacturing industry and has started to rationalise and restructure industry. Once again we had the situation, particularly in the, 1960s and late 1970s, where the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia in government did absolutely nothing, providing years of wasted opportunity. I have confidence in Australian invention,innovation and the skills of our work force. I believe that government direction and assistance is required to provide growth and more jobs for manufacturing industries. I suspect that neither serendipity nor market forces will generate the growth that we need. We need not only to cut out jobs but also to create them. I look forward to making an input into the Caucus infrastructure committee. ' I am an optimist, but even the most optimistic prediction still leaves us a long way short of full employment-indeed, we are unlikely to return to it for some time. It has been rightly said that the accord is central to the Government's management of the economy. In many ,ways the accord represents what the trade union movement is prepared to forgo for itself for the greater opportunities of the unemployed. I welcome that sacrifice and commitment. However, as a society we must realistically face up the issue of long term unemployment. As I said before, the unemployed are the victims, not the villains. I hope that the Government has the opportunity to review the unemployment benefit ,with a view to further increasing it. As a society, we m:edto rethink our attitudes to work. I do not think that the traditional view of a job being 35 or 40 hours a week will survive. I should like to thank the senior citizens clubs of Mount Druitt, Rooty Hill, Doonside and Blacktown. I was thrilled to be invited to their functions and I appreciated the warmth of their hospitality and friendship. It was, nevertheless, quite disgusting during the election campaign to witness the distress and trauma that these good people suffered as a result of the scare tactics adopted by the Opposition parties when discussing the assets test. These are the people in our community who should be esteemed and supported rather than preyed upon. I am pleased to have been associated with the Mount Druitt, Hospital from its inception and have been pleased to serve as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors with His Lordship Bishop Murphy as Chairman. From the outset we have sought to treat the whole person and instil a team approach to the delivery. of services. Our most important committee of the b-ard is on patient care review. I must say that I abhor the current doctors' pute and was stunned that the Opposition should come out in support of the rebel specialists. What this dispute is all about is: Firstly, money; secondly, who should control the hospital system, be it doctor or state; and, thirdly, whether Medicare patients should have an equality of access to the best medical treatment. I could give many examples, but I shall give only one of where a doctor in surgery halted proceedings on the patient-a child-to ring up the parents from the operating theatre to determine whether the child was privately insured or a Medicare patient. I am concerned that there are many people in our community who need medical attention but because of the dispute they' are not getting it. There are children whose fractures will never be properly set; there are others waiting ,for the onslaught of another attack, with attendant pain and suffering, so that they may be classified as emergency cases. I regret that the ladies of Our Lady of Consolation Nursing Home and Doonside Nursing Home are being shuffled from one hospital to another. I cannot rule Qut the possibility that some may have died in the process. The attitude of these rebel specialists is callous and totally indifferent to individual dignity and needs. The whole community condemns them and their advocates, the Liberal Party. Mr Speaker, I sincerely look forward to the next three years and the opportunity to speak out on behalf of my constituents. I sincerely hope that I will live up to the trust and responsibility placed upon me'. I thank the House.",57
101,Mr SPEAKER,PETITIONS,"Before I call the honourable member for Hinkler, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech and I ask the House to extendto him the usual courtesy.",60
102,Mr CONQUEST,PETITIONS," Thank you, Mr Speaker, for drawing the attention of the House to the fact that this is my maiden speech. At the outset, I thank you, Mr Speaker, and Madam Deputy Speaker for the warm way in which you greeted the new members of this Parliament and for being such gracious hosts during the seminar that we had. As you said, Mr Speaker, I rise for the first time to address members of this Parliament. I am aware of the convention which suggests that a first speech by a member of this House should be heard without interruption. I am conscious of the fact that this is a courtesy that I will probably receive only once in this House. In such circumstances I will refrain from straying, as far as conscience dictates, on to matters which might be considered so political or so sensitive to disGovernment members that they might tempt some to respond through spontaneous reaction. That is not to say that at another time in this same forum I will not seek to draw reaction in the thrust and parry of political debate. While speeches in this House may be more savoury with a little salt, I seek today to tempt honourable members' attention, not with spicy oratorical flavour, but rather with the materialistic matters which briefly describe the new Federal division of Hinkler, a few of the problems being faced by constituents and a short resume of that great aviator who has been honoured in that naming. Hinkler is a provincial and rural coastal electorate in which the main centres of population are situated at Gladstone to the north and Bundaberg to the south. The division stretches from the coast westward across the Dawson River to the boundary of the Duaringa and Banana shires. Prior to redistribution by the electoral Commission, each of three Federal divisions partially serviced the present region. I speak, of course, of Kennedy in the west-represented by my good friend sitting beside me-Capricornia to the north and Wide Bay to the south. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) have continued their service in this House, whilst the former member for Capricornia chose to retire and has been succeeded by another. I thank those past custodians of what is now. encompassed in the new Hinkler division for their long and dedicated service to the people now enrolled in the new division. I look forward to co-operation with the three current representatives of Wide Bay, Maranoa and Capricornia in matters of common interest on our boundaries during the term of this Parliament. Whilst one member is not of the same political persuasion, I have known each person for a long time and some affinity has already been established even though, perhaps, in a more relaxed environment. The history of this House bears testimony to the fact that politics are not a barrier to friendship and respect, even though members may be philosophically divided. So should it be at all times. The Federal division of Hinkler is almost microcos,m of Australia, with a great diversity economic endeavour and social thinking. large aluminium processing industries and house complexes in and near Gladstone have brought a measure of stability to that city. the less, in the aftermath of massive development, we perceive the difficulties of transition as itinerant construction and technical workers leave in search of further employment. Small businesses have been closing with demoralising regularity, bringing further unemployment disruption to families. The social problems we perceive are not unique to Gladstone when compare the situation with other such growth citrus centres which have slowed down. It is vital for government to recognise, however, that such areas require special consideration and finance to lessen the impact of this demoralising reversal in the economy Just a short distance north of Gladstone lie some of the world's richest deposits of oil shale. Demands for this energy resource could escalate sooner than expected if, as aviation indicators suggest, the denser synthetic fuels can provide longer ranges in flight against an equivalent fuel load of fossil derivatives. The city of Bundaberg and the immediate district are also feeling the effects of the recession as the sugar farmers and the dependent industries within that infrastructure face a crisis of serious proportions. Decisions on the future of the sugar industry should place heavier reliance on the short term social problems so created, rather than economic philosophies devoid of compassion. Unfortunately, compassion is not a criterion by any dimension within the academic field of the economist. I remind honourable members that good government is first and foremost a people-orientated institution, and therein lies the purpose of its establishment. The region around Bundaberg has a viable fruit and vegetable industry which has the capacity to become the salad bowl for South East Asia and other countries. But as the sugar growers turn to these alternative crops to survive, there is a real danger of creating a glut on the domestic market, thus threatening the livelihood of the traditional small crop growers. Support for the continued viability of agricultural production throughout the division will be addressed vigorously by my office during future deliberations in this House. The conventions of this maiden speech preclude such action now, although, Mr Speaker, I am sorely tempted to be more outspoken. However, I ask all honourable members assembled here to recognise the important contribution that primary industry has made to the economy of Australia through a vital export income. It is noteworthy, though, to of consider that even in these distressing times just The one by-product of Bundaberg's sugar power production-a little drop probably known to many members of this House; I refer to a famous Neverrum-from one factory contributed over $50m to government revenue by way of excise and sales the tax in the last financial year. The income from agricultural production to successive governments has subsidised many projects of benefit to this nation, and the farmers' plea for assistance and now should not be so lightly discounted. The division of Hinkler is also a significant conwe tributor to the economy of Australia through fruits, grains, cotton, beef and other meats, tobacco and dairy products. All these are affected by cost increasing decisions of government. A vigorous export promotion campaign should be maintained with relentless zeal to secure stable markets against the heavily subsidised produce dumped on the international market by the European Community. No members of this House should countenance or support an import parity price philosophy for Australian primary production. Farmers, too, are entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I have read the submissions to the Government by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation calling for urgent action to restore confidence to the dairy industry. The proposals contained therein have the support of each State organisation. I join them in a call to government to take urgent action to alleviate the financial pressures on the member farmers. Milk is a basic food. The industry has continually argued that holding down dairy product prices could be counterproductive in respect of milk production. Faced with a decline in price, the farmers' first reaction is to increase production in order to maintain gross income and meet commitments. Milk production declines only after the dairy farming community exhausts its capacity to work harder and longer. When this point is reached, farmers leave the industry in great numbers and the resulting decline in production becomes excessive. It should be further noted that the prices of manufactured dairy products in Australia are relatively cheap in comparison with almost all Western countries. It is true to say that we can purchase many of our agricultural commodities more cheaply today on the international market; but if we allow those primary industries in Australia to be destroyed for consumer orientated expediency, who will guarantee continuity of supply? Who is prepared to guarantee that the price of imports will not increase substantially in the near future? Who will care for the people who have depended on farm income in the many towns the farmers now support? Who indeed? The people on the land have enough to contend with as they battle the elements of nature. Let us not now add indifference of government to the vagaries to which they are exposed. This nation's wealth and progress emerged from the sweat and tears of primary producers and therein still lies our future. Before we throw in the towel to signify the demise of those rural dustries now in serious trouble, let us at least offer a tissue of support and encourage them to go just one more round. They have the will and they have the courage. Let us givl(them interim financial support. The known mineral wealth of the Hinkler division is also significant to the economy. Large coal deposits are mined by Thiess Dampier Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd at the Moura and Kianga fields. The old Cracow goldfields are being reworked with new technology and equipment. Many other goldfields are being assessed as the potential to rework the old diggings is improving. Nearer the coast, at Biggenden, one of the few magnetite mines still operates successfully. Additional reserves of oil shale are located at Lowmead and Nagoorin near the coast and at Duaringa in the west. For those who like to go rock-hounding and fossicking, there are many fine gems to be found in the western shire of Banana. The offshore waters of the Hinkler division also support a large fishing fleet which mainly utilises the facilities for berthing and processing at Gladstone and Bundaberg. The seafood delicacies from these fishing grounds are reriowned for the quality and variety of their selection. Yet, the fisherman too face the problems of increasing costs for services and fuels. There are indications also of dwindling stock resources caused by the incursion of large fishing vessels from other centres, and destructive influences affecting traditional fish breeding environments. The coastal areas and offshore islands in the Hinkler division combined with the historically rich hinterland could be the mecca for increased tourist traffic. There are numerous well established resorts along the coast and on the islands of the Great Barrier Reef. The many small inland towns offer an old world hospitality which complements the charm of the various localities. Off the beaten track, the adventurous traveller will find breathtaking views of the countryside and many splendid gorges. The residents of Gladstone are justifiably proud of the great natural harbour on which the city nestles and to which they flock for aquatic recreation. Although Port Bundaberg, at the mouth of the Burnett River, is not as well known as the major trading port of Gladstone, it is still a vital sugar, molasses and oil terminal. The Burnett River is also an important recreation facility for the district. Before concluding, it would be fitting if I were to dwell for a short period to recognise Squadron Leader Bert Hinkler, after whom the Federal division is named. This famous pioneer aviator was in- small in physical stature, but as Major Turner wrote in the London Daily Telegraph following Bert's tragic death: 'He was a small man with a giant's heart'. Herbert John Louis Hinkler, affectionately known as Bert, was born in Bundaberg on 8 December 1892. During his pioneer aviation days Bert Hinkler became the idol and hero of all Australians as they proudly sang the praises of HustlingHinkler, upin the sky. His principal feats were the first solo flight from Great Britain to Australia and the first solo flight across the South Atlantic Ocean from west to east. His flight across the South Atlantic was an admirable performance, but there is no doubt that the 16-day flight from England to Australia is one of the best remembered. Enduring extreme discomfort in a small Avro Avian, lacking ground and communication support, with primitive navigational aids, and with only an atlas map to guide him, Bert Hinkler displayed courage and determination. The last flight of this great Australian was another solo attempt from England to Australia. Tragically, he lost his life when he crashed in the Prato Magno Alps in Tuscany, Italy, on 8 January 1933. It is a fitting memorial to Bert Hinkler that the new Federal division of Hinkler has been so named. The holder of the Distinguished Service Medal for bravery in action over Germany in 1916 and the Air Force Cross presented for the finest aerial exploit of 1925, Squadron Leader Bert Hinkler was also presented with the International Aeronautical Federation gold medal in the same year. It is interesting to note that another nominee for the gold medal in the same year was Squadron Leader Charles Kingsford-Smith. Any person elected to represent the division of Hinkler would be hard-pressed to mirror the feats of this famous man, yet strength can be gained in striving to emulate those personal traits which he displayed. Bert Hinkler was not deterred by the formidable barriers he faced on the way to success. He set a true and faithful course towards his objective, with a determination to succeed against any adversity; fearless in thought, deed and action; believing in what he was doing and the eventual benefit to mankind. Yet Bert Hinkler was constantly humble amidst all the accolades bestowed on him by many nations. Reference to the life and success of Bert Hinkler surely places a heavy responsibility on this division's representatives to refrain from any action which could demean the name of Hinkler by association. Under such circumstances a representative can only draw strength if he too is not distracted from any course considered true in the navigation of matters political. lam honoured to be known as the member for Hinkler, which I understand, will be the only term used to recognise me in this House. Debate (on motion by Mr Humphreys) adjourned. NA Victorian Government-Primary Producers Motion (by Mr Young) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",60
103,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"First I would like to congratulate all those honourable members who have made their maiden speeches today. I think we have heard some excellent speeches, and I look forward to hearing many more from those who have broken the ice, so to speak. In the brief time available to me I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to an article in the Age today, entitled 'An audit of Victoria'. In the preamble to the article, the author begins by saying that he will be attempting to give an independent audit of Victoria under Labor, which I think is very appropriate when one considers that there is a State election on Saturday. Of course, the first area we touch on is taxes. It is very interesting to read what this article says. It states: So far as the Cain Government's performance has been under scrutiny in this election, it is largely over the question of tax rises. Its problems stem from the 1982 election campaign, when Mr Cain said he saw no need to increase taxes and promised to reduce train, tram and bus fares, electricity and gas charges, petrol tax and motor registration fees. Mr MACKellar-He did that?",63
104,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"He did that before the 1982 election. He has broken every single one of those election promises. The article continues: Everyone knows that taxes, fares and chargesnot only have risen buthave risen faster than inflation. Mr MCArthur-Faster than inflation!",63
105,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, they have risen faster than inflation. So much for that great promise from Mr Cain. According to the Victorian Opposition the actual rises have totalled 55.4 per cent. This is including inflation. The Cain Government tries to exclude the fact that the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, the State Bank of Victoria, et cetera, now have to pay a public dividend tax. Mr Cunningham- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask whether the honourable member is prepared to substantiate what he is reading from the newspaper?",63
106,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! There is no point of order.,64
107,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, obviously the facts hurt. The point is that in Victoria we now have one of the highest taxing State governments this country has ever seen. In fact the Age article continues: . On any realistic measure, then, the rate of tax increases has been higher under Labor than under the Liberals. I think that debunks one of the arguments put forward by the members of the State Government. The article further states: It is certain, however, that in its first two Labor increased taxes more sharply than any other state government. These are the facts in an independent audit. Mr Charles-No, that is not the truth. They are not the facts.",64
108,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It is telling honourable members opposite what they do not want to hear. As I said, this is an independent audit of the performance of the State Labor Government. If we look a bit further on the spending side we see that the total net Government spending figure shown in a graph in the article, which honourable members can look at later if they like, reveals a big increase-from $5,766m to $9,089m. Mr Donald Cameron-In what period?",64
109,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"That is an increase of 57.6 per cent in three years. Mr Donald Cameron-Gracious me, you're gangsters down there.",64
110,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"In real terms, that represents a 26.7 per cent increase-",64
111,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,No one has done better than you out of the public purse. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! The House will come to order. The honourable member for Wan non has the call.,64
112,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. There is another important fact that puts it all into perspective. A 26.7 per cent increase in spending in real terms compares with a 3.3 per cent increase in the last three years of the Liberal Government. I think that kills yet another argument that has been thrown around. It is nothing more than furphy. Therefore, the Cain Government has been not only the biggest taxer but also the biggest spender. It is no wonder that when we pick up today's Australian Financial Review we read on top of the front page 'Business turning sour on Cain'. It is amazing to read the article. One part states: The Australian Small Business Association yesterday dismissed the Cain Government's claims of a 'partnership' with business, describing its relations with the Government as 'more like a state of war'. So much for Cain and his talk about co-operation with business. I could go on if I were not running out of time. The Cain Government has put taxes up, increased spending and now has the audacity to promise before this coming election that it will not increase taxes at a rate that is faster than increases in the consumer' price index. I do not believe that.",64
113,Madam DEPUTY,ADJOURNMENT,"SPEAKER-Order! The years in office, honourable member's time has expired.",64
114,Ms MAYER,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would like to say that there are probably just two things that we can believe about what we read in the newspaper; one is the price and the other is the date. Also I could suggest that the sub-title of the Small Business Association of Victoria should be the Roger Shipton support society, but I will not do so. Tonight I wish to take up a much more positive theme which has been one of the most satisfying underlying themes of my time as a representative of my constituency. That theme concerns the co-operation between this Federal Government and the Cain Government in Victoria and the co-operation between the state government members and myself in my electorate. The list of achievements' for our constituents resulting from that co-operation is a list which demonstrates the enormous difference to theJives of the people that results from getting things done instead of simply talking about them. In my electorate and the State electorates of Box Hill, Bennettswood and Syndal we have in a matter of three years completed the long overdue reconstruction of the Box Hill Hospital at· a cost of $7.25m-and I wonder whether my colleagues on the other side of the House would suggest that that $7.25m was badly spent-to provide badly needed new operating theatres, reconstructed wards and a new kitchen. I think that that $7.25m was spent extremely well and I am glad that we spent it. Also long overdue for construction was the Eastern Suburbs Geriatric Centre, about which the previous Liberal Government talked for 20 years. That is now in existence and providing day care services, referral services, and assessment services Jor elderly people, of whom we have many in our mutual electorates. The money for that centre was also well spent in my opinion. I think the first sod was turned by the appropriate Liberal member in 1972 after there had been some discussion about it. As of this moment bricks and mortar are there and so are the services. In-fill housing, and housing projects involving the proper use of serviced land-held for years by the Education Department under the previous Government, for some extraordinary reason-are now a fact in the State seat of Bennettswood, where high quality housing is being provided for a number of public and rental and private dwellings. ; On the subject of housing, let me say this: Of the Federal housing budget of $148m spent on housing in Victoria, $1.9m has been spent in Chisholm and the State seats of Bennettswood, Syridal and Box Hill. The first home owners scheme has provided 543 new home owners with $1.45m to enable them to purchase new homes in the areas where their families live and the services are provided. That is extremely good. The Box Hill College of Technical and Further Education, a college which has 20,000 students and is a very good college, providing an essential educational service, has had $5.5m worth of capital works provided. Is that money badly spent? Is that something a government should not have done? Is the education of young people not a consideration when members talk about spending governments. The Box Hill Co-educational Technical School, a school providing the skills that we'so badly need, has had $1.4m provided to demolish the 60 portable classrooms that' the Cain Government inherited from the previous Liberal Government, and for the provision of proper educational facilities for those students. The Box Hill Special Development School"" which was talked and talked about, has had $l.lm worth of capital works provided to cater for those young people who need the services provided by a, special development school. .The police buildings have been upgraded to the extent of $160,000. I again ask: Is that money badly spent? Is that money that government should not have spent? The long day care program in Box Hill, Ii Federal and State initiative,' has been provided with $175,000. Do cl;1ildren not need care? A capital works program' to provide a 35-place day, care centre for children is in place. I mention also the Box Hill Transpoit Centre, a $60m combined private and, public effort, which every day provides---.:.:this is something that might be worth listening to-15,000 commuters who travel on 500 buses and 900 trains with the ability to change from bus to train under cover and to do their shopping in a big retail centre on the way. Is that something on which governments ought not to have spent money? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Child)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",64
115,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"1 join the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in congratulating those members of the House who have made their maiden speeches both yesterday and today and commend them on that Important milestone in their role as members of the House of Representatives. A number of the' maiden speeches, from both sides of the House, have alluded to the fact that ainong the most disadvantaged in Australia's community today are Australia's primary producers. Australia's primary producers-not because of the unpredictability Of nature"" which often beleaguers them, but because of falling world markets and the falling Australian economic state-find themselves no longer as profitable as they were. As the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) has' so carefully and skilfully explained, a number of Australian primary producers face on average a 17 per cent fall in their annual incomes. We should feed that to the public servants who have been causing this government distress or to the power workers in Queensland. , I make that point this evening simply because this is the season when primary producers find themselves busiest of all. While we have been in this House talking, people in all otir electorates have been carrying out work that is sometimes most unpleasant. I think of those who are on clover harvesters, doing the dusty work of harvesting small seeds; I think of those who are without any shade at all in grape patches harvesting grapes; I think of those who, in the itch of a peach patch, are currently harvesting' clingstone peaches, in spite of the itch and fluff that is implicit in that work. The honourable member for'Hinkler (Mr Conquest) has already alluded to the importance of hard work, and I rose this evening because I was astonished to see in yesterday's Australian an article that said: New South Wales and Victoriannote 'Victorian'fruit growers are facing an employment crisis. They cannot find enough pickers to harvest their pears, peaches and grapes. Should a nation with the unemployment statistics of this nation carry an article like that in its leading daily? What sort of reflection is it on the Australian nation when we have work to be done and people who are unemployed, but growers are unable to find people from that unemployment pool to do the work that needs to be done. It is absurd to find that article in the Australian and then to find attached to a press release from the Minister for· Employment and Industrial· Relations (Mr Willis) a comment that he is planning to spend down-$24,571 to create four jobs for 16 weeks to expand a community vegetable garden. A little further down it is said that he is plailOing to spend in the Lockhart River community $23,071 to create four jobs for 16 weeks to expand another community vegetable garden. All this is happening while fruit growers of Victoria are unable to find people' t6 pick their temporarily profitable crops. It would be the height of irony if we were to discover that the unemployed 'in Australia were not predifference pared to harvest the crops we need harvested while the Asian people, with their green' revolution, are becoming increasingly productive, achieving grain production levels. we scarcely to - ope are possible, and are employing peoplwho were once unemployed. It is in the interests of the fruit growers of South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria that I make this plea.",65
116,Mr GRIFFITHS,ADJOURNMENT,"At the outset; Madam Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on once again achieving election to your high office. I also congratulate those honourable members who have presented their maiden speeches today. At the start of this adjournment debate I listened with some interest to the honourable member for Wan non (Mr Hawker) quoting they might be. extensively from an article i.n today's Age. Part of that article referred - o Mr Cain's analysis of the difference.in tax rates under his Government and its predecessors, the Hamer and Thomp&on alition governments. The figures referred to by Cain, as reported by the Age, which were calto culated by the Liberal Party, indicate a 29 per cent increase in per capita taxes under the Libcated erals and an ,- per cent increase under Labor. wholeheartedly endorse the terms of that article. It shows the economic illiteracy of the Victorian Branch of the Liberal Party for ,it to use thindex as an all-encompassing economic measure. As the article points out, the appropriate measure to be used in the context in which the Liberal Party wished to luse it was the implicit price defladustrial tor. If one is to enter into economic debate important to get the fundamentals of the debate correct. As I have said, to use the CPI is simply indicator of economic illiteracy. The Cain Labor Government has a strong record of performance over the last three years but, more importantly, it has a next 10 years. For the first time in the post-war period an Australian government has put down a concise and well thought out program. This program maximises the relative advantages that the Victorian economy has over other State governments and, more particularly, over our overseas competitors. The W-year program set Opposition members. interjecting- .",66
117,Mr GRIFFITHS,ADJOURNMENT,"This may be boring to those members of the Opposition who are not interested in economics. Perhaps I should mehtion some of the Mr Kennett's statements, such as whether one would allow one's daughter to go out with the Premier of Victoria-a juvenile and stupid statement. Another rylated to working out the between adult wages Imd award wages, Clearly he was unable to do.so when he promulgated the so-called YES scheme, a scheme I might add, that has been universally condemneclby mOllt dare observers and' by almost all young people to whoqI I have spoken. He made comments about the Nat.ional Economic Summit Conference 1 which was very importaqt to Australia. We have reaped some rewards from that Summit. Mr Kennett believed that it was akin to the Council of Fascists. We have to draw the line somewher-. Someone who is aspiring to the leadersqip of a State really needs to be able to project a degree of responsibility. I liote with some interest the stunried silence of h6nourable members on the other side of the chamber. Of course they are embarrass-d by that sort of juvenile behaviour, an- well ' . I come back to what is important in the election campaign-plans for the future of Victoria and of coits economy. The Victorian Government, as I Mr have indicated, has laid down a 1O-year program maximise the relative advantage' that Victoria has over its competitors. It is all fairly complistuff, but I would commend the reading of I that program to honourable members opposite because it is much better than coming up with advertising jargon or gimmicks in an attempt to CPI hoodwink the Victorian electors. For example, the program sets out some major areas that Victoria will concentrate on in the next 10 years. 'It looks at the extent and diversity of Vi!,:toria's inskill base, something that simply was not it is addressed .under previous governments., The program looks at the development of Melbourne an as an industrial and international commercial centre. It'looks at the location of the Port Phillip region as a major component in transport, distribution and communications for the south-eastern program for the l?art of Australia. I could go on, but my time is limited. Suffice it to say that when one is faced with a choice between two parties, both promulgating their platforms, it is important to look a little further than the nearest advertising gimmick that one can come up with. It is my submission, and I am sure it is supported by most Victorians, that the present Government in Victoria has done a great deal over the last three years and, given the chance, it will be in a position in the next three years to reap some significant rewards for the Victorian economy and to try to set about achieving reasonablrates of employment and growth in the Victorian' economy.
