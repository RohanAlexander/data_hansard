2,Mr LANG,Unknown,"-In the event of this country suddenly becoming' engaged in. .warwith Russia, will the Prime Minister 'state' whether officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service would have power to detain known traitors immediately, or would it be necessary for the Parliament to re-enact the National Security Act before any such action was legal i",12
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"It is obvious that if Australia suddenly becamo involved in war with any country the security provisions of the law would be immediately put into operation. The officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service would make recommendations to the Attorney-General, who would take appropriate action under existing laws, apart altogether from the regulations promulgated under the National Security Act. In the event of an emergency arising sueh as that indicated by the honourable member, comprehensive laws to safeguard the security of Australia would be immediately operative. ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE.",12
4,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"I direct the attention of the Minister for the Army to a report that a board is sitting in Sydney at present for the purpose of selecting cadets for the Royal Military College at Duntroon. Is it true> as reported, that : the board will visit all capital citiesexcept Hobart? If so, can the Ministersay why Tasmania is to be omitted from, the itinerary of theselection board !",12
5,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"I am aware that a committee is to visit the States for the purpose mentioned by the-honourable member, but I did not know that it intended 1 to omit Tasmania from itsitinerary.. Immediately after questions without notice have been disposed of, I shalt ccntact the appropriate authorities toensure that Tasmania shall be included in the itinerary of the committee; DEAF AND DUMB CITIZENS.",12
6,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"I direct a question, to the Minister representing the Minister J. for Health. Ts it'true that deaf and 1 dumb people do not receive an invalidpension? Does the Government extend' to such people therehabilitation training: facilities that are available to invalid pensioners? If not,, will' the Minister consider extending to adult and teen-age deaf and dumb persons whowish to engage in employment, the benefits of the splendid CommonwealtL scheme of rehabilitation' training now given to invalid pensioners?",12
7,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,I cannot speak on this 'subject with any degree of certainty; but I assumethat the benefitsavailable to blind and other invalid pensioner? are alsc available todeaf and dumb people. I shall discuss the subject with the Minister for Health and advisethe honourable member of the position in. due course. NA KEROSENE'.,12
8,Mr ABBOTT,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"Will the Ministerrepresenting the Minister fbr Shipping; and Fuel indicate whether it is true, as reported, that the permitted' sales of liquid fuel's for all oil companies for the year ending the 31st March, 1949-, represent a reduction, as compared with sales for the year ended the 31st March, 1948, of power kerosene amounting to59,528 tons, representing 19.9 per cent., lighting kerosene, 29,290 tons, representing 25.8 per cent., and' distillate fuel, 2,394, representing 2.1 per cent? Is it also true that there is norestriction oni the sale of crude diesel oil, bunker oil and white spirit? If those why are the fuels consumed by farmers in the production of food and those used by open-cut coal operators reduced while the fuels consumed in the cities and for shipping and clothes-cleaning are not restricted? Mr Dedman"" - The nature of the honourable member's question is such it is quite obvious I cannot answer it immediately. I shall refer question to my colleague the Minister for Shipping and Euel and ask him supply an answer. AUSTRALIA DAY.",12
9,Mr HAYLEN,DISTILLATE AND POWER,I direct a question the Minister for Information arising from the following paragraph published recently:At a meeting of the Australian Association of Advertising Agencies held in Sydney were suggestions made that the' Government should organize through the Department Information an annual Greater Australia celebration movement to arrange for proper observance of Anstralia Day. present the day has no significance and regarded by most Australians merely another holiday. Has the Association of Advertising Agencies approached the Minister matter and will he consider the question of co-operating with them for a greater and more significant Australia Day?,13
10,Mr CALWELL,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"I haye been proached by that association and its suggestions are receiving consideration. Various organizations in difTerent States are interested in this matter. One them is the Australian Natives Assomoney ciation, which is a very strong friendly society, particularly in Victoria. society discusses matters of national importance from time to time and daries? hae been very active regarding this particular matter. About a ago it formed an Australia Day Council and engaged the services of General Sir Thomas Blarney to poputhe larize the movement. Various represenThe tations have been made to the Governin ment on this matter and I hope that rising tide of Australian nationalism will ensure that the day which all . tralians regard as their' own particular day shall be fittingly celebrated and fuel longer be regarded, as heretofore, . a* are facts, merely another holiday. TRADE WITH JAPAN.",13
11,Mr FRANCIS,DISTILLATE AND POWER,Some considerable time ago 1 raised with the Prime Minister the question of negotiations with Japan with a view to arriving at a basis os which some trade might be started be that tween the two countries. The Prime Minister answered my question from his memory and said that he would endeavour to supply a fuller answer later. ] to now ask whether he has any further information to impart on that subject?,13
12,Mr CHIFLEY,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"The honourable member's previous question was put to to me the day after the Government had received certain proposals concerning trade' between the two counr tries of an estimated value of aboui £6,000,000 annually in each directhero tion, though there might be a slight balance in favour of Australia. Thr of general arrangement has been made with the SCAP through the Supreme Commander.' At hut I am not able, offhand, to furnish is the details of it . I shall arrange with as the appropriate officers to set out the details as soon as possible and w i ll then have the information supplied to the on this' honourable member. WAR DAMAGEFUND .",13
13,Mrs BLACKBURN,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"Can the Prime apMinister say whether war damage insurance was collected for the Australian Government by local government bodies in the. States during the war? If so, will of the Government consider returning the so collected to the municipalities to enable them to undertake housing That schemes for the accommodation of aged, homeless -.persons within their boun",13
14,Mr CHIFLEY,DISTILLATE AND POWER,"D u r in g the war tht year Government made arrangements through the War Damage Commission, for localgovernment bodies to act as agents for collection of war damage insurance. staffing of regional collecting officeidifferent parts of Australia would have the involved the diversion of man-power from more pressing work and local goAusvernment bodies undertook to collect insurance payments as .a patriotic effort. no No "" tags"" were attached to the offer of the local government bodies, and they carried out the task most ably. As thp honourable member is aware, the Government has already introduced a measuro to divert the accumulated profits from war damage insurance to a reserve fund for payment of war gratuity, and I am afraid that I cannot undertake to make any diversion cf that money into the channel suggested by the honourable member. NA PRISONERS OF WAR . England,",13
15,Mr RANKIN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"Can the Minister for Immigration say whether a nation-wido iearch was commenced early last month for 45 Italian prisoners of war and two German ex-internees whom it was dosired to arrest and deport? is it a fact, as stated in the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that 500 investigation service officers were engaged in the search nnder the direction of the Department ->f Immigration",14
16,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Fiv e hundred security - dfieers?,14
17,Mr RANKIN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,That is the number mentioned in the Sunday Telegraph report. Will the Minister in f o rm the House of the annual cost to taxpayers of the huge army of investigation service officers which is being maintained ? What results were achieved by the search mentioned in the report to which I have referred ?,14
18,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"If we had 500 investigation officers we should have found by now the stolen or forged dc-cuuients about which so much has been aaid recently. The investigation service is much smaller than the report in the ' Sunday Telegraph suggests, [t is true that we have been trying to re-capture the escaped Italian and German prisoners of war and ex-internees, and we intend to deport them from Australia when we apprehend them. None of them will be allowed to remain in this country. C gave ample opportunity tc those who had escaped to surrender themselves. I made two announcements that if they surrendered they would be sent back to It a l y or Germany, as the case required, and could then apply for re-admissicn to Australia as migrants, in which event their applications would be considered. At the same time. I stated that those who did not surrender would be deported summarily and no application for their re-admission to this country could be considered. We are now seeking those prisoners of war and internees who did not surrender. Only yesterday the Acting Leader of the Onposition asked a question concerning two of them, Duerkop and Schmidt. I am referring not to the human bloodhound from New but to the particular persons whose arrest we desire to effect. Following mention of those persons yesterday departmental officers called on the news editor pf the Sydney Sun, Mr K in g, and interI f so, viewed him. They tried to glean some information regarding the whereabouts of the two men whe were reported to be working in Sydney",14
19,Mr HARRISON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,On e is a jeweller and the other is working in a leather works.,14
20,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"The Sydney Sun had made the statement that they were so employed. Mr K in g told my officers that the reporter who wrote the article was away from Sydney and would not be back before the end of the week. He said that he would question the reporter on his return, but he expected that it would not be until Monday or Tuesday of next week that he would be in a position to supply any further information. My officers pointed out that they required the. information urgently and that sucb a delay would not be helpful in tryin g to trace Duerkop and Schmidt, who would be already awaro of the disclosure that they were in Sydney and that the authorities were searching for them there. The officers accordingly asked Mr K in g to give them the reporter'sname and hie present address, so that an officer of the department could interview him at once. However, Mr K in g refused to divulge the reporter's name or his whereabouts, but promised that if contact could be made he would question the reporter and then advise our office. It is obvious therefore that my officers w i ll be getting little or no assistance from the Sydne\ Sun on the matter. They left the interview with that feeling. PISHING.",14
21,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"Is the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction aware that damage of about £8,500 was done to fishing fleets in South Anstralia during the violent storm last Sunday and Monday? Government members may smile but",15
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,The honourable member must ccmplete his - question.,15
23,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"Is the Minister prepared to consider further the matter of providing boat harbour facilities for the fishing fleets'? I point out that it is of no use to send a newsletter monthly to the fishermen in my electorate telling them how to catch more fish, which the Minister said should be done, if the Commonwealth is not prepared to do something to protect boats which they - require to carry on that work.  - honourable member's question",15
24,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,The Minister has said that increased efforts should be made to cateh more fish and has tried to advise them how to do it.,15
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"The honourable member must cease interrupting; when he asks a question he should - at least have the courtesy to listen to a reply.  ally disturbed at the damage suffered by the fisherman in those storms. As I understand the situation, the responsibility for providing adequate harbour accommodation on the coasts of the various States is the duty of the respective State governments, and not that of the Australian Government. I understand that tliere is provision in the Federal Aid Eoads and Works Act, which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, whereby in certain circumstances mon^y may be allocated for the provision of shelters for fishing fleets. If the honourable gentleman were to direct a qnestion to my colleague regardingthat aspect of the matter, I am sure that he would be given a most satisfactory ;answer. ONIONS.",15
26,Mr HAMILTON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I have received from the Western Australian Onion Marketing Board a communication concerning the export of onions. Is the Minister aware that Victorian onions imported into Western Australia are being exported from Eremantle to Singapore, with the approval of the export division of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture? Is he further aware that, because these onions were pruned of quite lengthy shoots before shipment, they would continue to shoot during the journey to Singapore, where they undoubtedly would arrive in bad condition? As Western Australian onion-growers were financially affected last year as a result of the Ceylon authorities having placed an embargo on Australian onions, because the export of poor quality onions had - been permitted from the eastern States, will the Minister investigate this matterand ensure that steps will be taken to prevent damage to Australian markets, to the detriment of the Western Australian onion-growers ?  would it be constitutional, for the Australian Government to attempt to prevent the shipment of onions from one State to another, and I am sure that the honourable member will agree that such action should not be taken. In view of the fact that the onions mentioned were Victorian onions, which have established a good reputation overseas, I see no reason to prohibit their free export from another State, provided that they are in such condition as to be fit for export. But 1 remind the honourable gentleman that inspection of onions to determine fitness for export is carried out. by officers of the Departments of Agriculture in the respective States. If there has been any remissness in this instance, it will be a matter for consideration whether it has been due to neglect on the part of the State officers. However, I should not imagine that there has been any neglect on the part of such officers. I shall make further inquiries into the matter. IMMIGRATION .",15
27,Mr BEALE,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,I am informed that an Australian National Airways Skymaster aeroplane flew to Italy about the 2nd October to bring Italian migrants to Australia and that that aeroplane was under charter to the Australian Government. I am ' also informed that that aeroplane left Australia empty. I ask the Minister for Immigration whether these are the true facts?,16
28,Mr SCULLY,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Facts ?,16
29,Mr BEALE,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I ask whether these statements are true. ""Was that aeroplane under charter to the Australian Government, and was it permitted to go empty to Italy to bring Italian migrants to this country? If so, can the Minister inform the House of the circumstances, and explain how it was that Italian migrants were brought by air to Australia ptjof to British people who are waiting in England to come here? Why was that aeroplane permitted to fly empty rather than carry passengers, or food parcels to Great Britain?",16
30,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I am not much of a purist in language, but a statement is either a fact or not a fact. If a is true it must be a fact, and the honourable gentleman has not got his facts right. I am sorry that he has raised this matter in such a way as to create the suggestion of xenophobia in the minds of some people in this country. No aeroplane has been chartered by the Australian Government to bring any foreign nationals or any British migrants to Australia. We have used the magnificent Convair aeroplanes which Trans-Australia Airlines purchased, to bring British migrants to Australia. I understand, subject to correction by my colleague the Minister for Air, that two Convairs are leaving Great Britain today with British migrants for this country. Aeroplanes do leave Australia under charter to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and other non-governmental bodies to bring people here. Those aeroplanes leave this country empty because the Australian Government is not going to allow charter flights to interfere with the ordinary activities of Qantas Empire Airways Limited and such organizations",16
31,Mr BEALE,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Coul d not such aeroplanes be used to transport food parcels to Great Britain?,16
32,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"In some instances they are used for that purpose, but in no instance are they permitted to carry passengers. People who travel by those aeroplanes have their fares paid by relatives in Australia. No governmental assistance is afforded to them at all. It is purely a private deal. I am glad to see those migrants coming here. They are coming to relatives who have guaranteed them accommodation in their own homes and undertaken to And them employment in this country. Many of them are going to work in the sugar industry in Queensland. Others will go to the irrigation areas, wnere they will help to produce food which, if not needed in Australia, will be available for shipment to Great Britain. We want many more people in Australia. If the honourable member proposes to ask any more questions of this kind I advise him to come and see me first.",16
33,Mr HAMILTON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"Will the Minister thing for Immigration say whether it is the intention of the Government to transport 100 migrants from Britain to Australia on the delivery flights of four of the five Convair aircraft that were purchased by Trans-Australia Airlines? Will each of these migrants be required to pay a fare of £260 sterling, or any fare at all? If so, will the Minister inform the House why the Government considers it to be necessary to turn the transport of migrants into a money-making venture for Trans-Australia Airlines, and why desirable migrants who cannot afford to pay such fares are not given first preference in the allocation of seats in aircraft travelling to Australia on delivery flights?",16
34,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"As I announced in reply to the honourable member for Parramatta a few moments ago, the Australian Government is using the magnificent Convair aircraft that were purchased by Trans-Australia Airlines for the purpose of bringing, on their initial flight to Australia, some migrants to this country. The fares that will be charged to the migrants who travel on the machines will be those that would ordinarily be charged less the amounts that would be - paid by the British Government and the Australian Government respectively, if the persons had travelled by sea. This is not a nioney-nwiking venture.",16
35,Mr HAMILTON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Will the money go to Trans-Australia Airlines?,17
36,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"The money will be paid to Trans-Australia Airlines. If we can utilize seats in these aircraft to more people to Australia, it is right and proper that we should do so. It would be ridiculous if the aircraft travelled from the United Kingdom to Australia without passengers when they could be filled with people who can afford to pay the fare that I have indicated. The Australian Government is under no obligation to fly any person to Australia free of charge. The migrants who come to this country under the assisted passages schemes pay something, and the British and Australian Governments also pay something. There is nothing in the mistaken idea of the honourable member that we are trying to make Trans-Australia Airlines pay by bringing people from the United Kingdom in these four Convair aircraft. Trans-Australia Airlines is becoming a very profitable organization, and will shortly be paying its way. As a matter of fact, it will soon beat its competitors out of the skies entirely. We shall bring as many migrants as we can by air to this country under this scheme and T also hope, under another scheme that is at present being negotiated. I am sorry if the honorabie gentleman feels that we should work on such an equalitarian basis that, although a person can afford to pay for a passage from the United Kingdom to Australia by air, he must nevertheless take his place at the back of a queue of persons who are waiting for berths on ships. BROADCASTING.",17
37,Mr DUTHIE,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General say whether it is true that Dr Keith Barry, federal controller of programmes for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, has been nominated by the Australian Government to represent Australia at a meeting convened in Paris by Unesco of broadcasting experts representing eighteen nations? What i9 the nature of the conference? Will Dr Burry investigate overseas programme arrangements, and bring back new ideas for the Australian Broadcasting Comniission from the British Broadcasting Corporation and other organizations?",17
38,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I believe that Dr Keith Barry has been appointed a delebring gate to the conference convened in Paris by Unesco. I understand that approval for his attendance at the conference was given by my colleague, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, on the advice of the Commonwealth Office of Education. I shall ask the Postmaster-General to provide me with answers to the questions asked by the honourable member, and I shall let him have the information as soon as possible.",17
39,Mr MCEWEN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I ask the Prime Minister a question which is founded upon a report that Mr R. A. King, M.L.C, a director of 2KY, a radio station in New South Wales, announced a decision by his board of directors in these termsThe Government has suggested that it is going to nationalize radio, so it would not pay us to purchase property for new studios. In view of this announcement, by a leading Labour personality, of a decision not to proceed with the expansion of the radio station owned by the Labour party because of an authoritative report that the Government intends to nationalize radio, will the Prime Minister state whether it is the policy and intention of the Government to nationalize commercial radio stations?",17
40,Mr CHIFLEY,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I have not seen the statement attributed to Mr King. I announced in this House a few days ago that the proposed legislation which had been recommended to the Parliamentary Labour party, and which, of course, will not come before the Parliament until the party has made its decision, had nothing to do with the nationalization of radio stations.",17
41,Mr FRANCIS,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Not yet!,17
42,Mr CHIFLEY,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Peopl e who gaze into the crystal ball always have an advantage over line. 1 assure the honourable member that the nationalization of radio stations has not been considered by the Government. ARMED EORCES. AUSTRALIANS LN JAPAN : HOUBINII FOR RETURN rao FAM I LIES.,17
43,Mr RYAN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"H as the Minister for the Army seen a report in this morning's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald in which it was stated that a woman, who had just returned from Japan with her daughter on the ship Duntroon, intended to "" squat"" on the vessel until the Army had honoured its promise to find her a home? Can the Minister say what specific promises in regard to housing were made in this and similar cases ? Is it true, as stated by Major A. C. I r w in , officer in charge of personnel arriving from Japan, that the Army had agreed to find accommodation for all who intended returning from Japan, but that sometimes objection was raised to the kind of accommodation offered? AVhat kind of accommodation has been offered, and in what locality?",18
44,Mr CHAMBERS,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"It is true that the A r m y arranged to provide accommodation for those wives and families of members of the occupation force who returned from Japan if they have not homes of their own to go to. accommodation offered is in guest houses, hotels, & c , and I have not previously heard that objection had been taken to it . It is the only kind of accommodation available. Because of the difficulty of providing accommodation for returning families, the Government has decided not to send any more wives and families to Japan: SOIL EROSION.",18
45,Mr BLAIN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. In his capacity as Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, he has, f presume, some control over the Waite Institute in South Australia. My question relates to the dust cloud which has enveloped the eastern areas of Australia during the last few days, and which received much publicity in the press. In view of the damage caused by overstocking of the western areas of New South Wales, northern South Australia and the channel country of western Queensland-a n area which it is proposed to over-develop still more-ca n the Minister say whether Professor Prescott, a well-known authority on soil erosion is in Australia at present, wil l he arrange for the professor to be seconded to in vestigate the problem, and if possible lay down a comprehensive policy to combat erosion in the central areas of the continent, where the rainfall does not exceed five inches a year ?",18
46,Mr DEDMAN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"When the honourable member began to ask this question, ""I thought that he was about to add to the various criticisms of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which had been voiced recently in this chamber, and to blame that organization for having been the cause of the recent dust clouds over the eastern States. Offhand, I am not able to inform the honourable member whether Professor Prescott is in Australia at the present time. I believe that he is, but I shall obtain that information for the honourable gentleman. The honourable member has also asked that Professor Prescott be seconded to some unspecified body for the purpose of recommending practical measures to combat soil erosion, but I noticed The that, in asking his question, he mentioned certain parts of the Commonwealth, including western New South Wales, south-western Queensland and the northern part of South Australia. Primarily, the responsibility for preventing soil erosion in those areas rests with the respective State governments, and if they require the services of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research as an organization, or any of its officers, they should make a request to the Australian Government in the usual way.",18
47,Mr THOMPSON,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Professo r Prescott is a State officer.,18
48,Mr DEDMAN,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"That is so. He has been associated with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in the conduction of various experiments, but he is not an officer of that body. The proper proctdure is for the State governments concerned to approach the Australian Government with a request, for the services of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Besearch, as an organization, to combat soil erosion. If the States adopt that procedure, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Besearch may enlist the services of Professor Prescott or any other State officers who have been associated with it in that kind of work. HMAS. KANIMBLA. Air. WHITE - Las t week, I asked the Minister for the Navy a question about ELECTORAL an incident in which ratings of HMAS. Kanimbla were involved in Genoa, in the following papers:Italy. One Australian naval, rating was killed, and others, were injured. Has the Minister for Immigration seen a later report to the effect that the captain of HMAS. Kanimbla was threatened with firearms, beaten and thrown into gaol? The Minister for the Navy did not have that information .when I addressed my earlier question to him, but in the meanAustralia time HMAS. Kanimbla has arrived at by an Australian port and additional inand formation may be available about the inpointed cident. Until the matter is fully investisaid gated and the Italian Government makes tember, suitable amends, will the Minister for Immigration consider the imposition of sanctions against ex-enemy Italian except migrants, and refuse landing permits, them ?",18
49,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,The honourable member is prejudging the matter on a newspaper report.,19
50,Mr WHITE,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,Does not the Minister lieve the report?,19
51,Mr CALWELL,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I believe very little of what I read in the press, and I am not the only person in this country who is opinion that newspaper reports are generally spiced with prejudice and misof information. The Minister for the Navy has advised me that an official report not yet been received from the captain of HMAS. Kanimbla or the Naval Board. Unfortunately, an Australian naval rating was killed in the incident Genoa. That fatality was most regrettable. Nobody will sympathize with the action of any person who was responsible for his death, even if it occurred in hot blood in the midst of a brawl, no matter who was responsible for the brawl. long-range 1I have the natural, prejudice that all of us have in favour of Australians, whatever may happen to them anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, in a matter of this sort, we must wait until we get the official report.

Has he also seen the report evidence to the effect that the installation of long-range radar equipment would has be a valuable contribution to the safety of the present flight control system? As some time may elapse before the report of the court of inquiry is presented to at the Government, and as safe flying is of paramount importance, will the Minister take immediate action to increase the staff at Mascot airport as suggested, and or will he state, what the Government intends to do about the suggestion that radar equipment be installed ?",19
54,Mr DRAKEFORD,KSCAPED INTERNEESAN D,"I have seen several press reports of evidence that been given at the court of inquiry into the Lutana accident, but I do not regard what I read in the newspapers as authoribut tative.

Whilst statements may be made about shortages or the adequacy of certain safety provisions, am of the opinion that the safety operations in Australia has been proved. That does not suggest that the system is infallible and, if improvements can made to increase safety, I shall be pared to take action to have them, made without delay.

They are not the in that countiy as indentured labour. They went there of their own volition. They assisted in very important wartime jobs. They are earning good money the in important positions. They carry Australian passports, and have not offended any way against the laws of either this country or the United States of reAmerica; yet the Minister temporarily charge of the Department of Immigration has issued instructions that are tantamount to extradition orders. The are to be dragged back from the United States of America. Australian representatives in that country are being used in exactly the same manner as the Russian diplomatic representatives were used in the two recent incidents concerning Soviet schoolin New York who were ordered back to Moscow. Those incidents caused friction, and eliminated in one of the teachers jumping out of a window aud the Soviet consul getting Iii* mar-cning orders from the Government of the United States of America to leave that country. How can we uxpect American puiblic opinion to differentiate between the Australian and Russian incidents? In both cases those immediately concerned had expressed a preference to remain in the TJnited States and their respective governments attempted to force them back to their own countries. Is CalweU attitude any different from that adopted by the Eussians? Equally grave in the substance of the charges levelled this Minister of the Chifley Government against the TJnited States administration. The American authorities have been accused of breaking an agreement, but, so far, no evidence has been produced that such an agreement ever existed. As to the existence of an agreement we have only the say-so of this Minister of the Chifley Government. Yet the American State Department, the American Army and four other United States Government departments have been directly involved by these wild, unsubstantiated charges of had faith. No Minister of any Australian government has the right to sign any agreement interfering with the free movement of Australian nationals. This is not the Soviet Union, and thank God, we are not yet behind the iron curtain. So, if the Chifley Government signed any agreement with an officer of the American Army, it did so in complete violation of ihe constitutional rights of the Australian citizens involved. That phase of this country's history ceased with the ending of the Kanaka trade. The liberties of Australian nationals are not to be bartered away hy a Minister or by a government as if our people were merely cattle. By recklessly accusing the American Government of violating the text of an agreement, and by directly involving responsible American public servants employed at the American Embassy at Canberra, without a scintilla of evidence to support these charges, the Chifley Government is destroying the goodwill developed between the two nations by the close association of war. Such action is a slur on Labour's own former leader, Mr Curtin, who offered the hand of comradeship to the United itr. Lang. States of America when he appealed for help in his broadcast directed to that nation when things looked black in the South Pacific. He, too, made commitments that are being recklessly violated by the actions of the Minister for Immigration. The Chifley Government is repudiating the commitments made by the Curtin Government. If the Minister gets his way, and these women are dragged out of jobs in the United States, the it will be at the cost of the loss of American public opinion. The only difference between the Australian girls and by the Eussian women is that onr girls are typists and the Russians were teachers. These lime-lighting tactics of the Minister come at a most inopportune time. They happen at a time when grave doubts are being expressed by the United States Government whether Australia is a good security risk. Apart altogether from the source of certain documents produced in this cliamber recently, there is certain knowledge that their contents were authentic and that the Government of the United States has its doubts of us. The United States Government is fully informed of Communist activities in thiF country. Its congressional committee inf vestigating communism recently reported that some of the leading enemies of the United States of America came from Australia. The American Embassy in Canberra would be remiss in its duty if it failed to report to Washington that the decisions in relation to these Australian girls were made not by the Parliament but by the Minister for Immigration and the Chifley Government. If these matters are not reported it is well that this Parliament should make clear to the United States of America that the Parliament as a whole does not approve of the Minister's actions. There is a feeling in the United States of America that Australia is not to be trusted and that the Australian Government and the Minister for Immigration are irresponsible. The Minister should be curbed immediately. His impetuosity should be restrained. He should be prevented from further injuring the good relations that exist between the two nations. He should withdraw his affronts to the American State Department. The Australian girls should be allowed to remain in the United States of America without ministerial interference. Even more urgently, the Chifley Government should clear out the Communists, that it admits are employed in key security departments. Then the way will be clear to re-establish good relations with America. Finally, is the Minister for Immigration in charge of the international affairs policy of Australia? I challenge the Prime Minister to say whether he endorses the Minister's action. Has the right honourable gentleman abdicated in favour of the Minister for Immigration? If the Prime Minister remains silent, it is obvious that the Minister for Immigration directs the Government and that his policy prevails. The Parliament should be informed whether the Minister for Immigration consulted the Cabinet on this matter or whether both the Cabinet and the Prime Minister are dragged in as consenting parties to every brawl in which the Minister involves the Government. Finally, in particular, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister and the Cabinet endorse the following statement made by the Minister in this House last week:There would huve been no trouble if the United States Army si uthorities had honoured the obligation they had entered into . I see no reason why I should make it easier fur anybody, particularly the representatives "" f a great power, to escape the obligations which they entered into with the Government of this country. The Prime Minister must either answer that, or be silent. If he is silent, then country will know the inference to draw from his silence.",20
60,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for I m m gration) 111.30] - Accordin g to information that I have received, the motion which the cliamber is debating was intended to be placed before the House yesterday. It a]jpears, however, that the honourable meinber for Eeid (Mr Lang) was not able to obtain the necessary support from the Opposition to make it advisable for him to submit the motion at thnt stage. There has been a considerable amonnt of maiucuvring around the corridors of the House to ensure that there would be a sufficient number of members opposite who would rise to support such a worthless and ridiculous motion.",22

62,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"-It is significant that not one member of the Liberal party rose to support the motion, and that those members of the Australian Country party who did so were so ashamed of their action that instead of standing straight up like men they rose in simian fashion, using their hands to propel themselves upwards.

63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,Onh-r. ',22
64,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"The motion, which has been placed formally before the House, is without substance and i * designed, not to promote good relations with the United States of America, but rather to poison them. Those honourable members of the Australian Country party who have lent themselves to this man03uvre today have every reason to be ashamed of the part they have played. Let us consider the content of this motion. It deals with the question of the alleged impairment of friendly relations between the United States of America and Australia. The girls are dragged in only as an afterthought, the whole emphasis being placed upon the alleged impairment of good relationship. As I stated recently, Australia's relations with America are so good that we can afford to be perfectly frank in discussions relating to our mutual problems. Wc have not, damaged the our relations with America by representing to the United States authorities that agreements, expressed and implied, which were entered into by their reprei - sentatives in Australia, should have effect given to them.",22
65,Mr MCEWEN,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,T'h e frankness is very one-sided.,22
66,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"AV e on our part are perfectly frank at all times, and the American authorities also have always been frank and helpful. The American Embassy has in its files a copy of a letter sent to the Australian Government by Mr Harold Shantz, who was counsellor at the American Embassy at Canberra when Mr Butler was Ambassador, in which he acknowledged that an agreement in regard to those girls existed. There were both oral and other agreements between Mr John Minter and American army officers and myself. Everybody knew that the arrangement was that the girls should leave Australia for a period of six months to serve with the American forces and then be returned to Australia at the - expense of the American army. An explicit undertaking was given that during that period of six months the American authorities would train their own girls to take the places of the Australian girls. The Australian Government did not disturb that arrangement even at the end of six months, but allowed it to continue. Almost two years passed before the Government officially raised the matter of the return of the girls. There would have been no publicity in respect of this matter had it not been for the action of the Melbourne Herald in either ""cracking "" a cable or stealing a telegram and using it as the basis of a story. The information used could only have been obtained from a cablegram from the Australian Government to the Australian Embassy in the United States; or from one sent by that Embassy to the Australian Government. No other document existed upon which Melbourne Herald could have based its story, and I may state that the Government has not completed its investigations as to how the newspaper obtained the information on which its story rested. The proudest day of my life will be that on which I see the editor of the Melbourne Herald in the dock charged under that section of the Crimes Act which provides for seven years gaol without the option. I personally would also like to see punishment meted out to other people who have used stolen documents which deal with our relations with the United States of America. As I stated, those girls left Australia with the full knowledge of the conditions attaching'to their employment by the Americans. If tbose conditions were not satisfactory to them they could have said that they did not desire to go. They went however, and they have no right to alter the conditions which were made between the Governments of Australia and the United States of America, and which were not agreements made with the girls Mr Calwell. themselves. They knew that the American army would return them in due course to Australia. The American army authorities at Guam returned about 100 Australian men and women who served there with them, and on that occasion, no attempt was made in this house by honourable members opposite or their de facto leader the honourable member for Reid, to drag the poison cart around this chamber and thus impair, or try to impair, our relations with the United States of America. The honourable member for Reid publishes in Sydney a newspaper known as the Century, which is the most violently antiAmerican publication in this country. .During the war, through the columns of this newspaper, the honourable member attacked General MACArthur to as great a degree as the censorship provisions would allow.",22
67,Mr ANTHONY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"I rise to order. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, called the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) to order and declared that he must adhere to the terms of the motion. I submit that the Minister is now departing very widely from its terms.",23
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"The honourable member for Reid spoke of the impairment of relations with the United States of America. The Minister is entitled to show that the honourable member's actions in the past were along certain lines, but he is not entitled to deal with that aspect at great length. So far, however, the Minister is in order.",23
69,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"I have only adopted the police court tactic of showing the bad faith of the propounder of the motion which refers to the impairment of our friendly relations with the United States of America. The honourable member for Reid is the last person entitled to talk about friendly relations with America because he has never wanted them to continue. He, and others associated with him, hate the name of America and hate to be reminded of what America has done for the defence of Australia. The pretext on which the honourable member moved his resolution does not exculpate him from his guilt over the war years and up till recent times in the matter of impairing friendly relations with the United States of America. The arguments which he used about a security risk are beside the point. The American authorities, on the ambassadorial level, the military level, the consular level or on any other authoritative level, have never aaid anything to - this country regarding any of the matters canvassed by the honourable member for Reid. The Government has always been proud of its relations with the United States of America, and realizes that without that country's assistance in the Pacific in the year's that lie ahead Aus- expense. tralia has little hope of happiness or prosperity. Australia needs to shelter under the broad wing of the American eagle if it is to survive, and everything that has been done by the Government bas been done in good faith, and with the desire to reach a quick and satisfactory settlement of any problems that may exist between the two countries. The Government's action in asking the American authorities to return those girls to Australia was reasonable and all the attempts made by the press and certain honourable members in this chamber, particularly-some members of the Australian Country party and the honourable member for Reid, to stir up trouble on the issue are damaging to Australia's good name and can only give satisfaction to those who are enemies of both America and Australia. The Government has done nothing of which it has reason to be ashamed. It certainly has not impaired friendly relations with America and has no intention of doing so. Only those who continue, either for political or other reasons, to talk! the nonsense that has been talked here today. are guilty of impairing such relations or trying to do so. Mr Gur.LETT -""Will the Minister tell us why it was decided to bring these girls home?",23
70,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"I have already told the honourable member that, in the first instance, an agreement was made that the girls were to remain abroad for six months, and, in the meantime, Americans were to be trained to take their places. We allowed those girls to remain abroad for two years.",24
71,Mr ANTHONY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,Why has the Minister raised the matter now?,24
72,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"We wanted the matter settled because some of the girls now find themselves stranded and are appealing to the Australian Government to bring them back. In one unhappy instance, to which I have already referred, we shall probably be involved in heavy expenditure in returning the girl to Australia. I have not the slightest doubt that ultimately all those girls will approach the Australian Government and ask to be brought back at its",24
73,Mr WHITE,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,Canno t the Government make a new agreement with them ?,24
74,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"-The Government does. not run away from its agreements, and it accepts full responsibility for what it does.",24
75,Mr WHITE,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,I did not mean that,24
76,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"I think that I know what the honourable member had in mind. The honourable member is suggesting that the Government might very well adopt the attitude of saying to the girls, "" You are over there now, and it does not matter to us what happens to you"".",24
77,Mr WHITE,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,That is not at all what I had in mind. I was thinking of the way in which service personnel are discharged after a war.,24
78,Mr CALWELL,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"The American authorities have not expressed any disagreement with or dissent from the action taken by the Australian Government. If there is any concern in the minds of American authorities it is at the press campaign which has played up the matter, not in order to serve the interests of the girls or to, improve relations between the United States of America and this country, but in order to cause trouble. In conclusion, I congratulate members of the Liberal party on their sanity, political acumen and good sense in having refrained from associating themselves with the motion now before the House, which was initiated by the de facto Leader of the Australian Country party, and who may also be the de facto Leader of the Opposition.",24
79,Mr GULLETT,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"Henty) [11.43] - It Las been an interesting experience to hear the Minister for Information and Immigration (Mr Calwell) defend the action of the Government, which has ordered the girls to return to Australia, and to listen to his assertion that at any time the Government of Australia or of any other country has the right to say to any of its citizens working abroad, ""Now is the time when you must come home"", because no honourable member has had more to say about human rights - than the Minister. It is ironical that the Minister should adopt such an attitude, because he is the Minister responsible for attracting people to Australia from other countries. How will the Department of Immigration function, and how will the Government settle this country, if governments abroad, act as be has acted in this matter? How we are going to attract people to Australia and keep them here if other governments are to be free to say to the Australian Government at any time. "" You must send all our nationals home""? In fact, we had a recent example of that when the Communist Government of Yugoslavia arbitrarily recalled some 5,000 Yugoslav nationals who were living in Australia. As honourable members realise, their sudden withdrawal from our country was a serious matter for Australia. It is outrageous that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Immigration, should take the stand which they have taken in this matter. The only other countries in the world which adopt a similar attitude are Russia and Yugoslavia, which are under Comniunist domination. Furthermore. I consider that the taken by the Minister, who has the port of the Governinent, in this constitutes a breach of the fundamental rights of the people. Those rights expressly guaranteed by the Atlantic Charter and by the Charter of the TJnited Nations which provides that a citizen of any country has the right to leave his country and work wherever he likes, proI vided that he engages in honourable ployment and his action is not such to prejudice his country's security. I remind honourable members that the present Government, and particularly the Minister, have paid lip service to that principle again and again. Not verylong ago twenty or thirty young Australians who were members of the Eureka Youth League, or some other youth movement, went to Yugoslavia to work on the construction of a railway line in thai country. It was revealed that their real purpose in going to Yugoslavia was to V indoctrinated in the techniques of communism, and that unfortunately they will seek to put into practice those technique? on their return to this country. The matter was brought to the attention of the Minister at the time, and in thtcourse of his defence of the attitude adopted by the Government in the matter he said, in effect"" This is not a Comniunist government. I will be quite honest about it "" . He also said"" We deplore young people going abroad l . "" learn Coinmunist techniques, but at the same time it is none of onr business where our nationals go provided they do not infringe the law. They have a right to go where they like "". The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). who supported the Minister's attitude on that occasion, made similar statements when he was questioned regarding thivisits of Mr Sharkey, the well-known Communist, to Malaya, India and other places. The present Government, which has stated repeatedly that it is not entitled to interfere with the freedom of movemem of its citizens, and has refused to do so in the case I have cited, did not hesitate to intervene in this instance and dictate to these girls. The circumstances surrounding the departure of these girls from Australia have been outlined by both the Minister action for Immigration and by the honorsupable member for Reid (Mr Lang). matter, The girls went abroad with the United States forces to assist in are carrying out essential work after the war. They were to return to Australia after six months, and I admit at once that, the Minister allowed them to remain abroad for a considerably longer period. t is true that most of them have returned emto Australia, but others have remained as abroad. Undoubtedly, they had in mind their right as citizens of a. free nation to go where they wanted and to work for a country which had been onr ally. Of course, in refusing to return to Australia they defied the Minister. They apparently believed that they could go where they pleased. They had their passports extended, and went from the Philippines to the TJnited States, where they continued to defy the Minister. They insisted on their normal civilian right to live and work where they wished. But now is the Minister's opportunity. Now his opportunity has come. Those girls have 'defied him; now they shall suffer for it ! Look at the steps he has taken. First of all, he wrote to the Government of the TJnited States and asked that the.girls be dismissed from their employment. That is a nice thing for a governinent which has assured us, time after time, that people have a right r,o work wherever they wish! The members of the Government pay continual lip service to the workers. Let it apply the principle of freedom to these girls, ft is despicable for a Minister of the Commonwealth to write to a foreign government about a few unfortunate girls working for their living in that country, seeking to have them dismissed from their employment. The girls have passports, nothing can be said against them, and they are a credit to their country; yet the Minister has now begun negotiations to have them extradited from America. I cannot criticize his action too strongly. 1 also want to say something about the means which the Minister has employed to achieve his purpose, and the manner in which he has defended his action in this House. He has not hesitated to throw the blame on the Government of the TJnited States of America. He referred to agreements and to breaches of agreements made with our war-time ally, the TJnited States of America. He deplored the friction which he alleged members of the Opposition were creating between the two Governments in this matter. The explanation is that the Minister found himself in a corner when he was called upon to defend his action in this matter, and he did not care what lie said. He knows that the differences between the Governments of the United States of America and this country have attracted great interest and have received considerable publicity aibroad. A great deal . of publicity has also beeu given to the matter by the Communist presses of Russia and its satellite countries. The Minister's conduct is worse than irresponsible and despicable; it is cowardly, because yesterday he reflected, by innuendo, on the girls. Yesterday, the lionorable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) asked him a question about a Mrs Garrett, one of the Australian girls who married a United States lieutenant in the island of Guam. She was one of those ordered home. ""When she sent a reply-paid cablegram to the Minister, he did not reply, and she had to return. On her arrival in Australia, as the Minister told us yesterday, she was told, "" You can either go back to Guam to your husband, or he can come to Australia "". The Minister implied that this marriage had beeu broken up through no fault of his. The truth of the matter is that the man was a serving officer who could not come to Australia. He was ordered back to the United States. What was the use of this girl returning to Guam when her husband was no longer there? It is futile for the Minister to say that although he does not wish to go into the matter, he is acting in the best interest of the girls. It has been said that some of the girls were in trouble there. Even if they were in trouble, I hold that they have the right to remain abroad. If they get into trouble that, is their business. The Minister should not set himself up as an arbiter of morality and people's interests before issuing them with passports or permits to go abroad, and passports having been issued to them, they should be permitted to stay abroad.",25
80,Mr CHIFLEY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11,52] - I shall deal very briefly with this matter, concerning which there has been more hypocrisy by the honourable memher for Reid (Mr Lang) than I have ever before known in this House.",26
81,Mr WHITE,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,That is not a sufficient answer.,26
82,Mr CHIFLEY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"The honourable member for Reid has done more to promote ill-feeling between the United States of America and Australia, and between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, than has any other person in this country. During the war period, journals that he controlled indulged in a campaign of hatred of people from the United Kingdom. I rose merely to support what the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) said and not with the object of carrying this argument between Australia and the United States of America to international levels. The honourable member for Eeid asked whether I accept responsibility in this matter. I support the Minister. On one occasion the Minister came to me, accompanied by a representative df ' the American Embassy in Australia, who inquired on behalf of the American army authorities whether the Government would permit certain girls, who were then employed by them, to go abroad and work for the American army. The Government was averse to the girls going abroad for that purpose because difficulties had arisen from time to time, when girls who had gone abroad had subsequently become stranded, and all sorts of pathetic and sentimental reasons have been advanced why they should be repatriated at government expense. I discussed the matter fully with the Minister and the American representative. It was requested that girls should be permitted to go abroad for six months, at the end of which period suitable female assistance would be forthcoming from America to release them. At the time the American army authorities were experiencing difficulty in procuring female assistants from the United States of America. Despite what honourable members have said about a written agreement and other matters, I assure the House that the American authorities gave a complete assurance to the Minister and me .that within six months, the Americans would ohtain their own citizens to carry on the work when the Australian girls would be returned to Australia. That was a completely clear arrangement, with which the girls themselves were in agreement. It is only reasonable that an agreement of that character should be honoured.",26
83,Mr ANTHONY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,Were the girls a party to the agreement? Ifr. Ohifle}/.,27
84,Mr CHIFLEY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,The girls distinctly understood the conditions under which they were going.,27
85,Mr ABBOTT,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,Hav e they signed the agreement ?,27
86,Mr CHIFLEY,RECALL OF AUSTEALIA N,"It is not a matter of signing an agreement. The honourable member for Eeid suggested that the Minister has no right to sign any agreement, or to make any agreement involving the movement of Australian nationals. Frequently, however, the honourable member suggests that the Minister should refuse to issue passports to certain persons who desire to leave the country. Have honourable members ever before heard of such hypocrisy? That is entirely the reverse of what the honourable gentleman is asking the Minister to do today. I wish merely to make clear what the Minister has already said about the girls. The understanding between the representative of the American authorities and the Australian Government was a gentlemen's agreement. I do not claim that the American Department of State knew all about it, but the representative of the American Embassy here, on behalf of the American army authorities, certainly entered into a simple gentlemen's agreement, of which the girls were fully conuizant. There is one thing I do like, and that is that people should keep their word. Nothing more than that is asked should be done in this instance. The whole matter could have been straightened out quite amicably if it had been left to the Minister and the American authorities to handle. The reason that this was not done is that there was something about it which could be used for political purposes. When some people talk ahout relations between America and Australia, they do not really care what the relations .are, so long as they achieve political publicity, which they hope will react to the detriment of the Government. I shall not enlarge on that except to make it perfectly clear that, in conjunction with the Minister, I was a party to the arrangement made in regard to tiis matter, which was a gentlemen's agreement-o r a ladies' agreement. The Government does not propose to enter into a lengthy discussion on the matter. Motion (by Mr SCULLY) agreed toThat the question be now put. Original question resolved in the negative. NA CONSOLIDATION BILL 1948. SECOND EEADING. Debate resumed from the .12th October (vide page 1468), on motion by Mr. HOLLOWAYThat the bill be now read a second time.  warmly commend the Government for troducing this ""measure to liberalize social service payments at an additional cost to Consolidated Eevenue of £15,000,000 a year. No doubt, some will say that an expenditure of £80,000,000 for social services for hospital, pharand maceutical and tuberculosis benents, addition to the present expenditure of teen years. £10,000,000, is more than the country can afford; but the Labour Government can take great pride in the fact that it has so consistently and generously pursued its policy of liberalizing social service benents that today its expenditure on social services is £90,000,000 annually compared with an annual expenditure of £17,000,000 when it assumed office seven years ago, or an increase of (-73,000,000 annually. When the Gomeasure vernment assumed office in 1941 the only social services provided by the Parliathe ment were old-age and invalid pensions, maternity allowances and child endowguarantee ment. The Government has not only greatly liberalized those classes of benefits, but has also introduced benefits for wives and children of invalid pensioners, funeral benefits, pensions for widows deserted wives and women whose husbands are inmates of prisons or mental institutions, and unemployment, sickness, hospital, tuberculosis and pharmaceutical benefits. As honourable members aTe aware, the Government also has well under way its plan for a national .scheme. The people of this country, cluding even the political opponents the Government, must agree that it has taken Australia much further along mad to social security than has any government in the history of the Commonwealth. When the Menzies Government was defeated in October, 1941, the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions was £1 ls. 6d. a week, whereas under this measure those pensions will be increased to £2 2s. 6d. a week, or an increase of nearly 100 per cent. At the same time, child endowment is being increased by 2s. 6d. a week to 10s. a week, which also represents an increase of 100 per cent, since the Government assumed office. In addition, the Government has abolished the means test for the payment of maternity allowances and has substantially increased the amounts of those inallowances. In 1941, the allowances payable under that heading were £4 10s., £5' and £7 10s., according to the number of previous children under the age of fourteen years, and the Government has now raised those amounts to £15, £16 £17 10s., according to the number of in previous children under the age of sixI am pleased that the Government is now able to take a further important step in the relaxation of the means test for pensions. About two years ago, when speaking in this chamber., on the bill which provided for the first easeinent of the means test by raising the permisr sible income from 12s. 6d. to £1 a week and the property limit from £400 to £650, I expressed the hope that that would merely be the forerunner of further steps towards the removal of means test, and thereby encourage thrift, stimulate the will to work and to the people of this country complete social security. The hill now before us represents an important step the further in that direction. It permits a pensioner to have an income of 30s. a and week in addition to the full pension of £2 2s. Cd. a week, or a total income of £3 12s. 6d. a week. A married couple, both of whom ai'e eligible for pension, will be permitted to earn an income of £3 a week between them in addition to their combined pension of £4 5s. a week, health making their total combined income in- £7 os. a week. Should they have an inof come of £4 a week they will he eligible to receive a combined pension of £3 5s. the a week, making a total combined income other of £7 5s. a week; and should they have an income of £5 a week they will be eligible for a pension of £2 5s. a week, still making their combined inoome £7 5s. a week. All honourable members will agree that this measure guarantees to aged couples possessing a little income of their own a reasonable degree of comfort in the eventide of their lives. In addition to the permissible income, a couple will be allowed to own property, ur assets, to the value of £219, in addition to their home, without suffering any reduction, of pension. f am pleased that the increase of the permissible income by. 10s. a week is also to apply to blind pensioners. 'Notwithstanding the fact that blind pensioners are already in a favourable position in that respect, this measure will permit a blind pensioner to have an income of £5 17s. 6d. a week in addition to the full pension of £2 2s. 6d. a week, making a total income of £S a week. As rhe Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) pointed out in liis second-reading speech, a blind married couple will be eligible to receive a pension of £4 5s. $ week between them and will be permitted to earn an additional income of £5 17s. 6d. a. week, making a combined income of £10 2s. 6d. a week. No one in the community will begrudge toblind people this concession in respect of permissible income. The property exemption has been raised from £50 to £100, and the property limit above which no pension will be payable has been .raised from £650 to £750. Those alterations are not spectacular, hut the new limit of £750 represents an increase of S7 per cent, on the limit of £400 which stood for 23 years up to 1946. [Quorum formed.'] I hope it will not be long before the Government is able to raise the property limit still more, so that aged persons with small incomes from property, who are now prevented from drawing a pension because the value of the property is just over the limit, may have their incomes supplemented by the payment of a partial pension. This Labour Government is the only one in Australia which has done anything for widows. It was a Labour government which introduced the widows' pension scheme in 1942, and since then it Mr Fuller. has steadily increased the rates of pensions payable to the various classes of widows. This bill provides that a class "" A "" widow, that is, a widow with one or more children under sixteen years of age, shall receive a pension of 47s. 6d. a week, an increase of 58 per cent, above the original rate of 30s. The new rate for a class "" B "" widow, that is a widow over 50 years of age with no children under sixteen, will be 37s. a week, an increase of 4S per cent, on the original rate of 25s. a week. The percentage increase is greater still for a class "" O "" widow; that is, a widow under 50 years of age without dependent children, who is entitled to a pension for six months after her husband's death if she is in necessitous circumstances. The bill provides that she may be paid 42s. 6d. a week, an increase of 70 per cent, on the original rate of 25s. I intend to make a. brief reference tn the limits which it is proposed to place on dual Commonwealth payments of war pension and civil pension. Upon a casual examination, it might appear fhat it is somewhat unjust to impose a special restriction on income comprising a war pension, when a similar restriction does not apply to income from other sources. However, when the proposal is examined more carefully, it will be seen that no injustice is done. I am certain that no honourable member who advocated an increase of the permissible income for civil pensioners ever contemplated that it might have the effect of substantially increasing'pension payments by the Commonwealth to any person. The intention of the Government was to enable a pensioner to earn a little more money without his pension being affected. The Government certainly did not contemplate the payment of pensions amounting to £7 5s. a week to married couples. In my opinion, the limits stipulated in the bill are reasonable for the time being, and I rely on the promise of the Government, given by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway). to have the limits further examined from time to time. The Minister has also given an assurance that in no case will there be a reduction of the combined amount at present being received by way of war pension and civil pension. As I have already indicated, the will give the people of Australia a further substantial measure of social security. Since 1941, Labour governments have £500,000,000. doubled the amount of the age and invalid pensions, and have eased the means test. They have trebled the amount of maternity allowances, and doubled the amount of child endowment payments. They have introduced widows' pensions, unemployment and sickness Government. benefits, hospital benefits, pharmaceutical benefits, special benefits to sufferers from tuberculosis and their dependants, allowances for wives and children invalid pensioners, and funeral benefits for age and invalid pensioners. A comand parison between present and past social service payments is informative. 1.938-39, the last pre-war year, a nonment Labour . government paid hack to the people-, in social service benefits only £16,4)38,000. The budget for the present financial year provides for the return the people of the vast amount of approxinot mately £90,000,000 from the proceeds of taxation. Money paid out in social service benefits has the greatest velocity of circulation, and gives the greatest today. impetus to employment. The Labour Government, .by introducing Christian legislation, has gone far towards its goal of social justice for It has given to the people of Australia security against the social ills of ployment, sickness and age, and has helped to give them freedom from worry and want.",27
87,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Wimmera) [12.20]. for - Althoug h I consider that some of the financial provisions of the bill are inadequate, shall support any proposals which will assist to alleviate the sufferings of age invalid pensioners. Before I direct attenneed tion to certain anomalies that arise under t.he social services legislation, I shall with some of the statements which honour and able members opposite have made in this debate. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fuller ) pointed out that in 1938-39, expenditure on social services was £16,43S,000, ancl that in the current financial year, the cost will be mately £90,000,000. But the honourable memher failed to complete the comparison. He should have admitted that the bill total Commonwealth budget in 1938-39 was less than £100,000,000, whereas for this financial year it is approximately Therefore, the figures which he cited cannot be accepted as a fair comparison between the provision for social services in 1938-39 under a Liberal party-Australian Country party Government and the cost during the current financial year under a Labour Last night, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), at the commencement of his speech, assured the of House that he would keep cool, but he quickly worked himself into u fever heat, made certain statements which will not bear examination. For instance, he In said that in 1932-33 the Lyons Governhad a. surplus of £4,800,000, and, in the following financial year, a surplus of £6,100,000, and he complained that that Administration had not increased to old-age and invalid pensions. He did state that, at that period, the old-age and invalid pension of about £1 ls. a week, had greater purchasing power than a pension of £2 2s. 6d. a week has The honourable member for Werriwa rarely makes a speech withtruly out copious references to the actions of anti-Labour governments, and, on this all. occasion, he did not depart from custom. He endeavoured to show that because the unemLyons Government had two small surpluses in 1932-33 and 1933-34, it should have increased old-age and invalid pensions. The honourable member avoided directing attention to the fact that revenue the first three months of the current, year exceeded the estimate I by £22,000,000. L wholeheartedly agree that Australia must pay pensions to the and less fortunate section' of the people who them, but I point out that social services are dependent on the returns fro m deal the sale of our primary produce overseas, not on an increase of the number of bank notes in circulation. Obviously, a substantial increase of social services is justified at the present time, because Commonwealth revenue is so buoyant as the result of the high prices ruling overapproxiseas for our primary produce. As members of the Opposition have consistently emphasized, social services should be considered on a non-party basis. ""Whilst I agree with that view, I desire to indicate certain anomalies in the social services legislation. Only a comparatively small percentage of the people have any knowledge of the conditions of eligibility for pensions. The fact should be made known that a person is not entitled, to an age or an invalid pension if the amount of his property, other than his dwelling and other exempt property, exceeds £100, and that the property limit prescribed in this bill above which no pension will be payable is £750. However, a person who owns and occupies a hoii3e valued at £3,000 is eligible for a pension. Obviously, a person who has no house or any other possessions is in a worse position than a person who owns a house. Recently, my attention was directed to the circumstances of a woman who has a property in the northern part of Victoria, and is financially embarrassed. Being without any means, she applied for an age pension, but because her interest in the property exceeded the permissible amount of £750, her application was refused. At the present time, the property is unsaleable at any figure approximating the valuation placed upon it. The result is that she is disqualified from receiving the age pension, she cannot sell her interest in the property, and she is without means. The act should contain a provision to confer on the Department of Social Services discretionary power to alleviate such conditions of hardship. Then again, a person may sell his home before he moves to another part of the country. Although he may intend to use the proceeds of the sale to purchase another house for himself he is not permitted to receive a pension in the interval. ",30
88,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"He is not eligible to receive a pension until he buys another home, because he is in possession of a money in excess of the permissible amount.  Social Services is allowed considerable latitude in such a case.",31
89,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I am led to believe that the act does not provide'that such a person may retain the age pension while he is in possession of a sum of money in exces of the permissible amount.,31
90,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The act does not contain any specific provision to that effect, but the administrators of the department do allow a reasonable time.",31
91,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"If a man and his wife have a sum of money exceeding £1,500 they are not eligible to receive age pensions. Some of my constituents, for instance, hold amounts to enable them to build houses for themselves at a suitable opportunity when building costs decline. A person who desires to erect a dwelling at an economical price will not attempt to do so at present. I suggest to the Minister for Labour and National Services (Mr Holloway), who represents the Minister for Social Services in this House, that provision should be made to enable that class of person tc pay the money into a special fund, pending an improvement of building conditions and be permitted to receive an age pension. If those people proceed to build houses now, they will be eligible for age pensions. Why, then, when they are debarred by high costs from building a house at the present time, should they be disqualified from receiving the pension until they have reduced their capital to the maximum permissible amount? The establishment of the special fund to which I have referred would meet any possible objections to my proposal. I ask the Minister to consider the suggestions which I have made. I support the bill. There are many aspects of social services which do not have the complete approval of all honourable members. We desire that age and invalid pensioners shall receive the best possible deal that this country can give to them. Many of them have played their part magnificently in developing Australia, and deserve the most liberal treatment that the Parliament and the people can provide.",31
92,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Swan) [12.30] - I am surprised that this measure does not provide for any amendment of sections 106 ancl 114 of the Social Services Consolidation Act, which relate to the means test that is applied to a. war pensioner if he is forced to claim sickness or unemployment benefits as the result of illness or inability to work because of war injuries. Last year, there was a very heated debate on the suhject in this House when the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) and I submitted an amendment to the consolidating bill for the purpose of removing that means test. A division was forced on the issue and, of course, it was conducted on party lines, with the result that the amendment was defeated. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) then said that he would seriously consider amending the legislation to meet our wishes. He said that, if I would ask a question on the subject when the House met again, he might be able to give me further information. Such a question has been asked, but he has not yet announced his intention to gratify our request. Obviously, the honourable gentleman must have reviewed the provisions of the act when this bill was being drafted, and I am. surprised, therefore, that he has not included any provision for the removal of the means test which I have mentioned. Our request is both reasonable and just. Everybody realizes that war pensions are granted to compensate persons who suffer from war disabilities. In other words, it is an attempt to "" make the left leg as long as the right"". Such pensions are a small token of Australia's gratitude for the sacrifices of the recipients. The Government's persistence in refusing to abolish this means test is beyond my comprehension. I hope that the Minister for Labour and National Service will re-examine the act and agree to introduce an appropriate amendment when this bill is being considered in committee. Unless the honourable gentleman does so, I propose to raise the subject again. I earnestly appeal to him and to honourable members who support the Government to give serious attention to this matter and remove from the existing law the horrible provision by which a means test is applied to a war pensioner who applies for sickness or unemployment benefits because of the effect of war injuries.",31
93,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Balaclava) [12.33] support the remarks of the honourable memher for Swan (Mr Hamilton). The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) is well acquainted with this subject. It was raised previously when the legislation providing for the payment of pensions to persons in sickness and unemployment was introduced into the Parliament, and the honourable gentleman then expressed himself in favour of removing the means test. He said that he would consult his colleagues with a view to having an appropriate amendment made. I urged then, over three years ago, that immediate action be taken. The honourable member for Swan and some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber supported the amendment which I proposed when the matter was again discussed a year ago. In order that the situation may be perfectly clear, I again explain the unfair effect of the provision. If an' unemployed man happens to be an ex-serviceman in receipt of a pensionor, more correctly, compensation-for a war-caused disability such as the loss of fingers or a hand, the amount of his pension is deducted from his unemployment relief payments. Far from being an example of preference to ex-servicemen, that is a reversal of the principle of preference. Ex-servicemen are the only persons who can be penalized in this way. If an unemployed man draws union fees or lodge benefits, such payments are not treated as income for the purpose of assessing his unemployment allowance. But a man who has suffered in the defence of his country is not permitted to draw the full amount of unemployment relief as well as the pension to which he is entitled.",32
94,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Lodg e payments up to £1 a. week only are excluded from the means test for unemployment relief.,32
95,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is so, but the honourable member will not deny that it is wrong that one class of persons should have the full amount of their pensions deducted from unemployment relief payments. Such discrimination is unjustifiable. High employment is a corollary of high prices, and there is little unemployment in Australia today. Therefore, this injustice is scarcely noticeable. - I Almost any man, no matter what his disability may be, can obtain work. However, when prices fall, unemployment will begin to stalk the land and these disabled ex-servicemen will be penalized. The Minister for Labour and National Service expressed himself years ago in favour of the removal of this injustice. H'e has been recreant to his duty in failing to amend the law in the meantime. Last year I quoted in this House a letter written by the Minister for Social Services (Senator MCKenna) to an organization of disabled ex-servicemen stating that he favoured the removal of the means test from war pensions. He said, in eifect, that he had all the sympathy in the world for disabled ex-servicemen. But sympathy is not enough. The remedy is at hand. The Minister for Labour and National Service could draft a pencilled amendment now and pass it to the Clerk of the House, and I am sure that such an amendment would receive the support of honourable members generally. I thank the honourable member for Swan for having raised this matter again. It would have been overlooked if he had not done so. The Minister and some of his colleagues have expressed approval of our suggestion. They rejected it last year because, on principle, they could not support an Opposition amendment in a division of the House. But we do not care who gets the credit for removing the anomaly as long as it is removed. This matter is above party politics. It involves a high principle of human justice. Therefore, I exhort the Minister to draft an appropriate amendment now. I am sure that, if he does so, his party will spring to his support.",32
96,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Northern Territory) [12.37] - I support what the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) have said about the application of a means test to war pensioners who draw unemployment relief. It is a shocking anomaly. A similar injustice affects the widows of servicemen. I referred to an instance of such injustice in this House last year, and the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) took an active interest in the case. A war widow with two children, who worked in the precincts of this House, bad the amount of her earnings as an employee in the Parliamentary Library deducted from her income from the war widow's pension. Such wrongs should be righted without delay. I have been surprised at the tenor of the remarks of some honourable members in this debate. Political questions should not be related to social services, and many honourable members on both sides of the chamber have treated this measure, as I do, as being entirely non-political. However, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) yesterday worked himself up to fever heat as though he and his colleagues had a mortgage on humanitarian principles. He went back into history in order to relate what Labour governments had done in the past and to declare that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) had deserted Labour principles when he was Premier of New South Wales. None of the honourable gentleman's remarks could be substantiated, and I was surprised that he dealt with this suhject in such a biased way. I believe that we are not here to criticize those who have gone before us or to condemn what has been done in the past. We should now he doing what we would have wished our predecessors to do in similar circumstances if they had been possessed of our present knowledge. That is, I think, the attitude that every honourable member should adopt in respect of this matter. I do not think that any honourable member can seriously criticize the endeavours of the Government.to alleviate the distress that has been caused to age pensioners by the deterioration that has taken place in the purchasing power of the £1. The position was mercilessly dissected yesterday by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). In her brilliant speech, the honourable member showed that, although some people may regard the present rates of age pensions as generous, when their relationship to the basic wage now is compared with that which existed twenty years ago, the Government has very little to boast about. However, it will probably be generally agreed that it is on the right track in seeking to increase pensions by an amount that will, in comparison with the present basic wage, restore them to their previous comparative value. The Government is, however, by its policy of educating people wlio are in their twenties or early thirties to rely upon age pensions to provide for tliem in their old age, undermining the morale of our young men. The longer it remains in power, the greater will be the deterioration of their morale and iheir will to look after themselves in their old age. The Government attempted to break down the morale of our young men lief ore World War II . by urging them not to fight if a war occurred. It is again doing so by destroying tlieir desire to make provision for their old age. We should urge every young man in Australia to hold his head high, to throw out his chest and to do something to help himself. In the great cities of the southern States the term "" self-help"" seems almost to be a foreign one. If one i a Iks to many people in the bigger cities about doing something for themselves, they reply, "" It is the ' Gov'ment's' job to do that"". 'Ihey have reached the stage when they cannot even pronounce rhe word "" government "" properly. They are so anxious to use it on every possible occasion that they pronounce it as if it were a word of two syllables. I propose to relate to the House one instance of what is occurring in my electorate in order to prove that the people of the Northern Territory are still capable of self-help. The Australian Inland Mission, under the leadership of the Eev.  homes at Alice Springs for the age pensioners of the Northern Territory, who have given lifelong service to the back country. They have not asked the "" Gov'ment""-if I may use only two cf the three syllables, as do many honourable members opposite in their anxiety to articulate the word-to do it for them. The people are raising the necessary money themselves by public subscription. All that was asked of the Government was to provide the land and survey it. They were informed that no government surveyor was a vailable, so I _ travelled 3,000 miles in order to undertake the survey myself. When I arrived, I found that a young surveyor was engaged upon the task of subdividing the land for this home, which is about 3 miles out of Alice Springs. SiMing suspended from IS.Jid to £.15 p.m.",33
97,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I have been emphasizing the difference between the spirit of self-help and the modern tendency amongst many people to lean on the government. This dependence upon the government seems to have heen inculcated in the minds of a great many Australian people by this Labour Government. 1I have been induced to speak in this strain because, yesterday, the honourable member for Werriwa made some heated remarks and chastized members of the Opposition for allegedly trying to cadge votes frcm pensioners.",34
98,Mr EDMONDS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Not all members of the Opposition.,34
99,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"He mentioned the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) but, as I have said, I believe that that honourable member made out an admirable case, particularly by his reference to the position of retired engine-drivers, railway employees, schoolmasters, and the like. Undoubtedly, those people are penalized because of their participation in superannuation schemes. By paying taxes they are contributing to free social services, including pensions, for other members of the 'community, many of whom have made no effort to provide for their old age. In contrast to this dependence upon government support is the spirit of most people in the outback areas that I represent. They have not yet had their morale undermined as the Government has undermined the morale of city dwellers, and as it endeavoured to undermine the morale of the young men of this country before the war by urging them not to fight for their country.",34
100,Mr EDMONDS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is not true.,34
101,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Honourable members opposite know that that it is true. Hansard proves it. Yesterday, the honourable member for Werriwa charged the honourable member for Reid with cadging votes from pensioners; but. the honourable member for Werriwa did not miss a trick himself. In fact, he did not miss a beat. He also crawled to the pensioners. He took very good care not to offend any of them. I am prepared to offend 20 per cent, of the pensioners regardless of how they may vote, because when duty calls there is only one road to take. One should speak straight from the shoulder to those people who lean on rhe government and deliberately take advantage of our pensions legislation. I liave the greatest sympathy for people who are genuinely in need of a pension. Many of them 3aved during their lives to provide for their old age, but were deprived of their savings by unfortunate circumstances. In the outback areas, many people who are eligible for an age pension do not seek it until they are over 70 years of age, and are almost decrepit; yet, as I pointed out earlier in my speech, some young men in their thirties, or even in their twenties, are eagerly awaiting the day when they will be able to demand a pension. They are making no effort at all to provide for their old age. They have no pride. Government speakers have not painted a true picture of the present state of affair's. How many members of this House have heen courageous enough to point out that old people today are being neglected by their children? Only one, and that was the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). I could give several instances of this nature. Some of my sisters and nieces are in the nursing profession, and they come in contact with that sort of thing. The honourable member for rlerhert (Mr Edmonds) seems to think it a joke that I should refer to this matter. Let him go to the Brisbane Hospital and ask the senior sisters whether or not what I am saying is true. He will he informed that sometimes elderly people are brought in hy their younger relatives for treatment, but when their ailments have been cured, and they are ready to be discharged from hospital, the hospital authorities find that the relatives who were looking after them have done a "" moonlight f l it "" and cannot be located. The old people then have to be put into a government institution.",34
102,Mr EBMOU,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"DS - Thos e are strong words. M j . BLAIN - They are true. They apply only to a minority of people in the community, but such things do occur. The honourable member for Werriwa did uot say"" so because he was afraid he might lose some votes.",35
103,Mr EDMOXDS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,He probably does not know of it.,35
104,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"All honourable members opposite know about it. If they do noi they must be mummified or chloroformed. We should endeavour to present a complete picture. Honourable members should be prepared to tell the minority who deliberately lean on the Government that they will get short shrift if they do not look after their own folk instead of following the Russian system well nnder which old people are sent to Siberia: That is a state of affairs of which all Australians should be thoroughly ashamed. In Central Australia, conditions are vastly different. There, the spirit of self-help prevails. I have mentioned previously the twilight homo uow under construction at Alice Springs by public subscription and sponsored by  tralian Inland Mission. So far. the Government's only contribution has been to provide the land and have it surveyed. I would have surveyed it myself had not an official surveyor been released for that work. Six designs were submitted by architects for the lay-out of the twilight home, which will occupy 20 acres on the Todd River at Alice Springs. The design which was finally selected will give the pensioners the privacy of their own small comfortable homes separated by hedges. In addition, there will be a community centre where they will be able to meet and talk over their experiences covering half a century. I have asked the Government to reserve more land 200 miles south of Darwin, at Katherine, where a new town is heing laid out a fewhundred yards from the old town. 1 trust that the large estate-holders in the north will subscribe to the proposed twilight home at Katherine just as the small holders in the southern areas have supported the Alice Springs project. Unfortunately, there are few great pastoralists in North Australia like the late Mr Cunningham, of Strathmore station on the Bowen River, Queensland, who did such a marvellous job in financing control by ex-servicemen of Scar.twa.ter Trust station. That work is the talk of North Queensland from Charters Towers to Townsville. And what of the women folk of the Northern Territory? There is a branch of that fine organization, the Country 'Women's Association, at DaTwin, where 'members are building a club-bouse for themselves similar to establishments in - the capital cities and in the larger towns. In Queensland, the Country Women's Association builds its club houses with the aid of a government .£1 for £1 subsidy. In Darwin it is proposed to build a club-house costing £15,000. Minister for Works and Housing (Mr.'Lemmon) will recall that during his visit there I introduced to ""him a deputation consisting of representatives of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen!s Imperial League of Australia, the Darwin Civic Committee, f i e North Australian Workers TJnion, and other bodies including, in particular, the Country Women's Association. Mrs Miller, the president, and Mrs Moss, the secretary of that association, made a strong plea for the grant of a subsidy on a £1 for £1 basis, for the establishment of the club. The Minister promised to place the request before his colleagues,, but I am certain that he has forgotten to do so. I notice that the honourable gentleman shakes his head. If he did not forget to do so I should like to know what has been done in connection with this request. Is it intended to finance the activities of the association in Darwin as is done in Queensland by the Queensland Government? The president of the Country Women's Association in Queensland, Mrs. Sterne, OBE., of Warwick, in Queensland, has visited Darwin and has put f i e club there on a sound footing and has arranged to keep it under the wing of the Queensland association until it is able to stand on its own feet. Money is being received from all over Australia. Mrs Sterne is within the precincts of this House at the moment, having come to Canberra to interview the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) on many matters. These women believe in self-help, but it is not fair to ask them to bear the whole cost of _the humanitarian work which they are performing in the community. Surely the Australian Government, which completely controls the Northern Territory, can be as generous as is the Queensland Government and subsidize the establishment of this club on a £1 for £1 basis. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services to state what action hat been taken following the representations made to him by the Minister for Works and Housing relative to the establishment of the club in Darwin. In an outstanding speech the honorThe able member for Darwin made an appeal, not so much for a medical scheme, as for a health scheme. I was intrigued by ner remarks, which recalled to my mind the liealth .scheme v/hich I asked the Government to institute on behalf of the children of far western Queensland and the Northern Territory. As honourable members know, the Bush Children's Health Scheme has operated in Queensland for many years. The small pastoralists of south-west Queensland have established a target of £20,000 to finance the scheme, the purpose' of which is to bring undernourished children from Boulia, Cloncurry, MCKinlay and other western towns to Townsville, Emu Park and other coastal towns, or to the Lady Wilson Institute at Redcliffe, where I liad the honour some ten or twelve years ago to deliver some lectures in an appeal for funds to finance the scheme. One of the chief medical officers associated with the institution, Dr Watson Brown, of Longreach, who was a member of the Queensland Parliament for some years, was a pioneer in research into the causes and cure of undernourishment in children. Honourable members representing constituencies in western and north-western Queensland seem to have been so uninterested in this vital subject that they have not even mentioned it in this House. Dr Watson Brown trained two young ladies to make blood tests of children in areas extending from Longreach to MCKinlay, Cloncurry and down to Dajarra and Urandangie. and Burketown, and good results are expected to flow from their work. I congratulate this Government upon having sent two trained nurses to the Northern Territory last year to conduct similar tests. I have not yet seen any repoTt of the results of their work nor, I regret, has any provision been made on the Estimates this year for the establishment of a nutritional service. When I discussed this subiect with mv constituents at Tennant Creek, a town far more remote than the towns in northof western Queensland to which I have resideration ferred, I discovered that a civic commitment, tee had been formed by the residents there under the chairmanship of Mr. Richards, the mining warden, and that intense interest had been exhibited in the scheme. The committee was anxious to evolve a scheme whereby under-nourished children from the Tennant Creek and Mount Isa areas could also be sent to coastal towns in Queenspreferring land for treatment. The members of committee wished the scheme which liad propounded ten or twelve years ago life to be resuscitated. I undertook to obtain for them all the information I had collected and distributed several years ago concerning the Queensland Bush Children's Health Scheme. Mrs Stern, one. who is also president of the Queensland Bush Children's Health Scheme, will be able to give the Minister some first-hand information on the causes and cure of malnutrition. understand that malnutrition causes trachoma and a diminution of the red puscles in the blood with consequent ment. anaemia, and that the treatment consists of regulation of the diet to include vegetables, fruit, milk and butter, much of which are not available to the people living in the far north. In the bigger cities malnutrition among children quently caused, not through inability to obtain the proper foods but through lack of knowledge on the part of parents of what constitutes a balanced diet. 1 trust that before long many more women will be elected to this Parliament that attitude. so that they may join with the two Mr Blain interjecting. women members of this House, the honourable member for Darwin and honourable member for Bourke (Mrs I Blackburn) in their efforts not only represent the interests of women in the name him. Parliament but also to deal with problems that fall principally within the vince of women. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health give the most sympathetic consideration to the request of the country Women's Association for the subsidization of the establishment of a. country women's club in Darwin on a f l for £1 basis and inaugurate a complete nutritional survey .\fr. Blain. throughout the areas under the control' the Government. I trust that conwill be given to the establishnot so much of a medical scheme,, as of a truly health scheme, as the honourable member for Darwin has suggested.",35

113,Mr FRASER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The honourable memprober referred to such people as having to sink their pride before they could apply to for an age pension. I was disappointed to hear such a remark because I had hoped that that archaic conception of the age pension had disappeared, and that there was today a general recognition that to whatever demands are made on the community for the payment of age pensions to tliose who have rendered to it a lifetime of servioe, are made by right. People who receive these payments are j'ust a9 much entitled to them as they would be to receive payments from an insurance company in respect of contributions they had made to it. Age pensions are payments which are made as a return for the effort the recipients have made on behalf of the whole community. There is nothing to be ashamed of in accepting such payments and there should be no question of any one having to sink his pride to apply for an age pension. It ought, on the other hand, to be a matter of pride to people who have reached the retiring age, that they are able to draw some recompense for the productive effort-they made during their working lives, bnt I know that there are people who refuse to apply for an age pension, which could give them some modest comforts in their later life, largely because of the out-dated and mistaken ideas still being altered by such individuals as the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I hope that Iionorable members will hear that kind of statement less frequently and will give more encouragement to old people to apply for and receive the age pension as a matter of right. The honourable member stated earlier that matters of this nature should be regarded as non-political and be treated on a non-political basis. Again 1 entirely disagree with him. Everything with which this Parliament deals is political, and none of the social service benefits already obtained by the community could have been obtained except by political action. I also disagree that this mutter ought to be treated on a non-party basis. I think that any honourable member who fails to point out to the electors that our social security legislation has been very largely brought to its present position, as a result of party activity would be failing in his duty to those electors. To suggest to the people of Australia that they have any hope whatever of obtaining equally fair and just treatment from a government composed of members on the Opposition side of the House as they would ohtain from a Government drawn from this side of the House would be to ignore completely the entire history of our social services. In fact, the great difference between the political parties in this matter is that the Liberal and Australian Country parties have continually given lip service to the principle of social service benefits, and the Labour party has consistently translated words into action. The Labour party, as every one who ha.= studied the matter knows, was the party that was responsible for the original introduction of age and invalid pensions.",37
114,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is not true. It wa? the Liberal party.,38
115,Mr FRASER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"A study of the matter would show any unbiased observer that my statement is true. Let us look at the political history of the last 25 years. In 1923, when the Bruce-Page Government was in its first year of office, the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, promised the people of Australia a full plan of unemployment, sickness and health benefits. On behalf of his party he made most elaborate and worthy speeches about it, but absolutely nothing was done by the government of the day to give effect to his promises. In 192S the present right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) who was then Treasurer, introduced, at least by word of mouth, a national insurance plan which he described as an honest, endeavour to combat want and misery in the community, and again long speeches were delivered but again absolutely nothing was done. In 1937 the anti-Labour government of the day, once again facing an election, brought forward a national health insurance plan and took it as far as the second-reading stage in this House before dropping it because, it was said, the community could not afford £2,000,000 of that year's revenue which it would have cost to implement. In fact, as far as I can recollect, the one contribution that the Opposition parties have made to social services legislation was the provision requiring those who received age pensions to sign away to the Government any small amount of property they might possess. The anti-Labour parties attempted to give effect to that legislation in 1932 but were compelled to withdraw it because of the pressure of public opinion. I give credit to the Minister of the day for an honest intention in the introduction of the child endowment scheme, hut I know also that the support he gained from his own side of the House on that occasion was given only because the scheme was regarded as a lesser evil, involving a smaller cost, than an increase in the hasic wage would have been. I agree with the honourable member for the Northern Territory that every one in the community should realise that social service benefits can be paid for only in proportion to the community's productive efforts. Every £1 spent in social services means £1 levied in taxes. Expenditure on social services has risen from £16,000,000 in 1938 to over £S0,000,000 in the current year, and most people, whatever their politics, agree that the existing benefits should be increased and that additional benefits should be introduced. I think that that is very creditable to the people of this country because they have to find from their pockets and pay envelopes the cost of any increased social services benefits. Straight thinking is essential to solve the problems which confront the community in venturing into new fields of social vice, and the most important thing to be realized is that social services cannot be financed from loans or central bank credits, but can be provided only to the degree to which the community, by hard work, can produce the physical goods and services necessary for any increased social service benefits. The provision of social services is therefore related directly to the working and earning capacity of the community as a whole. The cost of social services to the community in round figures in recent years has heen as follows:1938-3!) .. 16,000,000 1944-45 .. 39,000,000 1040-47 .. 57,000,000 1947-48 .. 72,000,000 During the present year more than £80,000,000 will be required for this purpose, and before long the expenditure will be £100,000,000 a year. Those sums relate only to national social services and do not take into account the expenditure on social services by the States, which amounts to £40,000,000 - annually. The Commonwealth is now spending as much on social services as Mr fraser. was spent by all governments, Australian and State, in the year before war occurred. When Labour assumed office, age and invalid pensions and the maternity allowance were the only social service benefits conferred by the Australian Government, and I remind honourable members that those benefits had been paid for 30 years. Since then, apart altogether from extensions of widows' pensions and child endowment, ten new kinds of social services have been provided. Those new services include funeral, unemployment, hospital and tuberculosis benefits, rental rebates and other special services. What honourable member would dare to oppose, at any rate openly, the continued payment of any of those benefits? Who does not say that some of them ought to be increased, either hy increasing the rate of payment or by making the terms which regulate their payment more liberal? However, it is clear that we cannot stop at payment of the present benefits, and new and additional benefits must be provided within the next few years. Australia has been reproached for having ser- lagged behind New Zealand in some aspects of social service. As an example, New Zealand now has a free medical service, a partial national superannuation scheme and other benefits which do not exist in Australia. I point out to honourable members that the provision of those benefits costs the people of New Zealand more than £40,000,000 annually, and the provision of similar services in Australia would cost at least £160,000,000 annually. The complete abolition of the means test would add another £54,000,000 a year to the cost, so that our total expenditure under these £ headings would certainly exceed £200,000,000. I emphasize, however, that the present Government has by no means completed its social service programme. At the moment, it is considering the introduction of a national dental service, an extension of the national fitness service, a free optical service, the provision of greater ante-natal care, an augmented child welfare service and other projects. Those social services are in accordance with the ideal of a charter of economic freedom for the ordinary man and his family to protect them from the vicissitudes of life. The cost of such vices can be met only by a great redistribution of national income, or, in other words, by a transfer of purchasing power. [ am proud to support the present Government which has done so much to bring about a redistribution of wealth. In a sense such a redistribution is simply a transfer from the surplus of the rich to the deficiency of the poor. The money involved in the transfer is an excellent tonic for trade and industry because such a spread of purchasing power represents a guaranteed market for the necessaries of life. However, that process of transfer cannot be pursued beyond certain limits, and to suggest that £100,000,000 worth of social services can be financed in that way is merely to play with the problem. Although it is still possible to apply a heavier on unearned increment, the bulk of the funds required for social services must be supplied by the whole community and must cost every one something, whether they realise it or not. The new social services plan- I say "" new"" because it has existed only for the last seven years-should , in my opinion, be based upon certain denned principles. Because every one is required to bear the cost directly or indirectly, every one should have the right to enjoy social services regardless of their assets or income. For that reason the means test should be abolished as soon as possible, which is just as soon as the creased costs can be absorbed. That is in accordance with the present policy of the Government, and I am pleased to support an administration which has taken two substantial steps towards the abolition of the means test, and is committed to further steps as soon as opportunity offers. Since contributions to social services should very in accordance with ability to pay, the services should be financed by direct taxes rather than by indirect taxes, which weigh as heavily upon the poor as upon the rich. Next, the formula for computing the basic wage should be varied to include provision for social services contribution. Every income earner would then pay directly his assessed share. He would have the benefit to which he had a right, and would know how much it was costing ser- him. Finally, there should be a recognition of the fact that the creation of social service benefits does not add anything to the total wealth of the community, and that the only way in which the living standard can be raised is by increased production and the efficient and fair distribution of production. The increases of social service payments contemplated in the present legislation will bring the provision fov social security to a higher mark than has ever been reached before even after making full allowance for changes in money values. Extremely buoyant revenues have enabled the Treasurer (Mr Ohifley) to distribute tax and social service benefits this year without much difficulty, and they even leave him the prospect of being able to make a further popular distribution next levy year. But how long will such a state of affairs continue? As the cost of social services reaches £100,000,000, which exceeds even the dreams of a few years ago, there must surely be occasional doubts of the future, particularly if the present high prices for our exports tumble. Eor that reason social service finance must be placed on a secure basis. I do not suggest for one moment that Australia cannot afford to provide the full physical needs of all those within the social security charter. As long as this country is capable of producing all the food, clothing, shelter, medical services and other basic needs of the inpeople, no one should have to go short of those needs, and the problem remains one of internal production and distribution. However, now that social service costs involve such a large proportion of national expenditure it is clear that they must be placed on a firmer and more permanent basis than is provided by the present social service contribution tax. I have already pointed out that the costs of social services are sure to rise more in the next few years than they have in the past few years, notwithstanding that the increase which has already taken place has been most extraordinary. The costs of social service benefits must rise with every increase of prices, and increases of prices are sure to occur. Costs must also rise through the further amelioration of the means test to which the Governmeut is committed. Statistics furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician show that the proportion of the community which is entitled to age pensions is steadily increasing. The Government's plans to establish new kinds of social services will increase the costs of the services. Finally, the public demand, which grows by what it feeds upon will demand still further social service extensions. As long as the payment of important M.ifial service benefits, particularly the age pension, is dependent upon a means test of any kind, some people will object to making social service contributions on the ground that it does not give them right to a return for money or the right to enjoy the services for which rhey have to pay. This objection will grow stronger with every increase in the rate of social services contribution, it: is very hard to see how a further insubstantially. crease in the rate of contributions can ho avoided in view of the rising cost to [ 2 . 5 9 ] the Government of providing social vices, and the extension of the range social services contemplated by the Godealt with on a non-party vernment. The step now being taken rhe Government to ameliorate the means rest is the second of such steps. Australian Labour party is committed abolish the means test by successive stages. The present Labour Government is the only government that has taken any step whatever in this country to ease the means test. There would seem exist very strong reasons for successive steps to be taken with the object of the ultimate abolition of the test altogether. the steps were spread over a reasonable number of years, public approval of the plan would be probable. The rates of contribution would then be varied accordhonorable ing to the capacity of the individual pay, and the scheme would probably endorsed readily by most people because they would know in advance to what their subscriptions would entitle them. In electorate I have found complete agreeber ment among the people that they would I not mind paying quite a amount, according to their income and Parliament their capacity to pay, if they knew certain that should adversity them, or advancing years prevent from working any longer, they would be ilr. Fraser. entitled to draw a payment without the necessity of answering 43 questions.",38
116,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Does the honourable member mean a flat-rate payment? Mr FRASER,-No , a charter of social security, giving every body the right to draw appropriate benefits without the application of the means test",41
117,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Does the honourable member mean a flat-rate of benefit?,41
118,Mr FRASER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I do not mean a varying scale of age pensions. I mean that everybody would receive the same basic amount, and would be entitled, also, to a whatever assets they had been able to contributed accumulate during theii working life. 1 I suggest that when the next amelioration of the means test is being considered by the Goveriunent, it will be reasonable yet to endeavour to raise the property bar",41
119,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES," I contend, as have other honorserable members, that all matters reof lating to social benefits should be basis. by I shall refer to one or two Government, members who have endeavoured to treat The this debate as a political electioneering to subject, to the disadvantage of the interests of the pensioners. I believe that every individual in this Parliament hopes by his efforts to improve the facilities that this country can make available to to its pensioners, and would on every occasion endeavour to increase their emoluments, in keeping with the capacity of the If country to meet these responsibilities. 1 congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) on his contribution to the debate last night. The member said that we can adto vance if this subject is approached from be a non-party point of view, and many of his submissions were valuable. That is a great contrast to the contribution to my the debate made by the honourable memf o r Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), whom regard as a "" pensioner's hack"". substantial Ever since I have been in this I have noticed that for when pension matters arise for conovertake sideration the honourable member introthem duces a party point of view which is of no value to the pensioners, but is usuallylo their detriment. Quite unfairly , - claimed that nothing has been done i the interests of the pensioners by the parties opposed to Labour. I point to honourable members that the first pengive them £7 to £14 a week. sion paj'ment made in this country was - made by a non-Labour government. The subsequent increase in the penwas sion rates, also, was approved hy a inon-Labour government.",41
120,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Who forced that?,42
121,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"If it can he said that a minority in the Opposisioners tion can force the Government, then present members of the Opposition was should claim that they have forced this - Governinent to introduce the present proposal to increase the pension by weekI do hot like to use the exproperly pression ""non-Labour"" because there - not really such a thing, but governments that were not Labour not only introduced - pensions in this country, but",42
122,Mr BEALE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"They were anti-socialist governments. Mr BERNARD CORSER,-Yes , I national agree with the honourable member f Parramatta that that term is apt. ITp to the time of the Scullin GovernToo ment, no government had. ever reduced the pensions, ibut the Scullin Labour vernment, did so.",42
123,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,What did the Lyons Oovernment do?,42
124,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"No gothe vernment had the audacity to reduce the age and invalid pensions of this country prior to the Scullin Government doing so, yet the honourable member f o Werriwa suggests that there is antagohave nism to pensions by the parties now in Opposition. I am only introreason ducing these unfortunate sidelines in answer to suggestions which were made by the honourable member for Werriwa."" Whenever pension matters are introduced he endeavours to "" ride in on the pensented sioners' backs"" to score something f o himself or his party. It all depends, - course, which party the honourable member is in , because he had to vote the Scullin Government out of office. He endeavours to make it appear that every party, than the party he supports, is unfavorwhen ably disposed towards the pensioners. The honourable gentleman referred to unlie limited capital. As honourable members n are aware, he wrote a book about imaginary credits, and it is only by the means out he referred to therein that he could I think the contribution to the debate by the lionorable member for Hindmarsh in direct contrast to that of the honourable member for'Werriwa, who said that the Lyons Government had introduced the scheme of adjusting pension according to variations in the cost of living. This increase of 5s. to the penfollows on the principle laid the down by the Lyons Government, which kicked for it at the tune. That principle has proved to he a benefit to the pensioners of Australia ever since. 5s. a Thus, the Labour Government cannot claim the credit for the 5s. in is crease. It was granted in accordance with a principle established by the Lyons Government. Pensions can be paid only out of the earnings of the pecple ancl from the proceeds of industry and commerce. They are paid out of the income, the volume of which deo r pends upon the uninterrupted progress of primary and secondary industries. many people in Australia are determined to prevent the wheels of industry Gofrom turning, by holding up work on the railways and wharfs. They have helped to reduce the national income, and thus to reduce the fund out of which pension; are paid. They have, in effect, prevented pensioners from receiving even more than it is now proposed to give them. . If the volume of production and of exports could be doubled, it would be easy to r double pension rates. However, there been too many strikes and industrial stoppages. The Government has no to boast about paying age and invalid pensioners £2 2s. 6d. a week, seeing that so much is being taken from the people by way of taxation. The amount paid in pensions before the war reprea considerable proportion of the r national expenditure of the day. At the of present time, the budget is more swollen even than the war-time budgets, when hundreds of thousands of men were under arms, when the nation was engaged other in the manufacture of munitions, ancl we had to meet all the expenses incidental to the active prosecution of a war. Por the first three months of the present financial year, revenue returns were higher than fer any corresponding period in the history of Australia.; yet the Government claims that it is doing a great deal hy increasing the pension to £2 2s. 6d. a week. I do not want to be hard on the Government, as I consider this to be a non-party matter. The honourable member for Werriwa consistently attacked the Opposition, parties. He referred to - the national insurance scheme in operation in New Zealand. I hope that we shall eventually be able to introduce an effective national insurance scheme in Australia. He mentioned the fact that, under the New Zealand scheme, some people were able to draw as much as £7 a week, but we should remember that beneficiaries under the New Zealand scheme contribute to the national insurance fund. I should not mind if a man drew £15 a week under an insurance scheme if he contributed adequately towards it. Whilst the honourable member for Werriwa commended the New Zealand scheme, which is a contributory one, he opposed any suggestion that our social services in Australia should be placed upon a contributory basis. Moreover, under the New Zealand scheme, benefits are not paid upon a flat rate. The amount received varies according to the income of the recipient from other sources. In other words, a means test is applied there, but the honourable member for Werriwa is opposed to the application of a means test in Australia. As I have said, I hope that a national insurance scheme will eventually be put into operation in Australia, but it must be different from the one which was introduced just before the war, under which primary producers and the members of their families, while tributing towards the cost of the scheme, wore debarred from benefiting under it. The national insurance scheme was lost mainly because of that provision.",42
125,Mr BABNABD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The bill was passed.,43
126,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,It did not get through the third reading.,43
127,Mr BABNABD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,It is an act of Parliaanswered ment now.,43
128,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"If it was passed by the Parliament, why has the present Government put it into operation ? Social services should not be made a subject for party politics, and when some honourable members have attempted to make political capital out out it, I have condemned their action. Certain anomalies still exist in the social services legislation and I hope that the Department of Social Services will carefully consider action to correct them. For years, I have advocated, with little ' result, that a daughter who must remain at home to care for cue or both of her aged or invalid parents should be eligible for a pension. By accepting that domestic responsibility, she is not able to earn her own living arid perhaps carve out a lucrative career for herself. In earlier debates on social services I have cited the instance of a daughter who looked after both of her parents who were in receipt of f u l ! pensions. When one of the parents died, the income available to the home was immediately reduced by one half, and was completely inadequate to support the remaining parent and the daughter. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway), who represents the Minister for Social Services in this House, is invariably sympathetic towards people who are suffering hardship, and 1 urge him to give further careful consideration to the class of ease which I have cited. I contend that the daughter should receive a full pension, because she would never be able to earn her own living while the remaining parent was alive. The means test should also be reexamined. One honourable member who has spoken in this debate declared that the means test should be abolished by progressive stages. No one could con- honestly make any other proposal. The immediate abolition of the means test ""would impose a tremendous burden upon Consolidated Revenue, necessitating substantial increases of taxes which the Australian people would not be prepared to pay. When the Minister for Labour and National Service was asked why the increases of pensions were not made retrospective to the 1st July, 1948, he that it would not be possible to do so.",43
129,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,My answer did not not mean that the payments would not ho made retrospective. I meant that the increases could not be paid on the 1st July. Mr BERN AHD CORSER - That was not the interpretation which I placed on the Minister's answer. Perhaps Opposition speakers have caused him to change his mind. He stated that it was impossible to make the increased payment earlier than November because of a shortage of staff.,43
130,Mr HARRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The Minister stated that it was a physical impossibility. Mr BERNARD CORSER,-He cannot get away from that. Mr HOJLLOWAY; - I do not want to change my statement.",44
131,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I hope, from the hint that the Minister has given, that Opposition speakers have convinced him that the increased payments should be made retrospective to the 1st July. He certainly stated that, because of a shortage of staff, it was cally impossible to adopt that procedure. Never before in our history have Commonwealth departments had such large staffs. Surely some of the officers who were formerly employed in the Prices Branch, could be assigned to assist other departments which are said, to be short-staffed. Only a few additional officers would be required to arrange for. the payment of the increased pensions to be made retrospective to the 1st July. The present proposal is that the increase shall not. he payable before November. If administrative difficulties are a real problem, the Australian Country party will accept the responsibility for making, the. necessary calculations, for payments, retrospective to the 1st July, and will not charge for its services. When the Prices Branch was issuing new orders almost daily, private businesses throughout Australia, from the small corner shop to the big wholesale and retail stores, had to make prompt adjustments, and shortage of staff was not accepted as an excuse for failure to do so. However, the Minister has made the excuse that because of administrativedifficulties, including shortage of. staff, the increased pension cannot: be paid until November. I contend that the payment must immediately be made retrospective to the 1st July. Shipowners, mine-owners and employersgenerally must adjust increases of wages from the date on which a court varies an award. They would not be permitted to wait for three months before making the adjustment. During World War II . , weexperienced government by regulation, and despite staff shortages, all private businesses had to comply promptly with alterations in orders, or he liable to a lieavy penalty. Mr Acting DEPUTY .SPEAKER (Mr Lazzarini) - Order ! The honourable member has carried that argument far enough and. I ask him to return to the bill.",44
132,Mr BERNARD CORSER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Private enterprise has to make prompt adjustments to comply with new awards, but evidently the Department of .Social Services cannot make an adjustment of"" pensions in three months because of the shortage of staff. As I have pointed out, physi- many Commonwealth departments' are already over-staffed and, if necessary,, additional clerical assistance could be supplied from the over-staffed departments to the Department of Social Services to enable pensioners to receive theincreased payments without further delay.",44
133,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Wilmot) [3.22] - A government is judged at the bar of public opinion on what it does or fails to dofor the health, education, family life and social security of the people. From the text of speeches in this debate, even including those by honourable membersopposite, I feel that this Government, although it has faults as all governments have, has not failed the people of Australia on those fundamental Christian principles. Social security is a fundamental Christian principle.",44
134,Mr GUELETT,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Is the honourable member making a speech or delivering a1 sermon ?,44
135,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,It would not do the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) any harm if it were a sermon.,44
136,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES, - Order !,44
137,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The honourable member has the right to leave the chamber if he does not desire to listen to my remarks. Mr GUT.LKTT - And I propose to exercise that right. Mr ACTINGDEPUTYSPEAKER . - Orcier ! The honourable member for Henty will leave the chamber in any event if he does not behave himself.,44
138,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"F o r centuries the aged, the temporarily sick, the temporarily unemployed, invalids, the broken in mind, the halt, the lame and the blind, mothers at childbirth, people stricken with tuberculosis, and widows and fatherless were not considered by governments to have any significant place in the scheme of things, and great tragedy, suffering and hardship was imposed [hereby upon successive generations up to the beginning of this century. As the result of the consistent agitation of a small band of Labour men who were - elected to the. Parliament of New South Wales and another small band who subsequently were elected to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the government of the day had to introduce the original 'Commonwealth invalid and pensions legislation in 1908. honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . White) ridiculed the statement of - the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Fraser) that it was the members of the Lahour party in the Parliament who were responsible for the passing of that wonderful act in 1908. That statement, however, was correct. There were then three parties in the Parliament. Two of them were loosely referred to as the Free Traders and the Protectionists. The other was the Labour party, which was at that time a minority - or cross bench party. It s members engaged in an agitation for the introduction - of legislation to help aged and invalid people. In return for the support of the Labonr party, the Deakin Government brought down the bill for the Invali d and Old-age Pensions Act of 1908 and so was able to remain in office. The Deakin - Government was forced to choose between bringing the bill down and suffering defeat as a result of the withdrawal of the support of the Labour party. It may be - of interest to recall what was said by Senator Mulcahy. of Tasmania, in the Senate on the 3rd June, 1908.",45
139,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,He was not a Labour iman.,45
140,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"As the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) says, Senator Mulcahy was not a member of the Labour party. He left no doubt in the mind of any one as to who was responsible for the passing of the first pensions act. He said I nm prepared to give the Labour party every credit in the matter, and I assert that if a scheme for the establishment of an old-age pension is approved, the whole of the credit will be due to the Labour party and not tin 1 Government. Other strong political opponents of the Labour party at that time contended that, it was due to the action of the Labour party of that day, small though it was, that the Old-age Pensions Act of 190S was passed. I think that answers the contention of honourable members opposite that the Labour movement, had nothing to clo with the passage of that legislation. In the years before the Curtin Government assumed' office in 1941, Australia was governed almost entirely by nonold-age Labour governments. Between 1908 ancl The 1941, a period of 33 years, age and invalid pensions were increased from 10s. a. week to 21s. 6d. a week. Between 1941, when the Curtin Government came into power, and the present time, which is a. period of only seven years, such pensions were increased by 21s. 6d. a week. The Labour party increased age and invalid pensions by double the amount that they were increased by the non-Labour parties, and did it in a quarter of the time. Even the Opposition is prepared to say that this legislation is good. It contains anomalies, but that is inevitable in such a comprehensive measure. Although honourable members opposite are not anxious at the moment to make this matter a political issue, I thought it only fair to those who have gone before us to relate the facts that I have just outlined. Having regard to its record in the fields of health, education and social services, the Government must surely be returned to power at the next general election. In my opinion, the greatest insurance scheme in which anybody could participate is our present social security scheme. Thousands of our people who live on low incomes are receiving maternity allowance, child endowment, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, widows pensions and the like, without making any direct contribution for them. Surely there is no greater insurance scheme in the world than that. It entails, however, that those people who enjoy financial independence must make a contribution to help those who cannot help themselves, or those who are not financially free to do as they like. 'Chat is a sound principle. It is the principle of the strong helping the weak, the rich helping the poor, those who ai'e well helping those who are sick, and those who have their sight, hearing aud the full use of their limbs helping the blind, the deaf, the dumb and the lame. When I hear a person moaning because he has to pay social service contributions, my immediate reply to him is, "" Why do you not regard the payment of your contributions as a thanksgiving to God that you have your health and strength?"" That is the way in which I regard my social service contributions. In the eight years during which I was a minister of religion, I visited many hospitals ancl saw many human beings who had been wrecked mentally and physically. Our social service scheme is a great insurance for broken humanity and the greatest practical expression of Christian beliefs. The main complaint of the rich people is that they do not receive anything in return for their social services contributions. They say it is always somebody else who receives help. As I have said, they should regard tlieir contributions as a thanksgiving that they are not in hospital and, therefore, have uo necessity to receive benefits that have been provided for hospital inmates. The aged, infirm, lame, blind and sufferers from tuberculosis and other diseases who are assisted by the operation of the social services scheme, many of whom are widows and many of whom are broken in mind as well as in body, are the victims of the ruthless economic system that was in existence wben World War II . began. Thousands of people have to receive the benefits and to be assisted by the Government because in pre-war years they were broken by that system. The system has been modified to some degree by the Government, but not as extensively as one would wish for. It is morally right and proper that a government should spend some of the taxpayers' money to assist the victims of such a ruthless economic system. I refer now to the attempt made by the Dnited Australia party Government in 193S to assist the people by introducing the National Health and Pensions In surance Bill . That legislation provided for the contribution of ls. 6d. a week by all wage earners and contained provisions for medical benefits and a free medicine service-whic h honourable members opposite ridicule today-and for a pension of £1 a week for contributors who reached the age of 65 years. It also provided a payment of 3s. 6d. a week for each child under the age of sixteen years. That, in the light of present-day conditions, does not sound like a very generous measure of social security. It represented, however, an attempt to provide some measure of social security. In the legislation now before the House the Labour Government has offered the people something in finitely better than was offered to them by Mr Casey when he was Treasurer in 193S. Is it any wonder that the Opposition does not wish to make this measurea party political matter? Any measure of social security should have some relation to the encouragement of the birth-rate. In his book, Women and Children First, Dr V . H . Wallace states that the greatest factor in the f a l ling birth-rate today is the economic factor. I do not entirely agree with him. J think that there should be some modification of that view. At page 143 of his book, Dr Wallace statesAs economic considerations constitute by far the greatest single factor in family limitation our social legislation should aim at removing all financial burdens which the rearing of children entails. In other words, society should be willing to pay for its ownsurvival. We, as a people, should be prepared to pay for our continued existence. I regard this as a fundamental principle which cannot and must not. be disregarded. It is the duty of each adult member of the community to shareequitably in the cost of rearing children. No .self-centred., luxury-loving person should, be allowed tn shirk his economic responsibilities in this matter. Xo man or woman without children should evade making an adequatefinancial contribution towards the maintenance of the young generation. This just and fundamental principle is not accepted aswidely as it should be, but we must all recognize its survival value and introduce social 1 egi s 1 at i o 11 a ceo rdi ngly. There are at least three ways in which we may help financially those young men and women wlio desire to marry and have children. We may assist them hy furniture and all the varied but essential goods necessary for them to set up house and start married life together. We may help them to meet the high cost of childbirth with its hospital fees, medical expenses and the purchasing of all those articles and supplies the advent of a baby entails. Finally, we may help then\ to maintain their offspring u n those children are old enough to earn a living for themselves. We must be willing to do all three if we, as a people, are to survive, and we should make the assistance generous enough to be effective. Some critics refer contemptuously to assistance as a "" hand o u t "" . They say that it is spoon-feeding young couples and that such treatment destroys the spirit of independence. This criticism is evidence of a complete misunderstanding of the position. Dr Wallace also says that mutual aid must be the underlying principle if society is to survive in this modern age. In that, I entirely agree ""with him. In a hook entitled Mutual Aid, Prince Kropotkin shows that only by co-operation and mutual assistance can social groups .flourish, whether 'they belong .to the human or to the lower animal species. The principle of mutual aid has never been fully established. The system under which w.e live, whether we call it a capitalistic or .an individualistic system, has been a selfish system, the fundamental principle of which is self first and others last. It is .difficult to establish and operate a system of mutual aid under these conditions. However, by legislation such as that now under consideration, Labour governments during the last seven years have endeavoured to imbue the people with the principle of mutual aid to the less fortunate members of the community. 'The three methods by which Wallace suggests we may assist the birth rate are, first, the provision of marriage loans; secondly, allowances; and thirdly, child endowment or family allowances. He deals with each in separate chapters, and he - covers his subject very well indeed. There are some aspects of the economic factor in family life to which I wish to draw some attention. During the depression years 30,000 couples who otherwise would have married did not do so. According to' the statistics, the fact that those marriages did not take place is one of the fundamental causes of the problem of the teen-age group in industry which Ifr. Duthie. is so handicapping our industrial progress. ""Whilst it is true that the economic factors of the depression years did result in fewer marriages, I cannot, however, help feeling that the influence of the economic factor on the birth rate is somewhat over-emphasized. In places which where poverty is rife, children are most numerous. In many European countries t i l where the people, far from enjoying any measure of social security, have always been on the bread line, there are to be seen millions of children. It cannot be said that children are numerous in these countries because of the social security afforded to their peoples. Indeed, the birth-rate is high in countries where poverty, bewilderment and misery are the lot cf the common people. In China, Japan and - India, where poverty and malnutrition are rampant, the birth-rate is extra-ordinarily high. In OUT great cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane the largest families are to be found not dn the better-cljass suburbs, but in ""working-class suburbs and slum areas. In our poorest and shabbiest suburbs children are to be seen playing in the streets every day by the hundreds. I know that that is so because I have worked in the slums of Melbourne. I know that the largest families are to be found not in the best suburbs, such as Toorak in Melbourne, and at Darling Point in Sydney, where in general the people enjoy the greatest measure of 'social security, but in the poorer areas. iSo, in my opinion the economic factor in relation to the birthrate is definitely overrated. There are several factors which contribute to the lack of child birth in the middle and upper class groups in this country. That is where the failure lies, not amongst the maternity lower groups at all. The lowest average number of children in a family is found in the middle and upper class groups who cannot plead economic reasons for their faihrre to have children. They cannot plead that they are poverty stricken, or that they have not amenities in their homes because they have the lot, but still do not have children. They are more prepared, in many instances, to look after pomeranian dogs, to engage in social life and to try to climb the social ladder, and to indulge in sport and pleasure.",45
141,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,", - Order ! The honourable member should confine his remarks to the subject of the debate.",48
142,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I place these facts before the House to show that the economic factor is grossly overemphasized - today as a reason for the falling birthrate. Dr Wallace stresses that encouragement could be given to increasing the birth-rate by the provision of marriage loans. However, we have discussed that matter in the caucus, but so far nothing further has been done in that connection. Before the war the authorities in Germany went thoroughly into the principle of marriage, loans and that aspect of the matter is dealt with fully in Women and Children First?. Although the birth-rate did increase following the granting of marxiage loans, other statisticsshow that that increase was. not: due entirely to that incentive.",48
143,Mr BLAHST,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Can the honourable member tell us how the Germans were treated ?,48
144,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I shall now refer to the maternity allowance. On page 158 of that book the following appears as a quotation from the official Year-Boole for 1939 at page 232:Under the provisions of the Maternity Allowance-Act 1912-1937 a sum of. £4 10s. is payable to the mother in respect of each confinement at which a Hving or viable child is born, provided the total income of the claimant and her husband for the period of twelve months preceding the date of the birth did not exceed £247. Where there are already one or two children under fourteen the amount payable is £5, with an income limi t of £2G3, and where there are three or more other children under fourteen the amount payable is £7 10s. with an income Umit of £338. [ quote that as evidence of conditions in Australia in 1939. Dr Wallace then commentsWhat niggardly parsimonious payments! And what caution is displayed! The Government seems to have been afraid of paying a few shillings too much. New life, the source of our future strength aud greatness, is involved. We are here concerned wit h the citizens of . tomorrow who w i ll develop this great country, advance its culture, defend it against foreign aggression and play a prominent part in the progress of civilization. If it was worth spending many hundreds of millions of pounds on unproductive war-time activities surely it ie worth wliile investing a few modest millions in the removal of the economic disabilities of parenthood. T521 That was the maternity allowance provision when the present Government came into office. Now, when the first child is born in a family, £15 is paid altogether as a maternity allowance. The siun of £5 is paid for the child, £5 to the mother before the birth, and £5 after the birth. Eor the second child £16 10s. is payable, and for the third child, £17 10s. This has been a tremendous help to mothers and the Government is to be commended for having trebled the amount payable to mothers at child birth, to help finance the coming of the baby into the world. It is important for honourable members to realise that motherhood is the greatest achievement of womanhood, upon which nationhood is founded. Upon that depends the very survival of' the nation, and anything that the Government can do to encourage parenthood must be of great service to the country. It may be that the maternity allowance will be increased in years to come. I hope that' it will be. All of the benefits provided are of tremendous assistance to families. In his reference to child endowment, Dr Wallace quoted the words of Miss Eleanor E. Eathbone, who wrote on this subject in TJie Case for Family Allowances. She says that there are three different methods by which family allowances should be paid. These are a State-paid system, a contributory insurance scheme, and themethod of equalization funds or pools. She shows that, the best schemeis undoubtedly a wholly State-paid national scheme covering the entire child population. That is the scheme this Government has adopted, and Dr Wallace commends us for having raised child, endowment from 5s. a week to 7s. 6d. a week. Now this legislation is raising the amount payable to 10s. a week for every child after the first. The principle is sound. As a result of this increase, in a family comprising six children, the child endowment entitlement for five of them would he £2 10s. a week. That amount would come into the. home over and above the wages of the husband. Prom every point of. view the endowment scheme is good. It has been while suggested that there are mothers who should be criticized because of the wastef ul methods they employ. Of course there are mothers, ancl also fathers aud. members of Parliament wbo are wasteful in their methods. There are members of every community who are wasteful. Perhaps we will never be able to teach them otherwise. Should we condemn the thrifty mothers who wish to use this money for their children, merely because some other mothers may squander il. wastefully? In principle, the scheme is sound. The only change that will be made to it-while this Government is in power is that the amount payable will be increased still further. It will not be reduced. I have now referred to the main factors on the economic side whereby we can assist family life in this country and encourage an increase of the birthrate in Australia. As I said previously ihe economic factors can be over-stressed as the principal cause of the falling birthrate. Another matteito which I wish to refer was raised by the honourable memher for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) in the able speech she delivered yesterday. She suggested that we should relate pensions to the eost of living. Whilst that is an admirable objective, it is not easily done. I shall refer to the years 1919 to 1921. Was there any attempt by anti-Labour governments in those postwar boom years to relate pensions to the cost of living? No.",48
145,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,There was an automatic provision in the act.,49
146,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It was only just prior to the second world war that any thought wa9 given to the desirability of relatpublic ing pensions to the basic wage or the cost of living. That was done at the of Is. increases at a time. Though the principle may be good, the working of it in practice is not easy. If the of living is high in relation to the value of the pension, the actual value is less than it would otherwise be. The cost of living is not going to keep rising. It is inevitable that the cost living will come down as production increases. A fall may be expected year or the year after. I point out to honourable members that whilst the sioners of this country may be feeling pinch in a certain sense today because of the high cost of foodstuffs, and rentals, the time will most assuredly come when the costs of those items will be lower. The amount of the pensions will not then be reduced.",49
147,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,How does the honourable member know?,49
148,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,This country would be in a serious financialstate if the Australian Labour party ever reduced pensions.,49
149,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The honourable member should not commence electioneering already.,49
150,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Honourable members cannot deny that fact. It is of no nse to try to get around it. The cost of living will ultimately come down and as it does the value of pension payments will increase. The pension itself will not he decreased while this Government remains in office.,49
151,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Can the honourable meinber guarantee that?,49
152,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Yes , the Government has established a reserve to maintain pension rates, and the pensioners may feel happy about that aspect of the future. The benefits that the Government is providing today cover a very wide range indeed. They include funeral benefits, hospital benefits, tuberculosis benefits, pensions for the blind, free medicine, allowance for the wife of an invalid pensioner, widows' pensions in three classes, maternity allowances, child endowment, sickness and unemployment benefits and a host of smaller benefits that the are not very conversant with. Under this bill we propose to raise invalid rate and age pensions by 5s. a week, and to increase from 25s. to 30s. a week the perout missible income which all classes may cost receive without pensions being affected. In the case of a blind pensioner the increase of permissible income has been raised from fo 7s. 6d. to £5 17s. 6d. a on week. The property bar is to be raised of from £650 to £750, and the rate of child endowment has been increased from 7s. 6d. next a week to 10s. a week. I refer particularly to what is proposed pento be done for the blind. Many blind the persons earn a. considerable amount. The amount of income which a blind person may earn without affecting the amount of his pension has been increased from £5 7s. (kl. to £5 17s. 6d. n week. Blind pensioners will thus, in many instances, be able to retain their income, and in addition receive the pension. In effect, this will mean that they may receive a total income of £8 a week instead of £7 os. a week as at present. Where hoth husband ancl wife are blind they will be permitted to earn between them £5 17s. 6d., and in addition will receive the full amount of pension. The total income they may thus receive will be £10 2s. 6d. a week instead of £9 2s. 6d. as at present. The total cost of all these recent increases will be considerable The increase of 5s. per week in pensions will cost the Government an additional £15,000,000 a year; the liberalization of the means test, for which this Government must be commended, will cost an additional £2,300,000; and the increase in the rate of child endowment will cost £6,700,000. Pension payments will increase by £6,000,000. Later on, the purchasing power thus released by these pensions w i ll have the full effect within the homes to which it goes, as the cost of living decreases. The real life blood of a nation is its purchasing power. To draw that off would mean financial ancl economic death. I claim that by the provision of £SO,000,000 for social services the Government is ensuring that the nation will be kept healthy, virile and happy. I have great pleasure in commending this legislation to honourable members. . Mr BOWDEN (Gippsland) [4.0] My comments on this bill will be short. They will be all the shorter, because I had intended to comment on the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lazzarini), and I have decided that he, as Mr Acting Deputy Speaker at the moment is either too well, or too unfavorably, situated to warrant my replying to him. This bill provides for increasing age and invalid pensions by 5s. a week, and a pensioner's permissible earnings from 20s. to 30s. a week. Provision is also made for small increases to war pensioners. No one can object to the bill . The Minister who introduced it (Mr . Holloway), and many honourable members on both sides of the House, did their best when discussing the measure to avoid party politics and electioneering propaganda. However, the debate was apparently going too smoothly, ancl it became impossible for some Government supporters to refrain from saying how marvellous the Labour party was, and from claiming that if it were not for the Labour party the whole world would collapse. Therefore, it became necessary for lionorable members on this side of the House to answer them. Some honourable members opposite speak of members of the Opposition as savages who would like to see people standing around the doors begging for crumbs. I remind them that there is as much humanity on this side of the House as on the other. I commend the honourable member for Hindmarsh (MT . Thompson), who succeeded in keeping party politics out of his speech. He did not seek to give the Labour party credit where credit was not due, or to blame the Opposition when blame was not deserved. Later, some other government back-benchers spoke, and we have had to listen to some extraordinary statements from them. They have tried to convince the pensioners that the Government is really doing something worthwhile for them. Actually, the bill merely represents an attempt to keep pensions abreast of the cost of living, and even in that it has not succeeded very well. However, to hear honourable members opposite, one would tliink that the millennium had arrived. After all, it is only proposed to raise age and invalid pensions to £2 2s. 6d. a week. Some honourable members opposite have attempted to paint a. false picture by saying that an old couple could draw between them £7 5s. a week, while livin g in their own home. To achieve this, each would have to earn 30s. a week. If they are unable to do this, they will have to be content with £4 5s. a week for the two of them, and. if out of this they have to pay rent for a homo they will not have much to come and go on. If the Labour party is responsible for that, it has nothing much to boast about. I was disappointed in the speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Fraser), who tried to discredit the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) because he referred to certain old people in the Northern Territory who still have the pioneer spirit, and fiercely resent anything in the nature of charity, because they like to believe that they have the eapacity to provide for their own old age. I do not say that their attitude is always right. It is a pleasure for us to help them when they cannot help themselves. But to decry the independent spirit which made this country great, and. which built the Empire, is to do disservice to the nation. The Labour party has encouraged people to believe that they need make no effort to meet a crisis. All they need to do is against the post and hold out a hand, confident that some one-the Government, most probably-wil l put something .in it. No one is encouraged to save in order to provide against old age or decrepitude. It would be a tragedy if the spirit of independence were to disappear from among the people. Some Government supporters have tried to create the impression that, but for the Labour party, there would be no pensions and no social services. As a matter of fact, it was the Deakin Government, which was non-Labour, that put the original Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act through the Parliament. Honourable members opposite claim, of course, that it was done under Labour pressure.",49
153,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Sir'Joh n Forrest, who was Treasurer in the Deakin Government, resigned over that issue.",51
154,Mr BOWDEN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It is absurd to suggest that a handful of Labour members were able to bring enough pressure to bear on the Deakin Government to influence its policy. If the Deakin Government had been defeated on the issue, the Labour party would not have been strong enough to form a government, and there would have been no pensions scheme. The present Opposition parties have, in the years gone by, built the bridges, and the Labour party is trying to claim credit for all the water that has run under them. It is time that the public knew and understood what hypocritical stuff is talked by honourable members opposite. At the present time, the pensions of ex-servicemen are not high enough. Indeed, they are a disgrace. Widows are complaining that they have not enough to live on. Yet, according to .honourable members opposite, everything is rosy, and no one has anything to worry about undei this marvel1 lous Government ! It is sickening to hear them talk in that fashion. If the Labour Government were to introduce a sound social service scheme on a permanent basis I should be happy to support it. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) declared that social .service payments, no matter how great, could not be met out of loans. They must be paid out of to lean revenue. The significance of that has not, apparently, registered with backbench supporters of the Government. To every one else it is obviously unsound to base a social service system upon such a fluctuating quantity as the national revenue. At the present time, revenue is high because prices for our wool, wheat and butter are at an unprecedentedly high level. However, if prices for our primary products were to fall by 50 per cent., the national revenue would decline correspondingly, and where then would the Government get £100,000,000 a yeaT for social services ? Some honourable members opposite have referred to - the New Zealand social service scheme, which is a contributory one. Such a scheme 'may well be . sound enough, but it is uot sound to .rely upon revenue to maintain a social service system; yet honourable members opposite talk as if increasing the cost of social services from £17,000,000 to £100,000,000 was something clever. The whole system will collapse if prices for our export commodities should seriously decline. If there should be a general economic depression, the position will become even worse. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) claimed that, as long as the Labour Government was in power, pensions would not be reduced. It might be possible to maintain pensions at their present level, but if the national income falls pensions can be maintained only at the cost of other social services. A previous speaker cited figures which emphasized the ever-increasing number of pensioners in the community, and the decreasing number of those who are earning. It is estimated that by 1960 every four persons who are earning will be supporting an age pensioner, in addition to whitjh the community will have to support the blind, the halt, the sick and the maimed. It is a terrifying thought and the burden may well prove to be too heavy for the younger people to bear. Because of scientific discoveries, the average expectation of life is greater now than it used to be, but for some inexplicable reason the birth-rate is falling. I am glad that the honourable member for Wilmot demonstrated the absurdity of the guff that is talked about the birth-rate being influenced by economic conditions. He very properly pointed out that the birthrate was higher among people living in the slums than among those who live in big homes where they have every comfort. The birth-rate is higher in India ancl China, where economic conditions are generally low, than in countries where the standard of living is higher. Obviously, the raising of the standard of living is not the solution of the problem of the declining birth-rate. Every year, fewer children are being born, while every year more and more old people become pensioners of the State. If ""he means test were abolished, an extra £52,000,000 a yeai' would have to be found for pensions, and it is ridiculous to suggest that, this could be done all at once. However, no one can deny the right of those who pay the taxes to share in their distribution. I admit that the means test cannot be abolished in one, two or three years. We should need to make the necessary provision for it. The only honest and wise way in which we can help those who cannot help themselves is by adopting a scheme with a sounder backing than that provided by a fluctuating overseas market. We should adopt a scheme similar to that which is in operation in New Zealand, where the means test has been abolished and a contributory system has been introduced. Mr HOJ.LOWAT - The means test has. been only partly abolished in New Zealand.",51
155,Mr BOWDEN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I understood that it had been completely abolished. However, we in Australia must evolve a permanent scheme which will stand up to any test. Instead of doing so, honourable members opposite are boasting about the virtues of the present scheme, and are completely overlooking the fact that Commonwealth revenue is uow the greatest in our history. I should feel assured that social services will always be maintained at the present level. 1 should feel much happier in my mind that the people, of Australia were being less deceived ^ if a scheme were introduced that could operate in any economic circumstances. I do not, .propose to criticize any social services schemes which have been introduced by this or any previous government with that objective in view. Unquestionably, a scheme can be evolved which will remain soxmd under any economic conditions. Under the present system, that is not possible, and no honourable member can honestly pretend that it is. All that we are doing is to dig in a number of leaning posts. We are discouraging people from being thrifty and providing for themselves. I agree with the statement by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) that not all the people who are receiving pensions deserve them. I have in mind the "" boozers "" and "" guzzlers "", who, during their working life, did not save a penny but swilled away their earnings onalcohol. I would not care what happened to them. They did not contribute one penny to the development of this country. However, I realise that if we were to penalize them,, we should also penalize hundreds of thousands of worthy people. Therefore, on the principle of British justice that it is preferable that nine guilty persons shall go free than that one innocent person shall be made to suffer, I agree that all persons who conform to the conditions of the means test should receive a. pension. However, I do not wax enthusiastic about trying to help those who have never saved a penny but have squandered everything that they have received. Every citizen has the responsibility to do his best to relieve the nation of the obligation to maintain him in his old age, and when he is "" down and out "". An obligation devolves on him to help himself, and he should apply to the Government for assistance only when he has not sufficient means adequately to provide for himself! Some honourable members opposite probably considered that this debate waa proceeding too smoothly, and that the Laboui party was not receiving sufficient 1 credit for its share in introducing or expanding social services. Therefore, they endeavoured to discredit the Opposition and to give all the credit to the Labour party. They reluctantly admitted that the Menzies Government introduced - jhild endowment, but they qualified that admission with the words, "" under pressure from the Labour party"". They sought to claim for the Labour party all the credit for every social improvement that had been in the country. They were, in effect, trying to claim all the water that had run under the bridges built by the political parties that now constitute the Opposition in this House. The Labour party adopted those tactics in regard to defence and later in regard to pensions. The purpose of honourable members opposite in doing so was to endeavour to convince the people before the nert election that the Labour party and not the Liberal party and the Australian Country party was their friend. The bill bas my approval, and the approval of every member of the Opposition, but the measure could have had a speedy passage, free from party bias, had some honourable member opposite not introduced party politics into the debate. Last night, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) began a tirade. I am not able to deal with that speech, because, as Mr Deputy Speaker at the moment and not as the private memher for Werriwa, y.ou, sir, are in a favourable position to protect yourself.",52
156,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES, The Chair has no objection to the honourable membev critition. cizing the speech; he may go ahead.,53
157,Mr BOWDEN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The honourable ber for the Northern Territory disposed of the speech by the honourable membei as for Werriwa most effectively. In opinion, it was a most objectionable he has made a statement speech, because an atmosphere of harit mony existed in the House and no honorhe able members objected to the bill. Indeed, who can object to an increase of pension amounting fco « miserable 5s. a week? Honourable members opposite scoff. Any pensioner listening to the debate can excused for thinking that, in the minds of honourable members of the Labour party, the increase of pension is sufficient to enable a recipient to buy a mansion. Honourable members opposite are scratching their hacks with pleasure because of a miserable 5s. a week. They should return to reality. I approve of the bill, but I hope that, in future, social sevvices will be discussed outside the realm of party politics and that members of one political party will not claim a. monopoly of all the charitable emotions in the House. During this debate, honourable members opposite have pretended that the menibers of the Opposition are like savage beasts, and want to grind the pensioners down at every opportunity. Some, educated gentlemen opposite should be ashamed of themselves for having fried to create that impression.",53
158,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Fremantle) [4.22] T'he honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) deplored the party political controversy on the subject of social services - It would he true to say that there has been very little party controversy about the proposed increase of pensions, the nature of the pensions, and the classes of people who should receive them, but there has been a good deal of party controversy about the method of financing social services. When discussing that aspect, the honourable member for Gippsland suggested that revenue was not a solid base for the scheme. He did not really tell us what he considered to be a more solid basis, but I am not doing him an injustice when I say that he consider? that a contributory scheme will be a basis for social services than n scheme financed out of proceeds for taxaI f the honourable gentleman is arguing that it is sounder ethically for a permemson to be directly aware that he is contributing to his future benefits, 1 he would be if he were my contributing to an insurance scheme, that will be very difficult to, refute. But if is trying to inform the country that contributions make a. sounder financial basis tban taxation to safeguard pensions in the event of an economic depression. I advise the honourable gentleman to read be a. report produced and signed by members, of the two political parties which now constitute the Opposition. The principal signatory was a former member for Parramatta, Sir Frederick Stewart. That report made an exhaustive examination of contributory schemes throughout the world. If there is an economic depression or a serious fall in national income, a system of social services based on contributions is no safer than a system of social services based on tax contributions. Sir Frederick Stewart pointed out that when 2,500,000 persons were unemployed in Great Britain it was obvious that they could not contribute to a contributory scheme any more than they eould pay taxes to a. tax-financed scheme. The contributions that an individual can make are no more independent of his income than the taxes that he can pay are independent of his income. Quite clearly, under depressed conditions, a contributory scheme is as unsafe as is a scheme financed out of taxation. Sir Frederick Stewart pointed out that fact, and also dealt with the ethical argument in favour of a contributory, scheme, but I shall not deal with that aspect. Another matter to which I propose to direct attention is the pensions which are payable to sufferers from tuberculosis. At rhe Wooroloo Sanatorium in Western Australia a. brilliant doctor who was appointed not long ago has started occupational therapy. He has established some kind of industry within the colony of people suffering from tuberculosis, and they have developed it. Many of the patients are able to earn quite a reasonable income, and the interest which they have in their jobs helps to cure them. But the operation of the means test has the immediate effect of reducing their invalid pension. I am not making an attack on the Government, but am merely pointing out an unexpected anomaly. However, the reduction of pension acts as a deterrent to the sanatorium patients and authorities alike in relation to the earning of income and the expanding of the industry that the colony has developed. There cannot be a large number of tuberculosis sufferers in Australia, and I cannot believe that the abolition of the means test on their income, when earned under the control of a sanatorium for work done as a part of the hospital treatment, can make a significant dent in the Commonwealth revenue. I am certain that it is possible to abolish or drastically modify the means test applicable to. the earnings of invalid pensioners in the circumstances which I have described. Tho honourable member for Gippsland complained that the community was becoming pension-minded and that the virtue of thrift had been forgotten. The emphasis which members of the Opposition sometimes place on that point creates the impression that they are hostile to the payment of pensions, and the emphasis which they also place on the necessity for abolishing the means test has caused their strictures to be regarded as an unfair attack on the Governmeut. That belief has led many members of the Labour party to defend the social services record of the Labour party compared with that, of the Opposition parties. I propose briefly to examine the subject of thrift. Savings are dependent directly upon the capacity to save. As a member of the Parliament, I am able to save more than I was able to save when I was a teacher but that does not mean that I am now more virtuous than I was then in that respect. The explanation is that I now have a higher income than I previously had. But I have not become more virtuous. The wife of a man in receipt of the basic wage, which, after all, is the wage computed to purchase only the basicneeds, can save only at the expense of her family. In those circumstances, the statement that thrift is a virtue is utter rubbish. But wise, intelligent expenditure is definitely a virtue. A person in receipt of the basic wage cannot possibly save a sum of money that will guarantee to him an income in his old age. When we talk loosely about thrift, and say that those who have happened to save are, ipso facto, more virtuous than those who liave not, we are talking utter nonsense, and obscuring the problem. There are other matters to be considered. Let us examine the child endowment. A person with dependants does not need to have a high income now before he finds that his social services contributions equal the child endowment payments that his wife receives. The exception to that statement, of course, is provided by the wage earner with a large family. A man in receipt af quite a moderate inoome can be making a social services contribution of 10s. a week and be receiving a similar - amount in child endowment. A great social advantage of child endowment lies in the fact that the expenditure is put into the hands of the woman. It seems to me to be true to say that in the main women make money go further than men, and insofar as child endowment makes a transfer of expenditure into the hands of women it is a great social advantage. Of course, in the case of large families it also has the great advantage of assisting in the bringing up of the children. The question of a contributory scheme has been raised on several occasions. I have dealt with the argument that it is more soundly hased than a scheme which is dependent on ordinary revenue. If there is a depression and consequent mass unemployment in Australia, it is quite clear that tax contributions to an age pensions scheme will not be kept up and :at some point the Government will be forced to revise all social service benefits downwards. That would apply as much to a contributory scheme as to one that was financed out of taxes. I feel that honourable gentlemen opposite, in dealing with this matter, ought at least to referto the existence of a fund, which now amounts, I believe, to £79,000,000 and which is intended to act as a reserve in a period when there may be a decrease of revenue. Since the National ""Welfare Fund is not, as it were, living from day to day or from hand to mouth, it at least provides a reserve that would cushion the shock of any sudden fall in government revenue in the event of a depression. T congratulate the Government upon the proposed increase of the age and invalid pension, but I agree that it will not do anything more than to offset the rising cost of living. The pensioners in Western Australia take the view, and it is a difficult one to refute, that the age and invalid pension should be fixed at 40 per cent, of the Commonwealth basic wage.",53
159,Dame ENID LYONS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,To'ris e and fall with costs of living?,55
160,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Yes . That would follow if it were always to be 40 per of the Commonwealth basic wage. The amount of money that pensioners would receive at the present time if that proposal were adopted is approximately £2 9s. weekly, or 6s. 6d. more than they are now receiving. An old couple would get £4 ISs. a week. To ask that pensions should be fixed at 40 per cent, of the Commonwealth basic wage does not seem to me to be making a demand for .something that would jeopardize the present fund. As I say, there is now a reserve of £79,000,000. If the cost of living fell, pensions would be decreased; if it rose, they would be increased. I realise that there are revenue difficulties. Governments liketo be able to anticipate expenditure for a year ahead, but I think that that is an obsolete concept. It is possible, in relation to certain items in the budget, to estimate expenditure for a period of more than a year ahead. It is possible to budget for a longer period than one year ahead and to allow for contingencies such as variations in the cost of living and in fact we are doing it by building up a reserve. The amonnt at present in the fund is £79,000,000, and it will, I presume, he increased further. If the proposal of the Western Australian people were adopted, it would help those people who are concerned ahout the rising cost of living. It is difficult to be dogmatic about pensions. . An old couple who are receiving between them an age pension of £4 5s. a week today are not badly off, if they have their own home. They are not involved in the clothing and travelling expenses that have to be borne by people who go out to work. If , however, from that £4 5s. a week they have to pay 25s. or 30s. a week for rent, their position is entirely different. We have to face the fact that 85 per cent, of age pensioners have no means other than their pensions. Some of them may own their own homes, but they are probably in a minority. I consider that at some time in the future the means test should at least be modified in its application to a pensioner who has to pay rent. The means test will operate in exactly the same way in respect of a pensioner with his own home who is earning 35s. a week and a pensioner without cent, his own home who is earning the same sum. but the position of the two people is entirely different. In making modifications of the means test the question of dead loss expenditure, such, as rent, ought to he taken into consideration. This measure will do something to enable the pensioner to get nearer to the rising cost of living and therefore in common with other honourable members, f support it.",55
161,Dr GAHA,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Denison) [4.38] - I have listened with interest to the debate on the motion for the second reading of this bill.,56
162,Mr BEALE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Did the honourable gentleman listen to it in-Tasmania?,56
163,Dr GAHA,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) is indulging in cheap gibes. It is not possible to educate ignorance out of such people, whatever is done. I was particularly interested in the remark of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) that women make money go further than men. Like the honourable member, I have recently entered into the bonds of matrimony. I have had some breathtaking experiences. I do not want to dilate upon them, but I think that neither my heart nor my pocket will stand it if they continue for much longer.",56
164,Mr HARRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The honourable gentleman should have married for money.,56
165,Dr GAHA,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I may try the next time. For some years we concentrated upon fixing a basic wage, and later provision was made for the payment of child endowment. I have never been able to understand the purpose of child endowment. I hope to make that remark clear as I proceed. In the famous Harvester award the learned judge, having regard to the size of the average Australian family of that time, fixed the basic wage at a level which would provide for the needs of five people. I think that award was made in 1907. ""When another learned judge investigated the position in the early days of war he found that the size of the average Australian family had decreased, and his award provided for the reasonable needs of three people. The Harvester award was made on the basis of the reasonable needs of a man with a wife and three children, but the later award related to the needs of a man with a wife and one child. Honourable members opposite have explained that child endowment was not provided for the first child because it was covered by the basic wage. ""We can only conclude, therefore, that the purpose of child endowment was not to encourage the growth of family life in this country, but to implement the hasic wage hy making payments in respect of children other than the .first a charge upon the national revenue and not upon industry. If that is true, it is a sad commentary upon the decisions of the Arbitration Court in the years between 1907 and 1940 or 1941. I do not want to cast slurs upon judges, but AVC must take the facts as we find them. We can only conclude that, instead of child endowment being designed to encourage the growth of family life in this country, its purpose today is to implement the basic wage. There are fundamental differences between the two principles, and I shall endeavour to explain them to the House. The Commonwealth Statistician has supplied me withsome very illuminating figures relating to the number of persons in Australia who have dependent children under th* age of sixteen years. The figures are compiled to the 30th June, 1947. In round figures, in Slew South Wales there were at that time 176,000 families of one child, 121,000 families of two children, and 23,000 families of four children. It has been said that families of two children are not sufficient to maintain our Dooulation at its present figure. In thp 'nineties the average Australian family consisted of 6.2 children but today it consists of two children. If the purpose of child endowment is to encourage the growth of family life, we must approach the problem in a different way. If honourable members will consider the facts that led to the outbreak of the South African war they will find that it had its origin in a curious piece of legislation that was introduced by a South African Government many years ago. The Government discovered that if it extended the franchise to all the people who were entering South Africa, those people would be able to out-vote the native Boers. One of its actions was to impose intolerable conditions upon people who wanted to enter the country, to make it their home and to rear their families there. The Government disfranchised them because it realized that if they were given full voting power they would be able to outvote the native Boers. If there is a large influx of migrants into Australia over a period of years, it may not be long before they will be in a position to out-vote the Australian equivalent of the native Boers. That may produce another kind of problem altogether which has not been thought of, or at least which T have not heard discussed in this chamber. If , on the one hand, we have a steadily declining natural increase of population and on the other a gradually increasing population in consequence of our migration policy, the time must come, in the not-distant future, when the impact of the migrant on the Australian-born must be materially felt. I do not say that that would be a bad thing, but it is a sad commentary on our own people if we cannot maintain our own natural growth of population. Although the population is increasing it is increasing because of greater longevity among our people and by migration, and not by an increasing birth-rate. child endowment for that reason alone should be given an entirely new meaning. It should not be regarded as a supplementation of the basic wage, but as an encouragement of the growth of family life in this country. Honourable members can visualize some idea of the picture from these figures. Out of 392,000 families in New South Wales, there are only 23,000 families with four or more children. Of the 263,000 families in Victoria, only 14,000 have four or more children. In Queensland the comparative figures are much the same. In that State out of the 147,000 families only 10,000 have four or more children. The estimated figures for the Commonwealth are 9S7,000 families and only 58,000 families of four or more children. That indicates how little the Australian-born ultimately control the destinies of their country. Child endowment be given an entirely different significance. I do not want to touch on some of the political issues in this proposition because when party politics reach their full impact on the community reason seems to go outside the door. It Dr Gaha. is no use to try to reason with people when the press chooses to cause them to panic. 1 believe that when the people at the last referendum rejected the Government's proposal to control rents and prices they did their country a very great disservice. Lf the Commonwealth has power to fix the basic wage it should also have power to control the prices of essential commodities upon which the basic wage has to be expended. It should not lie possible for the Arbitration Court to raise tue basic wage to, say, £7 a week, only to find that on the day after the judgment is delivered the prices of meat and bread rise to offset the increased wage. It should be possible for the Government to say, "" The court has fixed the basic wage at £7 a week; vve now fix the prices of bread, meat and other essential commodities within very narrow margins of fluctuation "". The basic wage would then mean something. In. criticizing honourable members opposite for advising the people to reject the Government';proposals at the recent referendum I do not do so merely because of party alinements. Results have proved that they So, did this country a singular disservice because after having agreed to allow the Arbitration Court to determine the minimum basic wage they refused to allow the Government to control the prices of essential commodities that that basic wage must be used to buy. I believe that the day will come when Unpeople will approach this - problem, not with a mind biased hy party politics, but with sanity. They will apply themselves to the solution of this problem on rational lines because they will be forced to realise that it is of no use for them to hide their heads in the sand. Political change is in the air, and instead of trying to hold it back we would do better to attempt to guide it on rational lines. Just as the struggle for democracy, great and enduring as it was, ultimately will succeeded, so the struggle for newer thought in politics must win through. should We must not be hidebound in our approach to this problem; rather must we be prepared to adapt ourselves to the change with a considerable degree of flexibility. Rather than have things happen by a process of revolution we must achieve them by a process of evolution. The time has arrived when we should reconsider the whole subject of child endowment not as a supplement to the basic wage, as it is regarded today, but as a means of encouraging the growth of family life in this country. If the Commonwealth Constitution enables ns to do so, I should like the determination of the basic wage to he referred back to the Arbitration Court. We should say to the court, "" You must determine a basic wage which makes provision for a man, his wife and two children "". Some one may ask, "" What about the man who accepts no family responsibility?"" My answer is that we can look after the responsibility of such a man by taxation. If we did that and then said to the people, ""We shall remove from the field of legislation the need for providing for the second child; if you are prepared to have a third child we will give you 25s. a week; if you have a fourth child we will give you £2 » week"", we would encourage in this young country the growth of Australian-born population that is so urgently needed to ensure our future safety. During the last ten years, the whole Australian picture has changed. Ten years ago, we were a people living close to the .=outhern-most portion of Asia, carving (inf. our own destiny in our own way. To-day, we no longer enjoy that freedom. The world is becoming conscious that we liave vast open spaces and potential resources waiting to be developed. A population of 7,000,000 people, a large percentage of which is moving into the old age group, cannot adequately protect this country. It behoves us to admit that new movements are in the air. We should apply ourselves diligently to understand them. As a first step, granted that we have the necessary machinery and the necessary constitutional power, we should refer back to the Arbitration Oourt the fixation of the basic wage and direct the court to fix a basic wage adequate to meet the needs of a man, his wife and two children. Next, we should provide for child endowment to be paid solely for the purpose of promoting the growth of in milies.",56
166,Mr CONELAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The States could that.,58
167,Dr GAHA,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The States have the requisite constitutional power, but they would not be able to exercise it because of the operation of uniform taxation. That is not the only way by which the problem of our dwindling birth-rate could be tackled. There are many others. For instance, the efforts of the department administered by the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon) have been directed towards making provision at the earliest possible moment for larger families. That avenue could be further explored. In terms of size, family life in Australia is deteriorating. We are maintaining our numbers by increasing longevity and by enabling an ever increasing flow of migrants to infiltrate our population. I trust that the migration policy of the Government will be continued. No honourable member of this House in my time has pushed with more vigor than I have the necessity for attracting migrants to Australia, for I realise that because of our geographical situation .and increasingly significant of the place we are taking in the scheme of world affairs the world is becoming far more conscious of our importance. I offer these comments in no carping spirit, but solely because I believe that I am suggesting the correct approach to our social services problem insofar as it is affected by child endowment. I do not wish to bore honourable members any more on the subject except to emphasize that it is indeed tragic that, of approximately 1,000,000 families in t.he Commonwealth only 5S,000 liave four or more children and only 2.11 have ten children or more. This problem demands the attention of every person in the community. I am aware that it would be an unpopular move for the Government to try to upset a principle that is well established as part and parcel of our social services programme. However, to provide for the second child in the basic wage would represent no innovation. Indeed, as early as 1907 the court provided a wage which was estimated to cover the needs of the second and third child. We should make the child endowment an inducement to people to have large families, a do purpose for which it was established. 1 propose now to discuss social services from anotiier angle which may he of interest to the House. Increasing longevity is producing all kinds of complex problems for the medical man. So complex, indeed, are some of these problems that they appear to be almost insoluble. For example, people in their 80's who suffer from comparatively minor ailments are now filling the wards of our public hospitals. What can we do with them? They have no other place to go to and many of them have no families to look after them. These people are occupying beds in our institutions and preventing the hospitals from functioning to full capacity. I agree with the honourable member forFreemantle (Mr Beazley) that old couples should be cared for. If they are in reasonably good health provision should be made for them to remain together and they should he afforded such comforts as the nation can afford. In increasing numbers old men and old women' who have no homes and no families are occupying much needed bed space in our public institutions. Before the next election' the Government might well consider the desirability of providing in all capital cities inexpensive accommodation for old people in which they may spend the evening of their lives with some degree of comfort. I believe that this would be the cheapest and most effective way of dealing with the problem presented by these old people. I am sure that such a proposal would commend itself to all sections of the community. Its adoption would relieve the burden on our public hospitals and enable them to provide beds urgently needed for the treatment of acute cases. I make the suggestion for what it is worth and, as honourable members know, I have had some experience in this domain, having been Minister for Health in a State government for some . years. My suggestion sbould be given the consideration it merits.. I admit that the total capital expenditure involved .may be high but the problems must be tackled in. one way or another. I wish, now to touch on a highly controversial subject which I desire to approach in a non-party spirit. I refer Dr Claha. to what are termed, for want of a better description, "" B "" class widows. A widow of that class comes into the pension field at the age of 50 years, but the wife of a worker does not come into the pension field until she .has reached the age of 60 years. I believe that that will Ihe admitted by all honourable members. I should not like .to tell a widow 50 years of age that she was 'decrepit and could not do a .day's work. Here is a field that requires a lot of examination by the Department of Social Services. One of the matters that is being discussed in thif country at the present time, and one concerning which I have a great, deal of sympathy, is that of home help. I do not know what can be done in regard to it. There are times - when a mother of three or four children expecting another child cannot obtain domestic assistance. T believe that an approach should be made to widows in their early fifties in something like the following terms:We shall have you medically examined, and if you are physically fit to perform such work we shall provide you with a course of training Vou can perform home help duties for a portion of the year. We shall pay you a full salary, and sO that you will not he taxed unduly we shall deduct from your total annual earnings the pension that you would have received as a widow if you did uot work. If that were done I believe that many of them would respond to the appeal. If such an inducemrant were offered and the women could be adequately trained in certain branches of nursing and home help generally, I am sure that the scheme would prove successful. I am referring not to the widow with two or three children, or even with one child, but to the widow who is receiving a pension and has no encumbrance of any kind. I believe that if the Department of Social Services offered an attractive salary, some degree of education, and a tax concession equivalent to the widows' pension in return for sendee for a part of the year, a number of these widows would agree to serve and considerable benefit would accrue to the community. I hesitate to believe that a woman would accept 27s. or 30s. a week as a widow's pension in preference, to performing a public service for which she: wonld .receive a reasonable salary, knowing always that if she were out of a job she could again obtain the pension without having to do a full, year's work, l'hat is. a field that should be explored.",58
168,Mrs BLACKBURN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Many women in receipt of widows' pensions would not like to start work again.,60
169,Dr GAHA,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I am not competent to give an opinion upon that matter; [- merely suggest that the Department of Social Services give the proposal a trial and observe the result. It may be that only thosepersons who are decrepit seek rhepension and bhat they have not the physical capacity to do suchwork. If so, we should^ not achieve worthwhileresults. But if fchere are widowedpensioners in their fifties who could perform, this very useful service to the community-, such a schemeshould' be introduced - isms",60
170,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Thei r main complaint is that they have lost touch with the commercial world. The honourable member's proposal would overcome that.,60
171,Dr GAHA,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It should be possible to introduce such a scheme in every country town in Australia. If , after an exhaustive examination, it were found that such pen^sioners were not physically capable of doing the work,, I should not press the matter. I make the suggestion because I cannot get out of my soul the conviction that it is grossly unfair to say to a woman of 50 years of age, ""Because you are a widow you are entitled to a pension "", and. to the wife of a working man, "" You must work until you are 6.0 years of age before you can get a pension "". That is not right. I was very interested to hear the claim of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) that wool,, wheat, meat and other primary products enable the Government to provide to. so great a degree social services in Australia. In this connection, my mind goes back to the days of the depression. I recall having heard spoken the words, "" When wool prices go up everything will be all right in this country"". Yet in one of the depression years an exceptionally good wool crop did not improve our economy. The great value of social services, apart from the benefits conferred upon those who are pensionable, is the stability that they give to the consuming and producing community. The retailer and wholesaler are assured that. eve.ry. year they will be able to dispose of £100,000,000 worth of consumer goods. If that money, were merely beingtaken from the community, set aside, and not usedj the complaints of Opposition members would be justified; but every penny taken from the community atpresent passes back into, circulation immediately and is used to pay rents and buy consumer goods, thus ensuring stability to the producers. Tbat is anotheraspect of the matterthat should be explored. I have endeavoured to show that social services can confer very great benefits upon the community. I believe that we are entering a new era of social and political activities. There will be no new "" in the world which will be detrimental to the people as a whole ifwe develop an evolutionary capitalism. For the last 50 years we have stagnated in our capitalistic approach to many of our problems. That is why present-day social services appear revolutionary. Many honourable members will recall the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. Many people then claimed that, it was only a euphemeral experiment. Subsequently, a similar attack was made on arbitration. I was a member of a cabinet the Premier of which continually referred to- "" the birth-pangs of a new idea "". Perhaps social services are experiencing birth-pangs. I . believe, the time is not far distant when all governments and allparties will endorse social services as the new, progressive and. evolutionary approach to a better system of capitalism and as a first-class antidote to some of the dangerous "" isms "" that now prevail in Europe in consequence, of the non-existence of a satisfactory social services scheme.",60
172,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Bass--Minister for Repatriation) [5.9]-It is pleasing that, generally speaking, the House has approached consideration of this bill in a fairly broad and non-party spirit. After all, whatever might be said about social ser/vices, every government in the past has played some part in the provision of social services for the community. It is true that Australian Labour party governments have underlined the social services plankin their platform for a longer period than have any other parties. I suppose that is because, in the main, the Australian Labour party has been more closely associated with the masses of the people who are not fortunately situated in the community. The honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) has made a contribution to this debate which is entirely free from party considerations, and has made a wise approach to the problem as he sees it. One or two aspects of this matter which have been mentioned during the last day or two ought to be clarified. One was mentioned by the honourable member for ""Wide Bay (Mr. Bernard Corser). I interjected at the rime because I thought he had inadvertently made reference to the National insurance Health aud Pensions Act when he spoke of the measure passed by the Lyons Government, but he persisted in his attitude that the bill had never reached the statute-book of this country. I remind the honourable member. I said by interjection, that the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill was passed, in 1938 and the National Health and Pensions Insurance (Employers' Contributions) Aet.and the National Health and Pensions Insurance (Employees' Contributions) Act were passed in 1939. T remember the occasions very well, and the lionorable. member for Wide Bay should also remember them because they provided some interesting debates, and they were very interesting sequels. Those acts which were all repealed by the Social Services Consolidation Act No. 26 of 1947 were placed on the statuteuook by the Lyons Government. The only matter that had to be attended to in connection with them was their proclamation. The machinery was all set up to deal with the subject, but it was never set in motion. The then Opposition, the Australian Labour party, said that it wa3 not possible to operate measures of that kind. Although the acts were passed by the government of the day, they were never implemented. I make that point because I wanted to correct the assertion of the honourable meinber for Wide Bay that the acts did not pass the third reading stage. I have a good deal of interest in social services, as have also some honourable Mr Barnard. members of the Opposition who were associated with me on the Social Security Committee which operated in this country for a period of about five years. It is particularly interesting today to see unfolding before our eyes the implementation of many of the recommendations that were made by that conimittee over a period of years. In all, the conimittee made nine reports, which were unanimous, except in one detail concerning the payment of certain unemployment benefits during the course of the war. The honourable member for Plinders (Mr Ryan) will remember that very well because he was one of the members. He rendered good service on that committee. ' Today, we see being translated into legislation the recommendations of the Social Security Committee. The committee, in its first report dated the 24th September. 1941, recommended that a social security act should be passed. To-day, there is on the statute-book the Social Services Consolidation Act, which this bill proposes to amend. That act brought outsocial service legislation up to date, ancl the Minister for Social Services (Senator MCKenna) is deserving of praise for his part in the framing of the. measure. Previously, social services were covered by a number of independent acts, which made the schemes difficult to administer. The Social Security Committee also recommended'l'hat the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1 !>40, and, where it applies, the Maternity Allowance Act, be amended to provide thatPayment of an invalid pension at the maximum rate be made to a permanently incapacitated person whose disability precludes the earning of more than 15 per cent, of a living wage, provided that such person would otherwise be entitled to receive an invalid pension. A former member for Bourke, Mr. .Blackburn, attempted several times to obtain an amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act so as to remove the dissatisfaction arising from the fact that borderline cases arose in which the persons concerned were prevented from qualifying for a pension. That recommendation has now been adopted. Any invalid who is So per cent, incapacitated may qualify for a pension by obtaining the certificate from a medical officer. Regarding deaf and dumb persons, the committee recommended as follows:Deaf and dumb persons be granted similar income rights to the totally blind in the payment of invalid pensions. The deiinition "" deaf and dumb"" to include those who are so deprived of the ordinary faculties of speech and hearing as to be precluded from earning more than 15 per cent, of a living wage. That recommendation has been enacted to the great benefit of the persons concerned. On the subject of adequate maintenance, the recommendation of the committee was as follows: The basis for calculation of adequate maintenance in respect of invalids, otherwise entitled to an invalid pension at the maximum rate, be increased from £78 per annum per member of the family to £130, a half rate pension to be paid where the income per member of the family does not exceed £Y5fi per annum, with similar income allowances for children to those at present granted. The' Government considered that recommendation, and a measure of relief has been provided. As a matter of fact, I think the benefits at present in force are even greater than those recommended by the committee. Our committee considered the subject of vocational training of invalids, and submitted the following recommendation:The Minister be empowered to appoint a committee or board whose function it would be to investigate the disability of un invalid pensioner or a claimant for an invalid pension, who is willing to be, or is considered capable of being, trained for a vocation or physical rehabilitation. During recent months, I have ha.d great pleasure in visiting centres such as those at Mount Martha, in Victoria, and Victor Harbour, in South Australia.,, where invalid pensioners are receiving training to enable them to become self-supporting members of the community. When the Social Security Committee was in Queensland, we were told by a deputy commissioner of pensions that he had himself trained men and women pention sioners until they were able to support themselves, thus regaining their pendence and self-respect. I am able pay a. high tribute to the officers of Department of Social Services for their humanitarian treatment of aged and vernment invalid persons. Nowhere else seen a body of men with such a human approach to the problems confronting them. In this regard I could say thing about my own department, also, but today we are considering the Department of Social Services, and I confine my remarks to it . Throughout Australia there are carefully selected men who are doing an excellent job in the department, with great patience, sympathy and understanding. In every way possible, they help those who come before them for relief.",60
173,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That comes badly from the Minister who abolished the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement tribunal.,62
174,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has an obsession on that point. Later on, he will have plenty of opportunities to discuss the subject, and I shall be able to explain satisfactory to the House, if not to the Iionorable member, my reasons for doing certain things. However, I am not going' to be led away from ray subject. I was paying a tribute to the men in the Department of Social Services with whom T came into contact as a member of the Social Security Committee, and also, as a private member for the Parliament. I have not hy me the figures regarding the number of persons who have been given vocational training by the department, but it is considerable. Those persons have become an asset to the community. They never had any desire to be pensioners. They wanted to be restored in health, and to become economically useful. Now, some of them have married, and have taken their normal place in the community. The department, without any fuss or advertisement, is doing a remarkably fine job. The Social Security Committee made the following recommendation on the subject of accumulated property:The amount of permissible income which an old-age pensioner may receive without reducof pension be increased to £1 per week. That recommendation was given effect to indeand the Government now proposes to to raise the l i m it of permissible income the f rom. £1 to 30s. a week. When that is done by the passage of this bill the Gowill have raised the l i m it from have I 12s. fid. a week to 30s. a week. Mr A WOK in CAMERON - The Government taxps in millions, and hands the somemoney back in ten "" bob "" notes. Mr BM?NARD - The Government is able to raise millions in revenue because of the high level of employment. If the honourable member for - Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) had listened to the speech of the honourable member for - Denison (Dr Gaha) on this subject, he would have had a better under^ standing of it. It is not a matter of handing back ten "" bobs"", but of providing a better standard of living for pensioners. On the subject of homes for pensioners, the Social Security Committee mendedInquiries be instituted by the Minister for Soc,ial Services to determine the most suiting able means of caring for old-age pensioners under satisfactory living conditions and at a nominal rental only. Such accommodation as might bo provided to include provision for the attention and care which the increasing helplessness of old age or infirmity renders necessaiy M u c h d if f i c u l t y has been experienced in i m p l e m e n t i ng that recommendation.

184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Order ! The Acting Leader of the Opposition should set an example in conduct to other - members on his side of the chamber. If he does not refrain from interjecting, I shall have to deal with him.",64
185,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I was endeavouring to explain to the House that recommendations which had been made by the Social Security Committee had been incorporated in legislation. In its third report, the committee made a recommendation providing for the organization of labour, as follows: The organization created under the control - - i the Director-General of Man-power provides ihe nucleus of an efficient system of employment exchanges which may be expanded to carry out any function associated with unemployment benefits. Under any scheme of protection against post-war unemployment, the principal day-today work would necessarily rest with the employment exchanges, upon whom would devolve the registration of all unemployed persons, and in the event of their failing to obtain work within the prescribed waiting period, the payment of tlieir weekly benefit. When f u l ly organized the national services offices in each State would be the appropriate agency through which to apply » work, test-on e object in establishing such ""'Rices being the fullest possible employment nf all labour. That recommendation for an organization to control employment in this eountry was another important feature of the work of the Social Security Oommittee. Last night, the Acting Leader of the Opposition stated that the committee's recommendation for financing social services was similar to the method advocated by the Liberal party. I inform the honourable gentleman that the Social Security Committee, in its - third report, proposed, as an urgent - war measure(n\ The payment of a prescribed scale of benefits, financed by a graduated tax on incomes, to persons suffering distress from war-time unemployment, and PAIBB. (b) The appointment of a Central Commonwealth co-ordinating authority to proFalstein, S. M . vide for relief in any civil war-time emergency that might arise. Subsequently, we developed that recommendation, and expressed the opinion that it should be .applied to the peacetime set-up. It is now a feature of the - method of financing social services. Old-age pensions were introduced in 190S but, the invalid pensions did not become payable until later. For the information of honourable members, I shall place on record a table showing the increases of the old-age pension duriug the last 30 years. On only one occasion was the rate of pension decreased. The table is as follows:Pension. S. d. 1909 .. 10 0 1910 12 6 1919 .. 15 0 1923 .. 17 6 1925 .. 20 0 1931 .. 17 6 1937 .. 20 .0 1940 .. 21 0 1942 .. 25 0 -1943 .. 27 0 1945 . . 33 6 1947 .. 37 6 1948 .. 42 6 I have heard the opinion expressed thai we have not increased the :age pension in relation to the increased cost of living. Actually, the cost of living index cannot be applied to the age pension. When we used the Commonwealth - Statistician's figures to determine whether the pension should rise or fall in relation to fluctuations of the cost of living, organizations representing old-age pensioners asked the Government to discontinue that method. Their request was granted. I believe that the purchasing power of pensions bears a reasonable relation to the cost, of living. The Labour Government can justifiably claim .a great deal of credit for the improvement of social services, and the people appreciate increases of age and invalid pensions, dependents' allowances, maternity allowance, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits, and hospital benefits. In the social services field, the Labour Government has done an exceedingly good job not only in war-time but also in peace-time. I do not propose to delay the passage of this measure, but, in view of the interest that I have taken in social services for many years, I felt that I should say something before the motion, for the second reading was agreed to. My remarks do not seem to be appreciated by honourable members opposite. However, I am sure that they will agree with what I have said about my interest in these matters, even although I have had to say it myself. It has been a pleasure to me to see this scheme unfold, first as a member of the Parliament and later ,as a Minister in the Government that is responsible for it . I should like age and invalid pensions to be paid at a higher rate than is proposed. There are, of course, imperfections in the present system. As the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr . Beazley) said, everybody is not in the same position and, undoubtedly, pensioners who own their own homes have an advantage over those who have to pay rent. Despite the anomalies that still main, the bill represents a great step forward in the provision that is made for our aged people. It is by no means an end in itself. Some of the anomalies to which reference has been made by honourable members on both sides of the House will have to be rectified later. subjects dealt with by the honourable member for Frementle, the honourable member for .Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn), the honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) and the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Duthie) will be dealt with during the term of the next Parliament, when a Labour government will still be in power. The people will not dismiss a government which has done so much for them. Like the honourable member for Wilmot, I shall be very happy if I receive nothing in return for my social services contributions. The contributions are paid to help less fortunate members of the community, and should be regarded as a thanksgiving for good health and the strength to do something to help one's fellows.",64
186,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Moreton) [5.50] Although this bill has been endorsed by members of all parties in this House, four of the last five speakers are supporters of the Government. Although the people desire legislation to he passed only after it has been full y discussed by the Parliament, they do not wish the time of the Parliament to be wasted by Ministers and other honourable members stonewalling bills.",65
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Order ! That is a reflection on the Ohair.,65
188,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I submit, with respect, that it is not a reflection on the Chair. Your function, sir, is to call the first honourable member who rises to speak, and in this debate you have done so. It is a reflection on the Government, because it is the Government and not you, sir, that is stone-walling this measure. Y o u have not spoken in this debate. If you had, you might have been charged with stone-walling. I submit that my remarks are strictly in order. It is urgent that the increased pensions shall he paid to age pensioners as soon as possible, but the stone-walling tactic? .re- of honourable gentleman opposite may prevent that from being done. The pension increases that are proposed in this bill are sufficient only to compensate the aged and infirm people of Australia for the inflation and consequent decrease of the purchasing power of the pound that The has been caused by the .maladministration by this Government of the country's affairs. The purchasing power of the increased pensions will be equivalent only to the purchasing power of those that were paid in 1920. The Minister for Lahour and National Service (Mr . Holloway) has stated that a further four months must elapse before the increased pensions can be paid. The honourable gentleman said that, owing to a shortage of staff, it will not be possible to pay them earlier than that. The Department of Labour and National Service is a large organization. Its task is to find employment for unemployed people. Employers are crying out for men, but they are not available. During the war onr industrial effort was diverted from the production of the goods and services that the people required to the production of war materials. When the war ended, the shelves of our warehouses and retail stores were almost empty, and since then we have been concentrating upon building up stocks of the goods that the people require and which were denied to them during the war years. Production is still not sufficient to meet the demand, although almost every available man and woman is in employment. As a result, the staff of rlie Department of Labour and National Service has very little to do. I ask the Minister whether any officers of his department can be loaned to the 1 department of Social Services to assist in the clerical and administrative work that must be completed before the in creased - pensions can be paid. The in creases were decided upon by Cabinet a considerable time ago, and, if the Government really wished, to give effect to them quickly the preliminary work could have been completed before the bill was brought down so that the proposals could be implemented immediately it was passed. The Government is only toying with the aged and infirm people of this country, and by its stone-walling tactics in this chamber it is endeavouring to delay the payment of the increased pensions to them. T say that the underemployed officers of the Department of Labour and National Service should have been set to work to prepare the ground so that the payments could have been made as soon as the bill was passed by the Purliament.",65
189,Mr HOIXOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,-So they will.,66
190,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"- I am glad to note that the Government proposes to yield to the pressure that has been brought to bear upon it by honourable members on this side of the House If we had not "" punched "" at the Government, it would not have done so. The Department of Labour and National Service is supposed to find a job for everybody who is out of work, but nobody is unemployed. As a result, the officers whose task is to find jobs for the unemployed are themselves, in effect, without jobs. I contend that they should be used to do the administrative work that is involved in giving effect to these proposals. useful outcome of this debate, during which the Minister has been "" strafed "" by honourable members on this side of the House, has heen that the Government apparently no longer proposes to delay the payment for .the increased pensions for four months. I am sure that the aged and infirm people of this country will thank honourable members on this side of the House for that. They have not much to thank the Government for, because the amount by which the pension is to be increased will only raise its purchasing power to the 1920 level. Although the bill proposes increases of the pensions that are payable to the aged and infirm., the children have not received the consideration to which they are entitled. Honourable members on this side of the chamber have stressed again and again that the taxes payable by family men should be reduced and that concessions in respect of their wives and children should be increased. I urge that the provisions of the bill which relate to children should be reviewed, because they are inadequate. There is a lot of make-believe in this bill. It has been suggested that because a pensioner is entitled to earn 30s. a week without affecting his pension, the total weekly income of a married couple may be £7 5s. One has only to look at many of our aged and infirm people to realise that they are not capable of earning any money at all.",66
191,Unknown,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Sitting suspended from 6 to S p.m.,66
192,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Before the suspension of the sitting, I had been discussing the proposal in the bill now before us to increase invalid, age and widow's pensions by 5s. a week and also to increase the amount paid by way of child endowment. I had said that all parties in this House support tliese proposals. Indeed, they could do nothing less than that because what is proposed in this legislation represents only a stepping up of the amount of pension and child endowment to meet the increase of the cost of livin g or, in other words, the fallin g off of the purchasing power of the £1 caused by, or contributed to by, inflation resulting from the Government's maladministration of the affairs of this country, its One extravagance and the loss of production consequent upon the excessive taxation imposed upon industry. As this measure is designed solely to meet these conditions it should have had a speedy passage through this House, but the Goverument has stone-walled it. Of the last five speakers, tour were Government supporters, and when I rose the Minister I'mthe Army (Mr Chambers) also rose ID discuss the bill. It is remarkable to Hnd speaker after speaker on the Government side discussing a proposal with rhe principle of which all parties are in agreement. I rose mainly to protest against the delay in making available ro certain deserving sections of the Australian community badly in need of assistance the additional money that this measure will provide to enable them to meet the increased cost of living. Even now the Government proposes to give to invalid and aged persons and widows the purchasing equivalent only of the pension which: they received in 1920. There is nothing magnanimous in these proposals. I. protest at the delay which has marked the introduction of this measure into the Parliament. The inflation which the increased pension rates are designed to cover has already been in existence for a long time. I point out that payment of the pension out of the proceeds of revenue, and also from the social services contribution is a - very insecure method of providing for the needs of these people. Indeed it is possible for the Government to increase the rates of pensions to the scale proposed only because nf the high incomes enjoyed by the people today, principally because of the high prices obtained for our exportable primaryproducts, such as wool and wheat, and the high prices ruling for manufactured goods. If the incomes of persons engaged in industry generally, particularly in primary industry, were to drop because of falling prices, the security of any pension^ schemefinancedin this way would be jeopardized. I urge the Government to completely re-examine these proposals. It is not the duty of the Opposition to frame the Government's legislation. Our task is to point out to the Government, the weaknesses of the legislation it introduces into the Parliament. We have done that in this instance hy pointing out how insecure is the financial basis cn which the increased pension rates are resting. Another matter to which I wish draw the attention of the Government the increasing number of pensioners, subject which was dealt with early in debate - by the honourable member for Mr Francis. Dai-win (Dame Enid Lyons).. Probably the Minister, having heard so many speeches since the point was raised, has forgotten about it. In 1910, there were 65,492 pensioners. Ten years later, in 1920, the number had increased to 99,170. In 1930 it increased to 155,196; in 1940, to 272,896.; and in 1947, the last year for which figures are available, it had increased to 290,173. Analysing these figures in another way, for every 10,000 of the population in Australia, there were 150 pensioners in 1910, 1S9 in 1920, 240 in 1930, 38S in 1940 and 384 in 1947. Having regard to the rapid rise in the number of persons in the community in ' receipt of pensions generally, and to the dwindling number of persons who are to provide the funds from which pensions are to be paid, the whole basis of pensions should be reviewed by the Government. Por a long time honourable members on this side of the House have pressed the Government to give greater - consideration to the needs of a married man. with a wife and family. We have urged, among other things, that such people should be granted substantially increased tax concessions so that they may have available more money with which to meet their family responsibilities. Only now have we been told of the sudden acceptance by the Government of the vital principle that a .married man with a family should be granted further assistance. Another unsatisfactory feature of this legislation is the provision for widows and children. TJnder the present proposals an "" A "" class widow is to receive £2 2s. fid. a week. She is also entitled to receive os. a week for the first child, or a total of £2 7s. 6d. a week by way of pension for herself and her child. The total amount of pension and permissible income allowed to such a widow is £3 17s. 6d. a week. To-day, however, a couple each receiving the age pension are each entitled to receive £2 2s. 6d. a week and to earn 30s. a week or a. total of £7 5s. to in pension and permissible income. T'he is difference between the total pension and a permissible income allowed to the' widow the with one - child and to a. married couple each receiving the full age pension is :E3 7-s. 6d. a week. I believe that the fixation of a permissible inoome for people in receipt of the age pension is entirely useless. Very few of them on account of their age are able to work. Yet the Government proposes to allow them a permissible income which, with theii pension, will enable a married couple to enjoy a total income of £7 5s. a week. The principle' underlying the whole of these proposals is wrong. I focus the attention - of the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services on the weakness of the Government's proposals by citing some other figures which were - mentioned earlier in this debate. The total amount of income and pension for widows with children is as follows:Widow with one child . 3 17 6 Widow with two children . 4 7 6 Widow with three children .. 4 17 6 Widow with four children .. 5 7 6 Widow with five children .. 5 17 6 Widow with six children .. 6 7 6 Widow with seven children .. 6 17 6 Widow with eight children .. 7 7 6 A widow would have to have eight dependent children in order to secure for herself the same amount of pension and permissible income as allowed to a couple receiving the age sion. The Government, has obviously given very scant consideration to these - proposals. There is far too much makethe believe in them. The whole of the legiseverybody lation as it applies to children should recast. If it were not for the need the aged, the infirm and the widows receive this additional money at once would have moved that the bill be drawn and recast in order to give greater measure of justice. Honourable members on this side of the House repeatedly pressed for greater consideraavailable tion to be given to children and married people with family responsibilities. I protest at the delay in the payment of these increases to those who will fit from them. I and the members my party urge that the increased ments should be made retrospective the 1st July and that payment of arrears be made forthwith. The ter by interjection last night made it clear that it was impossible to pay the - increased amounts forthwith because of insufficient staff to work out the details. The proposals contained in this measure have not been suddenly accepted by the Government. They have been known for 1 a long while and there has beenample time to prepare all the necessary data to ensure that payment would be made immediately the bill was passed. The officers of the Department of Labour and National. Service cannot be fully occupied. To-day there is a great scarcity of men available for employment. The omcers of that department might well be made available for - this work. During the war almost the whole of the activities of industry and commerce were devoted to war producPer week. tion. Consumer goods were largely out £ s. d. of production. With the ending of the - war oui' factories concentrated on the production of consumer goods and consequently there is little or no work for the Department of Labour and National Service to undertake. Almost the whole of the personnel of that department should be directed to the task of preparing the data necessary to enable .immediate payment of pensions ' at the increased rate to be'made. Now we are - concentrating on the goods that the comis munity wants. The raw material which penwas being used for manufacturing goods for war has only just become available for the manufacture of goods required by civil community. Accordingly, today is crying out for more and more men to make the goods which are in be demand. Based on claims that have been for made about full employment, the staff to of the Department of Labour and I National Service should be almost entirely withunemployed, and available to be switched a over to prepare this data to enable these funds to he made available immediately. have There should be no delay in making to the people, money that is long overdue to thera. I hope the Government will give consideration to the matters raised by honourable members on benethis side of the House, with a view to of ensuring that these amounts will be paid payimmediately, and also that more equitable to provision will be made for widows and the their dependants. This has been conMinisstantly urged by Opposition members.",66
193,Mr ADERMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Maranoa) [8.17] In giving my general approval and commendation to this bill that provides for social services, I do so in the belief that that should be a practical part of real life, when necessity exists. I do not intend toengage in a discussion of the arguments which have been advanced by honourable members on either side of the House about which party brought this or that measure into being, or failed to meet this or that particular need. It must be recognized that all parties claim to believe in this principle. I shall leave it at that. I speak rather from the point of view of trying to make some practical contribution towards this debate and to put forward some practical suggestions. I shall also point out some anomalies which [ do not think have so far been mentioned in this discussion; or if they have been mentioned they will bear repitition. \. shall deal with one aspect of sickness benefits. Some months ago I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) whether he would amend the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act to provide a longer term in which application could be made for sickness benefits. The Minister plied that he would do so if he considered that there was any necessity for such an amendment. Subsequently the Minister explained that he considered that the discretionary power vested in the officers administering the act was sufficient to meet all cases. I regret to say that that has not been so. In at least two instances of genuine illness, country workers were debarred from a major portion of the sickness benefits to which they would have been entitled had their applications heen made within the period of six weeks specified in the act. I point out that country workers are not in the same favourable position as those working in the closely settled areas who have the advantage of hospital facilities and the direct assistance of union organizers. Sliould they not be acquainted fully with the provisions of the act they can draw on the knowledge of their fellow workers, who will help them out. That does not apply in many instances to country workers. Frequently when workers take sick in sparsely settled districts, it isimpossible for the men concerned to lodge their applications within the specified time. I think it is general knowledge that many such workers are dependent on the advice of the flying doctor, and: it is impossible for such people, in many instances, to secure the attendance of a doctor. They have to make contact with the flying doctor by pedal wireless, obtain his prescription, and do the best they can. In circumstances where they have only one mail delivery a week, or perhaps in some instances only one delivery a fortnight, these genuine workers in the sparsely settled districts are debarred from obtaining sickness benefits. I repeat that in at least two cases, notwithstanding that I inquired into them fully and submitted the facts to the officers who were administering the provisions of the act, for review, those workers were denied their rights. The facts were placed before the Minister for Social Services (Senator MCKenna), but discretionary power was not exercised in those instances because the applications were made too late. I consider that an amendment should be made to the act to cover that situation. re- Mr HOU-OWAV - That has already been provided for.",69
194,Mr ADEEMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Why should those workers be denied a review of the circumstances I have outlined?  date.,69
195,Mr ADEEMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The Minister for  has apparently no concern for the workers who live in sparsely settled districts. I . on the other hand, have a great concern for those who live in country areas, and I make an appeal now that provision should be made, by an amendment of the act, for a. longer period in which such workers may lodge their applications. As long as a case is genuine, and supported by a doctor's certificate, a sick worker should be granted the benefits.  been adjusted.",69
196,Mr ADERMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"In many of those cases, the wives of the sick workers know little about the provisions of the act, and in any case have their hands full bearing the entire responsibility of running the household while the breadwinner is away ill, if it has been possible to get him away from those remote places and into hospital. Irrespective of what the Minister now says, I repeat that in the two cases I have mentioned the sick workers were denied the benefits to which they were entitled. When I asked the Minister a question on this matter, he was quite favourably disposed and answered me genuinely, but his reply does not exactly meet the position.",69
197,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Provisio n made to provide for such cases.,70
198,Mr ADERMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That was apparently subsequent to my question to the Minister. 1. wish to mention an anomaly concerning the interpretation of the provisions regarding the payment of pensions. TJnder the act a pensioner is entitled to. augment his income. To take advantage of that provision, many pensioners have taken in boarders. The total amount of hoard received has then to be regarded by the authorities as income, which is totally wrong. Everybody knows that if 30s. is paid for a week's board, the net income of the person who provides the board is considerably less than that figure. W it h the present high prices ruling for foodstuffs, in order to obtain a net income of 30s. a week, the pensioner would have to charge the boarder no less than £3 or £4 a week. Only the net amount should be taken into consideration. If that were done, and allowance made for the cost of the iroods required as food for the boarder, obviously the pensioner would not then he penalized, because the amount would be insufficient to bring about any reduction of his pension. I. shall now raise another matter for interpretation. Perhaps it has been provided for already, hut I have had instances quite recently where a pensioner owns a residence within the stipulated value, hut has been forced by illness or other circumstances to leave the home and reside with one of his family. It may even be that he has to seek accommodation elsewhere because no other member of his family is able to assist him. Because of his inability to look after himself the pensioner is penalized because the value of that residence is assessed at. its full capital value, and the amount of the pension payable to that person is reduced accordingly. In such instances I submit that a doctor's certificate proving ill health should be accepted and the pension lef t intact. In any case the pensioner should have the right of a home, irrespective .of whether he lives in it or not. And so far as that one home is concerned, if the net value is taken into consideration, allowance should be made for rent less expenses by way of rates and other charges. That would mean that has been unless the pensioners had other income, their pensions would be unaffected. On the present rate, despite the proposed amendment to increase the amount that a pensioner may earn from £1 to 30s. a week, in most instances pensioners would not receive more than £1 a week net from the rent of their property. There is an anomaly in regard to the unemployment allowances, to which I shall draw attention. Unemployment allowance is not payable to any person over the age of 65 years. I point out. however, that many persons over that age prefer to work. According to the taxation schedule, they are taxed on their earnings, whatever their income may be. If unemployment or sickness should overtake them, they are debarred from securing any benefits for which they have contributed.",70

200,Mr ADERMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"A l t h o u g h the act says that, I know that there is an alternative method by which they can draw the pension.",70
201,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,An appeal has been made to such people to work.,70
202,Mr ADERMANN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I think we should encourage everybody physically able, to work. Apart from .the fact that a man is better off, financially, if he is working. I think it is better for him from a health point of view that he should work. He would be permitted to work as long as he desires, provided that he is not forced to do anything against his will . Many such persons recognize that it is beneficial to their health to perform a certain amount of work.' When, kowever, the only interest that the Government takes in the matter is the rate of tax applicable to them, I 1939. contend that the Government is discouraging a measure of production and doing an injustice to those people who are physically able to work. There is one way in which the breadbill winner is worse off than is a pensioner. A man and his wife, both pensioners, can earn up to the maximum amount allowable, which would result in total income to the couple of £7 5s. week. ""Whilst it would be only on occasions that both would be able to earn the full amount of 30s., we find that amount would be tax free in the case the pensioner. In the case of the worker, however, varying amounts of tax are paid' according to the number of his depenvote dants. A worker receiving an income equivalent to that of the pensioners, where both the husband and wife are in the I home, would have to pay £15 a year under the new proposal. If he has two dependants, a wife and one child, he would still have to pay £7 10s. If he has wife and two children, he would pay £3 los. It is hard on the workpensions. ing man, but I do not suggest that the law should be amended to make pensioners pay tax. Pensioners are genersince ally regarded as being free from taxation, and they are, indeed, free from direct taxation, but it is very wide of the to suggest that they pay no taxes at They pay all the indirect taxes, including sales tax, customs and excise duties, amusement tax, &c, an<J the Government, by withdrawing price subsidies, has into creased the cost of many articles which pensioners have to buy. Whatever be said about the rate of pensions in 1939, the fact is it that the pension would buy as much in 1939 as the present pension will buy. The Government has withdrawn the subsidy on potatoes, with the result that the-price has increased from l^d. to 3d. per lb., and it has been suggested that, as a consequence, the basic wage may be increased by Is. a week. The subsidy on wool has been withdrawn, and although prices for woollen goods have not yet increased, every one knows that they will increase as soon as present stocks are exhausted. The present rate of pension is no more than it ought Mr Adermann. to be, and the present pension will not purchase more than did the pension of",70
203,Mr DALY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Martin) [8.331 - I had not intended to participate in the debate, but because of the obvious intention of members of the Opposition to hold up the by stone-walling tactics, I find it necessary to say a few words in reply to tl e criticism directed by honourable members against this bill, and against the a record of the Government in regard to a social services. The honourable member odd for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) referred to the cost of living and its effect upon this tlirpurchasing power of pensions. The of honourable member must accept full responsibility for the increased cost of living, because he advised the people to against the Government's proposal that it be given power to control prices. f pensioners are in a sorry plight today, the blame should be laid at the door of honourable members opposite, who advocated the abolition of price controls which a would have kept down the cost of living, - and preserved the purchasing power of Non-Labour governments were in power for the greater part of the 48 years federation, and except in 1928, and again in 1938, when half-hearted attempts were made to institute a system of mark national insurance, not one worthwhile all. social service measure was put on the statute-book by any anti-Labour government until 1941, when child endowment was introduced, and that was done only avoid granting an increase of the basic wage. So far as social service legislation may is concerned, the 30 years between paid 1912 and 1941 during which non-Labour governments were in office were barren years. The attitude of honourable members opposite and their supporters is easy to understand. Most of those who support non-Labour parties do not believe in social service schemes at all, and they have climbed on the social service hand waggon merely to win the votes of the people by advocating something of which they do not really approve. Another section of non-Labour supporters are those wealthy members of the community who believe that men and women thrown on the industrial scrap lieap should look after themselves as best they can; or, at any rate, they should be supported by social benefits financed by the lower-paid workers. orable members opposite have advocated the introduction of a contributory scheme of social services, as if that were the solution of all our problems. They also advocate a flat rate of income tax, irrespective of the income of the taxpayer. This would place the burden of social services on that section of the community least able to bear it, who are in receipt of the lower incomes, whereas the burden should be borne to a large extent by the wealthy section of the community who can well afford to do so. Honourable members opposite would have us believe that the introduction of a contributory system of national insurance would immediately lead to the abolition of the means test. They lose sight of the fact that, under such a scheme many retired people, including public servants, would not qualify to participate in its benefits unless they had been contributing for a certain number of years. That was the situation in Great Britain when the national insurance scheme was introduced there. To tell the people that under a contributory system every one would qualify immediately to participate in the benefits is sheer political dishonesty. As a matter of fact the scheme which was introduced into this Parliament in 1938, and which was not preceeded with for reasons best known to the Opposition, provided for the payment of benefits much below those which this Labour Government has provided. The present scheme may, in fact, be called contributory in one sense, and it has the advantage that the person who qualifies for a pension under the terms of the act may draw that pension irrespective of the period during which he has been paying social services contributions. interest of the Opposition in these matters is purely political. federation, non-Labour governments have had plenty of opportunity to put into, effect social service schemes. Labour' governments have been in office for only about seven years, during which time a better social service system has been introduced than obtains in other countries which had a big start on Australia. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) said that the Hon- Parliament should not discuss Ihis subject on party lines, that honourable members should uot bicker about rises in the pension rate, but should co-operate in evolving the best social service scheme possible. Apparently, he overlooks the fact that, in 1941, an all-party Social Security Oommittee was set up upon which were representatives of the Labour party, the Australian Country party and what is now the Liberal party. That committee did excellent work. Its deliberations were most harmonious, and its recommendation were, for the most part, unanimous, and formed the basis of some of the legislation introduced by the Curtin Government and the present Government. However, after the. 1946 election, members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party refused to sit on the Social Security Committee. The Labour party has nominatedfour members to sit on the committee, and they are awaiting the co-operation of Opposition members. The Labour party does not regard social services as a subject for party politics, and we have invited the Opposition to co-operate with us to evolve a scheme for social services which will confer the greatest possible benefit on the people of Australia. I have no desire to delay the passage of this important bill, for which many people are waiting so that they may enjoy the benefits which it provides. However, supporters of the Government have an obligation to answer the false assertions of honourable members opposite on the subject of the means test. The Labour Government is committed to the gradual abolition of the The means test. We are not so foolish as to believe that we can substantially reduce Since taxation, and, at the same time, enter into commitments which would .involve greatly increased expenditure. It is estimated that, during the first year, the abolition of the means test would cost £54,000,000, in addition to the £S0,000,000 already being paid out in social service benents. We cannot have it both ways. Tne Opposition has also advocated the endowment of the first child of a family. When an anti-Labour government introduced child endowment-for which I give it due credit, bearing in mind the reasons which prompted it, it, could have endowed the first child if it had wanted to do so, but the honourable member for Fawkner C Mr Holt), who was in charge of the measure, explained that to endow the first child would upset the formula for the assessment of the basic wage. If honourable members will read the report of his speech, they will notice that, hi? excuses for debarring the first child from receiving financial endowment occupy nearly a column in Hansard. However, his principal reason was that the payment of endowment in respwt of the first child would have resulted in a reduction in the basic; wage. If endowment were now payable in respect to the first child, the additional cost would be £24,000,000 a year. To adopt that suggestion and to abolish the means test would increase tht' total social services commitments to £166,000,000 a year. Honourable members opposite know that the whole proposition is fantastic, but they are endeavouring to gull the people into believing that the means test can be abolished over-night. In a deliberate attempt to gain votes, they are making all kinds of specious promises, and hoping rhat the people will fall for them. The Government believes in the honest approach. During the last seven years it. has modified the means test. The increased cost of social services is cation cf its sincere desire to completely abolish the. means test. Some people say that the Labour Government is not sincere in this desire. My reply to them is that we should compare rhe scale of pensions that prevailed a few years ago with the present rates. The amount of pension has been doubled, and its purchasing power would be even greater than it is had the Opposition uot advocated a .relaxation of prices control. A man and his wife arc permitted to liave an income of £3 a week before their combined pensions of £4 5s. a week are affected. That increase of the permissible income is extraordinary when we recall that an anti-Labour governinent allowed ifr. Paly. only 25s. a week for a married couple. A man and his wife are eligible to receive age pensions even though their joint bank accounts may amount to £200. and they are not completely disqualified until their joint assets exceed £1,500. The fact that they own the house in which they live does not debar them from receiving a pension. The Labour Goverument has a .remarkable record in improving social services during the last, seven years compared with the barren record of anti-Labour governmeuts during a period of 30 years. I agree that even t.he increased rate of pension may not allow the recipients to live adequately, but, we must not forget that every increase of the pension by ls. a week represents a total cost of £1,000,000. That financial factor must be borne in mind when, we are considering whether pensions should be substantially increased. The Labour Government has done everything possible to modify the means test, to assist those people who urgently require pensions, and to ensure that justice is meted out to other sections of the community. Approximately SO per cent, of recipients of age and invalid pensions have no income other than their pension. The abolition of the means test would not assist the big majority of pensioners who are completely dependent on their pensions, although it would substantially benefit many people who are now disqualified but who already have sufficient means to live in reasonable an indicomfort without pensions. The Lahour Government has no apology to make, and does not need to offer any exeuses for its actions during the last seven years in modifying the means test on age and invalid pensions. T do not desire to delay the deliberations of the House on this bill, and I shall conclude my speech with a brief comparison. In 1938-39, expenditure on social services amounted to only £16,000,000. In the current financial year, the expenditure will be approximately £SS,000,000, on the most comprehensive scale of social services that this country has ever known, including substantial child endowment, maternity allowance, widows' pensions, funeral benefits for invalid and age pensioners, allowances for the wives of invalid pen-sioners, unemployment and benefits, rental rebates under the Commonwealth-States housing payments to sufferers from tuberculosis and thciii' dependants, and an extensive hospital benefits scheme. has also been made for a free medicine scheme, but it is uot operating because of a strike by members of the medical profession aginst the democratic Pharmaceutical Benefits Act which has been passed by this Parliament. Payments are also made to disabled persons aud in respect of mental patients in institutions, thus relieving their relatives cf that obligation. The Labour Government has achieved a magnifieient record in social servies during seven years compared with the barren of anti-Labour governments a period of 30 years. I commend . the bill to the House. I am sure that the people will judge fair l y the great record of the Lahour Government, and recognize as insincere the criticism which honourable members opposite have levelled at it .",71
204,Mr EANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Bendigo) [8.52] Unquestionably, every honourable member desires to support the Government in assisting invalid and age pensioners, provided the country can bear the financial burden. I desire to direct attention to certain interesting facts. In 1938-39, rhe total Commonwealth budget was approximately £90,000,000. In the current financial yeai', expenditure on social services, including invalid and age pensions, widows' pensions, child endowment and unemployment and sickness henefits, will be . approximately £S8,000,000. Honourable members must he realists in these matters. We must recognize that the price of wool may return to an average of approximately ISd. per lb., the price of wheat to 5s. a bushel or less, and that of butter to Is. 3d. per lb. Some honourable members opposite believe that in the event of such serious reductions of prices, our secondary industries will enable ihe country to continue social services payments at the present high rate. That belief is stupid, and cannot be supported. Australia is u primary producing country, and a large measure of its sickness prosperity is dependent upon returns fro m the sale of its primary products agreement, overseas. The only sound method by which we can assure the continuance of an adequate social services scheme, in the Provision event of a decline of the prices' of our primary products abroad, is by the introduction of a contributory scheme. Employers, employees and the Australian and State Governments should contribute to a general fund. I am sure thar. the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway), who represents the Minister for Social Service? (Senator MCKenna) in this House, sincerely desires to assist the less fortunate section of the community, and that, in his heart, he agrees with my contention that the only sound system of financing record social services is by a contributory during scheme. For political purposes, however, the honourable gentleman expresses the opinion that the wealthier sections of the community should support the recipients of social services. I am gratified to learn that, undei this bill, a person who has contributed to a superannuation f u n d for a small pension on his retirement will not be disqualified from receiving an age pension. In the past, a railway employee, for example, who contributed for two, three or four units of pension, was in a worse position on his retirement than a man who had not contributed to any funds, and who, being without means, was eligible to receive the full age pension. In thiopinion of the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly), the Opposition parties in this chamber do not desire tn assist the aged and invalid people. He likes to remind honourable members thar the Lyons Government reduced old-age and invalid pensions. What he would never state was that the Scullin Labour Governmeut in 1930 was the first administration ever to reduce invalid and old-age pensions. It also reduced the wages of public servants.",74
205,Mr HOLLOW AT,SOCIAL SEEVICES,And the allowance of members of Parliament.,74
206,Mr BANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is so. I referred to the action of the Scullin Government merely to disprove the statement by the honourable member for Martin that the Lyons Government was the only administration which had reduced social services. Members of the Opposition desire that pensioners should receive a fair deal, but we contend that a contributory basis is the only sound method of financing a social services scheme. People who are earninga reasonable income, employers and the Australian and State Governments, who are large employers, should subscribe to the fund. If our social services were placed on that basis, other countries would adopt it for assisting their own aged and infirm people to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. Honourable members opposite should face the facts and tell the truth.",74
207,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,We have a contrithat butory scheme now.,75
208,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is not so. Mr BARNARD.:-There is the social services contribution.,75
209,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It is not a conproposed tributory scheme. As the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) is perfectly well aware, some working men can avoid the social services contribution. Mr BARNARD:- I do not know anyor thing of the kind.",75
210,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"On e section of the community today is in a most unforduring tunate position. TJnder the present means test, a person may receive a penduce sion if he is living in the house that owns and if the value of his property does not exceed £750. Let us consider position of a man who heeded the Labour Government's exhortations and invested his total capital of £1,000 in Commonwe wealth loans. The best rate of interest that he can get is 3$ per cent. I know of a man who has a capital of £1,500, every penny of which is invested in government loans at 3^ per cent. The return from his investment is £46 12s a year, which is approximately one-half of what he could get if he were in receipt of an age or invalid pension. When be wrote to the department and comwithout plained about it, he was advised to spend his capital over and above the £750 he was entitled to have and then for a pension. Is that an inducement to the people of this country to prevent inflation? The Minister knows ap. well as I do that that is the worse proposition, that could be put to these people. The Government needs to consider this matter very seriously and to decidewhat it wants. ""Does it want the people to work aud save to provide for their old age, or does it want them to depend solely upon the Government? Does it want to say to them, "" Never mind about the future. Spend your money, because you will belooked after. There are many wealthy people in this country. We shall tak« money from them and give it to you"". The honourable member for .Griffith. (Mi*. Conelan) says ""Hear, hear!"". The honourable gentleman's idea is that money should be taken from people who have worked and saved and given toloafers such as himself. That is the story the Government is putting out. It is doing so in order to get cheap votesand for no other reason. Honourable members on this side of the House will support any scheme that is by the Government to assist the people who deserve to be assisted. The Government, must, however, abandon the stupid idea that we can afford to pay pensions which are equal to approximate to the basic wage topeople who are not producing, unless they contribute to a pensions schemethe years when they are working. I contend that those who work and procan afford to pay Is. fid. or 2s. a he week to such a scheme. The primary producers can afford to pay 2s. or 5s. a the week in respect of their employees, and the Government can afford to pay its share. That is the only way in which shall be able to accumulate a fund which will put the pensions scheme on a sound basis. I admit that the composite Government of 193S is not without blame in this connection. In 1938 an act was passed by the Parliament. It was a poor 6d.. one, but it could have been improved. I believe that if we had had the courage to go on with that scheme during the war,, when every man was employed, we should doubt have accumulated a fund that would have secured our position for that the next twenty years. However, the apply measure was not proceeded with. Honourable members opposite moan about the rising cost of living. The Government had authority to continue [.iricss control until the end of this year, but when the referendum on rents and prices was defeated the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and other Ministers showed their ill temper. Without giving the State governments a reasonable opportunity to take over, the Chifley Government cast its prices control powers from it, except with regard to one or two items. The people of Australia are disgusted with Ministers on that account and they are also disgusted with the two gentlemen who sold our wheat to New Zealand.",75
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES, Order ! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the bill.,76
212,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Honourable members on this side of the House desire that age and invalid pensioners shall be dealt with fairly, but we also desire that the scheme should be put upon a sound basis. The only way in which that can be done is to make it a contributory scheme. Ln no other w.ay can we hope to give security to .the .aged and invalid people and the widows. It must not be forgotten that although the people to whom I have just referred have been given a great deal of assistance, the service pensioners bave had their payments increased by only 5s. a week since 1919. It is disgusting that men who fought for this country and saved it should be dealt witli less favourably than those who were, in many instances, loafers.  Commerce and Agriculture) [9.7] - I listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin). The honourable gentleman said that the only way successfully to solve the problem of social security finance was by means of a contributory system. I do not think that I am misinterpreting the remarks of the honourable gentleman when I say that he visualized a system under which every worker, irrespective of his income, would contribute to the scheme on a flat rate basis. That provision was the very keynote of the 1938 national insurance scheme, which was brought before the Parliament by Mr. R. G. Casey, who was then Treasurer in the Menzies Government.",76
213,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I rise to order. I did not make any such suggestion.,76
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,There is no point of order involved.,76
215,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I repeat that I did not make any such suggestion. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,-Order ! There is no point of order involved. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin) is merely putting forward a point of view.",76
216,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The Minister is putting words into my mouth that I did not use.,76
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The honourable member for Bendigo must resume his seat.  honourable member for Bendigo considers that I have misinterpreted his remarks. I said clearly that I did not think I was making a mistake when I interpreted his utterances as meaning that he believed in a contributory scheme under which every wage earner in the community would contribute to a social security fund.,76
218,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The Minister suggested that I said that the contributions should be at a fiat rate.  dence of taxation. That is the scheme that was introduced by Mr R. G. Casey, the Treasurer in the Menzies Government.",76
219,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is quite wrong.  It was the Lyons Government. The honourable member for Bendigo and the other members of the Australian Country party were placid and meek followers of the Lyons Government at that time. The keynote of the scheme was that every worker who was in receipt of an income of not more than £7 a week should, in respect of himself, pay a contribution to a social security fund of ls. 6d. a week. Lf he desired to secure benefits for his wife and family, he could pay a contribution of up to 4s. 6d. a week. In return for those contributions, he w.as to receive a very meagre benefit. Notwithstanding the sneers of the Opposition and those who are behind the British Medical Association, those benefits included a free pharmaceutical benefits service. Mr .HAKRISON - How could it be free if the people were contributing to the scheme?  scheme was that, irrespective of income, people were to pay on a flat rate if they were in receipt of more than £7 a week. The anomalous, unjust and iniquitous part of the scheme was that it had no application to any individual who derived his income from any medium other than the employment of workers. cians, medical practitioners in the higher ranks of the medical fraternit y earning between £2,000 and £5,000 a year, individuals owning 20 houses and deriving an income of'perhaps £20 a week from them, and investors with a weekly income of £20 or £30 a week who perhaps employed only a stenographer were not, under the Casey scheme, required to contribute a penny piece. On the other hand, a man who owned a factory in which 100, 1,000 or even 2,000 people were employed was required to pay ls. 6d. a week in respect of every employee. That was the scheme that was put forward by the government of the day, backed by the Australian Country party, as a satisfactory method of dealing with the problem of social security in Australia. Underlying it was the fantastic idea that in that way it was possible to accumulate a reserve fund- a mere book entry-so that after 20 years there would he sufficient in the "" kitty "" to pay to all those who needed it a certain sum each week in respect of the disabilities from which, they suffered. If we look at this matter factually we must admit that, stripped of all humbug, the situation that really confronts us is that at any specified time there will be in the community a certain number of aged people, unemployed people, people requiring treatment for tuberculosis, people requiring - dental treatment and people requiring medicine. AVhether the wherewithal be provided by relatives or from some other source, in the final analysis it must come firom the current annual production of rhe country. By no othor means can i the provided. We may write figures in a book until we become blue in the face",76
220,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,To save certain people from the necessity for contributing.  the system operated by the Government it is possible to finance the scheme of social service benefits without the necessity for everybody contributing on a flat rate basis. The flat rate basis was proposed in the scheme introduced into the Parliament by Mr Casey and supported by the honourable member for Bendigo.,77
221,Mr RASKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I did not support it .  has amply demonstrated that it is posPolitisible to car© for the aged, the sick and the unemployed by imposing a graduated tax levied in accordance with ability to pay. Let us be honest about this. In respect of the last income year a man with a wife and two children in receipt of not more than £300 per annum, every penny piece of which he needed for the ordinary necessaries and amenities of life, paid no.t one single penny into the fund used by the Government to finance the aged, the sick and the infir m in the community, to finance hospitals to the amount of 6s. a day for each occupied bed, to relieve the unemployed and to pay the various subsidies provided by the Government. But what did the people pay who are in the position of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) and myself, with our parliamentary allowance of £1,500 a yeaa in addition 1 to an income from our farms? I am not. sure, but if my recollection is correct I paid approximately £160 in tax last year, and well I might have done so. That is the difference between the outlook of those who sit on the Opposition side and tliose who sit on this side of the House in regard to their responsibilities to the aged, the sick, the infir m and the widows of this country. Honourable members opposite would thrust upon married men with family responsibilities who receive less than £300 a year a share of the burden of financing these commitments of the Government. By contrast this Government places the heaviest burden on the shoulders of those most able to bear it . Is any honourable member opposite courageous enough to say that people like the honourable member for Bendigo and myself are not in a better position to pay the requisite money to provide the revenue with which to meet these commitments than is the uiwried man with a wife and two children in receipt of an income of £300 inless? The honourable member for Bendigo and other honourable members opposite have snivelled about the iniquity of paying social security benefits to the people of this country",77

I was about to say that, honourable members opposite, like the orable member for Bendigo, take strong objection to the payment of social service benefits to people in this country who. having wasted their substance, when the community. they reach old age have no material resources behind them.",78
225,Mr RANKIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Kee p to the truth.  ber for the Northern Territory (M Blain) and the honourable member for against him. Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) made similar remarks. It is, unfortunately, all too true that, in the community, there are people who waste their substance in - Order I riotous living, wbo drink too many :< pots "" of beer, or at least more beer than is good for them, and who smoke too many cigarettes; but for every why "" p o t "" of beer they drink, they pay into revenue, and for every 2s. they spend The Government has ou cigarettes, they pay Is. into revenue. To the extent that they are living riotously and are wasting their substance on beer and cigarettes, they are paying their own contribution to Consolidated Revenue in orcier to provide for their age, sickness or disabilities from which they may suffer.",78
226,Mr HAKRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Is that the reason behind the Government's policy regarding indirect taxes?  Nobody justifies riotous living, but to theextent that people indulge in it , they domake a substantial contribution to the moneys required by the Government to pay for social services. All the talk about the t h r if t y in the community having to the thriftless is so much humbug I ask the and drivel when it is analysed and viewed rein proper perspective. I have pointed out the iniquities of the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act which.the Lyons Governnieut placed on the statute-, book in 1938. Thanks to the opposition of members of the Australian Labour the government of the day did not to give effect to those proposals.. the succeeding government led by the right honourable member for Darling Downs (M'.r.

[ agree with the view of the honourable member for Bendigo that a big pertake centage of our social services benefits, which are of great magnitude, are directly related to the income which this Agriculture country receives from the sale of its portable primary products. Honourable members opposite have accused the Scullin Labour Government of being instrumental in reducing penthe sions.. That action was taken at a time when the Parliament was entirely unhonorable balanced in the Senate, which was at that time the final authority in this Parliament, there was a gentleman, now unfortunately deceased, was a member of the Country party. When the Treasurer of the day submitted a proposal to provide assisTo tance for poverty-stricken primary prothink ducers, and to relate the volume of money to the possible production potential, that member of the Australian Country party opposed the ing of monetary assistance to the Government to enable it to give effect to its proposals. Asthe result of opposition, the government of the day had no alternative but to make slight ductions of the pension rate payable at that time. When the honourable member for Bendigo attacks the action of the rates of pensions? then government, he should tell the whole story. He knows that what I have said is the truth.",78

230,Mr AKCHIE CAMEEON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Barker; Menzies's [9.29] - I apologize for engaging in this debate after having failed to get the Government to see the wisdom of closing it before dinner. It was on. the vote the Government supporters that debate was continued. I was engaged on other activities afternoon, and perhaps I did not as much interest in what was happening as I would normally have done. The Minister for Commerce and  exsecond Minister I have heard speak today. He has come to the assistance of his rather weather-beaten colleague, the Minister for Labouiand National Service (Mr Holloway), who is in charge of bill. I cannot remain silent after hearing some of the statements which the gentleman has just made. He criticized the Lyons Government for having placed on the statute-book the National Health and Pensions In who surance Act, and for not having proceeded to implement it. I have in my possession a copy of that act. listen to the Minister, one would that nothing was contained in thatact. When that legislation was passed by the Parliament, the honourable gentleman was sitting on the Opposition side of grantthe House, and was a voluble opponent of the scheme. Section 46 of the act provides for. medical, sickness, unemployhis ment, invalid and old-age pensions, widows' pensions, orphans' pensions and redependent, children allowances. ",79
231,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is one thing which the members of this Government cannot afford to have quoted. The maximum contribution to be paid any person under that scheme was ls. 6d. a week. The maximum rate of the social services contribution levied by this is ls. 6d. in the- £1. What the Lyons Government was prepared to if do for ls. 6d. a week, this Government will do only for ls. 6d. in the £1. It is to of no use for the Minister to look a little annoyed about what I am saying. Let us glance at some of the other beneby fits provided under that legislation. In these days we are considering war pensions, which was a part of the scheme in 1938. Another important item was child endowment, which today is net financed out of the 18d. in the £1 which this Government takes of out of the taxpayers' pockets. It is the financed by the wage tax. ",79
232,Mr AJRCHIE CAMEEON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It is financed by the wage tax that was imposed by the Menzies Government in 1941 in order to finance cbild endowment. If that does not finance cbild endowment today, the present Government is the guilty party, not the Government which put it on the statute book. To hear the Minister talk about rich and poor one would think that there are hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of rich people in this country who are contributing to social services. Before we proceed to consider the comtributions of these people according to the official government returns, we should further consider social services. [ believe in the old conservative doctrine of self-help and thrift, and I contend that people should look after themselves, and only expect the Government to look after them in the event of misfortune overtaking them. Whilst that might he old-fashioned and out of date, nevertheless it is my view. For any social services scheme to be satisfactorily administered it must be based in very much the same way as a friendly society is based. I have been a member of a friendly society for many years. My parents arranged my membership without consulting me and I have remained a member ever since. Mr HOLLO WAT;-Is that the only thing the honourable memher did that parents told him to do?",80
233,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I would fact not say that it is the only thing, but we all responsible to our parents for many is gradually rising. things. The Government should be pared to found social services on a satisfactory basis. The only fair and just basis, is one under which a person who hopes to get something out of office the scheme will contribute to the fund during the times when he and able to contribute. But what is the posinod tion today? At what stage of income people start to contribute at all? I have not the taxation returns before meat the moment, but I have other documents here which do not deal with taxation. From memory, under the old taxing scheme which will be out-dated in a days' time-or a few weeks' time judging by the present rate of progress- a man who with a wife and one child received f531 £5 10s. a week was called on to contribute only 3d. a week .to the social services fund. If a man expects to get benefits out of the social services fund he should be prepared to pay something towards building up that fund. Every man in receipt of wages or salary ought to be compelled to contribute to the fund. That is the first matter on which I and the Government fall out in regard to social services. All wage and salary earners should contribute. That is the policy that I put into force at one time when I was acting as Minister for Health, perhaps in quite an unorthodox way, in this city. I insisted on every wage-earner in this city contributing for hospital benefits. In return they were entitled to free treatment in a ward of the hospital. I was told on Sunday last that that scheme has since been abolished. My informant was a gentleman who is a. supporter of the Ausbralian Labour party, and. he said that he considered the scheme should have been continued because it was well founded and based on common sense. Let us consider the size of the fund required for the provision of social services. Last year the figure approximated £70,000,000. Speaking from memory, this year the provision of social services will cost the Government approximately £80,000,000. his The cost is rising by leaps and bounds every year and the Government is taking a great credit to itself for the that the figure is on the increase, are and the cost of providing social services At the same pretime the Government claims that the ""golden age"" has arrived, that there is 100 per cent, employment, and that so long as this Government remains in that will continue to be the state of affairs. The Minister for Commerce  his head, but Ministers propose to do remain in office everlastingly ",80
234,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Government members time after time suggest as a proposition that full employment few is going to be maintained from now on, and that the present Government is going to be in office to see that that happens. The Government claims that, the present system of social services and pensions is the greatest aud most beneficial that has ever been introduced. I. pass now to the important matter of the sources from wh;ich the Minister expects the mouey to come. From what the Minister has said anyone would think that the great hulk of the income tax revenue of Australia comes from the wealthy people. The social services contribution today is based on income only. Let us consider the facts as disclosed by the Commissioner of Taxation in his report based on the 1944-45 assessments, the latest report that I have been able to get. The total number of taxpayers in that year was 2,049,000. Of those, only 17,958 had incomes of over £1,500 a year. I. stress this, because that figure is the salary which this Parliament provides for its members. That is, out of a total of 2,049,000 taxpayers, the number of people who received an income of between £105 and £150 a year was 223,000-that is those who received just over £2 and under £3 a week. The number of people who had incomes of between £150 and £200 a year was 258,000. The largest group of taxpayers was those receiving incomes of between £301 and £350 a year, that is, under £6 a week to under £7 a week. There are .further graduations of £50 a year right up to £1,500 a year. The number of people who received over £1,500 was only 17,95S. The total income firom. personal exertion in that year was £714,000,000. Those people who received £1,500 a year received in all £4S,000,000. The property-income position was even worse. Of the total income of £69,000,000 from property, only £16,000,000 was received by people in receipt of over £1,500 a year. Without delving more deeply into figures which are a vailable to all honourable members, let us consider from what source the social services fund is to come if not from people who are in active employment. The idea that the money can be got from general revenue or from the employers is quite unsound. The moment a tax is put on the employer for this purpose, automatically the cost of everything manufactured by him is increased, and ultimately the burden /Ifr. Archie Cameron. falls on the primary producers, who are dependent on the returns from the sale of their products on the markets of the world. They get so much less of the value of their products than they received before this tax was imposed. If the burden is placed on secondary industry, the industrialist adds it to the cost of production, and the public ultimately pay. If it is placed on general .revenue, there are a multitude of ways by which the Government can raise the money, as we have learned in recent years. Thus, we get back to the original proposition that any social service scheme should be based on the contributions of those who are to benefit under it. The only alternative is for everyone to contribute to the eost, not according to what he hopes to get out of the scheme, but according to his income, and if that alternative be adopted, there should be no means test. The Government says that it is moving towards that end. Perhapsit is moving at the same rate as it was once supposed to be moving towards itssocialistic objectives. When the Labour party, in 1921, included in its platform the plank that provided for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), who was present at the conference, is reputed to have said that the party hoped to attain its objective in 100 years time. That, of course, is now out of date, and the Labour party has other plans. I have never concealed my opinion on the subject of social services. Until our social services scheme is founded on a contributory basis, it must continue to he unsound. When prices for wheat and wool and base metals come down to a sane level, for the present prices are not sane, but famine prices, there will be a reduction of the national income, and sooner or later this Government, if it remains in office so long, will have to face a very awkward situation. The Government has been in office now for seven years. We recall that Joseph, duriug his first seven years as governor of Egypt, had little to trouble him. His troubles came upon him during hif second seven years in office. Apart from the fact that I believe that Australia would be better governed by the Liberal party, I say that it would be poetic justice if the present Government should be in office when' the bailiff arrives and mands a financial .reckoning. The present Government has, by its policy, increased costs. It has fooled around with trust funds.",80

236,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"We are discussing finance, and it is one of the oldest privileges of the lower houses of parliaments in British communities to refuse to vote money for the use of the Crown until grievances have been discussed,- including the way in which the money is to be raised.",82

I trust that the day is not far distant when the Parliament will take an objective view of social services. Otherwise, the time will come when a Labour government may have to reduce pensions again, as a Labour government had to do during the depression. That, as I have said, would be only poetic justice, because the policy of this Government has brought about the very conditions that made an increase of pensions necessary. The Chifley Government, by a deliberate although undisclosed policy, has brought about an increase of wages, costs, profits and prices in order to get out of the difficulties arising from its borrowing policy during the war.",82

The Government ha been deluded, whether by itself or not .1 do not know. The worse form of delusion is self delusion, and I hope that the Government is not a victim of that kind of delusion.",82
243,Mr CONELAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Griffith) [9.48] It must be enlightening to the public to listen to the present debate, because the speeches of members of the Opposition conclusively establish the truth of what we have been saying for years, which is, that it is the wish of the Opposition that the workers should pay for their own social service benefits. On the other hand, the Labour party believes that the burden of taxation should be borne by those best able to pay. The last two Opposition speakers are both wealthy farmerswho, in addition to their income from their farming operations are receiving a parliamentary allowance of £1,500 a year, but they do not want to pay anything towards defraying the cost of the excellent social services which the Labour party has introduced. \Q\iorum formed.] On a recent occasion, the Leader of the  when dealing with social services, said In view of what has transpired in the international sphere we must regard ourselves nrery fortunate indeed that national insurance was not inflicted on the people. Tliose of us who strenuously opposed the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill and were to some extent responsible for the subsequent abandonment of the scheme have done the country a great service.",82
244,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,When did T say that?,82
245,Mr CONELAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"On the 22nd September, 1939. I refer honourable members to some significant details of the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act which was introduced by Mr R. G. Casey Avhen he was Treasurer in the Lyons Government. Under the scheme of that Act it was proposed that every adult should contribute ls. 6d. a week, and also: the case of married men, Is. 6d. a week in respect of the insurance of a wife. At the same time, no individual who was in receipt of an income in excess of £7 a week could qualify for any benefit under that achome. The magnificent benefits which were to be provided to contributors included a benefit of 12s. 6d. a week for widows, a sickness benefit of £1 a week for an adult male and 15s. a week for an adult female, and the magnificent sum of 5s. a week for a juvenile. [Quorum formed.'] Under that scheme a benefit of 3s. 6Q. was to be paid in respect of a dependent child of a married man whose income exceeded £7 a week. Any young man, or woman, under the age of 21 years, could qualify for a sickness or unemployment benefit of only 5s. a week. Yet. honourable members opposite who sponsored that scheme still advocate the contributory principle in respect of social services. A contributory scheme means that each employee would contribute a certain sum each week and his employer would contribute a like amount, whilst the Government also would contribute a certain amount to the insurance fund. The scheme sponsored by the Lyons Government provided that any employer who contributed to the scheme could automatically pass on that cost. The burden of such a scheme would fall upon the worker and, ultimately, upon the Government. The social services established by this Government are proving a great boon to the people. To-day, a married man with a wife and two children, a family unit which is not covered by the Harvester award, is not obliged to make any contribution in respect of social services until his income as at least £7 a week.' Hundreds of thousands of people whom this Government is endeavouring to help come within that category. At present they make no contribution whatever towards social services. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain) advocated a contributory scheme. The honourable member, who is a single man and has not contributed anything to this country, is typical of those who advocate a contributory scheme.",82
246,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I rise to order. The remark just made by the honourable member is offensive to me, and I ask that he withdraw it. The fact that I am a single man enabled me to fight in two wars in defence of this country, whereas Mr Conelan. the honourable member did not have thr "" guts "" to serve in any war.",83
247,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES," The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been offensive to the honourable member for Griffith, and so I think he has evened up matters.",83
248,Mr C GNELAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory has just told an untruth. I volunteered for service in defence of the country and was passed as medicallyfit,but was placed on the reserve list. I suggest that the honourable member for the Northern Territory also, in view of his age, should have been placed on the reserve list. Much has been said about the withdrawal of price stabilization subsidies, but the Government, to its everlasting credit, hatnot withdrawn subsidies in respect of tea. and sugar, the two commodities most essential to pensioners. So long as the Government remains in oifice it will continue to safeguard the interests of persons dependent upon social services. Unlike the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), I believe thai the Government will remain in office for many years to come. When the Government assumed office seven years ago, the honourable member predicted that it would be ejected within six months. In making that prediction he revealed himself to be a bad judge, and he is still a bad judge in such matters. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) dealt with the percentage variation of the pension in relation to the basic wage. When the invalid and old-age pension was established, it represented 22 per cent, of the then basic wage of £2 5s. 6d. Before the Labour Government assumed office that percentage had decreased to 19.5 per cent., and, subsequently, it rose to 20.7 per cent. The fact that the percentage relation of the pension to the basic wage was lowest during the regime of anti-Labour Governments reveals the weakness of the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite in this debate, because when the present Government assumed office in 1941 the basic wage was £4 Os. 6d. and the maximum pension was 21s. 7d. The increase of ls. wa? granted under pressure exerted by the Labour party in this Parliament. At diat time, the pension represented only 25 per cent, of the basic wage. Next month, the basic wage will be £5 16s. week and. the pension will be 42s. a week, representing 36 per cent, of basic wage, the highest it has ever in our history. Tho Labour Government .has also introduced numerous other forms of social services. I was instrumental in assistment desired it. ing to have one of them adopted, and I congratulate the Government on accepting the proposal. An amount of £15,000 is provided for the development of home help service, which will be availthis able to households the mothers of Opposition which are absent in hospital or are unable, through illness, to attend menl supporters. to theiidomestic duties. The honourable member for Denison (Dr Gaha) made a sound point when he - iiiggcitod that widows in the second category, which includes those who statement reach the age of 50 years and about have no dependants should be trained in motbercraft or nursing. would then be available to assist in homes where the mother of a family was i and there were a. number of children to cared for. [Quorum formed.] The honsuggestions orable memher for Denison suggested that the remuneration which they this received for that service should not effect their widows' pensions. Such vices. a sorvice would, be of inestimarguments able benefit to families when the to mother was ill. I congratulate the Godivided vernment on its magnificent achievecan ments in the social services field during the seven years in which the Labour party has been in office in this Parliathey ment. The people of, Australia are very grateful to it. The Labour Government will give even better service in the future tban it has done in the past, and, at the next election, the people will reward with the words "" Well and faithfully done "".",83

252,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I have made that only to reply to the suggestion stone-walling. I do not suggest that any honourable members indulged in They stone-walling. The debate on this bill has been very fine. Th.e criticism has l l been fair, and honourable members on be both sides of the House have made wise which deserve careful consideration. The outstanding feature of debate has been the challenge to the present method of financing social serHaving assessed the various for and against it, I have come the conclusion that opinion is evenly as to whether the present system be safely continued in future. Some honourable members do not favour the abolition of the means test, because consider that the cost involved is excessive. A discussion of that subject is worthwhile, and I should like to add my contribution at a later stage. A l this juncture, however, I desire to place it on record some historical facts associated with social services so that we shall not continually argue, sometimes witli heat, about who was responsible for placing certain legislation on the statuteTo me, it is immaterial who introproduced the legislation. The important point is the value of the legislation. be The chronological details which I am about to read are not opinions, but are of facts culled from history. Any honorconable member who reads the debates OB social services which t c k place in the early yeans of the Commonwealth Parliament, must come to the conclusion that there was a bargain, or "" gentlemen's agreement"" between the Opposition led by Mr Fisher and the Government led by Mr Deakin on the introduction of the first social services legislation. It is true to say, as members of the Opposition have pointed out, that the Deakin Government was responsible for the implementation of the legislation. Before the Commonwealth Parliament assumed its responsibilities, the Parliament of New South Wales and Victoria had introduced old-age pensions in a minor way. The age limit was considerably higher than that prescribed in the present act. The historical record of social services is as follows:July, 1909 - Old-ag e pensions, introduced by the .Deakin Government. December, 1910 - Invali d pensions, introduced by the Fisher Government. Ootober, 1912 - Maternit y allowances, introduced by the Fieher Government. July, 1941 - Chil d endowment, introduced by the Menzies Government. July, 1942 - Widows ' pensions, introduced by the Curtin Government. July, .1943 - Allowance s for wives and children of invalid pensioners, introduced by the Curtin Government. July, 1943 - Fnnera l benefits for age and invalid pensioners, introduced by the Curtin Government. 1945 - Unemploymen t and sickness benefits, introduced by the Curtin Government. 1946 - Hospita l benefits, introduced by the Chifley Government. 1947 - Tuberculosi s benefits, introduced by the Chifley Government. 1948 - Pharmaceutica l benefits, introduced by the Chifley Government. That is the history of Commonwealth legislation in the field of social services. I put it on record so that honourable members opposite need not argue about it in the future. I do not think that any of them wish to cling to an argument that is not based on a firm foundation. The history of the relationship of the age and invalid pensions rate to the basic wage also should be placed on record. I have obtained the relevant figures, because I want to reply to the statements made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), who opened this debate. The honourable member made a very fine contribution to the discussion and offered some useful suggestions, but, quite unintentionally I am sure, some of the things Mr TTolloiray. which she said were not founded on fact. She declared that a comparison of the basic wage established by Mr Justice Higgins in 1907 with the pension rate then, and a comparison of the present basic wage with the proposed new pension rate would show that pensioners in 1907 were at least no worse off than pensioners are today. In the first place, there was no age or invalid pension in 1907. Those pension were introduced in 1909 at the rate of 1.0s. a week.",84
253,Mr HABBISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That rate still applied when the Harvester award came into operation.,85
254,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is right.,85
255,Mr HARRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,B e perfectly fair.,85
256,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"If I were to be technical and tie the honourable member for Darwin down to the figure of £2 lis., her case would appear in a much worse light. The following table indicates the 'relationship of the rate of age and invalid pensions to the basic wage at variou;dates since 1909:Perccntaet of basic wapi year. Basic wnge. Pension rn.ee. represented by pension rate. f s. d. «. d. 1909 2 5 6 10 0 22 1916 - 3 4 0 12 6 19.fi 1920 - 3 12 6 lo 0 20.7 1925 4 5 6 20 0 23 1931 3 17 0 17 6 22 1937 1941 3 4 15 6 0 0 20 21 0 6 ic 25 1948 5 16 0 42 C 36.6 In 1931, during the depression, the basic wage had fallen and the pension had been reduced to the original comparative level of 1909. In 1948, under this legislation, the pension rate will be at the highest level in relation to the basic wage in the history of the Commonwealth. Those figures illustrate the position of unmarried pensioners. A married couple in receipt of pension will receive a combined income this year equivalent to 72 per cent, of the basic wage. Their conditions are much better now than they have ever been. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) and others have asked. "" Does the Government consider that £2 5s. a week is enough to keep a man or a woman in decent comfort? answer to that is "" No "". I say that on behalf of the Government without any hesitation. That is why we must reconsider whether we should add to the in '-omes of those on the lowest rung of the social ladder. Such people have no independent income and they need our help much more than do the people on whoso behalf members of the Opposition have made their sentimental appeals. I was also asked during the debate whether I. considered that 10s. a week was enough ro provide for the keep of a child under the age of .16 years. I answer "" No "" without hesitation. The Government does not declare that child endowment at the rate of 10s. a week is sufficient to maintain a child. Its policy is to make rhe income of the bread-winner, the father of the child, so high that he can keep his family in comfort. The endowment is a little addition to the family income to help the mother to save something, as many mothers like to do, for the higher education of her children. All rhese facts should be placed on record. The honourable member for Darwin made a good suggestion - which also was emphasized by the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn). Both honourable members asked, "" If we cannot provide free medical attention for everybody, cannot the Government establish <ome scheme which will provide free medical services for pensioners?"" The answer to that question should be well known to everybody. The Government has tried to establish a free medical scheme on a national basis. It has done its best, but so fa r has failed. It has provided for free hospital accommodation for the people. That scheme was first thought of because of the needs of pensioners who, more than anybody else, are likely to go io hospital when they f all sick because many of them have no homes and live only in rooms and have nobody to care for them. The fact that they cannot obtain free medical attention is not the fault of the Government. We overcame the constitutional barrier to the introduction of such a scheme by appealing to the people at a referendum, but we have vet to overcome the barrier raised by the Mritish Medical Association, which maintains an attitude of non-co-operation with The the Government. Perhaps we shall overcome that final barrier soon. At any rate, we shall try to do so. These facts show that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Darwin is in Hue with the objective of t.he Government, which will be achieved sooner or later. The honourable member complained that the Government, was doing much more for aged couples than it was doing for growing children and, in support of her argument, referred to the unusual case of a widow with eight children undei the age of sixteen years. She said that this woman was in a terrible plight and was having great difficulty in supporting her family. Naturally, everybody agrees with that statement. However, the honourable member's argument ought to be analysed. She said that the Government does more for aged couples than it does for this woman and her children. Let us consider the relative situations of a married couple drawing the age pension and of the widow and her children, assuming that they have no private r.ources of income. TJnder this bill, the married couple will have a combined income of £4 5s. a week. The widoww ill draw a pension of £2 Ts. 6d. for herself and her first child, and w i ll also receive £3 10s. a week endowment fov the other seven children. She will therefore, have an income of £5 17s. 6d. a week, compared with an income of £4 5s. a week received by the married couple. Thus, there is little ground for the honourable member's suggestion that the Government is unfairly discriminating against a widow with a large number of children in favour of an aged couple. Both the honourable member fer Darwin and the honourable member for Bourke suggested that home* should be provided for aged people They asked whether special homes, cottages or centres could be provided for old people who are dependent upon age and invalid pensions, because many of them have no homes of their own. We are faced with two difficulties. The first is that, under the Constitution, the Australian Government is not allowed to build homes for people other than its employees and soldiers. The second is a physical difficulty, which it is almost impossible to ov.erconie at the pre<sent time. We have obtained plans Irom other countries, including New Zealand, which has in. the last decade made more progress than any other member nation of the British Commonwealth in the building and planning of new homes and villages. The Government intends to build homes for our old people and will do so as soon as possible. We have believed for a long time that one of the greatest benefits that can be bestowed upon age and invalid pensioners who have no homes of their ownand thousands of them have not-is to provide them with comfortable cottages, situated close to markets where they can shop cheaply. They should not he isolated from the rest of the community. Those who are not able properly to look after themselves should be accommodated in small groups of cottages and a trained matron should be employed to care for them. Although the Government plans to do these things, it must fiirst overcome the difficulties to which I have referred. The constitutional difficulty may be overcome by co-operation with the State governments, which will, [ believe, join forces with this Government, because the. objective is so laudable. Cf that problem is solved, the formidable obstacle of the lack of building materials will still need to be surmounted. The honourable member for Reid (Mr: Lang) made one or two exaggerated statements that were not based upon facts. I am afraid that his dislike, almost hatred, of some members of the Government sometimes leads the honourable gentleman to indulge in reckless statements that do not do him justice. He referred to the unfair treatment of people who are in receipt of small superannuation benefits. He took as an example a head schoolmaster who is receiving weekly superannuation payments of £2 10s., having paid contributions to the superannuation scheme for many years* He did not say whether the schoolmaster was married or single. The majority of retired State and Commonwealth public servants such as schoolmasters, railwaymen and other who are in receipt of small superannuation payments are married. If the man to whom the honourable member referred is Mr nolloway. married, he and his wife are entitled to the payment of age and invalid pensions and, in addition, to receive £3 weekly from other sources. If , putting it at its worse, the schoolmaster is a single man, he may draw more than £1 a week of the age and invalid pension and still be entitled to receive a weekly superannuation payment of £2 10s. The position is not nearly so. bad as the honourable member for Reid made it out to be. He can see no good in this legislation at all. I do not know why he adopts that attitude. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) doubted whether the country could continue to carry the load that the payment of these pensions is imposing upon it. He further said that lie did uot favour the abolition of the means test because, in his opinion, the national finances could not bear the added burden. He went on to say thai Australia and other countries have learned that it is necessary to improve economic and social conditions if we wish to be freed from the fear of war. The right honourable gentleman pointed out that, whatever any government does in connection with economic, and. social security, it must be based upon international justice. In otber words, not. only must we do it in our own country, but. if we. are to escape from the fear of war, we must try to. see that it is done in all other countries. The policy of this Government is based upon social justice for all. On every occasion on which it has - gone to the people, the first plank of its platform has been full employment for the whole of the year. Every time that we send a delegate abroad to attend an international, conference dealing with industrial or economic matters we instruct him to emphasize on every possible occasion that, whatever conclusions are arrived at, the principle of full employment must be in the forefront. A policy of full employment involves social legislation. Social security will cost less as full employment becomes more of anaccomplished fact. Although there will always be the necessity to pay some sickness benefitsj full employment will, I am sure, result in less sickness. The cost of unemployment payments will fall. Indeed, they are costing practically nothing H i the present moment. It is only those who have heen unable to work except on odd days during the last ten or fifteen years who are now applying for unemployment benefit. That is the result of the Government's poliey of full employment, which provides economic security. To achieve social security, lation must be passed to deal, for instance, with people who are temporarily out of employment because they are changing from one job to another or because some accident has held up the work in which they are engaged. Legislation is necessary to deal with annual leave and holidays at Christmas-time ancl other periods. The granting of annual leave has bt'en made compulsory in all States of the Commonwealth. The object is to dovetail all. these things together and to ensure that in some way or other every one in the community receives a regular income for 52 weeks of the year. If that objective can be achieved, it will be of the greatest benefit to the small shopkeepers of this country, who denend for their livelihood upon the money that is passed across their counters. They are beginning to appreciate the benefits of this Government's full employment policy, ivhich means regular incomes, and therefore regular spending power.",85
257,Mr HARRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Does the Minister claim that full employment is the result of the Government's policy and has not resulted from war conditions?,88
258,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is a fair question, but it is not put in a sensible way. What the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) asks is whether 'the success of the Government's policy has been due to the Government's good judgment and management, or to other factors.",88
259,Mr HAUJUSON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The Minister .claimed rhat full employment was the direct result - >f this Government's policy.,88
260,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"No one can doubt ihe Government's policy because it is stated clearly in all Labour's manifestos, lit is .full employment for the people: bat I admit quite frankly that because of the unnaturally high prices that are prevailing overseas for our primary products, it has been possible to implement our policy more quickly and more successfully.",88
261,Mr HABBISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Th c shortage of commodities has bad something to do with it.,88
262,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I am admitting that. This legislation is in accordance with the Government's policy, and the legisActing Leader of the Opposition should know very well that it is of no use to appeal to the Minister in charge of the bill to accept amendments. The Government's policy has been definitely determined. It is the policy upon which a majority of the people have decided. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) frequently appeals to the Minister in charge of a particular measure to accept an amendment of it.",88
263,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The Minister has agreed with my suggestion.,88
264,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is quite true.,88
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES, Order ! The Acting Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Balaclava seem to be determined to interrupt the Minister's speech. Even at this late hour I shall not permit them to do so. I ask the Minister not to answer any further interjections.,88
266,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I was emphasizing that when a bill is introduced into this House it embodies government policy, and that the Minister in charge of it has to put it through to ""the best of his ability. It is useless for honourable members to ask that amendments be accepted. They can seek further consideration of certain proposals, and the Minister can promise further consideration, but he cannet accept an amendment on the spoil t is foolish to suggest otherwise. No matter how much a Minister may oppose a particular clause or provision in a bill, he cannot agree to alter it when the bill is before the House. He has had hi* chance to have the measure drafted to suit his wishes, but the majority has been against him. He has to abide by the will of the majority. If he does not do that, how can we have democratic government ? This measure will be passed in its present form, but that does not mean that the Government will not listen to suggestions from the Opposition, and perhaps have them discussed by Cabinet or caucus. Should a suggestion appear to be a good one, an amendment may be made when the bill is before the Senate.",88
267,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The Minister said that three years ago.,89
268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Order ! The honourable member for Balaclava must not interject again.,89
269,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"When a similar measure was before the House some time ago, I was asked whether I would suggest that the Government should reconsider the application of the means test to soldiers' pension. I agreed to ask the Minister to re-examine the matter, and I did that. The Government decided, however, that it could not alter its policy at that time. kept my word, and I do not know how any honourable member can say, year after year, that I did not. If I promise before this legislation goes through the committee stage to ask the Minister to reexamine any particular clause, I shall do so, but that is no guarantee that the Government will agree to amend the bill. The right honourable member for North Sydney suggested that our legislation should be based on the international concept of social justice for all people. That is the policy of the Government. It begins with full employment, and is completed by the passing of social legislation where it is necessary for social security. Economic security means guaranteeing an opportunity to earn a living to everybody who is willing and able to work. Social security means security for those who fall by the wayside a'nd are denied employment because of ness, injury or infirmity. Both social security and economic security are necessary to a successful society which will guarantee to every one an income suflicient to purchase the goods and services that are necessary for himself and his family. Having answered one or two outstanding criticisms and made clear how Labour's social services programme originated, and how each measure fits in with the basic wage and pensions-with out saying that pensions are adequateI shall reserve any further remarks until the committee stage. However, there is one matter that I should like to make clear. On several occasions it has been suggested that we should follow the lead set by New Zealand. If there is anything good in that dominion, we should be silly if we did not copy it ; but in the course of exchanges in this chamber, several honourable members have said that there is no means test in New Zealand. That is not so. In that dominion, a long-range plan is being followed. People over 65 years of age may receive a universal superannuation payment of £30 a year. That amount is being increased each yearby £2 10s. Person over 60 years of age may be granted an age benefit at the rate of £2 5s. a week, subject to a means test in respect of both income and property. No person can receive both the universal superannuaI tion and an age benefit. Therefore, in New Zealand both systems operate. 1 do not believe that we should change our system. The method that we follow today is the cheapest and most efficient way of achieving our end. Taxes artimposed on a sliding scale and we meet our social service payments out of general revenue. This saves the enormous cost of collecting and tabulating statistics showing the amounts contributed by each person. That would mean employing double staff. The cost of administration of tintwo methods in Australia is as follows, age, invalid, and widows' pensions. 0.8 per cent, or 16s. per £100 paid out. while the total cost, inclusive of sickness, unemployment and maternity benefit payments amounts to 1.2 per cent, or £1 4s. per £100. In the TJnited Kingdom, fluadministration cost of social benefits 4.3 per cent, or £4 6s. per £100 paid out. I would oppose any alteration of ill- the present system whether proposed in Cabinet, in Parliament or at any public meeting outside the Parliament. 1 believe that we should adhere rigidly to the system we have adopted. Unless I am defeated in logical debate, I shall never support the abolition of the mean? test in its entirety. I believe that we have reached a stage now where we cannot improve the means test and at the same time do justice to the people on the lowest rung of the social ladder who have no income at all. Every member of this House undoubtedly wants to do his most for people in the greatest need There are 430,000 people to whom these additional payments must be made. An honourable member spoke about a ""flat rate "" increase of 5s., and asked how long it would take to work out such an increase. Criticism, of that kind is based on ignorance of the problem involved. There are no fewer than 430,000 adjustments to be made and the increase ranges from a flat rate of 5s. to 17s. In deed, a married couple may receive a joint increase of 34s. as the result of this legislation. Scores of people will receive an increase of 17s. Many intricate adjustments have to be made. I had no intention to convey the impression which honourable members seemed to have gained from my statement that there was a physical difficulty involved in paying at the increased rates on a specified date. What I said was that payments at the increased rate will be -(fleeted when this bill becomes law, but - hat it would not be possible to work out the increased rates in a few days. The act provides->and this provision will be - strictly adhered to-that the increases proposed in this bill will be paid to the people entitled to them on the first pay period after the act receives Royal .issent. The sooner we pass the measure the sooner the increased benefits will be paid.",89
270,Mr EYAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Is payment at the increased rates to be made retrospective to :he 1st July?,90
271,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,No . The bill does not provide for retrospective payments and I feel sure that the Government will not alter the existing provision that payment will be made on the first pay day after the bill receives the Royal assentQuestion resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Jn committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2This Act shall come into operation day on which it receives the Royal Assent.,90
272,Mr HAKRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Wentworth-Actin g Leader of the Opposition) [10.45] - I was interested to hear the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway), in replying to the second reading debate, skip lightly over some observations made by me last night relanve to the need for making the increases retrospective to the 1st July. Unfortunately for the Minister, he made certain interjections during my second reading' speech, and in doing so made it perfectly clear that there was no financial difficulty associated with the making of retrospective payments, but that there was some staff difficulty. I wish to deal with that aspect of the matter, because 1 believe that it should be cleared up. It is most important that we should have a clear-cut statement of government policy. In dealing with the necessity for making retrospective payments, I pointed out that the Government had already agreed in the budget to make retrospective the application of certain income tax reductions and that I could, see no reason why, as the Government had in the National Welfare Fund approximately £28,000,000 more than it had last year, the invalid, age and other pensioners, who were to benefit from this proposed consolidation of the social services legislation, should not at least be given the same consideration as had been extended to companies and individuals in respect of income tax concessions announced in the budget. I based my argument on the fact that it was generally conceded that invalid and age pensioners were not getting sufficient to keep body and soul together. In his reply to the second-reading debate the Minister said that every member of this chamber agreed that the pension Avas insufficient to provide sustenance and a reasonable amount of comfort for ite recipients. I expected the Minister to add that the Government, having granted retrospective concessions to one section of the community, those whom it regards as comprising the most deserving section of the community would at least be extended the same consideration. The Minister having said that it is a physical impossibility to make the increases retrospective to the 1st July, I said that I could see no reason why there should be a on the physical impossibility because of the existence of an amount of £28,000,000 standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund in excess of that available last year. By interjection-and Hansard will bear out the accuracy of my recollection-the honourable gentleman repliedI did not say it was afinancialimpossibility. That interjection gave us the impression that the finance necessary to make retrospective payments was available and accordingly that any delay that might occur in effecting payment had nothing whatever to clo with the nnanciai situation. When I took the Minister to task and pointed out that when he said it was a physical impossibilty, I assumed that he meant it was a nnanciai impossibility, he saidThe staff of the department could not possibly do it. Later, when I drew his attention to the great increase of the Commonwealth Public Service-and I shall return to that point later-the honourable gentleman said-I am speaking of the time in which the Acting Leader of the Opposition says the payment should be made. These were the interjections made by the Minister, who is gradually getting himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Mr HOIXOWAY;- I am quite happy about it. I think this is all a waste of time.",90
273,Mr HARRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The Minister will have an opportunity to answer my comments. In effect, he asks, ""What does it matter if the age and invalid pensioners have to wait four months for payment of tlieir pensions at the increased rate ?"" Honourable members will have an opportunity to show by their vote in division where they stand in relation to this matter. The Minister made it clear that there is no financial difficulty associated with this proposal and that the only difficulty in effecting retrospective payments is a staffing difficulty. I shall have something to say in regard to that. In the course of my answer to the last interjection made by the Minister, I saidf. an; not concerned with the time. The 60vurnment has the money. The figures that I liave given prove that. Expenditure on social services this yeaT will he- £29,000,000 more than lost year. The Minister again saidIt is not a question of money. 1. propose to discuss that aspect of the problem for a few moments. The Commonwealth Public Service has expanded to an extraordinary degree. In 1938, Commonwealth departments"" employed 44,000 public servants. In Junej 1948. the total reached 169,200 in 25 departments, or nearly four times the number employed in pre-war years. It was upon these figures that I based my statemeni to which the Minister replied that staffing difficulties would prevent payment at the increased rates being made retrospective to the 1st July. Later, in hia answer to the second-reading speeches the Minister said that there were many complexities associated with making these payments which range from 6d. upwards. I say to the Minister that he can defer the payments and make them retrospective to the 1st July last. It is not necessary to make the payments immediately should he consider that hi? department is not sufficiently staffed to handle the necessary work. The amount? involved could be established as credifefor the age pensioners and might possibly become due for payment at the Christmas period when they would be like a Christmas box from the Governinent to each pensioner. That is a reasonable approach to the matter. Following the Minister's claim regarding the staff position I took it upon myself to examine it. I found that the number of person? employed in the age and invalid pension? and maternity allowance branch of the department was 311 in the year 1939-40. 591 in 1947-48, and in 1948-49 is to be increased to 636, which is more than double the 1939-40 figure. If by doubling the staff the Minister cannot at least ensure that he has the necessary administrative machinery, then I give him the logical answer which is, as I have already stated, to defer payments and create credits for the pensioners. By doing so the Minister will give age pensioners exactly the same consideration as is given to_ those who contribute to the country's revenue by paying income tax. The Minister has made it clear that finance is not the problem. As I have pointed out before, the Government has about £39,000,000 more in the ""kitty' "" than it had last year. There is no doubt whatever that in the minds of many honourable members of this conimittee and of people outside who take an interest in this matter, the difficulties mentioned by the Minister are purely a figment of Lii? imagination and can be overcome. F move That the words """"' day on which it receives 'tie Royal Assent"" be left out, with a view -<> insert in lieu tliereof the following -- first day of July, One thousand nine hundred ind forty-eight"". I'he clause, if so amended, would readThis a.cfc shall come into operation on the tirst day of July, One thousand nine hundred .nid forty-eight. That will give an opportunity for retro--pective payments to be made, and the necessary consequential amendments can he made so as to defer the payment until - uch time as the staff of the branch is - ible to make the necessary computations. During the intervening period a credit <\H.n be established for the age pensioners.",91
274,Mr CHIFLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Macquarie-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.56] - I think I should make it clear to the committee at the outset that the Government does not propose to accept any amendments to this bill. In saying that I refer not only to the matter under discussion but also to other payments provided in the bill. General principles have been laid down by the Government regarding the various types of benefits proposed in the legislation, which covers an annual ""xpenditure of about £20,000,000 for additional benefits. The Government does uot propose to depart from those principles. Whatever may be said, we believe we have made a fair judgment and a very liberal advance in the way of social - service payments.",92
275,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Wimmera) [10.58]. - I heartily support the amenament but it appears, from what the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has just stated, that he is quite definite that no amendment will he accepted. That is the kind of barrier the Opposition has been faced with in this Parliament during the short time. I have been a member of it, and in fact, during the seven years the Government has been in office. Judging by what the Prime Minister has said it would not make any difference to the Government if an amendment were brought forward' that would be for the benefit not ouly of the pensioners concerned in the bill but of the whole of the neople. Even if the wisest person in the world were to put forward an amendment, the Prime Minister would stil] say that he would not accept it. That is the barrier which the Opposition faces in its endeavours to improve this legislawords:- tion. I support the amendment for several reasons, the first of which is that if the increase.? t.o he made under the bill are necessary because of the rising cost of living, then they are necessary from the first day of the current nnanciai year. If the Government believes it to be just to make the increases during the second half of the financial year, what argument can it possibly advance to justify its refusal to pay them for the months of the current financial year which have already passed ? Pensioners throughout the country will tell the Prime Minister or any one else who troubles to inquire that thcy regard the Government's action as a flagrant injustice. Indeed, one does not need to inquire of them because one hears it discussed wherever people congregate. T cannot understand why aged and invalid people, many of whom have done much for this country, should be penalized so unjustly. The date of payment of the increased rates will depend on the actual date of passage of the hill. The amendment proposes to correct that anomaly by providing that on the passage of the measure and signification of the royal assent thereto the increased rates shall be made retrospective to the 1st July last. If the Parliament had met early in July and the Government had then introduced the bill, the probabilities are that pensioners would have received payment of the additional amount two months earlier. However, the Parliament did not meet until the beginning of September and pensioners are, in consequence, debarred from receiving any increase in respect of the months of July and August. The explanation of the Government's attitude cannot be that the Treasury is financially embarrassed and that the Government is anxious to delay payment in the interest of the national finances. I again stress the fact, that Treasury statistics just ^released reveal that the national revenue for the first three months of the current, financial year is more than £22,000,000 higher than estimated. Instead of an anticipated debit of - more than. £4,000,000, in respect of defence and postwar charges, which would have required to befinancedby loan money, the national finances are in credit. The three points which I have made are 'dearly unanswerable. The Prime Minister stated a short time ago that he would not agree to any amendments which may be moved to the measure. He was obviously trying to raise a barrier to discourage members of the Opposition from speaking to the bill, and I object strongly to such an attitude. Even such an important person as the Prime Minister should realise that he does not know everything rhat passes tlirough the minds of members of the Opposition, and he cannot anticipate the nature of amendments that may be moved. He should not attempt to pre-judge matters by adopting such an attitude, and I consider chat he was acting in a dictatorial fashion.",92
276,Mr OHTPIJEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I remind the honourable member that the decision which I announced was made by the GovernmentT am merely a cog in the machine.,93
277,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The Prime Minister says that the decision is that of the Government, and now he is running for cover.",93
278,Mr DEDMAIT,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Runnin g from the honourable member!,93
279,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I am pleased that tiven the right honourable gentleman realizes that my arguments have some merit. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) interjected to the effect that he was surprised that the Prime Minister should run for cover from me, but even I may be able to make a good suggestion. The Minister has not a monopoly of ideas for improvement of our social services.",93
280,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,There is always some wheat in chaff.,93
281,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I am glad that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) realizes that there is some merit in my suggestion.,93
282,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"No , I classed it with the chaff.",93
283,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Then . I pleased to know that the honourable member agrees with the rest of my speech. The honourable member cannot have it both ways. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Prime Minister to give sympathetic consideration to my request. I think that even supporters of the Government realise that the suggestion that payment of the increases to pensioners be made retrospective has much to support it. 1 consider that the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) should be agreed to, and 1 give it my whole-hearted support.",93
284,Mr LANG,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Reid) [11.5] - In the course of the speech which I made on the second reading of the bill, I drew the attention of honourable members to the proposed differentiation between the treatment of the wealthy and the poor. I pointed out that the Government proposes to give to wealthy tax-payers full advantage of the reduction of taxes by making that reduction retrospective to the 1st July last, whereas pensioners will not receive the benefit of any increase of their pension until after the measure is passed. Withholding of the lowest increase of pension, which is a flat rate of 5s:, will deprive each pensioner of at least £4 during the financial year, and I asked what sort of a miser government it was that would deprive the poorest section of the community, about whom we hear so many sob stories from members of the Government, of their right while it had millions of pounds at its disposal. I raised that matter in all sincerity, and I raise it again now because I believe in. what ] am saying, and I shall vote accordingly on the proposed amendment. In the light of the speech v/hich I made on the second reading of the bill, I consider that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) showed by his speech in reply that he has no sense of social justice. Whilst it is true, as he said, that some of the pensioners will receive an increase, not of 5s., but of an amount as great as 23s - indeed , I think he.went so far as to say that the increase would amount to 34s. in some instancesam Mr Holloway - In the case of married couples.",93
285,Mr LANG,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Le t us have the amount of the maximum increase, and call the increase 17s. It is evident that some of the unfortunate pensioners are to be deprived of 17s. a week for a period of fourteen weeks or more. Does that decision square with the statements made by the Minister and other members of the Government concerning the means test? Members of the Government have asserted that they cannot remove the means test because they must ensure that those who have the greatest need receive social service benefits, and Ministers are constantly speaking of those who receive the lowest incomes, the poorest people in the community. Because those pensioners are the poorest, the Government is going to rob them of a paltry £4, and its excuse is that payment of the increase from the beginning of the current financial year would involve some arithmetical difficulty. I point out to the committee that pensioners are paid fortnightly and the amounts which they receive are constant. Once calculations are made of the new amounts to which pensioners are entitled no further calculations will be required, and in the case of nearly all classes of pensions the calculations which will be made a fortnight hence could easily have been made before the first pension payment, day in July last. Therefore, the real reason why the Government has not paid pensioners their increases at the proper time is that it is deliberately withholding their money. I know from my association with many entitled. deserving people whom I meet that the matter of the increase of pensions was mentioned long before the 30th June Last, and that people who were drawing pensions were expeGting that any increase of their pensions would be payable the 1st July of this year. In a number of instances they mentioned it to Although I had nc authority for saying it, I suggested that the increase would paid from the 1st July. I never for moment thought that we were dealing with a lot of misers who would be so niggardly in their approach to a matter of this kind. It is all very well for Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) to say the collective mind has been made up. is not my mind. The Minister for Labour and National Service says that it is not his mind either, but that it is the majority mind. That majority mind will be tested and those who comprise it will be counted and noted. The people who consider that they have been unjustly and shabbily treated will not be deceived by people who will come around at the Christmas feast. They will not be choked listening to the words of those who sympathize with them, because it will be on record who constituted the majority. The Prime Minister and the Minister in charge of the measure have stated what they think. The Ministei' says that what he likes is not always what he gets, but that it is the majority mind. The Government will not be able to shelter behind that excuse, because in division, this chamber - will - show where the majority lies. It will very likely be found that that majority is a fairly uniform vote that some pensioners are to be deprived of at least £4, and other? fourteen or fifteen times 17s. That is not a small amount of money. It is not a small thing for those who need the money most, ,and who will suffer mostYet they are the people who will be deprived of it. Even now, the Government: should consider whether it will do thi? little act of justice and make the small amend.n)e;nt: which is necessary. It ha.= ether amendments to make, and this one could easily be added. On the motion for the second-reading I did what I could to ensure that the pensionerp would get the amount to which they are",94
286,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Balaclava) [11.14] - 1 urge the Government to accept this amendment. This is an indication of how the Government works; the Prime Minisfrom ter (Mr Chifley) made a dictatorial statement that no amendment will be me. accepted. We have seen that happen in connection with many bills. It means be that the Parliament, ceases to be a a deliberative assembly. If the Government of the day adopts real "" starchamber "" methods and decides that there shall be no amendment to a bill, there the is no deviation from that course. I conthat tend that if a mistake has been made, It that fact should be admitted. Let us consider what will happen if no amendments are ever approved.

After the Prime Minister said that no amendment would be accepted, he left the chamber. It how is a matter for his party.

Dame ENI D LYONS (Darwin) [11.26]. - I take this opportunity to reply to the remarks of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) in answer to the speech which I made on the motion for the second reading of the bill. Unfortunately, I was absent from the chamber during part of his speech, but .] Act is understood that he said that, whereas 1 had discussed the position of two age a man and his wife, in relation to their whole permissible income, he thought it would have heen fairer, beinvalid cause of the great number of pensioners pension 'payable to a penwho had no income other than their pensioner who is a married person and whose husband or sions, to have discussed the matter wife is also a .pensioner on the basis of pension income only. would be such that the If two age pensioners have no aggregate of the rates of the income whatever apart from their age or invalid pensions of pensions, their combined income will that married person and of the husband or wife and of amount to £4 5s. a week, and the rates of any war penmany such couples will be livin g in their sions payable to them would own homes. I do not say that all of exceed Three hundred and them will have their own homes, but seventeen pounds four shillings per annum, the many of them will . The widow with one rates of those age or invalid child will receive £2 7s. 6d. a week, conpensions shall he reduced by sisting of a pension of £2 2s. 6d. for heramounts equal in the aggreself, and 5s. for her only child. I said gate to the amount of the excess.: and in my speech that, allowing the permissible income to hoth groups, the widow would have to have eight children before - her income would reach that of the two pensioners. As a matter of fact, it would .iust slightly exceed their income. However, placing the matter on the basis of actual pension payments, the widonwith eight children would receive 65 17s. 6d. a week, and it is extremely unlikely that she would have her own home. The chances are that, in a family of that size, the husband would not have been able to provide the price of a home seeing that he had to leave his widow dependent upon a pension. The Minister, [ understand, argues that there is not such a great difference between the position of the two aged people living on £4 5s. a week, and that of the widow and eight children living on £5 17s. 6d. a week. I can only express my great astonishment at such a suggestion. I can understand that the difference would not be so great, considered on the basis of pension payments alone, as if permissible incomes were taken into account, but even on the basis of pensions only the suggestion of the Minister is absurd. When persons attain the pensionable age, their needs become less. I speak with some experience. At the present time, my family relations are such that I nave to deal with four generations and their needs. I know that those at the lower end make certain demands upon the family's general financial position which those at the other end do not. Por instance, the latter do not require so much clothing and food, whilst the diversity of food they require is not so important. I again point out that the amount of rent payable by two old people is much less than that payable in respect of a house to meet the needs of nine people. Therefore, a very good case indeed can be made out for the claims of a widow with a family; and I suggest that the endowment payments he increased in respect of children who are dependent upon a widow. Again, I insist that in the light of every statement made on behalf of the Government by either the Minister or his colleagues, there is every ground for increasing the allowance of 5s. in respect of the first child either a. widow or invalid pensioner need has been completely ignored under this measure. I spoke on the Estimates deliberately to draw the attention of the Minister to this position, and asked that my suggestion that the allowance of 5s. he increased be considered before this measure was introduced. Nothing has been done. I am perfectly convinced Dame Enid Lyons. that the urgency of my representations is not yet apparent to the Government. Is it fair to suggest that an allowance of 5s. even begins to cover the cost of rearing a child of any age at all? And the child of an invalid pensioner also is in exactly the same position as are the children of a widow pensioner. Again I urge upon the Government the necessity to review this matter in the light of the real need that exists in relation to these children. As I have already said, if - we care for the aged as we must and should, we must also care for the young upon whom the whole future of thi? country rests. Clause agreed to. Clauses 15 to 19 agreed to. New clause 17A.",96
294,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Swan) [11.34] - I move That, after clause 17, the following new clause be inserted:"" 17A. Section one hundred and six of the Principal Act is amended by adding to the definition of 'income' the following para frrupli:' (/) a war pension;'"". The object of my amendment is to enable unemployment and sickness benefit to be paid to an ex-serviceman in receipt of a war pension without application of the means test. At present the definition of ""income"" does not exclude "" w,ar pension "". This matter was discussed more than twelve months ago. At that time the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) promised that the amendment I now propose would be effected at the first possible opportunity. This is the first opportunity we have had since that time to discuss the matter, and I regret to note that no reference whatever is made in the bill to any proposal of the kind embodied in my amendment. Everybody is aware that a war pension is granted hy the country to of men who suffer disability as the result This of service in defence of the country. That pension is paid with a view to making the recipient an even target on the labour market and it is also regarded as a measure cf compensation for loss suffered by the recipient during service in defence of his country. Therefore, it comes as a rude shock to war pensioners to discover that should they become ill or cease to be employed because of their war disability they are not eligible for full employment or sickness benefit if they are in receipt of more than 40 per cent, disability war pension. At the same time, they contribute while in employment towards unemployment and sickness All ex-servicemen know man is awarded a 40 per cent, disability war pension unless there is something radically wrong with him. In those cir-. f.umstances it is a disgrace to any government to apply a means test to such peiBons should they be obliged to apply for unemployment or sickness benefit particularly as a result of their war disability. I do not propose to deal with the matter at length, because t believe that all honourable members fully understand the T make. My request is reasonable and just. I cannot see i'or the life of the why the Government will not accept the amendment. Some honourable members opposite have said that so few men would come into the category I have indicated that my proposal is not worth' bothering about. If that be so, why is the Government fighting shy of it? The cost involved would not be very great. When the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) stated that the Government would not accept any amendment to this measure, I believe that he was not aware of this anomaly.",97
295,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Balaclava) [11.38] The matter raised by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) was first brought up long before twelve months ago. When the principal act was under consideration in 1944, 1 moved an amendment along the lines of that now proposed by the honourable member. At that time the Minister for _<abour and National Service (Mr Holloway), who was in charge of the bill, said I ask honourable members to remember that this bill was introduced in the Senate, and that, as it is not my bill, I cannot accept the amendment, not because I do not think that there is justice in it, but because it is not a matter for me to determine. I promise that I shall sympathetically submit it to the Treasurer and Cabinet so that it shall be discussed at the next Cabinet meeting, which will take place soon. T shall see that an answer is «iven. The then honourable member for Parramatta, Sir Frederick Stewart, interjectedThe Minister will not ask us to pass the bili until the answer has been given? The Minister repliedI do not say that, but I do say that it will noi funds. he put into force until this provision has been that no inserted or reasons against it have been given. Sir Frederick Stewart then interjectedParliament will adjourn tomorrow for at least four months. The House rested on the Minister's assurance. I again raised the matter in 1947 when I had the support of a number of honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Haylen) and you, yourself, Mr Deputy Chairman. It has been made abundantly clear that the Government is acting point cruelly in ignoring the claim now made on behalf of war pensioners. The deduction which is made from their war pension under the means test, should they be given unemployment and sickness benefit under this measure, is really a deduction from a dole. But when the honourable gentleman gave a solemn assurance in his characteristic, selfsatisfied, soft-soaping way, we accepted his word on that occasion. Last year, the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Harrison), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) and others made strong comments on the subject. The honourable member for Swan saidThe duty of any government, regardless of its political colour, which subjects war pensions to the means test, is unworthy of being described as Australian. The Acting Leader of the Opposition made a similarly strong comment. He resented the manner in which the proposal had been shelved, and invited the Government to salvage its honour. The spirited discussion which took place on the amendment dragged on, as this debate is dragging on, until finally the committee divided at 2 a.m. I was sorry that a division was called, because I knew thai it would discomfit some members of the Labour party. I do not make that statement for the purpose of twisting their feelings on this occasion. I know that, their hearts were in .their words when they spoke in favour of the amendment. However, the discipline of the party was too strong. Earlier this evening, the I'rime Minister (Mr Chifley) entered the - hamber and announced that the Government would not accept any amendments. I know of the fate that would befall a member of the Labour party who dared ro place his feelings and conscience before the iron discipline of caucus. Doth the Minister for Labour and National Service, and the Minister for Social 'Services (Senator MCKenna) nave expressed their sympathy towards ""lie objective which the amendment seeks ro achieve. I understand that the Minister for Labour and National Service wrote most ingratiating letters to assure people that within a short period the - natter would be adjusted. Although 1 raised the matter four years ago, the position has not been altered. I shall explain the situation clearly to the chamber - so that there can be no equivocation. When speaking on this subject last year, rhe Minister said, in effect, "" I am not - helving the proposal; it is not my --""ault"". He used practically the same words this evening. A soldier who has lost an eye or is otherwise disfigured is - inder a great disability when seeking em;jloyment. He may receive a pension of a few shillings a week. An ex-crviceman who bas lost a few fingers or a hand is also in that category. The pension which is payable is only - ompensation, and is less generous than my other form of social services. I propose to deal extensively with that aspect when repatriation benefits are 'inder consideration. Undoubtedly, the time will come when - omo of those unfortunate ex-servicemen will be unemployed. Australia's general prosperity is dependent on the cont inn a nee of high prices overseas for our exportable primary produce. Should a - flight recession occur, men will become unemployed. Many ex-servicemen have received treatment in hospitals and are now battling for employment. Others a.re undergoing rehabilitation courses, and are receiving mere pittances. Should nn economic slump occur, they will be on rhe labour market. Par from receiving preference in employment, they will be at a disadventage. A member of an industrial organization may receive unemployment benefits from his union or a .Ifr. White. friendly society when he loses his job. and this is not deductible from unemployment relief whereas that of a partly disabled ex-serviceman is deductible. What is the reason? [ ba^e been considering that question during the last four years. I speak with considerable feeling at this stage because previously, I accepted the Minister's assurance that an amendment to give effect to my proposal would be incorporated in the act. Now, the honourable gentleman is trying to fob us off with additional assurances, and he had hif leader enter the chamber to announce that the Government would not accept any amendments. If this amendment be rejected, the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and National Service on ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day will be a mockery. They will give a new significance to "" Lest We Forget"". I speak with intense feeling on this subject because I say that we have been fobbed off with humbug and hypocrisy. Year after year, when we have raised this matter, we have received assurances that the position would be rectified. The Minister, by scribbling an amendment, can meet our wishes now. Mr HoLlfOWAY -^-Nonsense !",98
296,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The honourable gentleman said last year that the position would l^e rectified and be gave an assurance that lie would discuss it with other Ministers. He has given a similar assurance on this occasion. Are we able to accept his word? If he fears that he cannot prevail upon a majority of members of caucus or Cabinet, he should show hif manhood by resigning from the Ministry.",99
297,Mr RIORDAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Has any honourable member opposite resigned from tinMinistry on a matter of principle?,99
298,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Yes . The Ministei either agrees or disagrees with the proposal. If he refuses to accept the amendment, he must bear his share of the odium which will overtake the Labour party. Honourable members opposite are not unanimous in opposing the amendment. I respect the attitude of those honourable members who spoke last year in support of it. Sboiild the Government refuse to accept this amendment, it will be damned because of its attitude towards ex-servicewas men and its honour will be impugned.",99
299,Mr BOWDEN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Gippsland) [11.46] livery honourable member on this side of the chamber believes that an injustice is being done to certain ex-servicemen. Thi3 - subject has been debated on two previous occasions, to my knowledge and the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) has consistently promised to endeavour to induce Cabinet to alter its decision. I have no doubt rhat he has submitted it to his colleagues.",100
300,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is so. "" Mr BOWDEN - However , the honourable gentleman has failed to convince them. If honourable members opposite were allowed to vote according to the dictates of their consciences, I am certain that the majority of them would support t.he amendment. On a previous occasion, - leveral honourable members opposite spoke just as vehemently in favour of the proposal as any member of the Opposition did. I am inclined to challenge the Government to submit the issue to caucus, ff it were to do so, I believe that the amendment would be carried. The Government cannot legitimately and with justice continue to, regard a disability pension as income. A government which pretends to be humane should not be less generous to ex-servicemen than it is to citizens in other walks of life.",100
301,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is not quite the position.,100
302,Mr BOWDEN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"During the second reading debate, members of the Labour party constantly boasted about the lavish expenditure on social services. They pointed - with pride to the increased expenditure from £17,000,000 to £88,000,000 in a decade. Nearly everybody is receiving social services in some form except those whose sacrifices in war-time made the collection and spending of that amount of £88,000,000 possible. Under the social services legislation, ex-servicemen have received a worse deal than any other section of the community. L' shall not say that they are in that plight because they are ex-servicemen, but because they have done their job and are no longer wanted. It is so easy to forget what the country owes to them. When the fighting was at its hottest there much cheering and many emotional tears were shed. Now, All that is forgotten. It is so easy to forget immediately the fighting has ended. The Government has had four years in which to consider this matter. I understood, when the proposal was originally made, that it might not have been practicable for the Minister fco accept the amendment immediately. However, he has had four years in which to consider it. Duriug this nnanciai year, othei social services will be considerably increased but ex-servicemen will continue ? to suffer injustice. That is disgraceful, and cannot be justified. If caucus were given an opportunity to consider this proposal, a majority of honourable members opposite would approve of it and the necessary amendment would be inserted in the bill I should like to know the names of the Ministers who are opposed, to it, and to examine their background. How dare they oppose a proposal which is so manifestly just? The purpose is to grant to ex-servicemen who fought for tlieir country a benefit at least equal to that enjoyed by those who did not fight for their conntry. Some of them would not have fought for their country under any conditions. Other men went away in the service of their country and lost limbs, and, foi their sacrifices, the Government consider they are entitled to compensation of a few shillings a week, according to the degree of their disability. Yet the Governmem has the effrontery to class such a pension as part of a man's income. Government supporters have been talking about removing the means test. Here is a mean.' test on unfortunate men who have lost limbs and some of the strength and vigour that might have enabled them to earn a comfortable living. Why not at least impose the same means test to other people? Apparently the ex-serviceman-does not count. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) said that he had heard that the Government would not accept the amendmem which we are considering because the men affected are only few in number. It seems that, because of their small numbers, they have little voting ""value and therefore are not important in the oyeof Ministers and their supporters. It is a disgrace that any government should treat a payment of a few miserable - hillings a week as part of a man's income and so prevent him from obtaining beneiits that are readily granted to other - actions of the community, including, I repeat, some men who have never lifted a hand to contribute to the development - >f this country or its defence when it has Keen assailed by enemies. Even though rhe Government refuses to accept the amendment, I should not like the discussion to end without the Minister for Labour and National Service at least explaining its attitude. It would be an affront to the Parliament if the measure were passed without any reply being made to our representations. I know the Minister. My opinion of him is different from that held by many other honourable members. I believe that he really feels that we are in the right. lieve he would like to accept our amendment. He spoke to his colleagues four years ago in favour of this proposal. He has a chance to say to them now, "" You have had plenty of time to think this over. Now, come my way, accept the amendment, and put an end to this terrible injustice to men who are entitled to everything that Australia can give them "".",100
303,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labonr and National Service) [11.52] - I do not want to evade the challenge issued by the honorabie member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden). I shall put the case clearly. This matter has already been decided hy the Government. This is a democratic government, and it sticks to its decisions. That does not mean that members of the Parliamentary Labour party do not examine, and discuss problems for hours, hut like loyal members of any other united party, rhey stand by their decisions once they have been made. The situation is not exactly as the honourable inem.ber for Gippsland has described. He has accused the Government of discriminating between ordinary civilians and ex-servicemen. That is not correct. The amendment refers to the unemployment and sickness benefits provisions of the Social Services Consolidation Act, and to nothing else. Under those provisions, the income of an ex-servicemen is exempt to the same amount as that of anybody else. Therefore, it is not true to say that the ex-serviceman is the subject of discrimination. The real point at issue, as I believe the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) will agree, is whether war pensions paid to disabled ex-servicemen ar«to be calculated as income for the purpose of assessing benefits under the Social Services Consolidation Act. Is not that so?",101
304,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Yes .,101
305,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That is the principle involved. An ex-serviceman who ha a disability pension of not more than f 1 a week can qualify for the full benefit under the act. However, if his pension exceed sthat ""figure, the amount of the excess over f l a week is deducted from the benefit I be- payable to him. Not many ex-servicemen receiving a disability pension of £1 « week are able to work.",101
306,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Ye s they are.,101
307,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Not many.  reason why the Governinent should accept the amendment.,101
308,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I am trying to examine the matter properly. The real issue is whether pensions paid to compensate ex-servicemen for the loss of their ability to compete with their fellows should be regarded as income in the ordinary sense of the word for the purposes of assessing a social services benefit. Up to the present, the provision in the act has been regarded as fair and just. The committee is not considering the unemployment and sickness benefits legislation now.",101
309,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,That is included in the Social Services Consolidation Act.,101
310,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,It is not dealt with in the bill before the committee.,101
311,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Ye s it is.,101
312,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"There is no real need for the committee to discuss the unemployment benefits legislation at all now. Should we ever drift back into an economic depression, though we hope that we shall never do so, that legislation will have to be re-examined because its scope is not wide enough to provide for the needs of men who might be unemployed for long periods. If any such re-examination should become necessary, the issue which has been raised to-night could then be discussed. The Government cannot accept the amendment. The bill must remain as it stands.  The reply of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) has disgusted me. He was quibbling when he said that the legislation dealing with unemployment benefits was not under consideration. I remind him that, when the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill was before the Parliament in 1944, we discussed the proposal embodied in the present amendment at six minutes past three o'clock in the morning. We are again discussing the same subject almost on the hour of midnight. In 1944, the Minister said that he was strongly in favour of the Opposition's proposal He approved of it so heartily that he mised to submit it to Cabinet.",101
313,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,And I did.,102
314,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Ye t today, four amendment:years later, when the Minister is again asked to accept it, he merely brushes i on one side. Nobody with any regard inserted:for the rights of ex-servicemen could say that a disability pension should be treated as income. Disability pensions are granted to men who have been wounded in action, in order to compensate them for the handicaps that they suffer in civil life in competition with able-bodied men who did not go to war. It is shameful that such payments should he treated as income. There can be no foul in any government that treats legisI. lation of this sort in this way. The Prime Ministers action, in entering the chamber witliout having listened to discussion or studied the amendment, declaring that no amendment will be aeeepted. is a mockery of democracy. That is a form of dictatorship, and satisfied that the electors will not stand for it. It is time that the people realized that this Parliament is not being treated as a deliberative assembly. ""What happens is that caucus meets, obtains its instrucexceeding tion from the Trades and Labour Countralian cils, registers its decisions and then them upon the Parliament. I again ask the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Prime Minister to consider the representations that we have made on behalf of disabled ex-servicemen. Those representations were first made in 1944, when almost every ex-service member on this side of the chamber spoke twice on the proposal. On that occasion, the Minister for Labour and National Service undertook, in effect, to make a strong recommendation to Cabinet in favour of our amendment. He expressed his approval and sympathy, but apparently his views had no effect upon caucus, which is indifferent to the claim of the ex-servicemen of Australia, and it is as well that the community should know it. Thursday, U October, 19Jf8.",102
315,Mr HARRISON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Wentworth-Actin g Leader of the Opposition) [12 midnight]. - Honourable members may recall that on prothe 30th March, 1944, I addressed myself to this question in the committee stage of the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill 1944. I then moved the following That, in the definition of ""income"", after t paragraph (6), the following paragraph hi! "" (in) in relation to a person qualified tu receive unemployment benefit or sickness benefit, any payment not exceeding One pound five shilling? per week made under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 19201.943 in respect of a pension other than a special pension; or"". My reason for doing that was because a set of circumstances then obtained that was similar to those that obtain today. drew attention to the fact that the war pension that was paid to an ex-serviceman who had lost an arm, or a leg, or an eye. the was taken into account in assessing and his eligibility for unemployment or sickness benefit. I pointed out that that provision did not apply to persons who I am received pensions from trade unions, friendly societies or similar organizations. My amendment was designed to ensure that an incapacitated ex-serviceman who was in receipt of a war pension not f l 5s. a week under the AusSoldiers' Repatriation Act should forces be treated on the same basis as other members of the community. The report of my speech is to be found in Hansard the 30th March, 1944, at page 2384. Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr JEIolloway) said, as reported on page 2390 of the same volume of HansardI ask honourable members to remember this bill was introduced in the Senate, chat, as it is not my bill, I cannot accept amendment, not because I do not think chore is justice in it, but because it is matter for me to determine. I promise that I shall sympathetically submit it to the Treasless urer and Cabinet so that it shall be discussed nt: the next cabinet meeting, which will place soon. T shall see that an answer - xivtMi. We know what happened. The Minister promised that he would sympathetically submit the amendment to the Treasurer aud the Cabinet. I hope.that the honourable gentleman did so. If he did, he apparently found that Cabinet had no - ympathy for ex-servicemen.",102
316,Mr HOLLOWAY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I should not say that. Air. HAEEISON - It is a trite expresex-servicemen sion, but . actions speak louder than words. If Cabinet had been sympathetic to the amendment would .have been made co the bill. We know that it was not made. In 1947 the honourable member for Balaclava. (Mr White) again drew attenresult. tion to this matter and, in committee, moved .an .amendment similar to that to which I have just referred. The same arguments were adduced. On that occasion honourable members on the other side of the chamber supported the honorsacrifices, able memher for Balaclava. Again the Minister gave an assurance, again assurance was accepted by the committee, and again it was dishonoured. The honorof able member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) has now moved an amendment that is .a couched in much the same terms as those which were moved by the honourable memservicemen. ber for Balaclava and myself on those occasions, and designed to have the same effect which is to secure justice for those who fought, and sacrificed to make sible the facilities that are now enjoyed by age pensioners. The sum of money that would be involved if justice were extended to these men is infinitesimal comparison with the huge amounts that a.re being expended at the present moment. Incapacitated ex-servicemen are, of however, singled out as a section of the The community that must .not receive any consideration from this .Government. It is fitting that honourable members on this side of the committee should ask why this that body of people should be treated less and favourably than others. I have no doubt the that the amendment that is now before that the chair will be met with lip-service not a from honourable members opposite. Doubtthe Minister will run true to form. He will rise in his place and tell the comtake mittee with all the unctiousness at his is command that he has a great deal of sympathy for these men, that something should be done for them and that he will sympathetically submit it to the Cabinet. That will not mean a thing and this secof the community will again be singled out as one that must not reveive any consideration from the Governmenl in this connection. Honourable members opposite who artfeel keenly about this question. The honourable member for'Parke? them, (Mr Haylen) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke), who is now occupying the chair, have great sympathy for these men, but their sympathy is confined to words. If they took action in caucus they might achieve some The Minister will no doubt say that Cabinet is sympathetic towards these men, but we want practical results. What is the use of saying to a body of men. "" We know that you are placed at a disadvantage. We know that, by your you have made it possible for us to do many things. We shall give you the sympathy, but we are not going to do what you ask us to do "" ? Other sections the community have the sympathy of the Government, but that sympathy takes practical form and is entirely different from that which is accorded to the exHonorable members on this side of the chamber have .accepted the Minister's assurance on previous occasions, but on. this occasion we propose to posdivide the committee in an attempt to secure justice for these men. We propose to invite honourable members .opposite, who have on other occasions expressed in their sympathy in words, to translate it into action and to see if .they cannot persuade the Government ,to give these men the justice to which they are entitled.",103
317,Mr FALKINDEE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Franklin) [12.8 a.m.],- I support the amendment and cord my amazement at the fact that the Minister for Lahour and National SerGovernment vice (Mr Holloway) has not seen fit accept it. On the last occasion when this question was debated, the honourable gentleman clearly indicated that he was, in his own mind, sympathetic to the amendment that had been moved, and 3aid that an amendment might be prostill posed in another place. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) said on that occasionSome time ago, an assurance was given respect of the matter now at issue. I stake my position on this issue, and-1 feel adjustment ought, in all decency, to be made. Concessions have been granted in other tions, hut not to servicemen. The amount involved is paltry. 'Che honourable member for Herbert Edmonds) said1 could not possibly, be honest with myself ing and allow this debate to be concluded without expressing, my view. I said last night that there was nothing that this country could to ex-servicemen that was too good for Particularly is that so in respect of maimed ex-servicemen. Whilst I d'o not suggest the Minister (Mr Holloway) should accept the amendment, I ask in all sincerity that, collaboration with the Prime Minister Chifley) and the Minister for Health and Social Services (Senator MCKenna)., he give the matter consideration, with a view to having it clarified. That was an ambiguous statement. The Minister can offer no real reason why this amendment should not be accepted, tt is clear that the service pension should not he considered as income, and I say that if the Minister had any real humanity in him, he would accept the amendment.",104
318,Mr GULLETT,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Henty) [12.10 a.m.] [ rise to associate myself briefly with the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton). It is extraordinary that a very moderate and humane proposal . such as - this to which, even the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) pays some form of lip service, should not be the subject of any other comment whatBurke) soever by Government supporters. It is amazing, when one considers that there be heard in silence. are some ex-servicemen among honourable members opposite, and indeed, others who have good cause to be grateful to, and, no doubt, wish to help, those unrefortunate men who are sufferingfrom severe disabilities, that they and other supporters have had not the to decency at this juncture to associate themselves with this reasonable proposition. The service pension is a. payment to ex-servicemeu for certain definite disabilities such as the loss of limbs he eyes, hands, and so on. Do tibey not suffer from those disabilities whether they are in work or out of work? I say they should' be paid this money as some little compensation. No one will suggest in that the service pension is particularly generous. Every day of tlieir lives honthat an orable members opposite see in the direcfederal members' rooms in the various capitals and elsewhere, men suffering from war disabilities. Some of (Mr them are young men in the prime of bheir life, and it is astoundto think that a government which disburses public money on such a lavish scale, should seek to cut expendioffer ture in this paltry way. I repeat that it them. is shameful that with the exception of that the Minister for Labour and National Service, not one honourable member oppoin site has had the manliness and decency (Mr to speak on this simple proposal.",104
319,Mr BABNABD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Bass-Minister for Repatriation) [12.12 a.m.] - This matter has received the consideration of the Government on several occasions fbllowing representations by the Opposition. After mature consideration, it has been, rejected. No good purpose can be served by honourable members opposite arguing that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) said this, that, or something else on some other occasion. The Minister made a promise to the House in 1'944 and again in 1947, and on both occasions he honoured his promise. He referred the Opposition's proposal to Cabinet, and Oabinet decided that it was not prepared to agree to the request. Mr GDILETT.:-Why ?",104
320,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Mr. - Order ! The Minister is proceeding to give his reasons, and he must",104

324,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Than k you, Mr to ex-servicemen. Deputy Chairman. This question has heen argued very fully by members understand it. of the Opposition. It has also been canvassed very fully by Cabinet and by caucus, and the view of very the majority of members of both CabiGovernment net and the caucus is that the concession - ought by the Opposition should not made.",105
325,Mr BEALE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Why ?,105
326,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES," Order! The honourable member for Parramatta has heard the general ing that I have given. Interjections must not continue. M!r. BARNARD - I am not embarunemployed? rassed by the honourable member's queswould tion. Mr SI'ENDEK,-The Minister does know the answer.",105
327,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I realise that in the opinion of the honourable member for Warringah, nobody knows anything. is full of his own conceit. The claim has been made to-night is, of course, that can be made easily from the sition's benches, where no responsibility lies. If ever honourable members opposite rake over the reins of government, they will have many things to answer. quite easy to argue matters such as this when one is in Opposition. But let us look at the position. This problem did not arise until the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act became operative. It did not arise, therefore, while the parties now in Opposition occupied the treasury bench, because they did not anything for the unemployed whether were ex-servicemen or not. In those ex-servicemen were given the great of carrying their swags, drawing the dole, and searching in rubbish tins for something to eat. The Labour the Government put the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act on the statute-book. That legislation gives to every section of the community certain rights in the event of unemployment or sickness. It provides that an income of £1 a week from a friendly society or any other source shall not involve a reduction of the unemployment and sickness benefit. However, any greater amount, whatever its source, will reduce the benefit. I cannot see in that any particular injustice",105
328,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The Minister does not Mr . BARNARD - I understand it well indeed. I know, too, that this has done something for those people whereas the Opposition parties be did nothing during their term of office on the treasury bench. If an ex-serviceman who is in receipt of a small pension, not exceeding £1 a week, becomes unemployed he is entitled, as ""is any other member of the community, to the unemwarnployment benefit. What disadvantage would he suffer by comparison with other members of the community if he became In those circumstances he be eligible for the payment of the unemployment benefit. If he became not unemployed through war-caused sickness he would be taken care of according to the provisions of the Australian Soldiers' - Repatriation Act. If his sickness were He of a normal kind he would be entitled that to the sickness benefit. Thus he would one bs on equal terms with other members Oppoof the community. Honourable members opposite may make a great play of this proposal in their attempts to secure the votes of ex-servicemen, but their attitude It is is purely mercenary.",105
329,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Did the honourable member say that our attitude is mercenary?,105
330,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Yes . Because of my position in the Cabinet I have some responsibility for looking after the interests of ex-servicemen. I have examined do this proposal closely and I wholeheartedly support what has been said by the Minister for Labour and National Service in relation to it. The honourable gentleman has indicated plainly that the Government, vy.ill not accept the amendment because the Government doe9 not regard ex-servicemen as being .placed in a disadvantageous position by comparison with other members of the community in their eligibility for the sickness benefit.",105
331,Mr RYAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Flinders) [12.23 a.m.] The Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Barnard) convicts himself out of his own mouth when he says that disabled ex-servicemen should be able to compete on equal terms with other members of the community. That principle of equality is one which honourable members on this side of the chamber will not accept. We believe that if any one in the community is entitled to preferential treatment it is the disabled ex-serviceman. Surely - some measure of justice should be extended to the men who fought for their country and lost what no one of the members of this chamber has lost- a limb or an eye. In return for their disablement we give them what is called a pension, but which in reality is compensation for their injuries and their loss of something r,he possession of which would make life comfortable and happy for them. That compensation should not be taken away from them in any circumstances. I join in this debate solely to express .my regret that the Government will not concede the justice of a claim which we have frequently submitted on behalf of disabled ex-serviccmen during the last four years. Some honourable members opposite have indicated that they share our views on this suhject. I can only assume that they rely on the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government will not accept the amendment to still the urgings of their consciences. I deplore the refusal - if the Government to accept the amendment.",106
332,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Wimmera) [12.25 a.m.] - On looking through the Hansard record, I find that when this subject was debated last year the debate took place after midnight. Very few Governare ment supporters have spoken on the order amendment proposed by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton). I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that when a similar proposal was submitted last year some honourable members on the Government side frankly stated their views in relation to it. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Falkinder) mentioned that one of them was the honourable member for Parke (Mr Haylen). Another was the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds). who spoke at 2.54 a.m., clearly demonstrating that he must have been fairly keen on the subject. I compliment him cn the sentiments he expressed on that occasion. Amongst other things the honourable member said1 could uot possibly be honest with myselt and allow this debate to be concluded without expressing my view. I said last night that there was nothing this couutry could offei to ex-serviccmen which was too good for them That is a splendid sentiment. Tinhonorable member continuedParticularly is that eo in respect of maimed ex-servicemen. Whilst I do not sirggest thai the Minister will accept the ameiidment, I ask in all sincerity that he should confer with the Prime Minister (Mr Chi(ley) and tinMinister for Health and Social Services (Sena tor MCKenna ) to give the matter further consideration. Those are very fine sentiments which 1 supported on that occasion at three o'clock in the morning, as the Hansard record will show. The amendment proposed by the honourable memher for Swan refers to. the income allowed to person in receipt of unemployment and sickness benefits. Section 106 of the principal act defines income in relation to a person a meaningAny personal earnings, moneys, valuable consideration or profits earned, derived or rr ceived by that person for his own use or bene fit by any means from any source whatsoever, within ov outside Australia, and includes am periodical payment or benefit by way of »ifi or allowance Then follow certain exclusions. Tinhonorable member for Swan has proposed than an additional exclusion be inserted, namely, war pensions. I do not think there is any misapprehension in the minds of members as to the purpose for which war pensions are paid. All of us aware that war pensions are paid into raise to the level of other members of the community the earning capacity of those who have suffered by reason of their war service. The Minister for Repatriation has said that this measure inflicts no injustice on ex-servicemen by comparison with otber members of the community. The purpose of the amendment is not merely to place disabled ex-servicemen on the same level as other members of the community, but also to extend to these ex-servicemen ^ome degree of preference. Why should a disabled ex-serviceman be placed at a disadvantage if he becomes eligible for the payment of unemployment and sickness benefits? I heartily support the amendment. What I have said has been amply demonstrated by the Minister earlier during the committee debate. When the honourable gentleman says that the Government cannot accept the amendment, he is speaking truthfully. It cannot be accepted because the decision has been made by the majority of the Labour caucus.",106
333,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Dominate d by whom?,107
334,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Whether Minister wants to accept an amendment or not he is in the position that he cannot accept it, and that is what the Opposition faces when it fights for better conditions for ex-servicemen. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Falkinder) said that he was amazed that the Minister at the table would not accept the amendment. i am not amazed, because I expected that to happen, as the Prime Minister had already signified that the Government would accept no amendments to the bill. The Government's attitude cannot be regarded as being other than unsympathetic to ex-servicemen, in the same way as it unsympathetic to anything put forward on behalf of former prisoners of war, as T pointed out some days ago.",107
335,Mr MCLEOD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Wannon) [12.31 a.m.]. Any one would think that the Opposition had a monopoly of sympathy for ex-servicemen. I am just about sick of hearing such hypocrisy and I shall remind honourable members opposite of some general facts about ex-servicemen and the Government's attitude towards them. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) said that the Government was not concerned with improving conditions for ex-servicemen.,107
336,Mr TUENBOXL,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I said the Government was unsympathetic. The TEMPOEAEY QTTATRMAN (Mr Lazzarini) - Order !,107
337,Mr MCLEOD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It is strange how honourable members opposite become sympathetic to ex-servicemen when they are in Opposition. When they occupied the treasury bench they were not so sympathetic. In Opposition theii generosity is exceeded only by theii hypocrisy. When I first entered this Parliament as a member and even before that when I was on the hustings seeking election, I was charged, as was the Labour party, with offering bribes to ex-servicemen,..because the party had stated that its policy was to increase the miserable amount paid to them, which at that time was even lower than thai paid immediately after World War - ] . However, the people put the Labour party into power.",107
338,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I rise to order. Only one the clause of the Social Services Consolidation Bill is now under discussion and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr. MCLeod) is rambling over the whole of the bill. If he is allowed that liberty' ] intend to speak in answer to him. I ask that he be called to order.,107
339,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The honourable member for Wannon must relate his remarks to the elause that is under discussion.,107
340,Mr MCLEOD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It has been stated thai the Government has no concern for ex-servicemen, and statements made as long is ago as 1944 were used against the Minister. I shall refer to something that occurred prior to 1944 when the Labour party was fighting for improved conditions for ex-servicemen. Had it not been for this Government much of the present beneficial legislation would not be on the statute-book. It was this Government which removed the "" onus of proof"" provision which had been included in legislation passed when the anti-Labour government was in power. Until the removal of that provision a man had to have a 16in. shell sticking out of the back of his neck before he could prove that he was entitled to a pension. I have seen men who were actually dying on their feet and had been unable to prove their entitlement to a war pension. The Opposition voted against the removal of that provision and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) was one of those who did so.",107
341,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I rise to order. The Standing Orders provide that an honourable member may ask that the words used by another honourable member be repeated. I ask the honourable member for Wannon to say what it was I voted against, as I did not distinguish his words - I was astounded to hear him say that",108
342,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,- The honourable gentleman has not raised a point of orcier.,108
343,Mr MCLEOD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I said that the honourable member for Balaclava voted against the removal of the "" onus of proof "" provision. I have always taken any opportunity to help ex-servicemen, 80 per cent, of whom are workers whom the Government claims to represent. I warn returned soldiers that this legislation soon be removed from the statute-book if the Labour Government is defeated. At present an ex-serviceman is permitted to receive a payment from a friendly society of £ 1 a week and a pension of £1 a week. Honourable members opposite have tried to make some capital out of ex-servicemen, but let them examine their own murky past in respect of their attitude to ex-servicemen. I have not words strong enough to tell honourable members opposite my opinion of their record. While honourable menibers opposite were in office before the last war, they were more concerned about getting the last ounce of interest out of ex-servicemen. On many occasions. I have met men on the roads asking for jobs and I have had to tell thern that I had no job to give them because of the necessity to pay interest. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [12.37 a.m.] - As a rule I do not speak on matters concerning soldiers as there are so many honourable members who have a more intimate knowledge of such matters. The matter now being debated, however, is one about which I have felt very strongly ever since the experiences of a man in the district in which I live came to my notice. He was an ex-serviceman who became ill and was admitted to hospital. He applied for and received the sickness benefit, but while he was in hospital a decision was given on an appea! concerning his pension. As a result of that decision his pension was increased. When he was discharged from hospital he received a bill from the Department of Social Services for a few shillings that he had been overpaid. I hardly believed that such a thing could be possible until I heard the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) speak to-night, and there was no question of injustice to ex-servicemen as against any one else. The whole question revolves around the exact meaning of ""war pension"". A war pension is a compensation, or an attempt at compensation, for a disability incurred by the recipient on behalf of the people of Australia. It can never be complete compensation for a disability. Could any man ever be repaid for the loss of an arm or be replaced, by a payment of will a sum of money, on exactly the footing he would have occupied had he not lost his arm? He did not suffer his disability merely through an accident in industry, but because he went out into the field of battle either as a volunteer or at the behest of the Government. To pretend for a moment that that cau be placed on the same basis as any other kind of pension or compensation payment is sheet nonsense; indeed, it is utter hypocrisy. Any one who deludes himself into believing that that is so is false to all the decent instincts of most people. I wa surprised to hear the honourable meinber for Wannon (Mr MCLeod) say what he did. Honourable members on this side of the chamber have felt particularly sympathetic towards supporters of the Government who believe in doing justice to ex-servicemen and have spoken in favour of proposals similar to the present one. On prior occasions no vote was taken, and in this debate, which involves so much real sentiment and feeling, I should not have referred to any individual supporter of the Government, because I do not regard that as a decent way of conducting a debate. However, after listening to the honourable member for Wannon, I consider that the matter must be discussed. Until the honourable member spoke members on this side of the chamber were under the impression that the Government's attitude was simply the result of a cabinet decision, but the honourable gentleman implies that the decision was made by caucus. L appeal to those members of the Australian Labour party, who supported uur proposal in caucus, in fairness to themselves, to stand up now and explain their position - They should do that, not only to make their position perfectly - dear to the House, but also to enable the ex-servicemen of the country to know where they stand. I assume that they recognize the justice of the claim of service pensioners, and they should support the proposed amendment.",108
344,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Balaclava) [12.42 a.m.]. - I should not have spoken again but for Lhe wild and rambling utterance of the iionorable member for Wannon (Mr. MCLeod). The only question to be decided by the committee now is whether the anomaly disclosed in this clause should .be rectified. Honourable members - m this side of the chamber have brought the anomaly to the notice of the committee on previous occasions, and the Government gave some kind of undertaking that it would be removed. To-night the honourable meinber for Wannon alleged that when the matter was before the Parliament in 1943, I opposed the principle of casting the onus of proof upon rhe Eepatriation Commission. I point .'int to him that at that time. I was serving overseas with the Royal Australian Air Force. I support now, as I have always done, the principle that the burden of proof should lie upon the Eepatriation Commission. My views on the subject are well known, and I mention them nowonly to correct the mistatements of the honourable member, which will be reported in Hansard. He was hard-pressed to make out any sort of case, and. he resorted to making assertions which he Cannot substantiate. The dumb show made by the Minister for Eepatriation (Mr. Barnard) falls in the same category as rhe remarks of the honourable member for Wannon. Is the Government now prepared to correct an anomaly which it admitted in 1943 needed rectification. The proposal contained in this clause will have a very direct bearing on the happiness of many people. I said before that I did not want to embarrass supporters of the Government who have previously expressed themselves with considerable feeling in regard to this matter. No honourable member on this side of the chamber is seeking to gain political credit by supporting the proposed amendment; all thai, we desire is to rectify an injustice. The Government can promise now to rectify the matter, and consideration of the clause can be postponed. My impression is that caucus did not properly consider this matter, and that Cabinet unexpectedly rejected the proposal which had previously been supported by some honourable members opposite and is again supported by members of the Opposition. The matter is not one of major importance tc the whole community, but it is of importance to those who will be affected by it, and I appeal to supporters of the Government to reconsider the matter in caucus and submit their recommendation to the Cabinet for reconsideration by thai body.",109
345,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Swan) [12.45 a.m.]. - I rise to correct what I believe to be a misconception by the Minister for Eepatriation (Mr Barnard), who stated that when the present clause was drafted every consideration was given to ex-servicemen. Eeceipt of a war pension by an gx-serviceman simply places him on a level with - a civilian when he is seeking a job in the labour market, so that no special consideration will be extended to ex-servicemen if the proposed amendment be adopted. The reason why I spoke on the matter last year, and why I have raised it on this occasion, is that the Government has not honoured the promise which it gave twelve months ago. The ex-serviceman on whose behalf I spoke on that occasion was discharged from the armed forces suffering from arthritis of the feet. He was paid a weekly pension of 24s. 6d., which is higher than a 40 per cent, pension. He was forced into unemployment because he could not continue working but had to rest. He did not enter the Eepatriation General Hospital at Hollywood because there was no occasion for him to enter hospital at all. His condition was such that he could not work, and he was paid unemployment allowance during the period he was unable to work. Later he attempted to work, biit the artbritis from wbicb be suffered affected his legs and eventually his hips were affected. The terrible feature of his case is that after he resumed work he received a notification from the Department of Social Services rhat since he received a pension of 24s. 6d. a week and had drawn the maximum unemployment pension during the time he was unemployed he had been overpaid. The notification also informed him that the department had instructed the Repatriation Commission in Perth to deduct instalments from his war pension until the overpayment was repaid. The Repatriation Commission had to carry out a job which it did not relish, simply because the ex-serviceman had been paid more than he was entitled to receive under the act. I prefer that the matter should not be discussed on a party political basis. Indeed, I did not mention it to-night when Government supporters opposed the amendment which I have moved. I had an opportunity to mention this matter during the budget debate, but I did not desire to embarrass individual supporters of the Government. However, the clause now under consideration may have far-reaching effects, and it is my duty to put the case of ex-servicemen who are receiving a pension of more than 40 per cent. Those who receive less are not affected, and that is why I now do so.",109
346,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Bass-Minister for Repatriation) [12.49 a.m.] - I should not have risen a second time but for the case mentioned by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton),110
347,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,I can furnish name of the ex-serviceman concerned.,110
348,Mr BARN AHD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"I shall be glad to have his name, but not at the present moment. The honourable member reParramatta ferred to an ex-serviceman who was to name him. suffering from arthritis of the feet when he was discharged from the armed forces. He was given a pension of 24s. 6d. week. Because of his disability he was compelled to cease work and he applied for and was granted unemployment which benefit. The official who handled his case, whoever he was, handled it badly. The nature of the complaint from which rhe ex-serviceman was suffering at time of his discharge from the services obviously entitled him to admission to the Repatriation General Hospital at Hollywood. If he had entered that hospital",110
349,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Bu the did not.,110
350,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"That was because he - was badly advised. The honourable member is trying to connect that case with his argument that the proposed amendment should be accepted. I poini out to him, however, that his contention is ill-founded, because the ex-serviceman was entitled to admission to the Repatriation Hospital at Hollywood, and had he gone there he would have received a pension, not of 24s. 6d. a week, but at the maximum rate of 100 per cenl. It is not a matter of only a £1 a week, but a rise from 24s. to £2 10s. Instead of the arthritis travelling up his leg, it may be that with proper attention the arthritis could have been checked and he would have been able to go back to work earlier. Whatever merit there may be in that claim, I contend that the case submitted by the honourable gentleman is not well founded. This former soldier was badly advised. Whoever advised him deprived him, by wrong advice, of the benefit to which he was entitled as a returned soldier, not of another £1, but of trea tin ent in the first place, and of 100 per cent, benefit while he was sick",110
351,Mr BEALE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Bu the could not work.,110
352,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,If I may say so. the honourable gentleman does not know anything about this matter. I have been studying it for quite a while. the Mr BEALE - But the man was not able to work.,110
353,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Order! If the honourable member for does not behave I shall have,110
354,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"In this case the Department of Social Services quite proa perly asked for a refund of the amount that the beneficiary was overpaid. The former soldier did not get the benefits to he was entitled under the Repatriation Act.. Had he gone into hospital and received treatment, no question of a refund would have arisen. If the honour the able member for Swan has stated the ease exactly as it happened, this former soldier was entitled to the benefits I have outlined. I think that the honourable member admits that. If that is the basis of the case that he is presenting to the - diamber to justify an amendment of this - ection, then his case is not well founded.",110
355,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,Does the Minister rer quire more evidence?,111
356,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"If the honourable gentleman wishes to get these matters rectified, I remind him that my office door is always open to him. I like to deal with individual cases personally. They are not rectified by bringing them forward in this chamber. I have never refused to see anybody, nor have I declined to have a case examined on its merits. This applies equally to members of the Australian Labour party, and to Opposition members. No honourable member can say that I have not accepted facts presented to me and examined specific cases willingly. The case for the amendment has been presented on eutirely false premises. Whilst [do not want to detain honourable members unduly in connection with this matter, I wish to correct one statement made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). If I heard her correctly, she suggested that caucus had not considered this matter. When I was speaking earlier I said that this matter had been very fully considered by Oabinet, and also by caucuSj and that both Cabinet and caucus had decided it in the light of the fact that the Government had provided-unemployment benefits for people who were out of work. This is something that did not arise when honourable members opposite comprised the Government, because at that time nothing was provided for returned soldiers or anybody else",111
357,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Yes , there was.",111
358,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"There was no provision for unemployed persons when the honourable member was in the Government except that made by some of the States. At that time. I saw many men, who were seeking jobs in order to earn money to keep theirwives and families, led by turned soldiers. The honourable memher cannot deny that, because it is true. One tnass demonstration was led by a son of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes).",111
359,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SEEVICES,What has that to do with the amendment?,111
360,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"It has a lot to do with it. This Government has provided something for people who are out of work. It is a very good system because every unemployed man who registers is entitled to 253. a week for himself, a further 20s. for his wife if he is married, and 5s. for the first child, a total of £2 10s. a week. That is his right. The only qualification is that he must be out of work. I know that the honourable gentleman does not like this, but we say to the people who are out of work and who register "" Y o u can have an income of £2 a week before anything is held against you, whether you be a returned serviceman or a civilian"". That has been done for all sections of the. community by this Government. Had it not been for that provision,, this question would not arise at all. We say to the people in general that whether they are ex-service personnel or not, we will give them something if they are out of work. If the honourable member for Swan bases his case on the experiences of this particular ex-soldier, I say that his premises are false, and that the case is wrongly based.",111
361,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,But it happened.,111
362,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Yes , because the man was badly advised. There are any number of men in the community who could have given him some advice on such a matter.",111
363,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,The Minister should see my correspondence in the matter.,111
364,Mr BARNARD,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"If the honourable memher bases his case on those premises, it is worse than. I thought.",111
365,Mr BLAIN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Northern Territory) [1 a.m.] - I rise to express the obvious. I think we might look upon it as axiomatic that there is no need to do anything unless there is a special reason for it. I was under the impression that it was obvious to re- other Australians, and particularly to the members of the Government, that this concession should be granted to a wounded soldier, and particularly to one who had lost a limb. To my amazement, however, I find that war pensions payable to ex-servicemen who have lost a limb, or suffer some disablement, are taken into consideration when assessing their eligibility for unemployment and sickness benefits, and may, in some instances, debar them from receiving such benefits, ft is shocking to think that such a thing could happen. The Minister has admitted that the matter goes back to caucus, but [ say it goes still further. I say it goes back to the pressure groups outside Parliament, which the Minister has not the intestinal fortitude to resist. The Minister refuses to accept the amendment hecause of the pressure brought to bear upon him, but if his heart were articulate, he would confess that he really agrees with the Opposition. However, I ask the Minister for Transport (Mr. Ward) whether he, too, agrees with the Opposition on this matter. The question of preference to ex-servicemen is involved. When I was on Moratai Island, [ read in a volume of Hansard a most remarkable speech by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) on the subject of preference to ex-servicemen. I also read the miserable exposition of the Minister for Transport. His attitude was that work would be provided for all, but that there would be no preference to ex-servicemen. The pressure from outside was too great. The attitude of the Government to this amendment is dictated by pressure from the Australian Council of Trades Unions. I know that I am right in saying that, because of the shamed-faced attitude of Government supporters. Very few of them have risen to defend the stand taken by the Government. Last year, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Edmonds) was guilty of a faux pas in defending the rights of returned soldiers, but although he was challenged to-night by another prisoner of war, the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), to state his attitude, he has refrained from doing so. When this subject was discussed in the prison camps, I told my comrades that we could never hope for preference from this Government, but that when men returned they ought to be placed in the position that they would have occupied if they had never gone [54] away, [t is a disgrace that any government professing to have an Australian outlook should bring forward a measure of this kind. The amendment should be accepted. No ex-serviceman should be placed at a disadvantage because of the injuries that he received on service.",111
366,Mr FRANCIS,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"Moreton) [1.7 a.m.]. - I make a final appeal to the Government to reconsider its attitude to the amendment. At all times, the pension of a disabled serviceman has been regarded in the light of compensation for his war disability. It has been sacrosanct. It has been inalienable and unattachable, it cannot be garnisheed by any court. It is not regarded as income for taxation purposes. This is the first time that any government has grabbed at ex-servicemen's pensions, and it is a despicable act. The Minister - for Repatriation (Mr. Barnard) said that this legislation would not place the disabled ex-serviceman at a disadvantage when compared with any one else. I remind him that it will place the disabled ex-serviceman at a disadvantage when compared with a man who was not disabled. The serviceman's pension has been fixed by the Repatriation Department or by an appeal tribunal, yet the Government is grabbing at it in a way which the courts have refused to do, and which even the avaricious tax-gatherer cannot do. The debate ou this subject has been conducted in a temperate manner, but the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) entered the chamber and declared that no amendments to the bill would be accepted, although he did not know the purpose of the amendments which might be moved - He instructed caucus that it would not be allowed to do the fair thing by ex-servicemen. When this subject was discussed in 1947, some members on the opposite side said that it had not been considered by caucus. To-night, the Minister admitted that it had been before caucus, so that caucus must accept responsibility for the present attitude of the Government. Any government that breaks such well-founded traditions as are at issue in this matter will have a lot for which to answer. The Minister for Repatriation said that the soldier to whom the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) referred had beeu badly advised. My only reply to the Minister is that before measure dealing with repatriation is introduced, he should table the report of No. 1 Entitlement Tribunal. I repeat that up till now the war pension has been considered, absolutely sacrosanct. I again appeal to the Government to honour that tradition. If it persists in its refusal to accept the amendment it will do a great disservice to the country as a whole.

367,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Trans-Australia Airlines Convair aircraft, which recently 23 arrived in Australia, has been or is at present grounded ? .. 31 2. If so, has this action been taken to enable the stiffeners inside the wing tanks to he 8 strengthened ? -'t. If so, who ordered this alteration to the AYES. machine? .1 - I. Was this alteration necessitated because of faulty designing? ii,. Did the Australian National Airlines Conimission send experts to the United States of America to ensure that these aircraft were suitable for Australian conditions before they were taken over by the Commonwealth? li. If so, wil}' were not these improvements inn.de before Trans-Australia Airlines accepted delivery of the aircraft? 7. Why did the Department of Civil Aviation allow the machine to be flown to and in NOES. Australia before the alteration was made? S. Do thu remainder of the Convair aircraft purchased by Trans-Australia Airlines require similar alterations? fl. If so, will he issue instructions that these aircraft must not be flown to or in Australia before such improvements are made?",113
368,Mr DRAKEFORO,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No. The Trans-Australia Airlines Convair aircraft is flying on a programme of crew training and route familiarization prior to its introduction on scheduled services. Certain modifications found desirable as a result of experience of operation of Convairs in the PAIRS. United States of America have been brought to the notice of Trans-Australia Airlines and it was decided to embody these before putting the aircraft into regular passenger service. 2. Modifications of a secondary nature were made and consisted of detail improvements in rib attachments witliin the fuel tank area. 3. Trans-Australia Airlines decided to carrv out the work on the advice of the manufacturers. 4. So. The alterations were made to effect improvements. It has teen found with all types of aircraft that modifications are suggested by operational experience. 5. Yes. 6 and 7. The aircraft, holds u Uuited States Certificate of Airworthiness for Export issued prior to leaving the UDited States of America. The desirability of the modification became apparent since the arrival of Trans-Australia Airlines' first Convair in Australia. 8 and 9. The second and third of the Convairs on order for Trans-Australia Airlines left San Dfego with these changes already incorporated, on Sunday, the 10th October, and are now en route to Australia. The fourth and fifth aircraft will be similarly modified. It is not unusual for small modifications to be found desirable to any type of aeroplane as the result of operating experience. This hag been the case with all well-Known types of aircraft now in service, and such modifications still arise even after many years of service hy reason of the added experience gained in the industry. BERLIN CRISIS.",113
369,Mr CHIFLKY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"On the Slst September the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) asked whether further assistance eould be given to augment the airlift of supplies to Berlin. TheMinister for Air has informed me that the matter has heen examined and that it is not at present intended to make any arrangements to despatch further Royal Australian Air Force aircrews overseas to assist the Berlin airlifts. Wran NETTING.  honorablo member for Flinders (Mr. Kyan) asked whether if. is a fact that wire netting is being imported from Japan for primary producers ? If so, what quantity is to be imported and what is the approximate price at which it will be sold ? Tho Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:On the 27th .August, 1948, approval was - jiven for the issue of a licence for the tion of Woi tout, of wire netting of Japanese origin. The c.i.f. & e. price of this wire is approximately 100 per cent, above the mill selling price of available supplies of local manufacture, but below prices quoted by other nvcrseas suppliers, e.g., Belgium and the United States of America. The selling price to the user is not yet known buf it is reasonable to expect that it will approximate double the l>rice of locally made wire netting.",114
370,Mr DEDMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"On the Sth October, the honourable memher for ""Wilmot (Mr . Duthie) asked a question concerning the shortage of sugar for the Midland Districts of Tasmania. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel has supplied the follbwing mformation, regarding sugar shipments to Tasmania. The honourable member mentioned shipments of sugar to Launceston but it is understood that sugar for Midland Districts is usually supplied from Hobart, The following shipments from Sydney bave been made. The vessel Karuah sailed on the 7th October for Launceston and had on board 500 tons of sugmwhich it is understood is to be railed from Launceston to Hobart. The vessel Talune with 750 tons of sugar departed from Sydney on the Sth October an'd arrived at Hobart on the llth. The Colonial'Sugar Kenning Company Limited has notified that it will be able to make 1,500 tons of sugar available for Tasmania and the Anstralian Shipping Board iind the Central Traffic Committee are at present endeavouring to fix a special vessel to load this sugar at Sydney together with other cargo. The honourable member may be assured that the commercial companies engaged in the Tasmanian trades and the Australian Shipping Board which ie co-operating with them to supplement their tonnage arc desirous of maintaining regular services and are working to achieve this objective. It is essential that ships be run fully loaded to ensure that thexc arc used to their best capacity. This factor militates against complete regularity being obtained. Additional factors such as the bad weather at present being experienced,, congestion in ports and other matters not under the control of shipping operators are encountered from, time to time. Nevertheless there are frequent and it is considered, sufficient Tasumnian fixtures to meet Tasmanian needs generally. It is frequently found of course that supply and not shipping is respon-' sible for temporary shortage; nf goods at particular pliices. SHIPPING : TRANSPORT OF - STEEL PRODUCTS ; PROPOSED GOVERNMENT LINE.",114
371,Mr DEDMAN,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"On the 8th October, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr . importaHutchinson) asked a question concerning the delay in the shipment of steel products netting from Newcastle to ""Victoria. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel has supplied the following information:From various causes there has been an . accumulation of steel products at Newcastle and Port Kembla which the Central Traffic Committee (on which the Australian Shipping Board is represented) has been doing its best to lif t with the facilities available. One of the SuOAE. factors, contributing to the difficulty is shortage of labour, both at Newcastle and Fort Kembla, and at the ports through which the vessels tn load at Newcastle and Port Kembla must pass. This tabouu shortage, is nots. peculiar' to thewaterfront but: will be found at present in. industries throughout Australia. A special' examination of the labour position at ports principally involved has been initiated at. my direction and it. is expected, that, this action will result in the position, being relieved,. In the meantime the Central Traffic Committee iti continuing to allocate as much tonnage as can be worked and during the last two weeks tue backlag of steel' products at Newcastle and Port Kembla has-been reduccd by over 15,000 tons. The honourable member may rest assured that the necessity of transporting steel products is appreciatedby the Government and' close attentionis beinggiven to the position, in. collaboration with all participating agencies and authorities.",114
372,Mr CIUSXEY,SOCIAL SEEVICES,"On the 22nd September, the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) asked, a question regarding the establishment of a Commonwealth, shipping; line. Further to my oral reply on that date' I now inform the honourable member as follows: The Government's proposals in. regard to the setting up of a Commonwealth line of steamers and generally to carry out the Government's plans for the future of the shipping, and ship-building industrieshave now reached an. advanced stage, but. have not yet received, final consideration by the Government.. It is expected that, the draft bill will be completed in the near future, and.it is hoped that it will be possible, tb introduce this legislation, into Parliament at. an early date. It. is proposed to set up a board to.be known as the. Australian Shipping Board, with, the power to operate, shipping services bothon the Australian coast aud in tliu overseas trades. The board would be empowered to carry on the general business, of ship-owner and in addition have such, ancillary powers as may be necessary. The legislation is not intended to prevent the operation of commercially-owned shipping lines on the Australian coast. The Government intends to place the Australian Shipping Board, BS far as possible, in the same position as a private company operating ships, and the various acts, e.g., the Navigation Act, Customs Act, Wireless. Telegraphy Act, &c„ which are applicable to private ship-owners will apply in like manner to the Australian Shipping Board. The board will be given no powers of control over shipping services conducted by the. private shipping companies. In addition to providing for the setting up of a board to operate the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, it is proposed that the legislation wili contain provisions designed to foster the shipping and ship-building industries of the Commonwealth.
