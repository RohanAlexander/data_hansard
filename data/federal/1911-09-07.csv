7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ask, Mr Speaker, whether the Minister is not abusing the right to answer questions? Instead of replying to the question put to him, he expressly states that he is answering something said in a debate.

9,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Majo r Wynne applied in the early part of 1910 for permission to ; in take a contingent of cadets to the Old to Country, and suggested that the Governshould give £ 1 for £ 1 raised by to public subscription. This the Minister declined to do, but subsequently it was arranged to grant leave of absence to selected officers, non-commissioned offiand cadets. The issue on loan of arms and equipment, the issue of camp equipment during camp before embarkation, and the services of two nonofficers to assist at the precamp were also arranged. Major Wynne was informed that the Government accept no financial responsibility in connection with the visit. Before the emthe Acting Minister had a cable to the High Commissioner asking him to bring the matter of barrack accommodaunder the notice of Senator Pearce on his arrival in London. Senator Pearce, m whilst in England, asked the High Commissioner's military adviser, Major Buckley, to see that accommodation was provided, and he was informed that it was provided. He wrote a personal letter to Lord Haldane. the Secretary of State for War, asking that the cadets should be given a on the line of the procession, and if was promised that this should be done, and other facilities would be arranged for. disSenator Pearce went to meet the cadets on their arrival in London. But when Major Wvnne cabled to the War Office direct as Commanding Commonwealth Coronation Contingent, and the War Office Asked Senator Pearce if it had been decided to alter the previous decision ing the sending of Australian troops to England, he replied "" No.""",13

GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ling ADDRESS-IN-REPLY. Debate resumed from 6th September (vide page 155), on motion by BRENNANThat the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the 'House.  [2.47] - On e has to be prepared for many surprises in approaching this session after our long recess. Adequate mention has been made during this debate of the gloom cast over the House by the passing away of two comrades whom we all esteemed. We have had full proof that those gentleplacing men have been replaced by very vigorous members. The striking feature of the bate so far as it has gone has been the method of attack adopted by the Opposithat tion. I received a great surprise when listena ing yesterday, as I always do with a certain amount of pleasure, to the able painting word pictures by the Leader of the Oppofrom sition. When the honourable member set a nice straw bogy and christened it "" loyalty,"" I wondered for some time what he was getting at. It seemed to me that the out any frothing at the mouth. long recess had been leading the honourable member into indulgence in bad dreams jim-jams, and that he had come to the ported House without the effects of his nightmares being quite cleared from his mind, but when the honourable member for ney followed in a similar strain, bombarding the House for two and a half hours on the same subject, I began to see a little no such innuendo. daylight through the position of the Opposition. It seems that the administration the present Government has been sufficiently to obviate anything like severe criticism from the Opposition. There has been outrageous in the conduct of the Government, nothing to'which the direct atpostention of the people, or with which to taken awake the enthusiasm of the anti-Labour four daily press. Why, the Labour Governare ment have actually got through as well as the past Governments have done. We are still bere, Australia is actually solvent, there is no ruination, everything is jogging along beautifully, and all this in face of the fact that those horrible Labour people are sitting on the Government benches.",15
22,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Australi a is so prosperimmious now that the Labour party could not years ended destroy it if they tried.,15
23,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Jus t imagine a country being prosperous under Labour government! That is really the most startadmission yet made by an Opposition We have been led to believe ever since the Labour party came into existence that, Mr once it got on to the Government benches, there would be nothing but "" blue ruin "" for the country. We were further given to understand that ordinary "" common or garden "" representatives of the classes could not possibly successfully carry the honours of office at an Imperial Conference. All the same, we have had a delegation consisting of a Labour Prime Minister with his colleagues representing us at such a Conference, and accurately* carefully, and without a spice of Jingoism, before those who direct the affairs of the Empire the views of the Ausdetralian people on defence. And our Ministers have come back with the information the proposals submitted by them orr previous occasion have been adopted by the Admiralty as the basis of the Ausof tralian Navy. I have no desire to detract the proposals or efforts of honourable up gentlemen opposite, but I think we may disclaim that we have approached this question in a solid common-sense way, withTbe Leader of the Opposition yesterday beat or round the bush, and, by innuendo, supthe allegation that there is a certain spirit of disloyalty within a section of this Parliament. Such an attitude is unworthy North Sydof the honourable gentleman.",15
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition expressly said that he conveyed,15
25,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I challenge of the honourable member for Parramatta to look at the utterapces of the Leader of the Opposition, ancl say that they were not full of this innuendo, "" Let the galled jade wince,"" and so forth. am pleased, of course,- that the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for North Sydney have given the cue to the attitude of the Opposition. We now have a distinct pledge from a party, the members of which are prepared to '' Mafeking '' the whole time-to protest ancl protest again their great loyalty. We know what Shakespeare saysMethinks the lady doth protest too much, and we have all heard the advice that when a man brags of his honesty it is time to keep our hands in our pockets. Who can doubt for one instant the loyalty of any man who realizes the benefit conferred on us by our present political system? I challenge any honourable member opposite to say that, in any shape or form, the Government have been disloyal. As the discussion proceeded yesterday we very soon found the kernel of the matter. It was put to us that we are behind the movement of men who desire to meet force with force if occasion requires. I am well aware that there is a number of our comrades^ followers and fellow-workersand we are always proud to acknowledge them as fellow-workers, notwithstanding the attitude of the honourable member for North Sydney and others-wh o hold the opinion that militarism in no shape or form should not be allowed to take any hold in Australia. We are quite prepared to accept the honourable member's quotations as facts; but we have had all these protestations before. During the whole of the time that the defence proposals have been in drafting, there has been this crossfiring from sections of the community; and I am rather pleased that the replies of Senator MCGregor, and the resolutions on the subject, have emphasized the fact that a nation armed is a nation that can guard itself either internally or externally. If we put a rifle into every man's hands we cannot anticipate a repetition of history-w e cannot think of the military being called out to, in brutal fashion, to shoot down unarmed citizens. There is every reason why we, as liberty-loving citizens, should wish to see every man carrying his rifle, because when the day comes to make a demonstration the citizens will be able to come out on parade and make it peaceably.",15
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is not what takes place in conscription countries. Mr Frank Foster.,16
27,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"This is not a conscription country, and I do not believe I that the honourable member infers that it is. There is tremendous difference between conscription, under which men are taken for years from their ordinary walks of life, and such a system as is proposed here.",16
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If we put a rifle into the hand of every man, how can we shoot down the unarmed?",16
29,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I said that if there were a rifle in every man's hand the unarmed could not be shot down, simply because there would be no unarmed. I have no desire for a repetition in Australia of the shooting down by a hired military of unarmed citizens.",16
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,What the honourable member means is that we could not shoot down the unarmed citizens because the unarmed citizens would be armed !,16
31,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Apparently we are being overwhelmed with advice on military matters from the other side. Yesterday we listened to a speech for two hours and a half from the honourable member for North Sydney, and now we are being told more of the same kind of nonsense. I may say, with all modesty, however, that I am quite prepared to uphold my own ideas on the question without advice from the other side. The honourable member for North Sydney, who was so lavish with his advice, was so sure on the question that he was not satisfied with present-day history. Neither the Lithgow nor the Liverpool strike, nor any trouble of that kind, was of any use to him. He had to go to far-off India, and to declare that one Keir Hardie, a member of the Labour movement, and of the British House of Commons, had preached sedition there, with the result that there was likely to be trouble in that land. Despite what may be said to the contrary by the Press, I wish ""to give that statement an emphatic denial. I am in a position to do so since I asked Mr Keir Hardie to give me all particulars in regard to this very matter. In his reply he told me that, as we all know, an agitation has been going on in India for many years. The natives are becoming educated, and many of them wince under British rule. Rightly or wrongly, they feel that British rule in India is irksome, and who will say that the administration there is perfect? I am not going to say that it is. At the same time. I recognise that the British Government have a very difficult problem to face in India, and in retaining possession of it, and I am prepared to admit that many items of administration which would appear very harsh in a country like Australia may be quite unavoidable in India. The peoples of that country-and they are many-hav e their own papers, printed in their own dialects, circulating in every direction, and those who have read the history of those peoples know 'that they have a very great reverence for any man who poses as a prophet. Consequently when it was announced in the native Press that Mr Keir Hardie was about to visit ; India, that he was practically a saviour of the people, that he advocated the cause of the down-trodden, the helpless, the weak, the invalid, and the poor, the people, given as they are to hero-worship, rushed the railway station at which Mr. Keir Hardie vvas to take train for the try districts. The news of his coming went in advance of him. For some time prior to his arrival a great drought had prevailed, and there was a famine in the land. Just as he reached India, however, the drought commenced to break, and, strange to say, as he travelled from district to district, the welcome rain seemed to travel with him. The natives in this way came to entertain the idea that he was a prophet, and had something to do with the downpour. Here, indeed, was a saviour of the people come from Great Britain to India, and with his coming there was a glorious downfall of the welcome rain! Naturally the people were worked up to a high pitch of excitement, and they flocked in tens of thousands to the railway stations through which his train passed. Indeed, so great were the crowds that Mr. Keir Hardie had at last to keep his movements secret. He did not address the natives except to say a few words. He made no special tour of India, and yet the honourable member has told us that Mr Keir Hardie, a member of the British Parliament, preached sedition in India. I have entered into these details only to show how ridiculous is the foundation on which honourable members opposite build up straw bogies simply to knock them down again. It was not enough that the Leader of the Opposition should build up the bogy of probable disloyalty; the honourable member felt that he must go one better. He suggested a principle which I am ashamed to find any Australian advocating. He told us that this Parliament ought not to have the right of determining whether or not the Australian Army should be placed at the disposal of the British Government. Our Parliament, according to him, is not to be trusted with the control of either the army or the navy. Such a thing is so unthinkable, so inconceivable, from the Australian stand-point that I can hardly understand an honourable member in his full senses giving expression to it. Not only have we always taken up the stand to which the honourable member objects, but some honourable members opposite have also done so. This Parliament, as a Parliament, has stood up for this right, and I trust that the day will never come when we shall relinquish that attitude with regard to either the army or the navy of the Commonwealth. Jingoism run mad may seem a very excellent thing, but the representatives of counthose who have to pay the taxes to provide the cost of our naval and military system and to do the fighting should at least have a voice in determining where the expenditure shall be made and as to what generally ought to be done - Another laughable statement made by the honourable member for North Sydney was that the Labour party had been dragooned into the acceptance of compulsory military training. The honourable member said he was astonished that we had adopted it, and expressed the opinion that we had probably been dragooned into it by the Attorney-General. His statement serves only to show his ignorance of the procedure of our party. I can forgive-in fact, I can sympathize withhim, since I understand that he disowns the principle of the caucus, and upholds the right of the Leader of the Opposition to lay down a policy and to dragoon every member of his party into supporting it. Such a thing has never happened in the history of our party, and I should like to know what member of the Labour Government would dare to try to dragoon the Labour party into supporting a policy of which they did not approve. Such a thing has never happened, and I hope it never will. Every honourable member on this side of the House has a voice in determining the policy of the Government, so that when we go to the constituencies we are able to say that we have all shared in the making of the laws passed while our Administration was in power. We are not in the painful position of honourable members of the Opposition, who have to accept the administration of this man or that and to stand or fall by it regardless of whether or not they have had a hand in determining it. The whole of our party has a voice in the work of building up the system of laws that we wish to see placed on the statute-book. At the same time, it is only fair to say that the Labour Government are "" oysters "" as far as Cabinet secrets, which they have no right to disclose, are concerned. I do not think a member of our party would even dream of asking a Minister to disclose secrets that ought not to be divulged. We fully recognise that in every Administration there must be secrets known only to the Cabinet, and not one of us would insult a Minister by asking him to divulge any of them. If any of us did so, we know what the reply would be. I was rather surprised to hear certain allusions made to the cost of sending the delegation of honourable members to England to take part in the Coronation celebrations. We were told first of all that members of the Labour party were the meanest people on earth, because they declined to plunge into the heavy expenditure that would have been involved in sending to England a contingent of cadets, and also a contingent of soldiery, and then we were criticised because the Prime Minister and two of his colleagues went Home at the public cost. Surely that is not playing the game fairly. Has not a similar procedure been adopted by other Ministries? Have not members of other Administrations gone Home and stayed as long as it was necessary for them to* remain there? Investigation shows that the first delegate sent to England by the Australian Parliament-Si r Edmund Bartonrequired £1,850 to defray his expenses. We did not demur at that expenditure. I am not advocating for a moment that unnecessary expenditure should be incurred; but I hold that when it is necessary for public men to go and represent Australia at these conferences we should not take up a mean attitude.",16
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Minister who went with Sir Edmund Bartonspent,18
33,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Was it only £[450 ? I do not wish to labour this matter at all, but I want to state in passing that ture. this sort of criticism is extremely mean. It is a very unfair attitude for any one take up.",18
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is it unfair to inquire into the cost of things?,18
35,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,Not at all. What I refer to is not an inquirv but a sneering declaration made by the honourable member for North Sydney. Just a few more words in regard to his speech and I shall have done with him.,18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Can the honourable member tell us what the cost really was?,18
37,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I have not the exact figures, but I do know that the expenses of the Minister of Defence amounted to about £700. The honourable member no doubt will be able to get the figures if he asks for them. I have no objection to their production.",18
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is £ 2 0 0 more than Colonel Foxton got last year.,18
39,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I do expect that in these matters members of the Opposition will be fair, and always take into consideration the necessities of the position, because having had the administration of affairs in their hands, they know right well what these visits cost.",18
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member considers himself fair in defending a proposition which he evidently does not understand. He has told us so.,18
41,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,What is the proposition ?,18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member is defending the actions of Ministers, and yet says he does not know what they were, or how much they cost.",18
43,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I am not defending their actions at all, but I am contending that honourable members on the other side having had the administration of affairs in their hands, and their necessary expenditure not having been criticised, are rather mean in endeavouring to make capital by criticising necessary expenditure at the present moment. That is the attitude 1 take up.",18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Agai n the honourable member is assuming that it was necessary expenditure. Yet he says he does not know.,18
45,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,I know the men who went.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Oh , is that it?",18
47,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,I know that they are not so very fond of luxuries that they would rush into unnecessary expendi,18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Like a good party to man, the honourable member is backing his men right or wrong, eh?",18
49,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Is that the honourable member's stand as a party man? If so, I am rather pleased to hear it. fore passing away from the honourable member for North Sydney, whom I am pleased to see here- I did not wish to be severe upon him in his absence-ther e is one point on which I desire to say a few words.",18
50,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,Le t me tell the honourable member that he has misrepresented me.,19
51,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,I am very sorry indeed if I have done that.,19
52,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"I did not advocate giving the Imperial Government power to deal with our Army; I referred to the Navy, and not to the Army.",19
53,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I am not aware that I used the word "" Army."" ' ",19
54,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,The honourable member did so three times.,19
55,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,I meant the Navy.,19
56,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"The honourable member said distinctly "" Army and Navy.""",19
57,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,It is amusing to hear honourable members on the other side trying to get out of a situation by separating the Army and the Navy. Does the honourable member say that he would refuse to put our Army at the disposal of the British Empire?,19
58,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,Onl y in Australia-w e would not send them out of the country.,19
59,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,Would the honourable member refuse to put them at the disposal of the British Empire?,19
60,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,I would leave that to Parliament to deal with.,19
61,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I wish to be fair to the honourable member. I would not desire for one moment to misrepresent him. I protest most emphatically against either the Army or the Navy being removed from the control of this Parliament. One of the most remarkable utterances of the honourable member was that he would not think of fighting tyrants at Home-that he would not think of going out and defending the people against armies, and that he was astounded at the continual cry of this side for the worker, the worker, the worker. He suggested that we could see nobody else, and had no other sentiment. Now, whom do we class as the worker? Who are the people whom we are fighting for, and putting legislation through for? I have stated scores of times on platforms that we look upon the workers as the wealth-producers of the country. I refer to the miners, the farmers, the wage earners, the civil servants, and the legitithought Be- mate business men. Rut outside those persons there is a class of men who are trying to live on the workers the whole time, and who have been frequently referred to by writers as "" the criminal rich."" Although we may only have them here to a small degree, they have grown very numerous in the United States of America and we fear that when we do become as large a people they may grow as strong here as there. A great writer-Lloyd-in referring to this question, makes these remarks, which I think are worthy of some thought:The criminal rich-thos e who appropriate the labour of others in one age by brute strength, and in another by brute wealth-ar e today degrading competition into a rivalry of adulteration. The control of machinery of the exchanges is the control of prices, and control of prices is control of property. If you control the property of the people you control their lives. These are the kind of men whom we sought to bring to book at the referendum. We asked the people of Australia to take to themselves further powers, so that they might protect themselves from the brutal rich. We have no objection to any man becoming wealthy by his own labours;'' we have no objection to any man who succeeds by legitimate industry; but we have an objection to the brutality of those who, through the medium of tlieir wealth and power, seek to rob others of what is justly theirs. Honourable members on the other side will live to rue the day when they went from pillar to post throughout the Commonwealth and threw dust in the eyes of the people, asking them not to give themselves the power to protect themselves. That is practically what honourable members did, although they did not put their appeal in that way. They tried to make out that some foreign party, as it were, was seeking power. By the time the questions are again submitted, the people will know that it is they themselves who are to get the power to protect themselves through the Federal Parliament.",19
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And who is to give them the power?,19
63,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,The referendum.,19
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Will it give them more power than they have now?,19
65,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,Rathe r !,19
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will the ballot paper itself give them the power?,19
67,Mr FRANK ROSTER,Unknown,"I like to hear honourable members opposite shuffling on this question. They are still wild at the that, no matter what Government might occupy the Treasury bench, if our proposals were carried at a referendum, it would have the power to operate.",19
68,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,Brin g them on again.,20
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They are not game.,20
70,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Honourable members on this side feel very much like myself, that we must have justice for the people, the wealth-creators in this country, and that if there is no means of getting that justice except by amending the Constitution to give this Parliament the sary power, we must pursue that course; but we hope that, by the time the questions are again submitted, the people will have realized the fact that their enemies were those who prevented them before from getting this power to* assist themselves to the legislation which they require. blush for shame when I think-and I say it with regret-that it was assistance from our ranks which enabled honourable gentlemen opposite to defeat our proposals at the last referendum. Although five of the Labour parties in five of the States remained loyal, there were men in the party in another State who were not loyal.",20
71,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What State that ?,20
72,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"How innocent the honourable member is 1 Does he not know that every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth raised the cry that Mr Holman was against the referenda? Why was he against them ? Because he was disloyal to Labour? No. He was against them because he had joined honourable members opposite in the cry of "" State Rights."" I am prepared to believe that the good sense of Mr Holman and other members of his party will lead them to see that it is necessary to give to the Federal Parliament extended powers, because the State Parliaments cannot effectually exercise the powers that we desire to possess. How can representatives of the people in the State Parliaments do what is required when, as soon as they attempt to touch the sacred rights of entrenched property the dear old Upper Houses will be there to protect them ? The Upper Houses in the State Parliaments are so Tory that any advance whatever towards an alteration of the present system, or towards clipping the wings of the trusts, is blocked by them. That is why I wonder why Labour men who profess to believe in our great policy should appear to hesitate, as thousands of them did at the referenda, because of Mr Holman's attitude.",20
73,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Mr Holman did not influence other States than his own.,20
74,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Why , then, was he quoted in every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth?",20
75,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He was quoted in the Age every day.,20
76,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I wish to neces- put it to the people who desire to see Democracy triumphant in Australia that those who oppose the proposal to give greater powers to the Federal Parliament must know that what they aim at cannot be secured by the State Parliaments, because there the Upper Houses block every I advance. Indeed, even if the Upper Houses could be wiped out, the State Parliaments could only legislate within their own territories. Their laws would only run to their own boundaries, whereas Commonwealth law runs through the whole of Australia. It would be useless from the point of view of the people of Australia, as a whole, to clip the wings of an Upper House of any one State, and God forbid that that spirit should ever prevail in our was movement! I trust that the Labour movement will be as wide as the confines of Australia, that its principles will extend throughout the British Empire, and that they will ultimately permeate the world. Wherever there are brother human beings - whereve r there are men fighting for a cause that is right- I trust that our party will assist them to the extent of their power. It is a most contemptible, mean, petty, and parocfiial attitude to take up for any one to say, "" I am all right, let the rest go hang."" The matters affected by the referenda were of such serious importance that I believe that when the people of this country come to a full realization of the trick that was played upon them, when they know of the amount of wealth that was poured out against us in that campaign, when they learn that those who were concerned in trusts, pools, and combines rallied their forces behind our opponents, they will avenge themselves once for all by wiping out our political 8 enemies. That is what I think must happen. Wje are quite safe in trusting the people as a whole. The Jingoistic spirit to which the previous speaker appealed belongs, let me tell him, to the dead past. It no longer has any effect upon the people of this country. Indeed, if the honourable member were to attempt to incite Britisners in their own land by talk of that kind he would get even shorter shrift than awaits him in Australia. The people have got beyond that kind of thing. Nowadays we look to realities. And let us not forget while in connection with an event like the Coronation there may be a display of enormous wealth-of wealth so great, in fact, as to have a tremendous effect upon the people, and to be followed by terrific strikes-ther e are nevertheless millions in this Empire who require justice, and demand it, and look forward to the realization of their demands. I refer to the workers whose claims must be considered, l t is their cause that we, on our side, are proud to be fighting for. An honourable member near me interjects that they will soon assert themselves. God forbid that they should ever assert themselves by revoluMinister tion in any direction ! We want them to assert themselves through the ballot-box.. We do not want to have such revolution as the honourable member for Parkes preached. He said that if the voting at the referenda had been favourable to the Labour party there would have been revolution in Australia. We even pictured the honourable member himself riding through the streets, as a revoluthe tionary leader, in a comic uniform and waving a flag. Passing from these considerations I wish to thank the honourable member for North Sydney for laying his ideas on defence before us so frankly. We certainly know what his attitude is. We perceive that there is a direct cleavage. We understand that while we stand for all that is solid and straightforward there are other people in the community who stand for ail that is frothy and high sounding. I would urge the honourable member not to be too modest. Let us have his ideas on other subjects. He must have a great fund of knowledge on other political matters, and if he will only be as frank concerning them as he was on the question of defence we shall appreciate his speeches. T wish to get back to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition on the Tariff. I know that honourable members will give me credit for being an enthusiastic Protectionist, and I wish to say that the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter at the present time strikes me as rather peculiar,- in view of his knowledge of the whole history of the Tariff, and the promises which he has made in this House [7] from time to time in regard to new Protection. How could a Labour Minister face the people of Australia with a proposal for increased Protection in view of the result of the referenda, and the rethat fusal to grant to the workers their fair share of the benefits of Protection? The Leader of the Opposition suggests that the Minister of Trade and Customs should at once re-open the Tariff. That would be a grand thing to do at the present juncture when there is so much else to do. The Minister of Trade and Customs has in this matter taken up a rational attitude. He has told the manufacturers of Australia the information he requires, and they refuse to tell him what lie wishes to know. He issued to them a list of questions, which we are told are utterly outrageous and inquisitorial. I am very pleased that the has laid these questions before honourable members, and in glancing through them. I must say that JI have noticed none which might not be fairly answered by any straightforward business man. Manufacturers are guaranteed by letter that information supplied in the replies to the questions will be kept in the strictest confidence, and treated in the same way as confidential information acquired in ordinary administration of the Customs Department is treated. We know well that in the preparation of a Tariff confidential officers of the Customs Department are in the way of obtaining informa* tion which it would be very profitable to them to divulge. But we have no record that these officers have ever divulged such information at any time. It is then pure subterfuge to say, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that manufacturers refuse to have their business secrets exposed in the way proposed by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Manufacturers who come to the Government begging favours in the way of increased Protection for the industries in which they are engaged should be prepared to state the facts connected with those industries. I must admit that there may be some little difference in the stand-point from which, the questions submitted to the manufacturers are viewed. For instance, they are asked to say what capital is invested in their industry. Surely, from their point of view that is an outrage? Then they are asked to state the total value of the output of their factories. That is an awful question. Then they are asked what wages they are paying, ancl the total amount paid in wages. If such questions were correctly answered, it is possible that, after going through the replies, the Minister would have a shrewd idea as to whether a manufacturing establishment was making a little fortune for the proprietor or not. He might be able to say whether we are justified in maintaining so high a rate of Protection for the benefit of that industry. What a horrible thing it would be from the stand-point of those carrying on protected industries if the country were to get to know which industries were worth protecting and which were not. Viewing the matter from our stand-point we recognise that the public of Australia have to bear the burden of taxation. We are willing to justify the expenditure of a certain amount of capital in industries through encouragement afforded by a Tariff, but we claim that the public should share in the benefits derived from that encouragement, that the workers in the various industries should receive decent wages, and the consumers obtain the articles manufactured at reasonable prices. I should, for my part, like to see the proposals submitted at the referenda extended. I say that the day will come in Australia, and I hope it will be before very long, when a further power will be demanded for the Federal Parliament, and that is the power to nationalize distribution. Every day we live the fact is being forced upon us that if we raise wages, and better the conditions of workers, we have those in our midst who, by charging higher prices and higher rents, do away with the benefits ive hoped would follow from the increase of wages. The increases in rents and the cost of living are crying questions today. Rents' are going up by leaps and bounds. It is scandalous the way in which landlords in Sydney tell the people that rents are going up because of the land tax. Landlords who do not pay a farthing in land tax are making it the excuse for raising the rent of four-roomed cottages from ios. to 15s. a week. I feel so strongly upon this matter that I would support a resolution to nationalize all distribution in order that we might wipe out for ever the middleman, who is always so ready to take the earnings from the people, whether they are producers or wage-earners. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We want a fairrent court.",20
77,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"We want more than that, and we should not be afraid to go straight to the point. In America tOrday rents are so high, and the cost of living so great,' that the Americanpeople are on the verge of a revolution. We have only to go amongst the poor in Melbourne and Sydney, and other large cities of Aus- : tralia, to hear very deep rumblings of dis- : content from the same cause. Are we to sit idle and inept, unable to do anything to relieve the people from these burdens ? We tried our best in submitting the referenda proposals to take a step in the right direction, by securing the power to deal with monopolies, and those opposed to our proposals refused us the power to assist the people.",22
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will the honourable member say what there is in the Government programme to help the people?,22
79,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I shall do so vvith pleasure. I heartily congratulate the Government on proposing to strike the first blow at high rents by coming down with a national banking proposal. The first blow will be struck at high rents when we find cheap money for the people who wish to have their own homes, and to pay no rent. My idea is that every man should have his own home, and should not be obliged to pay rent.",22
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Is that the idea underlying the State bank ?,22
81,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,Yes ; it will provide money at a cheap rate of interest.,22
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Do the Government propose to fix low rates of interest by law?,22
83,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I am told that we propose to do this with the people's money. But I would ask vvho it is who finds the money to pay dividends to the shareholders of private banks? These dividends are paid all the time with the people's, money. Who have built all the noble institutions in which private banking operations are carried on ? It is the people - the workers and producers. I am aware that I should infringe the rules of debate by dealing in detail with the proposal for the establishment of a National Bank.",22
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then I understand from the honourable member that the National Bank will strike a blow at high rents ?,22
85,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Certainly . ' It wilt strike a blow at high rates of interest, which are the basis of high rents. If the people can obtain money at a low rate of interest and with easy repayments of the principal they will be able to husband their resources, and thus to establish little homes for themselves without being exploited by filibusters on every occasion that they receive an increase in wages. - Mr AGAR WYNNE - Where will the National Bank get the money to lend to the people?",22
86,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Fro m the people themselves. My honourable friend is facetious. He knows as well as I do that the whole of the money used in banking operations is provided by the people. He is also aware that the private banks do not lend money only-the y merely allow credit-and it is for that credit that the people pay interest. He knows, too, that a bank can have nothing better than a con r stant stream of interest flowing into it, whilst its security is daily becoming enhanced because, of the instalments which are being paid off the principal.",23
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then the Commonwealth Rank will be a bank of deposit and issue in the ordinary sense?,23
88,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"No Government which I am supporting will make itself ridiculous by bringing down any scheme for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank which does not enter into all legitimate channels of business-whic h does not cover everything except risky speculation. I wish specially to leave risky speculation to the private banks. When the Banking Bill is brought forward I shall have an opportunity of discussing it in detail, and therefore I shall not examine the proposal minutely now. But I feel sure that the creation of such an institution as a Commonwealth Bank will mark one of the great departures which is needed to secure to those who earn wealth in Australia their fair proportion of that wealth. No doubt as the years roll on everybody will be advantaged by the scheme. Even the man who preens himself that he is a capitalist will not be injured by it, because the National Bank will be open to him just as it will be open to everybody else; Ever since banking operations were initiated the curse of the system has been the high rates of interest and compound interest which have been charged. In fact, one great writer has said that of all the imps that Satan ever used to defeat mankind in their attempt to set up anything like a heaven upon earth the most powerful was interest. I do not intend to dilate upon the other proposals which are contained in the Government programme. I trust that, we shall push through this session with all expedition. I was rather pleased to hear the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government are determined to press forward to their completion the measures which are outlined in the Governor General's Speech.",23
89,Mr RYRIE,Unknown,"If that be so, we shall be here till this time next year.",23
90,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"Then let us stay here, if it be necessary to adopt that course. The honourable member knows that it will be the fault of the party with which he is associated if the measures in question do not become law within a few months. If each Bill be subjected only to reasonable criticism the entire programme can be disposed of within the period I have indicated. To me it is a pleasure to see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in such a genial frame of mind.",23
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Would the honourable member mind telling us what is "" reasonable ' ' criticism ?",23
92,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"I hold in my hand a little leaflet which just answers the honourable member's question. It contains samples of the "" reasonable"" criticism which was offered to the Government proposals during the recent referenda campaign. It is headed, "" Three reasons why farmers should vote ' No ' at the referendum,"" and. it reads1. To retain present local independence in State and municipal affairs. As if we ever wanted to take away that independence2. To guard against the threatened export duties on primary products. Was such a course ever suggested? 3. To prevent the nationalization of land. Let honourable members think of that last glorious criticism, seeing that there was no proposal in the referenda to nationalize land or even to touch it.",23
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member himself said today that he would nationalize all distribution..,23
94,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,Does ; distribution include land?,23
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Necessarily .,23
96,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,"What I said was that I would nationalize commercial; distribution. But I would be pleased to see the. trafficker in land also disappear. Those gentlemen who condemn land nationalization are only too frequently delighted to sell a piece of land to a widow and then to foreclose upon her because of a little mortgage. I warn honourable members not to say too much of land trafficking in Australia, because, if they do, they will hear something so unsavoury that they will wish they had not spoken. I do not desire to enter into this matter exhaustively, because honourable members opposite knew perfectly well when the leaflet which I have quoted was issued, that the States retained the right absolutely to deal with the lands of this country. But I wish to thank them for this class of literature because, if there is one thing more than another which educates the public to an appreciation of the true position, it is the lies which are circulated broadcast, and the dust which is thrown into 'their eyes during a political campaign. When they come to realise, in their quiet moments, now they have been tricked, betrayed, and mocked, I feel sure that they will, at "":be earliest opportunity, mete out condign punishment to those who so egregiously misled them.",23
97,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [3.50] - In his vigorous speech, the honourable member for New England said, with great truth, that England has a very difficult problem to face in India. I only wish that we were always fully conscious of the difficulties and responsibilities which beset the Mother Country in connection with that portion of the Empire and with the races of the East. A few days ago a deputation to the Minister of External Affairs requested that the wife of a Chinaman should be permitted to remain in Australia, although she is a prohibited immigrant. The Minister very properly replied that he was compelled by the Act to refuse admittance to all prohibited immigrants. I think that compliance with the provisions of the Act is obligatory upon him, though, in my view, the measure is scarcely worthy of this Parliament. 1901 we passed legislation which recognised that details of the kind under discussion did not touch the principle which we have all at heart-the preservation of a white race in Australia-and allowed married women and children under eighteen to accompany their husbands and fathers. All ethnologists tell us that a pure race is the best, if inspiration, efficiency, and a sense of nationality are desired. I have the highest respect for the Eastern races; but by reason of biological laws, it is impossible for European and Eastern races to acquire the same degree of efficiency by intermixture that each can acquire separately. For that reason I helped to put on the statute-book the legislation to which I have referred. We should not forget, however, that the civilization of China is much older than our own, and that her standards of education are high, and in these days of keen competition, we should do nothing to irritate and anger nations with whom we and the Empire at large have such important trade relations. The Eastern races in India, China, and Japan number something like 670,000,000, ancl I hope that the Government, with a sense of statesmanship and fairness, will consider whether it is not possible to regard their amour frofre by providing, in accordance with the law which was in force up to 1905, that men married before that year can have their wives here. Such legislation would in no way prejudice the maintenance of a White Australia. If we irritate nations with which the Mother Country has so often to negotiate, and whose positions she must consider, we do not act on what, I hope, is the growing sense of our Imperial obligations. I am glad that the Prime Minister has returned in vigorous health, just as he expressed pleasure at finding the Leader of the Opposition in the same state. He told us that we are to have another officer interposed between this responsible Parliament and the Public Service. I regret this growing taste for the placing of services under Commis< sioners, and under the control of men.who, from their official position, are of bureaucratic temper ancl irresponsibility.",24
98,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,A Court cannot be termed bureaucratic.,24
99,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I was taking occasion to reprehend a marked growth of the time. If Parliament surrenders its right to control the public services, which it is paid to govern, it weakens the principle of reIn sponsible government.",24
100,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The honourable member would abolish the Public Service Commissioner.,24
101,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I was laid up at the time of the provision for his appointment, and would have opposed it, though I have nothing to say against the present occupant of the office, who is a man of exceptional ability. We should not yield to the temptation to put services under Commissioners except under the stress of necessity, and should always be cautious about setting up barriers between us and those whom, we should govern. What is now proposed is that we shall not say what our public servants shall be paid. We have fixed the rates of pay for certain - grades, and have left it to the Public Service Commissioner to make the classification. That opens up possibilities of dispute as to whether the classification is right or wrong, and it is proposed that the determination shall be left to a Court. We shall have to obey the findings of that Court, although the Judge may be no better able than the Commissioner to come to a - correct decision. Indeed, the Commissioner is an expert, whose business it is to ascertain what is being done in the Departments, and what the work is worth; while the other, although he may be legally trained, and have a well-balanced mind, is not an expert.",24
102,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,But the honourable member would allow such a man to determine what the wages of the rest of the community should be!,25
103,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Parliamen t cannot well legislate directly to fix the wages of private employees, but it is bound to say what its own servants shall get.",25
104,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Not in individual cases.,25
105,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We determine that certain rates shall be paid, with automatic increases, according to classification, leaving transfers from one class to another to the Commissioner. The Prime Minister yesterday threw out what seemed to be an invitation to New Zealand to join the Federation ; but are we likely, when asking for the extension of powers which the people rejected by 259,000 votes, to induce the Dominion to join us ? What ground of expediency or common sense could induce it to enter a Federation in which the local industries would be controlled and regulated from an Australian centre? When one examines these shibboleths, these generalities, and tests them in the cold .light of common sense, one sees there - is really nothing in them. If I were a New Zealander, and were asked to come tomorrow into a Federation, the Parliament of which had the powers that were foreshadowed under the rejected amendments, I should certainly think, with a growing school of Americans, that the principle of autonomy was much dearer to me than that, and that whatever closer relations were felt to be required in regard to the larger external affairs should be obtained by treaties and co-ordination of powers, by individual and general co-operation, and reciprocity. With regard to the recent referenda, my impression is that the people gave a very common-sense judgment upon the proposals submitted to them.",25
106,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I think they were misled by a lot of catch phrases.,25
107,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There was a good deal of misapprehension even by advocates on both sides as to the scope of the proposals, and the people did not always get the best light, but they acted on sound impressions. I should like to know how they are to get the best light on these questions in the future, if what I read about the attitude of the Labour party is correct. I can understand a party-and I have respected the Labour party for it-havin g almost a rigid bond as regards certain essentials of their policy. It is reasonable to argue that if a man is returned to Parliament pledged to certain things, he ought to obey the mandate given by the people, and carry out those pledges. I have, therefore, never raised my voice in condemnation of what is called the caucus principle. It has its merits,- and may have its faults, but, without being an advocate of the extent to which it is applied, or said to be applied, by the Labour party, let me deal with what has been published on the question of the attitude of its members towards future referenda. I can understand that a man ought to be kept to the promises that he gave on the hustings, but the principle of representa r tive government would certainly be far more respected by simply taking the general lines of a man's political leanings and trusting him with some discretion as to how he is to apply them in legislation. On 22nd August there was a meeting in Sydney called by twenty-two branches of the Labour organizations, and attended by four or five Ministers. According to the papers, Mr Holman was there asked for an explanation of why, believing in a certain line of policy as being best for the State, he did not advocate the opposite in the referenda campaign. I understand it was then agreed that, for the future, all candidates must obey the majority decision on these vital matters of constitutional amendment. If there is one way more calculated than another to mislead the judgment of electors in a case where it is not in any way essential, although itmaj(be to some extent desirable, to obey a party mandate, it is by the adoption of such an attitude in connection with referenda. The reason for binding-a mem-! ber is that you cannot touch him for three - years. During that time, he ought to - stick to his promises, and obey some - majority decision as to the best metliod of carrying out the principles affirmed on the hustings. But how can that apply to the taking of referenda? There you go back at once to the men from whom, if you were standing for Parliament, you would get your instructions, and you are asked not to render an account of your stewardship, but to tell them what they are to do. In such cases, we ought to speak the absolute personal conviction of each of us when advising the electors. We cannot do that if it is rendered obligatory upon a member, no matter what his private opinions are, to obey the decisions of any Conference, however dignified.",25
108,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,There is no obligation at all.,26
109,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I ara referring only to what I read in the newspapers. I hope that the indications thrown out by that report cannot be assigned to the intended actions of the Labour party.  can easily get out by resigning his position.,26
110,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Why put him in the position of having to mislead the electors? There is no reason for it. He is simply asked by the electors to tell them what the truth is on this or that measure passed by Parliament, and it is making a travesty of all representative principles if you do not allow individual discretion in these matters, to the largest extent sistent with the solidarity of a party. The mistake which the Labour party made in the recent referenda was that they attempted to emulate certain advertising doctors, by applying heroic remedies to petty indispositions caused chiefly by straining a naturally sound Constitution. They asked for 95 per cent, more than they wanted. There were only one or two matters of pressing necessity, which they could easily have got if they had accepted bur amendments, but they failed by asking too much. Although it is now after the Imperial Conference, I suppose there is no harm in referring to what was done there. I think it was Lord Salisbury who, in 1887, presiding over the first Imperial Conference, mentioned that it was a great pity, in Imperial matters, to precipitate a decision upon questions before opinion was ripe. He actually ruled out the question of Imperial Federation, and confined the then discussion to defence. I am afraid 'that during the last fifteen or twenty years we have forgotten that very wholesome suggestion of his. One proposal, which was happily rejected by the Imperial. Conference, was the somewhat extraordinary one of the Prime Minister of New Zealand to set up another Parliament, with two hundred and ninetyseven members in one House, and fourteen in another, based upon popular representation as regards one Chamber, and I do not know upon what as regards the other, to deal with defence and some external matters for the next ten years, and with no direct responsibilities. It was actually to be given the power to apportion revenue raised by other Parliaments, l t struck me that if there is one line which is chiefly administrative it is defence. There is very little legislation required for that, and, as regards foreign affairs, surely a body like the Imperial Parliament, that already deals with them, is the most competent and proper, under our theory of government, to continue to manage them. The reflection occurred to me that in any sphere except the political, such a proposalwould have simply wrecked the reputation it was possibly intended to enhance. I am pleased to say that it was rejected, but there have been other suggestions of a similar kind. The Times, in 1907, and again in 1911, just prior to the Conference, put with extraordinary directness what it considered to be the alternative for the Dominions. It suggested that we must either separate, or join in some possible conpolitical consolidation.",26
111,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,There is a good body of public opinion which takes that view.,26
112,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I regret it, because I believe that one of two of the statements that have been made as regards neutrality in other matters were induced by this foolish attempt to re-organize, on stereotyped lines, that elastic system to which hitherto the Empire has owed its greatness. I find the Times writingThe whole position is impossible and cannot last. Some solution of the difficulty must befound. The one is separation; the other I m perial partnership. The Colonies must either become absolutely independent States, conducting the whole of their internal affairs without interference and without help, or else they mustbecome equal partners in a united Empire based upon the principle of mutual support and , 1 joint responsibility. I prefer to follow as conducing to what ought to be the aspiration of every one of us-integrity , perfect co-ordination, and' mutual support-the sounder lines of present relations. I prefer to trust in - this'matter the more deliberate utterances of the Quarterly Review, for instance, and The Nation. I remember that in one of the summaries of the Imperial Conference of 1907, the Quarterly Review said that it must regard the principle of the Federation of the Empire as having receded far from the high-water mark of hope. The Nation is a great Liberal organ, and, perhaps, the most brilliant English weekly published. It is, through its policy, the organ of Lloyd-George; ancl if gave him rhe most - strenuous support in his land tax proposals. There must be something wrong with the attitude of our Colonial Premiers when we find these newspapers, week after week, calling them to account. Reference is - made, for instance, to the question of retaining our control of the Fleet; and The Nation saysNot the integration, but the disintegration of 'Imperial aims is the actual issue of the new .movement, by which the daughter nations are furnishing the instruments of defence. I read the memorandum, and it did not - strike me as true Imperialism for Canada, which I do not think has contributed £ 1 directly to the maintenance qf the Imperial Navy, to say that it could only place the control of its local Navy, when it had one, under the Imperial Admiralty if Canada, forsooth, approved of the war. Is that Imperial loyalty? I dislike dwelling too much on such expressions, for a man's loyalty ought to be asserted by acts. We get too much lip loyalty; and the policy - of shoving loyalty down people's throats bas been, for instance, the cause of a great deal of the trouble in Ireland. There must, however, be something wrong, some grudging spirit displayed, when we find the very newspapers which ought to stand up for the Colonial Premiers, condemning their attitude on so many matters. I admire the view that is taken by The Nation, The Economist, and other great newspapers in which we find matured thought. they ask is that the bond shall be one of sentiment and autonomy under the Crown with a reserve power in the central government to be used for the benefit of the whole Empire, and of any of the parts at the request of the parts. That is the principle they adopt. On the 27th April, The Nation saidThere never has been anything like the Em-pire of the Five Nations, and if it must subsist, it must obey the particular laws of its '-being. Its bonds are spiritual and sentimental, ihot governmental. In regard to the attitude of Canada, I very much question whether we have the temper to render any form of political union workable-whethe r we would really subordinate our local interests to the coercive powers of the majority. I believe that if the Empire were in danger, we would be willing to sacrifice our local views in order to attain the great end we have in common. In connection with the Canadian position, however, we found, about ten years ago, that, although there was much talk of loyalty, the moment local interests were touched, there was an outcry. For instance, when the Alaska boundary report was published, and Lord Alverstone, the representative of the United Kingdom, took the view of the Americans, as he had a right to do, if the Americans were correct, Canada immediately contended that her interests were being subordinated to Imperial necessity; and there was much talk, bordering on disaffection, at some banquets in the subsequent six months. As to neutrality, of course, that is a thing that a man who knows anything of International law will contemn. It is an act of sovereignty; we cannot declare neutrality. The whole Empire might make such a declaration, because it is sovereign. For many years, the right of Switzerland to neutrality as between Austria and France was questioned; and it was only in 1815, owing to the interlacing of the interests of Switzerland with those of some of the other Powers, that neutrality was recognised; and it was not until 1870 that it was finally affirmed. What on earth is the good of talking about neutrality when its recognition depends on other nations rather than on ourselves? If I chose to detain the House, I could show that there has been much talk of neutrality by some Canadian statesmen in connection with the Defence scheme to which I have referred. I asked the Prime Minister yesterday why the Colonial repreWhat sentatives did not accept the friendly proposals of the Board of Trade representatives to use the Imperial Labour Bureau in connection with immigration. All that was suggested was that this Bureau, established in 1909, had done very good work locally, and might prove useful to the Dominions. Some 12,000 to 15,000 men are, every week, placed in employment through this agency; and we are informed that there is a surplus of skilled men. This Bureau is not established to aid the distressed class-^-that class which- Mr Coghlan, a few years ago, told us was likely to be sent out, and which was condemned in a report by the Agents-General. We are told that 89 per cent, of the engineering class which passed through the Bureau are skilled mechanics, and that only 15 per cent, of the available men in the building trade are pure labourers. These men are seeking homes across the seas; and the Imperial Government asked the Dominion representatives to accept its view on one point, at any rate. Yet they refused. No wonder we find the Liberal press again condemning this attitude. Hear what the great Liberal weekly, The Nation, saysI t is difficult to read the reports of the recent sittings of the Imperial Conference without an uncomfortable suspicion that something of the arrogance of youth is creeping into the relations of the Colonies with the Mother Country. It referred in particular to this refusal to accept the co-operation of the Imperial Labour Exchange in connection with the supply of labour.",26
113,Mr WEST,Unknown,They were advised not to accept it.,28
114,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"All that was asked was that the Board should be notified if persons of the class dealt with were wanted in the Colonies. The State Governments would advise their Agents-General, who in turn would inform the Board of Trade, which would use its machinery to send out the men.",28
115,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Does the member approve of the use of the word "" arrogance"" as to an opinion entertained by an Australian?",28
116,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No . I am afraid that some of these newspapers-eve n The Economist in one or two cases-condemne d rather too strongly the points of view of the representatives of the Colonies. In certain cases, however, there was displayed a good deal of what one might cail juvenile arrogance. I regret that our representatives did not take a more statesmanlike view of Imperial responsibilitiesfor instance, in connection with the Navigation Bill. For the last five or six years the British Government has been asking by correspondence that by means of the Navigation Bill it should be relieved of some of the difficulties which beset it in connection with the negotiations with various countries for uniform rules. The Merchant Shipping Act was amended in 1906 in a way that has enabled Great Britain to have with foreign countries uniform rules on many difficult questions relating to standard food, measurement, load^ lines, and so forth. But the British Government has been hampered very largely in this work by the absence of a similar spirit on the part of some of the Dominions, and those who are now in officehave every opportunity to study the documents. It was only this morning that I had an opportunity of reading some of the discussions, apart from the rather meagre reports that I had read in the Times, and I regret that there was not displayed in connection with some of these suggestions a more statesmanlike view of Imperial responsibilities than seems to some of have been displayed by some of the men who at banquets spoke rather loudly upon the growth of Imperial nationality, and so on. To come to a more abstruse question, let us see what is the position asregards the Declaration of London. I think that there has been a good deal of misapprehension as to the issue raised. It is a very difficult question whether the Declaration of London in the interests of the Empire should or should not have been adopted. . Some Dominions may take a different view from that of others, just as one belligerent will take a different view from that of another belligerent. The position of England, for example, is not the position of Russia. We are an Empire upon which, it has been said, thesun never sets- a power whose morning drum-beat, following the sun, and keeping honourable company with the hours, circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of martial airs, and have a sense of all that that means in connection with the diffusion of the elements which compose that magnificent organization. Russia is a great Empire, if that term may rightly be applied to it. with no Colonies, and with ice-bound ports; whereas England, on the other hand, practically lives upon the sea. Their points of view, therefore* are altogether different. Up to 1905 or 1906 lawyers-thos e men who in the opinion of some of our friends never can clo any good-ha d been trying  harm.",28
117,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"To the wrong side, of course. There are two sides to every, question, and the lawyer has to be on the one side or the other. In 1875 an> International Commission, consisting of lawyers- I forget for the moment the title of the Commission-wa s appointed to draw a code of international law on, among others, the eight questions that form the basis of the Declaration of London. After twelve or fifteen months' work the Commission presented its report; but - as is historically the case always-until trouble arose, nothing was done. Action was precipitated only by trouble that arose in 1901, in connection with the South African war, and in 1904 on the occasion of the RussoJapanese war. In connection with the South African war I think a German vessel was seized, but not sunk, by one of the British cruisers. England seized the vessel under what at the time was, according to the average opinion, her rightfully exercised power, yet acting on those moral principles which, I believe, have been growing in England, and have always characterized the relations of England with other nations in international matters, she gave way in the matter, notwithstanding that according to a good many lawyers her position was right. In 1904, when Russia had attempted to make food and coal absolute - contrabrand of war, and had also sunk some neutral prizes, the question of the consideration of a code was precipitated .by the diplomatic interchanges which then took place. We find that when the last Hague Conference met in 1907 it was suggested that, instead of each belligerent taking its captured prizes, to be condemned - according to its municipal law, in its own prize courts, it would be better to ascertain whether some consensus upon nine or ten of these larger matters of difference might not be come to and form the basis of an international code to be administered try the Hague Tribunal. That led to what is known as the Declaration of London. Although that Declaration on some points appeared opposed to British interests there was imposed upon those who had advocated its rejection a very great responsibility since the lead in the matter was taken by England, through Sir Edward Grey. He sent out an invitation to the various - Governments who were represented at the Hague Conference to express in memoranda their views upon eight points, and having taken in that way such a very large .and reponsible part in the initiation of the Declaration of London it was incumbent upon him to consider very carefully whether ihe absence of perfection in three or four lines would justify the rejection of the Declaration. That Declaration was sent - out to us. I do not know how long it was here, but it fell to my lot, as Attorney General, to go through the papers and to see what ought to be the Australian point of view. That was expressed in a memorandum, on the whole, approving of the principles of the Declaration, but objecting to three or four provisions to which I shall make a short reference. I do not think they are quite as vital to our interests as some people believe. I may say that very eminent men who objected on these very grounds to the ratification or, at all events, to the immediate ratification of the Declaration of London have, on the whole, praised it very highly. We find, for instance, Mr Arthur Cohen, K . C , in the Law Quarterly Review, describing the Declaration as an instrument containing two complete and admirable codes on the law of blockade and contraband. He saysWhatever may be determined as lo the ratification of the Declaration of London the International Naval Conference of London will be, I venture to assert, ever memorable in the annals of international law as having framed two complete and admirable codes of the law of blockade and contraband, and as having established on sound principles the important rules relating to compensation and the resistance to search. Lord Lindley, in a letter to the Times on the 9th June, said that on the whole the Declaration ought to be ratified, although there were three formidable objections, such as those relating to food supply, the destruction of neutral ships, and the conversion of merchant ships into war vessels after they had left the ports pf their country. I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that one part of the British Dominions might take a different view from that of the others. As regards food supply, for instance, the position might be more serious to us than to Great Britain. Whether food supply was absolute contraband or not has for many years been a moot point., England in 1763 regarded food as absolute contraband when it suited its purpose. The rule of might on the whole is the rule of right when war is proceeding, and it took a great deal of persuasion by other nations in 1856 to get England to surrender the tremendous power which its great navy then gave it in connection with the rights of neutrals; but it did so. In the beginning of the last century also, I believe England did declare food as absolute contraband in connection with some of the wars with France. Divergent views have existed, and as a matter of fact the advantage to a strong belligerent would be - practically as great if we never had the Declaration as some persons think it is by its adoption in connection with this very question of food supply, 'because it was within its right to say in any particular war that food was absolute contraband. What has been done, then, as regards food is that it has been made conditional contraband, and the weakness of the provision as drawn up consists in the fact that it is uncertain whether the mere consignment of food to any British port would make it contraband of war within the terms of the definition. That was one of the points to which in the memorandum the attention of the Imperial Government was directed.",28
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Any base of supply ?,30
119,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I have the whole of the terms.,30
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should think that that would include every inch of Great Britain.,30
121,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"It is doubtful-that is all I can say. Perhaps I had better refer honourable members to the provisions on this point. It is purely a question of the burden of proof. Before, when a vessel was seized for carrying contraband, the burden of proving innocence was on the part of her owner. But the burden of proof is now shifted on to the captor, and that is decreed in article 33, which readsConditional contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined for the use of the armed forces or of a Government department of the enemy State, unless in this latter case the circumstances show that the cannot in fact be used for the purposes of the war in progress. The latter exception does not apply to a consignment coming under article 24, which refers to gold and such matters. It does not touch the point I am dealing with. The clause I have quoted declares the principle that for the future the burden of proof is on the captor. But then there are presumptions which are somewhat vaguely expressed, and may be dangerous, in article 34, which is to be read with the other, and which says The destination referred to in Article 33That is the destination of the armed of a Government. The destination referred to in Article 33 is vessel. presumed to exist if the goods are consigned to enemy authorities or to a contractor established in the enemy country who, as a matter of common knowledge, supplies articles of . this, kind to the enemy. A similar presumption arises if the goods areconsigned to a fortified place belonging to the enemy or other place serving as a base for thearmed forces of the enemy. I shall not read any further than that. Asregards the latter expression, it has been suggested that even Liverpool or London,, as a place of consignment, would fall within that definition, and, if so, the Declaration, not as against the old system without it, but as against the comparative immunitygiven to continental nations who had noseaboard, and to whom this law of continuous voyage could not consequently apply-wa s disadvantageous . to us, while it might be helpful to them.",30
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I suppose that any other base of supply would be something distinct from a fortified place.,30
123,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I should think so, because the one is mentioned.",30
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is something plus that. j,30
125,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"All sorts of suggestions - I shall not weary honourable members by going into them-were made as to what ought to be done in connection with that clause. I have cited Lord Lindley. I could cite two or three admirable articles on this question in the Quarterly Review. They do not advocate the rejection. They advocate ratification, with a reservation in relation to these matters. Sir Edward Grey, I understand, has undertaken that these definitions, to some extent, at all events, will be cleared up-that the doubt as to whether Liverpool, for instance, would be a place of consignment for the purposes goods of the armed forces of the enemy within the meaning of these presumptions, will be cleared up by a minute attached to the acceptance of the memorandum by the Empire. So far, of course, so good. As regards the destruction of neutral prizes, there is no doubt that the position is not worse than it was without the Declaration.",30
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member think not?,30
127,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have given an instance. In 1904 Russia destroyed prizes. I believe that, after agreeing to regard food as contraband only when it was consigned to the armed forces of the enemy-that is, forces within the meaning of the provisions of the Declaration of London-it did sink a",30
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is . not the honourable member considering the question of the right to sink with the right to'search?,30
129,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"-On e is part of ""the other. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - You bind \ourself -.to take the word of the neutral.",30
130,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,That has nothing to do - with my point. I am simply dealing with the captor of neutral vessels supposed to - carry contraband of war.,31
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But their word must be taken.,31
132,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That need not necessarily be done. The enemy may take the risk of sinking, but if the vessel is sunk the captor has to show before his own prize Court-subjec t to appeal to The Hague tribunal-that the sinking was the - result of inevitable necessity.",31
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Declaration says that the enemy must not search if the - captain of the vessel says that he has nothing contraband on board.,31
134,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member is wrong on that point, because one of the provisions of the Declaration is that the belligerent vessel must not - sink, unless, after search, it is found that the contraband amounts to more than half the total value of the cargo; and, of course, he is entitled to test that. However, what I say is this: that this is a weak point, and that objection was taken by the last Government to it. It was one of the three matters to which the attention of the Imperial Government was drawn, as being-no t necessarily from our point of view only - objectionable, and it should not, therefore, without some modification, be adopted. Passing over one or two points on which I have made some notes, another feature that strikes me is this. On the whole, the importance of the - question is not so great as some may think. England's interest, from the point of view of neutral carriage, is rather that of a neutral trader than of a belligerent. How is that? I have taken some figures from the Board of Trade returns. They show that, between 1855 and 1859, 84 per cent, of the carrying trade between the United Kingdom and British Possessions was British. All the vessels conducting that 84 per cent, of trade would be belligerent vessels, and this Declaration of London would not touch them at all. Between 1905 and 1908, I find that 92 per oent. ing trade was in British vessels, and only -'8 per cent, in foreign vessels; and those foreign vessels in some cases included belligerent vessels, which, of course, would not be affected by the Declaration of London. VVe see, therefore, that, as a matter of substance-dealin g now with the trade of the Empire, and not purely withAustralian trade-the area of the in- 1 convenience of this Declaration is not very great. Take, now, the tonnage of sailing and steam vessels entered and cleared in the trade of Australia with theprincipal maritime countries-that is to say, our external trade with the principal maritime countries. In 1908, 8,581,000 was the amount of the total tonnage, and of this 6,318,000 was British, leaving only 2,263,000 tons for foreign vessels-and those would include belligerent vessels. If you take the total Australian trade, external and Inter-State, British and Colonial, you find that it comprises in round numbers 24,000,000 tons, of which the foreign trade would be only 4,000,000. It would not, therefore, be a matter of such very great, or at all events of vital, importance if these particular points were not qualified at the instance of the Imperial Government.",31
135,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"But ours, of course, is an ever increasing trade.",31
136,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"But not the proportion of our trade that is carried by foreign vessels. I have given-the figures of the proportion of trade so carried. In fact, I have other figures which go to show with quite as great force the comparative insignificance of some of these points when examined in relation to our actual trade. I could take, for instance, the trade from 1849, and show that there has been a greatincrease in the carriage by British vessels. There is another point of view. I have mentioned navigation. We ought to consider, as Mr Buxton stated at the Imperial Conference, the difficulties of Great Britain in connection with our amendment of the navigation laws; for instance, the provision that, at the instance of Sir Joseph Ward, was passed as regards Lascars and the employment of foreign seamen. It was pointed out that within the last four or five> years there has been, happily, an increase in the proportion of British seamen engaged on British vessels. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They ought to of the carry- get better wages.",31
137,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There has been a remarkable betterment of the condition of seamen. It is the case that the condition of men on many vessels was formerly most deplorable. But the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 is acknowledged to have brought about an improvement; and sincethen the reports are that men are tempted by the better conditions to join the mercantile marine, and so strengthen what is really a main source of our naval supremacythe great body of hardy seamen upon whom the Navy was able to draw of old. If we, by our pettifogging policy, in matters of no real substance, of not recognising our Imperial responsibilities, irritate foreign nations that are vulnerable in that way, England may seriously suffer. England is the great carrying country of the world. For instance, 36 per cent, of the vessels entering French ports are British. I believe that the proportion entering German ports is in excess of that figure. In the United States, 29 per cent, of the vessels are British. Mr Sydney Buxton stated at the Imperial Conference that 164,000,000 out of 285,000,000 tons of shipping going to foreign ports is British. That shows, therefore, that if we ask England to give a protection which we really do not want, and which very often will simply mean the protection of the capitalists, who are so much condemned by honourable members opposite, we may be exposing to serious reprisals the Mother Country, whose interest in this respect we need to have at heart. I am not going to trespass upon the time of the House by dealing at length with other matters, such as the dengerous right under the Declaration of conversion of vessels at sea, but will deal now with the question of the establishment of an Imperial Court of Appeal. I regard what has been done recently as one of those half sincere propositions about which so much is made, but which involves so little. The Privy Council and the House of Lords have been practically manned by the same Judges for many years. They sat in different places, and were, theoretically, differently instituted. The Privy Council was nominally appointed as its committee by the Crown, and reported to the Crown; and the Crown dealing directly with British Possessions, the Privy Council was a final Court of Appeal for them. But the Judges who sat in the House of Lords have been the same as those who sat in the Privy Council, and there has been practically no material difference between the judgments delivered by a particular Judge in one place, and those delivered in the other. What is now done is to give statutory expression to what has been the actual practice for the last few years. It is now agreed that there is to be one Court, instead of two. But, Mr Glynn. as I have said, the two were the same in substance, and, practically, the manning was the same. That is to say, the regular Judges were the same. Practically the Privy Council bad the right of calling, among others, one Australian Judge to itscounsels ; though I believe he attended only once since he was appointed in 1897. Jn a similar manner, the House of Lords occasionally has the Chief Justice of England and the Chief Justice of Ireland sitting in the Court of Appeal. But the same class of Judges sit on both tribunalsalternately, and the business is, I think, apportioned by the Lord Chancellor. What has now been done is to declare that there is to be one Court of Appeal in two divisions for the future, and to strengthen it by the addition of two other Judges. If there is anything in the arrangement, I am glad that we have it ; but I cannot see that it will help us very much. I think that last year we sent three appeals Home from the High Court-on e appeal from the New South Wales State Court, and an appeal from an Admiralty Court. The year before there were three appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council, and one appeal onlyfrom an Australian State Court direct, and that was in Western Australia. We have been looking largely to our own tribunalthe Australian High Court. However, if honourable members think that a great stroke has been done by the establishment of this Court of Appeal, I have no desire to discount any praise that may be given for its adoption. In conclusion, all I can say is that I hope that if there is to be a reorganization of our relations, we shall follow rather the advice given by The Nation and the Quarterly Review, than the somewhat formidable alternative suggested by the Times. When the question of Empire on the principle not yet fully recognised of independent growth and combined strength is considered freely, without the bias of personal ambitions, the haste, and, at times, insincerity, of Conferences called to discuss difficulties and problems that arise because something must be mooted or done, it may be found that cohesion and strength, unity in external and independence in local relations, and perfect coordination of the parts with stability of the whole, depend .less upon the creation of political machinery, complicated, coercive, and disproportionate, it may be, to the ends in view, than upon the maintenancl ance, and without the limits of clear necesfollow sity, the modification, of the elastic system to which the Empire and its elements their concordance and vitality, and will again turn, without misgivings, surance of continued integrity and freedom.  not intend to speak on the Address-inwill Reply, because if there is one matter with in his time. which I can agree with the Melbourne Age, it is in the advantage to doing away with so useless a debate. A f t e i the leaders on both sides have spoken i the debate on the Address-in-Reply, all that can be said with advantage has been said, and the rest of the talk is only much beating the air. But following the good old traditions of Parliament, I shall myself be a transgressor on this particular occasion. I wish particularly to refer to the references made by the Leader of the Opposition to industrial matters. Later on I shall deal with the caustic remarks which have been made about the loyalty of Labour party in connection with their omisshovel sion to despatch a contingent of Australian soldiers to take part in the ceremonies nected with the Coronation of the late King nents. Edward, and recently of King George, i suppose this is a free country, and, as members of a free Parliament, we have as much right to our opinion on this side as has the gallant colonel.",31

140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a military be gained by strategist, no doubt.  n and no one knows better than does the honourable member for Parramatta, that it is on a military basis we conduct these strikes. so There must be something good and grand in the Labour movement when it has .survived the vilification and misrepresentation of every newspaper in the Commonwealth, and its supporters have achieved the position they are in today. It is only since 1890 that the Labour party really came into existence in Australia. Our present Speaker was the amongst the men who did the pick and work in the movement at that time, and he knows the way in which the men conengaged in it were insulted by their oppoWhen the first Labour men were returned to the Queensland Legislative Assembly, their opponents declined to sit in the same room with them, and refused even to hang their hats or their coats on the same pegs.

142,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The organization to which the honourable member belongs has done that, ancl yet its members strike.  intend to do more. That is my ambition. I am never satisfied. There is no halfway house about me. I am a wholehogger. If there is anything of which I am proud in the whole of my existence, it is that I am a representative of Labour. I am not a Democrat from force of circumstances, but from conviction. ther, I have stood the test. I have been through the mill. I have been through a strike, ancl consequently I know what it means. My heart goes out to the men who do strike and to their wives and children. suppose that if I said what I think of free labourers, it would be ruled out of order as unparliamentary. But I look upon the free labourer as the meanest creature on the face of the earth. cannot compete in the open market and secure employment-as does the ordinary workman-h e has to come in at the master's heel. And what do the employers do when the strike is over? They give him the royal order of the boot quick and lively. Instead of giving him the order of the boot, they ought to drown him. We accepted the advice which was tendered to us by the honourable member for Fawkner, and others, and resolved to return our own representatives to Parliament. Directly we did so those in authority altered the electoral laws so as to prevent the nomadic population of the western district of Queensland from being enrolled. They made enrolment so difficult that many men who had never seen a ship afloat could not get their names upon the roll because they had no fixed place of abode. Then that great organization of which I am so proud, and which has proved such a big factor in returning Labour members to Parliament- I refer to the Australian Workers Union-spran g into existence. I say, without fear of contradiction, that were it not for that organialiases, zation, many men sitting in this Parliament, and in the State Parliaments of Australia, would not be there. The other side taught iis how to organize, and we have followed in their footsteps, so that now we have become a power in the land. The attempts to "" down "" the Labour party remind me of the attempts which are made to suppress secret societies. When once a secret society has been established, and an effort is made to suppress it, the masses at once come together, and desire to join it with a view to getting the good things which are going. Yesterday afternoon, the Leader of the Opposition stated that if things go on as they have been going, the Commonwealth will be captured by the Labour party. It was the first occasion upon which I have seen him work himself into a fury, and he did so by raising the bogie of militant Socialism. I hope that the day has not arrived-eve n now that we are in possession of the Treasury benches-whe n our Fur- force is going to cease to be a militant one. If I thought that the Labour party was going to rest upon its political haunches contentedly, I would get out of it quick and lively. The position which we occupy toI day is due to the fact that the party has been a militant one. Ever since it was formed we have had to fight our way against serious odds, against capitalism in all its worse forms, against bribery and corHe ruption. We have had to fight the press single-handed. In Queensland, the only Labour newspaper that we had was a little rag called the Worker. But it did its work, and it was deadly work, too. Although it was only a small journal, it set the people thinking. With what result? To-day we command a majority in both branches of the National Parliament. I venture to say that no matter how honourable members oppositemay dress their bogies, or alter the names of their political parties, the Labour party will still remain the national party-the same old party which sprang into existence in 3890 and 1891. We have no need to change its name. We have no need to address meetings of old tabbies-of disappointed and disgruntled old maids. We have right on our side. Since the inception of this great Labour party in the different States of Australia each of the other political parties has changed its name after every election. It is said that when the police wish to ram a charge home to an individual they always give him his aliases. Well, honourable members opposite have a lot of and their character politically is not too good. The honourable member for North Sydney worked himself into a terrible passion last night over the actions of Mr Keir Hardie in India. He declared that Mr Keir Hardie went about that ""country making seditious speeches. As a .matter of fact, that gentleman never delivered a single speech in India, although he managed to p;et a lot of matter inserted in the native press. The honourable member for Grampians declared that the authorities ought to have killed him-that they ought to have crucified him. But if honourable members opposite had.their way today every man sitting upon these benches would be crucified. They have tried to do that sort of thing before. .After the 1891 strike, when it was declared that bygones were to be bygones, what happened ? The employers picked out the leaders of that particular strike, and said, "" If we gPt rid of these fellows, who have the brains of the organization, we shall be able to work the other men quietly so that in the future things will go on swimmingly as they have done hitherto."" The result was that every time a man applied for a shearing shed, before he was given employment the black list was consulted to see if his name appeared upon it. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration in this House I produced one of those black lists. Those lists contained the names of some of the most noble men that Australia has produced. Many of them were native-born Australians, and honest, hard working men But they struck their rights, and because they strove hard to get them, and were beaten, they were to be hounded out of existence and out of the country.",34
143,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"B y some employers who are called Christians.  tians. I am pleased to say that many of the men who suffered as the result of the 1891 strike are today occupying proud and honourable positions in the different States of the Commonwealth. When the honourable member for North Sydney was in the height of his oratory last evening the honourable memher for Wakefield interjected something about a strike in Adelaide. He stated that the carters in that city had to obtain permits from the Trades Hal l because a weak-kneed Government was in power. That Government was a weak-kneed one, I suppose, because it would not do just what he and his party wanted it to do, namely, to put-the strikers in gaol or to shoot them. We have been afforded an illustration of what militarism and military caste wdl do by the cables which have appeared in the newspapers during the past two or three weeks. God forbid that such a state of - things should ever exist in this fair land of ours ! When the 1891 strike was in progress in Queensland Sir Horace Tozer said, in effect, "" If you men do not return to work, and obey our laws, we will send our police and our soldiers to arrest you. We will try you by our Judges, and we will put you in our prisons."" In less than twenty ye.irs what has happened? The position has been completely reversed, and we are now able to say to the other side, "" If you do not obey our laws we will send our police and our soldiers to arrest you; we will try you by our Judges, and we will put you in our prisons."" What a wonderful change has occurred in this brief space of time! History is being made so quickly that one hardly realizes how greatly things have changed in a short time. The Leader of the Opposition said that the sugar strike was brought about just as the cane was ready for harvesting, but, as a matter of fact, the Australian Workers' Association asked for a conference with the Growers' and the Producers' Associations early in the year. Mr Knox, of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, acted in a gentlemanly way about the matter. He replied that, if the employee's of the company were dissatisfied, he was prepared to for meet them, but that he could not treat with an outside organization. The request for a conference was made in February, so that the strike .did not occur without notice.",35
144,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There was trouble four months before the cane cutting season.  the vilification of honourable members opposite, of manufacturers' associations, and of kindred societies, I say, "" Thank God, we have a Billy Hughes."" "" What's the matter with Billy ? He's all r i g h t ! "" The other side would be only too pleased if they had a few like him in their ranks. The honourable member for North Sydney flogged the Labour party for its disloyalty in not sending a contingent to the Coronation. I have heard that you should mistrust the woman who stands at the street corner proclaiming her virtue, and should button up your pockets when a man commences to talk about his honesty. L i p loyalty may be all very well, but there are members of the Labour party who have shown their loyalty in other ways. Not one member of the party, so far as I know, has ever said anything in public or private to which the ordinary citizen could take exception. When gold rushes were common all over Australia, we heard a great deal of the lucky digger, but nothing of the unlucky ones. The honourable member for North Sydney picked a few cases out of Hansard to disparage the Labour party, but did not refer to the speeches which would have rebutted his statements. He went back to the first session, when many of us were new to the game of politics, and said .things that we wish now were forgotten. If I had my way, I would burn the Hansard record after every session. The honourable member, had he wished to be fair, would not have been content with resurrecting half-a-dozen ghosts to fit his purpose.",35
145,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Maranoa is the only member of the Labour party who, on a certain occasion, voted for the £200,000 contribution to the Imperial Navy.  members of the party are. No one ever tried to dragoon my vote. As for the reduction of the military Estimates by £750,000, moved by Mr J. C. Watson, it must be admitted, even by the honourable member for Parkes, that we were getting very little value for our expenditure on Defence at that time. The Department was in a chaotic state. Indeed, nothing was done to provide properly for Defence until the honourable member for Parramatta came into office. He originated a system of Defence for the Commonwealth. The honourable member for North Sydney accuses us of having stolen the Liberal programme. This is the first time that I have heard this party accused of stealing the programme of the Liberal party. On 3rd July last the honourable member for Parkes wrote a letter to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, in which he "" flogged his own Joss."" When I read his letter I smiled, and said, "" The lionorable member for Parkes is nothing if he is not thorough."" I look upon him as one of the straightest men in this Parliament. He says what he thinks in a most fearless manner. He goes right to the kernel of the question in one up. He does not fence nor circle, but gets straight to and in this letter he proved his Conservatism up to the hilt. It put me in mind of the Chinese who, when they want rain, gave their rain joss an awful doing, and when they want fine weather flog their fineweather joss. The honourable member for Parkes flogged the Liberal joss in Sydney on this occasion, because he said the Liberal party were putting on the pace too much, ancl would overtake the Labour party if they were not careful.",36
146,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member is putting his own interpretation on the letter; he ought to read it.  long to read to the House.,36

148,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I am a Liberal when they are Liberal.  the honourable member's explanation of the Liberal programme.,36
149,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That was not the Liberal programme. It was a Liberal organization, and I found fault with it for advocating Socialistic measures, which I thought belonged more properly to the Labour party. It was a conference, and as some unimportant persons were there, I thought I would strike the tuning fork for them.  it. The position is this : How can we steal these Liberal gentlemen's clothes when they have none ? The Leader of the Opposition was engaged last night in cutting a suit of clothes for them, and to-night he is going to fit them on. They do not know until to-night whether the clothes will fit or not. All these Liberal organizations are to be amalgamated. Some of them have peculiar names, but they are all to come down to bedrock, and be called the People's party - the P. P. L - meaning, in my judgment, the "" People's Political Legpullers."" That is the position in a nutshell, and then they have the cheek to announce through the Age and the Argus that this is going to be a grand realization of all their aspirations. Politically speaking, there is Mr Watt with his banjo and Mr Deakin with his tambourine, with all the hallelujah lasses on the platform behind them. It does not matter how they it, organize, or what they call themselvesthey are the same old crowd. As the Employers Federation told them one day last week, "" Those that are not with us are against us."" There are only two political camps in this country now. I do not know how the honourable member for Parramatta will get on when the carpet-baggers are done away with. He is the Ishmael in the party opposite. He is the only one among them who has no business there. I do not know how he is going to get on in the future with these Tory Conservatives and crusted Liberals. God knows where they are going to find him a place to lay his weary head; 1 do not. Last night the honourable member for North Sydney made great capital about industry, organization, and commercialism, but it appears to me that his whole and sole thought in living is militarism. To speak the honest truth, if there is one thing more than another that I quake at and baulk at every time, it is die fact that we are rearing a military caste for which some day we may be sorry.",36
150,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We must watch it, that is all.  history. I am not one of those who say that there should be no universal training. I say, and have said repeatedly, that the country that gives me my living, and is worth living in, has the right to call on me to defend it. If the day should come before I "" shuffle off this mortal coil,"" although I may not be able to take my place in the fighting and firing line, I will do my best for those who do. It hurts me when I hear men accuse us of being disloyal. There are in our movement today, particularly in Queensland, many men, and no one knows them better than yourself, Mr Speaker, who have risked their lives in order to give us the constitutional government and free institutions under which we live today. Why vilify those men? Surely they are worthy of some consideration, even if some of the representatives in this House do not see eye to eye with them in everything. There are old men, whom we honour every - year with a dinner, who kept the banner flying during the Indian Mutiny, and the - majority of them are supporters of the Labour party. They are looking to us in the declining days of their lives to make the conditions better for them. Our only ambition is to see that the masses have better - conditions than hitherto. If the Labour party were swept out of existence tomorrow, no one would be ""game"" enough to propose to wipe out the legislation which that party, with the assistance of honourable members here and in other Parlia-ments, have passed in that direction. We may sometimes say strong things about one another on the platform, though, as a irule, I do not indulge in personalities, either within this chamber or outside, but give my political opponents the same fair and square treatment that many of them give to me. You, Mr Speaker, know that amongst our political opponents in Queensland are some of our nearest and dearest friends. Under all the circumstances, I do not see why honourable members should accuse the Labour party of disloyalty. God forbid that an enemy should invade this fair country of ours; but if that came to pass, who would be the men to take up arms? The members of the Labour part)'-the rank and file outside. No matter what the red-rag Socialists may say, blood is thicker than water; and we all spring from a good old fighting stock. One honourable member, speaking yesterday of the referenda, asked why we on this side, having been beaten, did not give in. I can only say that Napoleon once asked why Wellington's forces, when they appeared to be beaten, did not retire; and, as a matter of fact, it is when Britishers are in the tightest corner that they fight the hardest. As I said before, our party is a militant party ; and when the clouds are darkest we show our fighting power. I hope that the Labour party will never cease to be militant, not only in Australia, but throughout the world.  listened with attention to the honourable member for Maranoa, and, whatever may be said as to the value or otherwise of this debate on the Address-in-Reply, it has certainly been given a value on the present occasion. The honourable member, at an early stage, gave us to understand clearly that, no matter how far the Labour party may have gone in the past, they intend to go a great deal further in the future. It is well that the country should know and understand clearly what the intentions are of both the great parties. I do not quite understand, however, the position of the honourable member for Maranoa in one particular. He rejoices in the fact that this is a free Parliament, by which I understand he means a Parliament in which every man is free to express his views and act according to his convictions and the pledges to his constituents. At a later stage of his remarks, however, although he had spoken of men being free to fight their life's battles according to their own judgment, he expressed the opinion that a free labourer is the meanest thing on earth..   the logic of that position. If it to be free in Parliament, it is good for loyalty is expected of us. 'every man and woman in the community be free. We have prided ourselves on great measure of freedom which our stitution has conferred on us. But a ceases to be free, when others, who speak in the name of freedom  their proper name-scabs ? I loathe scab!",37
151,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order 1  dress-in-Reply, I have first to compliment the Prime Minister on the fact been appointed to the Privy Council; and is, therefore, entitled to the prefix of "" Right Honourable."" This, although I British understand the honourable gentleman belongs to a Socialistic party, elevates him considerably above every other person the ranks of that party. I have also compliment the Prime Minister on his return, vigorous and able to discharge duties of his office. It is, however, a claimed cause of regret to me that gentleman yesterday gave us so very little higher information about what was done at the Imperial Conference. The country is titled to know much more than the Prime Minister deigned to tell us; there is justification for complaint on this score. It would, perhaps, be improper for a private member to take up the time of the House in dealing with such a subject, with what information has filtered to through the press regarding it. If the press has misrepresented the Prime Minor ister, the fact that he, yesterday, failed put the right construction on the news, titles us to regard what has been stated as fact. I understand that a with very important deputation waited on of the Prime Minister when he was in London attending the Imperial Conference, and according tq a newspaper report, it presented practically £50,000,000. In other words, it was representative of the gentlemen who are contributing very largely to the great powers of development that we possess, since they provide us with the tal necessary to carry out our works. _ The first of the two matters regarding this putation to which I wish to refer is that, the course of the discussion which took place the Prime Minister chose to regard British investors as absentees. A good has been said as to loyalty and lip loyalty, but if we form an integral part of the Briis good tish Empire, something more than lip We need to to strengthen every tie that binds us to the the different parts of the Empire; and I venConture to suggest that the action of the preman sent Government in requiring British investors to pay double rates under the Federal Land Tax Act, passed at their instance, shows that they do not recognise the true by principles of loyalty. It is all very well a for us to proclaim our loyalty; but if we impose additional charges upon men who are Britishers, just as we are, then, whatwe may say to the contrary, we show in effect that we are not true to them as that he has brother Britishers.",38
152,Mr CANN,Unknown,"The Federal Land Tax Act does not impose a double tax on absentee investors in Australia.  in events, a higher rate than is imposed on to resident land-owners. The Prime Minister safe more than Once, during the course of the the interview to which I have referred, prothe fact that he regarded these Brithe honourable opinion, they aswere tish investors absentees, and that, in his justly entitled to pay rates under our progressive land tax because they did not reside in Australia. enHe was told that it was an abuse of the English language to describe these British and I feel investors as absentees.",38
153,Mr SCULUN,Unknown,"They are absentees.  and within the Empire, and are, so to speak, us really part of the Empire. If they chose to take up their residence on the Continent, in America, I would freely admit that to they had ceased to be part and parcel of enthe Empire; but inasmuch as they are residents of Great Britain, and provide us the capital necessary to carry on many our developmental works, we are entitled to treat them as fellow Britishers. We ought to give them every advantage that reshould be extended to those who are prepared to render us the essential assistance which, capital really means to Australia. The other point to which I desire to refer, as arising out of this deputation, relates to capithe statement made by the Prime Minister that there never was a time when there were defewer strikes and industrial troubles in in Australia than there were then. When the right honourable gentleman was speaking yesterday, he said that strikes had not indeal terfered with production very much.",38
154,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Quite right. ,38

When the curacy of the Prime Minister's statement was questioned by the deputation, he reThat plied, "" Well, I thought I knew something of Australian affairs."" But what is the actual position ? I was so tickled with his Mr Stead. statement as to there being fewer strikes in Australia at the present time than has ever been before, that I determined to take a note of the number of strikes ported from day to day in the the very issue of the newspaper in which the report of the deputation appeared, read of a strike of ironmoulders at Perth. In its next issue-13t h July-ther e was report of a strike of coal wheelers castle, and of a miners' strike at Powlett wavNorth; on the 14th a strike of glassbevellers, ancl an eight-weeks' strike of colliers at Teralba. On the isth> no less than four strikes were reported, whilst on has the 18th reports of two other strikes peared.",39
157,Mr CANN,Unknown,"Would the honourable memwe ber have them all occur together?  plore is that the Prime Minister should Jack, have sought to deceive the people of Great Britain regarding an important matter this kind. He made the statement that there never was a time when there were fewer strikes in Australia; yet the papers of the day report strike after strike. Notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Parliament, from its inception, has been legislating with a view to obviating their occurrence, it is found impossible to prevent them. In connection with the Imperial ference there was published in the press a statement which was denied by the Prime Minister, and that is the statement was published at the instance of Mr. It appeared in an interview with Prime Minister, in which, he used expropressions of disloyalty to the Empire. I was very glad indeed to read his denial of",39
158,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Would the honourable member have been more pleased for party purposes if the statement had been true?  party purposes, but for the best interests of this great country. In view of that denial of the right honourable gentleman, I regret very much indeed the statement not which he made here yesterday, and that to was that if Great Britain went to war it would not be a question of our navy cowith the British Navy, but rather prea question of whether the Government and acthe Parliament of the day would permit our navy to co-operate with Great Britain. is his position, and I assert that it is as much a position of disloyalty to Great Britain as was the statement published by",39

160,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"It is tantamount to resaying "" We will think about the matter press. In when the time comes.""  I denied the truth of Mr Stead's allegation. Before it was understood that he would a contradict the report, the labour Call reat Newferred to the Empire in this disloyal The report of the interview with Andy Fisher just before leaving the Fog City, wherein he stated a few straight out facts re the Empire, staggered the spineless boodleistic press that is at present attempting by lies nnd corapruption to run Australia. This is how Andy puts it - "" We recognise that our territory is subject to attack by England's enemy, and if were threatened we should have to decide whether to defend ourselves, or, if we thought that the war was unjust and England's enemy the right, we should haul down the Union hoist our own flag, and start on our own."" No doubt the Labour Leader had the episode of of the infamous Boer War in his mind's eye. That is the attitude of a very considerable section of the community upon whom the newsPrime Minister and the party opposite depend for political support. No matter how loud they may be in their proclamations of loyalty, the fact remains that a considerable section, bolstered up by a section of the press which honourable members Conopposite recognise, is prepared to give utterance to these disloyal sentiments.",39
161,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Probably with a which circulation of 20,000.  the circulation of this journal is, but is the attitude which it has taken up.",39
162,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"That is not a solitary instance.  I heard a disloyal expression uttered in chamber. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the openmeeting, ing Speech refer to what is being done regard to our Naval and Military Forces7. Steady progress is being made in the construction of the ships for the Australian Navy. That is satisfactory. 8. During the recess the system of universal training under the Defence Act has been successfully inaugurated, and the patriotic response by the youth of Australia to the call to prepare themselves for the defence of their country is very gratifying. That reads well, but in his speech yesterday the honourable member for North Sydney quoted a resolution carried by 700 men, showing how utterly opposed they are to the defence policy, because, in their opinion, the forces might be used to tyrannize over Labour. I .wish to give an illustration of what is being done in another important part represented by the Postmaster-General, because we are entitled to know what is the attitude of those who support the Labour party outside Parliament. At a meeting of the Amalgamated Miners Association, which was held two or three days ago, the following resolution in connection with the Lithgow strike was carriedThat this association is appalled at and disgusted with the action of the New South Wales Ministry in sanctioning the transference of a large body of paid assassins to Lithgow for the purpose of bludgeoning the workers into submission in the cause of the capitalists; and we repudiate any action taken by Mr Griffith, as representative of this district, and call upon him to immediately show cause why he should not either resign from the Ministiy or his seat as a representative of Sturt; and we further call upon the B.D.A.P.L.L. to call upon Mr.. Griffith for his personal explanation regarding the matter. At the instance of the present Government we committed ourselves to a measure of oompulsory training which was largely in excess of any proposal made by a previous Government, yet that is the attitude of those persons outside who are supporting Ministers. They are really prepared to take up a position of antagonism to the military, because they might be used to enforce law.",40

The facts which I have quoted show how deeply rooted is the aversion of these men to the policy that is considered necessary for the preservation of law and order ",40
168,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Is the honourable member in favour of sending the military lo help to suppress a strike?  Government enforcing law and order, and if a ' Government ceases to discharge its duty in that respect it ought to be supplanted. In reference to naval defence I wish to quote an extract from the Pastoralists' Review of 15th July, 1911. That journal makes a most important statement with regard to our naval affairs. The determination and desire of this Parliament were that we should have an Australian Navy manned by Australian sailors; that, in fact, it should be essentially Australian in its characteristics. I should like to hear the explanation of the Minister of Defence in regard to the allegations made in this extractAs a matter of fact, from the moment of the arrival of the, new boats in Australian waters the locally enrolled men have been steadily leaving, and it now appears that of the sixty-four men who went to Europe to bring out the boats only twenty remain. The ostensible reason given by the men for this defection is that instead of receiving the wages they expected, these are being cut down by deductions of various kinds, and an example quoted is that of a stoker petty officer, whose pay is supposed to be 6s. 6d. a day, but who only receives actually js. ad. Another point raised is that preference is being given to Imperial naval pensioners who are being given special conditions, but, as a matter of fact, when it was found that Australians would not keep the billets, it became imperative to find others to take their places, and the only trained men available were old naval men. The article concludes as follows :In short, the attempt to man Australian of-war with Australian men is a ghastly failure, and we should recognise it before it is too late.",40
169,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Does the honourable member know whether a reply has been made to those statements?  may be satisfactorily answered, but if the facts are as reported we are faced with a bad lookout for the Australian Navy. Speaking on Tuesday on the Supply Bill I raised a question relating fd cadets. I say again that it is a great mistake, indeed, to disband the existing cadets until the Government are prepared to proceed vvith their complete scheme. A number of lads were receiving, under the cadet system, a good and effective training. They were proud of their uniforms. To drop them and deprive them of their uniforms, as has been the case in numberless country towns, is, in my opinion, a very great mistake.",41
170,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Was it only the uniforms of which they were proud?  a soldier being proud of his uniform one means that he is proud of the part he is taking in defending his country. I also think that it would be well if the Government would take into consideration the increased cost of living in this country. There should have been a reference to the subject in the Governor General's Speech. It is a good thing to give workmen good pay, and to increase the purchasing power of the money which they earn. Unfortunately the increased cost of living appears to be world-wide, though it is attended with greater gravity in Australia than elsewhere. This is one of the problems which we shall have to consider, and I am surprised that the Government have not intimated their intention to deal with it. I intend to quote an instance which has come to light in connection vvith contracts for the military service, and which shows the increased cost of articles which the Government have to purchase. This fact illustrates what is going on generally in the community. Every housewife in Australia knows that she cannot today finance her household with anything like the money that was sufficient five or six years age. The extract which I desire to bring under notice of the House is as follows :The Acting Minister for Defence recently called for tenders for supplying 1,800 sets of harness for the completion of the war equipment of the existing Defence Force. Only twomentenders were submitted, and in regard to these the Minister expressed astonishment on finding' that the prices, on the average, were about £ 3 per set higher than last year's contract, and £ 5 higher than English prices. He stated that every facility had been given to the tenderers, so that tradesmen in a small way of business could tender for any paTt of the whole requirements. The result, as above stated, was only two tenders, and the prices so upset the Minister that he has threatened to place the order in England. What is the principal factor in the cost of every article which we consume?",41
171,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The profits of the rings.  principal item in the cost of production is the cost of labour.,41
172,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It does not average 20 per cent, over the whole range of production.  everything that we consume is labour. Capital itself is the outcome of labour.",41
173,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I am glad that the honourable member admits that.  a proposition? I venture to say that the subject is one which this House ought very seriously to consider. By successive strikes ancl incessant strife in the Labour world the cost of production has been inordinately increased, and that increase of cost is having its effect upon prices. Wages Boards and Arbitration Court decisions have increased wages. Nevertheless, the people concerned find that they are in no better position. The honourable member for Maranoa said, a few minutes ago, that it was the poor men who were striking. Such is not the case. The legislation affecting labour is in the interests of the workers who are best able to defend themselves. The working men who are enjoying increased wages are those who are affected by the decisions of various Courts; but the persons who, by reason of that legislation, are unqualified to take work in the protected trades have been placed in a much worse position. The obvious effect of this policy is to drive the condition of those workers down, and down, and down.",41
174,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"They are the persons whom we wanted to benefit by the posals made at the referenda.  So far from benefiting those who are unable to protect themselves, honourable memrect statement. beres opposite are pursuing a line of action wnich is maling their condition worse it was before. I now come to a very imH all . portant question. It is : Can a union or labour-controlled Government really govern? In my view, the true functions government are, first of all, the carrying into effect of certain legislative Acts, then to see that those Acts of Parliament are duly given effect and observed. do we find at the present time? We have Labour Government in power in this ParliaBen ment, in New South Wales, and in South Army recently. Australia. Is it not right and proper, upon occasions such as this, to consider some the things which are coming to pass? I was in Adelaide at the time of the great carriers' strike there, and to my dismay discovered that we had arrived at a stage Australian history when a Government ceased to govern. I say it is a sad sorry condition of things that in any portion of our great island continent be a Government that has become effete. Why was it effete? For the simple reason that the men on strike were unionists, and  Government. How could a Government supported by that section of the community enforce the law when those men placed themselves in opposition to it?",42
175,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"They did not try.  the honourable member says. I had in my possession, and I wish I had it now, a of one of the actual permits which were issued by labour unions on that occasion, giving a man a right, while he held permit, to do certain carting.",42

I am taking up in a strong position when I say that a labour had union controlled Government cannot enand force the laws of the country, if the men responsible for their return to power are there should opposed to those laws.",42
183,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Suppos e we admit that, what then? - We should be in a position of anarchy when those ruling would not be representative of the people, but a section of the community controlled by Labour unions and bosses. Let me refer honourable members to some remarkable circumstances attending the strike of That strike affected one of our rural industries, and copy had very important consequences. Though the unionists said they would not gather the Renmark fruit , at the last harvest the the fruit-growers succeeded in having it gathered without their a.ssistance. I say, Free men proved themselves a valuable asset to the comi f munity on that occasion. The unionists it were, of course, opposed to them, and or sought to enforce their opinions and viVws in a way contrary to the law.as established the in South Australia. The law was defied, and acting under instructions from his of union, a driver in the employment of one of the largest carrying firms in Adelaide declined to put on his waggon some cases of Renmark f r u it . For refusing to obey lawful orders the man was prosecuted and fined. Time was given him in which to pay the fine, and he was committed to gaol on refusal to pay it. So far the action taken is against my argument, because, up to that stage, the Government had succeeded in governing and in enforcing the law. But what was the position later, because we must look to the future?",42

185,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Is not that good theology ?  logy, but it is bad politics. We have to look to the future. A Mr SpelTman expressed the hope that the vine-growers in the Renmark district would have their vines spoiled by unskilful pruning. That is a nice proposal to destroy the assets of the country. Now, let me show what was the attitude of the unions who are responsible for the existence of the Verran Government. I should like to ask honourable members opposite if they know what it was? It is certainly as well that they should know. It is defined in the following statement:The workers are exceedingly disappointed with the Labour Government, and consider that Ministers were not adhering to true Labour principles in taking the action they did in connection with the trouble. The fining of the driver should not be possible in any State, especially where a Labour Government has control.",43
186,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,That is what they call justice. ,43
187,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member first says that the Government has no trol, and then that the unionists are pleased with the Government because it control. What in the name of heaven does he want?  that is' against my argument. I have said that, up to a certain point, the Governkeenly ment were firm, and had a man prosecuted and finedbut I am dealing with the attiduction tude of the unions, at large which vvas of antagonism; to the Government. The facts go to show that, with a Labour-concommunity, trolled Government,, when the unionists who are their backbone choose to take a position of. antagonism, the authorities the are unable to enforce the law.",43
188,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"The same thing might said of the British Government! and they are not a Labour Government:  Renmark strike a very important deputation of fruit-growers waited on the Chief Secretary of South Australia. I wish to show just how weak that Government vvas under the circumstances. Honourable members will recollect what occurred on the occasion in question. They will remember that certain houses were fired, that a number of draught horses were poisoned, and that one man was shot. These acts were the outcome of the lawlessness which prevailed because unionists were not allowed to tyrannize over free labourers. Yet this is the attitude vvhich the Chief Secretary of South Australia adopted towards these terrible crimes. He saidThe Government had done its best, and he hoped that the culprit would be discovered. Until they knew who fired the shot they could nol cast suspicion on any particular body of men. There were a great many evidences as to who was the culprit in that case, but no sufficient action was taken by the Government to determine his guilt. The Chief Secretary saidThe Government was not desirous that anything of this sort should go on. The Government could only do its best in the circumstances to meet the emergency. Is not that a lamentably weak position for a Ministry to take up- a Ministry whose function it is to give effect to the legislation vvhich has been enacted. I shall not pursue this matter further. I might have referred to the strike which is now in progress in the sugar industry in Queensland. How great and important its results may be it is impossible to foretell. I believe that honourable members opposite are very much divided as to what is the best thing to be condone in the circumstances. But the faci disremains that a large industry vvhich the has people of this country have subsidized heavily, and which has been granted a large measure of Protection-apar t from the bonus vvhich is paid for the production of sugar grown by white labour-is suffering as the result of a strike. Its effect will doubtless be a diminution in the proof sugar, and a very considerable one financial loss to many persons in the community. If these things are good for the very well, but I maintain that they are not. I hold that the position up which we have now reached is largely due to is fact that at the present time Australia governed by a faction vvho have come into power on a wave which, under more be sane circumstances, will recede. Indeed, . it is already receding. We have evidence of that. I might quote with great satisfaction the splendid result of the recent ferenda. As the Leader of the Opposition 'pointed out yesterday, honourable members upon this side of the House represent a majority of 250,000 people.",43

Only the other day, one honourable member said that a great change had come over the public mind during the past twelve months. In the Legislative Council of South Australia, the city of Adelaide has, for years past, been represented by a Labour man. But, unfortunately, the other day an opportunity arose for testing the will of that con- stituency. What was the result ?

199,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 f.m. ployers Union.  rejournment I made a statement that was slightly inaccurate. I said that a Liberal member had been returned in place of a Labour member to represent Adelaide in the Legislative Council of South Australia.. But the real facts strengthen my argument still more. At the general elections three Labour members were returned to the Legislative Council to represent Adelaide, and at a subsequent by-election, occasioned by the death of a Councillor who had been a Liberal, another Liberal was returned by a solid majority, notwithstanding a great fight put up by the Labour party. Another occurrence not calculated to cheer the hearts of Government supporters took place at Renmark recently. The hotel there is conducted on the Gothenburg system, the committee of management being elected annually by those on the Assembly rolls. Last year all - the committeemen were Labourites, but this year every one of them is a Liberal. That shows in a candipractical fashion the result of the Renmark strike, and how the people of the country view such disturbances. To show how impossible it is that a union or labourcontrolled Government can govern, let me bring under notice the position occupied by the Attorney-General during the Queensland sugar strike. That strike, although harmful to the capitalist, has been still more harmful to the men employed in the industry and those dependent on them. It was effected and encouraged very largely by reason of the fact that the Attorney General is also President of the Waterside Workers Union. It is well known that the unions work one with another, like so many wheels within wheels. KIN G O'MALLEY - Than k the Lord !  bring about disaster. How is it possible for the Attorney-General to rightly hold dual position of president of the union and administrator of the laws of the country? It is true that he said that if the unions went beyond a certain length he would have to consider his position, and was good enough to declare that he would retain office. He is the chief law not adviser of the Crown, bound by his oath posito maintain and uphold the law.",44
200,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He has done so. He has was as much right to be president of an employees union as the honourable member for Fawkner has to be president of the Em ber for Fawkner has never taken up a position antagonistic to the law, and has never been Attorney-General. A Government controlled by the labour unions-and the Australian Workers Union is the force behind the throne in this case-canno t enforce the law against the members of those unions when they are determined to defy it, as they do day after day, and year after year. The Labour party, or, to use its right name, the Socialist party, has boasted that it is united and solid.",44

202,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We have closed up our ranks since.  Alteration Monopolies Bill was before the House, the honourable member for Franklin asked the honourable member for South Sydney, who was speaking, what he would do if the railway men did not accept an award of the Federal Court. To that the honourable member for South Sydney repliedI believe that occasions must arise when neither an Arbitration Court nor a Wages Board will give satisfaction, and I hope that the will never come when the workers will give up their final right to strike.",45
203,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"I stand by that.  mean the misery and humiliation of the workers, and the destruction of industries. The Premier of South Australia, when asked, What about the right to strike? saidThere will be no right to strike recognised. When a Labour Government is in power it is just as necessary lo have law and order observed as at any other time, and if a majority of the people say through Parliament that the interests of the community demand a cessation of strikes, then they must cease. Here he was upon absolutely sound ground, but unfortunately, as his Government holds office by the favour of the unionists, if it takes a stand contrary to their demands it must go. It is impossible for a Labour Government, if it continues under the domination of the labour unions, to govern a country. We find that these Labour men are not a happy family. Perhaps, I should refer to them as Socialists, for I believe they have gained largely by taking a name to which they are not entitled. We, on this side, are as much "" labour "" men as they are. Let me refer also to the position taken up in regard to Mr Holman. He asserted the same rights in regard to the New South Wales Parliament as the honourable member for Maranoa asserted today, when he claimed that this was a free Parliament. Yet that man's right to private judgment, and liberty, and freedom of thought was seriously interfered with by these individuals. He will undoubtedlybe hounded out of the ranks of the Labour party, because he is not content to be subservient to their rule. That is another illustration of the fact that it is impossible for a Government to represent a section and still uphold the laws of the land. The position occupied by the Attorney-General is a most peculiar one. I suppose there is no man in this House who would figure publicly upon the platform as more opposed to the evils of landlordism than the present Attorney-General, yet he is not only a landlord, but a landlord of the worse type.",45
204,Mr HALL,Unknown,"It is a good job for the honourable member that the Attorney-General is at home sick.  I did not know he was sick, and if I could discontinue this argument after having started it, I should be glad to do so. The time Attorney-General is on all fours with the Minister of Home Affairs. Certainly, he does not make those absurd and stupid references to the officers of his Department that the Minister of Home Affairs does, but so far as landlordism is concerned he stands in practically the same position, except that he is rather worse. The Attorney General is a landlord, and owns a fine farm near Sydney.",45
205,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"He does not, now !  found a way of getting out of an untenable position. He leased that farm under conditions which apparently were not satisfactory to him, for he sought to eject his tenant. VVe must remember that he is the chief law adviser of the Crown, and is supposed to be intelligently acquainted with the operations and necessities of law, but what does he do? He attempts to enforce summary jurisdiction ; in other words, he is a democratic autocrat. If his tenant's position was not sound in law, the Attorney-General should have resorted to the proper processes of law to secure his ejection. Instead of that he went with a force of relatives and friends and sought to put the man off by force. He did not succeed on the first occasion, but he went again with reinforcements and succeeded in forcibly putting that man upon the public road. My honourable friends may laugh, but I do not think it strengthens their position in the country. The tenant felt aggrieved, and took action against the Attorney-General in the Courts, gaining a verdict for ^""250 damages and costs. The Attorney-General, who is supposed to have some knowledge of law and ought to know what law costs, was not satisfied.",45
206,Mr HALL,Unknown,"He is now !  satisfied but happy, because he appealed to the Full Court, which unanimously upheld the finding of the lower Court. The result of that case does not say much for the knowledge of law possessed by the Attorney-General, upon whom 1° apprehend the Prime Minister has to depend for legal instruction and guidance. I am sorry the Ministerial benches are almost empty, and should be very glad if the Minister of Trade and Customs could be induced to enter the chamber to hear what I am about to say. Shortly before His Excellency the State Governor, Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael, left Victoria he paid an official visit to the Denton Hat Mills. He was received by Mr Beazley, the Chairman of Directors of diat extensive company, who in the course of his remarks saidOwing to inability to obtain the requisite labour, trade which ought to be done here was being forced into foreign channels. A statement of this kind, coming from a man connected with one of the large industries of the Commonwealth, is most important. It shows that the want of labour is preventing the development of an industry which might be more profitably conducted in the interests of the community generally, - as well as of the shareholders. In the same newspaper there is a speech by Mr Swinburne, which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister of Trade ancl Customs, who disapproves of .anything in the form of destructive monopolies. Mr Swinburne is thus reported"" Preference to unionists means unionist monopoly,"" said Mr Swinburne, M.L.A., last evening at a largely attended referendum ing at the Kev Recreation Hall. He pointed out that the proposals of the Labour party emhodied the purpose of preference to unionists, which would <1J away with the common rule laid down by the Wages Boards. What unionist monopoly meant might be gathered from Tecent events. There was here a union of employees in the making of felt hats. within its ranks every man working in the industry, and forbade chances of employment to non-unionists. A few months ago a number of hatters came from England. They had clearances from the organization to which they belonged in England, but they were kept nut of the union here. That union wanted employment to be restricted to its existing members. However, as the result of exposure, and in shame and sheer disgrace, the union ultimately admitted the men from England, but laid it down that in future men should not be admitted until they had resided in Victoria' for several months, and had paid an entrance fee of £20. Mr Tudor (the Minister of Customs) was a member of that union. The honourable member for Yarra, as I have said, is against anything in the form of destructive monopolies, and yet he is a member of a union which prohibits others joining; and I say that that is a most invidious position, such as no Minister of the Crown ought to occupy.",46
207,Mr HALL,Unknown,"How much does the honourable member think it costs to join the lawyers' union?  ought to be judged on its own merits; and I contend that it is not a tenable position for a member of this House to express his opposition to combinations restrictive of trade, and yet to belong to a union with rules and conditions having the effect of preventing men from joining it, and of providing that none but unionists shall be employed. At the same time, as I have already pointed out, an industry is being stifled owing to the absence of necessary labour. A case of this kind must appeal to the common sense of the community. I am assuming, of course, that the statements I have read are true, inasmuch as they have never been challenged; but if they are not true, the Minister of Trade and Customs will have an opportunity to lay the facts before us.",46
208,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Where did that report appear ?  Argus, in April, of this year, and it is a speech made by Mr Swinburne. Honourable members opposite may say what they like as to their general desire for an increased population; but, as a matter of fact, every time a practical suggestion is made to that end they are against it. I meet- was astounded yesterday afternoon to hear the Prime Minister say that the present Government were responsible for filling the ships with the emigrants now on their way to this country. That is a claim which cannot for one moment be substantiated, seeing that everything done to promote imTt had migration has been done by the State Governments-and that no practical step has - been taken by the Federal Labour party to introduce the labour necessary for this country.  the one man who said in this House that nine immigrants could not get in the country, and who asked this Parliament to give them tucker 1  There is not ati industry in the land toof day that is not suffering from a dearth labour.

The only point that I wish to make is that the cook to whom I was referring justified his claim for an increase of wages on the ground that shearers, who work eight hours a day, earn as much as £ 2 per day. This goes show that the position is not altogether unsatisfactory from the workers' point of view. I certainly do not grudge them their pay. So far as the shearers are connot cerned.

There is only one other matter to which I desire to allude. I have before me a copy of a series of at one resolutions adopted by the South Australian r sented in due form to the Postmaster: General on the 17 th February last.

Is it not a fact that the results anticipated are not produced ? If one has business at the Lands Office one has to wait sometimes for months obtain information which, if the Department were under private control, would be the forthcoming in a week. All sorts of disabilities adversely affecting the interests of the people also exist in connection with the that Postmaster-General's Department. Things which ought to be done rapidly are left un^ done. Untenable positions are taken up: Yet the public are powerless to obtain redress j and even members of Parliament, although using all the influence that they are able to bring to bear, find it impossible to to do so. That being so, seeing that in connection with all public Departments, State and Federal, there is great dissatisfaction, and a condition of things which is of the best, should we be justified in enlarging the Government's sphere of opera' tions, and giving them control of all industries? My honourable friends opposite will say that, although that might not be in the interests of the public, it would; nevertheless, be in the interests of those to be employed.

The first resolution readsThat drastic action he taken to secure for postmasters some recompense for being, under the classification of 1904, robbed of the allowances which, under the State, were officially declared to be part of their salary; also to secure payment of the increments due under State law and withheld under the same scheme. That is pretty strong. It goes to show what the honourable member for South Sydney professes not to know-that there is dissatisfaction in the Public Service. This pamphlet, it should be noted, was issued in July last. The second resolution readsThat, in the matter of promotion and transfer, the notoriously unfair treatment of telegraphists in South Australia, as compared with clerks in other branches of the Department, anil Also as compared with their fellow telegraphists in the Eastern States, be strongly resented, anil a demand be made that they be put on an equal footing with the clerks and telegraphists referred to. I venture to say that you can go through any of the Departments under the control t)f the Government, and find evidences of great dissatisfaction on the part of the - employees. If under Government control the administration of the existing Departments is unsatisfactory to the public on the one hand, and mast unsatisfactory to the employees on the other, wherein lies the strength of the argument of my honourable friends opposite who would bring every industry in the land under Government - control?

He took the Ministry and also the party to book for much of the legislation which has been placed on the statute-book-for what they have not done, and for what they should have done. At the beginning of his address he objected to the Labour Government taxing absentees more than the the citizens of Australia. I feel certain that ninety-nine and a half per cent, of its people will admit that it is quite justifiable to charge persons in other lands, who derive large fortunes from Australia, for its defence, seeing that they can give only money, not their blood, if war should take place.",49

Much has been said here about loyalty to Great Britain. The honourable member for Echuca is one of those who feel strongly that they are loyalists in every sense of the word. ",49

Not alone, but in common with honourable members on his side, he endeavoured to make out that those on this side are so disloyal that tliey would throw over the Old Country at any time it suited them. In spite of the fact that it may not be popular to say so, I do not believe that there is anything commendable in saying, "" My country, right or wrong."" I do not think that that is a fair stand for any man to take. If you were to carry out that idea, to its natural conclusion, it would mean that you would have to commit perjury, because, if it is to be your country, right or wrong, it must be your home, right or wrong; and, irrespective of any injury which you may do to others, you must take a stand and swear that it is in the right. I am one of those who will not believe that that is a proper attitude to take. Then, again, honourable members on the other side talk of loyalty to the Old Country, if we differ in any sense from British legislation, in the making of which we have not a word.

When a man feels inclined to criticise any action of the British Government, it is to make a play of the word "" loyalty "" to charge him with being disloyal. We have heard a great deal about strikes. The honourable member for Echuca has been trying to show that if the ideals of Socialism entertained by some of us were carried into effect the turmoil and strife that are sometimes witnessed in the industrial world today would be imported into the Public Service. The honourable member says that there has been dissatisfaction in the Public Service. Of course. I do not blame those men who weie dissatisfied. The honourable member should bear in mind that what has caused all the trouble is the fact that Governments in the past have starved the PubService. It was not a Labour Governis uttered ment that did that.",50
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Labour party the previous Governments in office.,50
240,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"My honourable has sitting with him the memthose Governments, or as many of them as are .left; and I trust that he - will not be able to handle them better than we did. The honourable member for Echuca referred to the enormous number of strikes in conmy nexion with private employment, and conmemtended that there would be more if the whole of the industries and utilities the affected were carried on under a state disof Socialism. After arguing that the Prime Minister was in error in saying that were fewer strikes in Australia now not than ever there were, the honourable member enumerated a list of strikes which have occurred, and then compared them with the trouble vvhich has existed in the Public Service. He knows very well that it is the right of man to be dissatisfied with his posiand to strive to improve it if he can. No one can fairly find fault with any one I who does so. My honourable friends oppoalways charge the wage-earner with Gobeing responsible for strikes. They never attribute any of the responsibility to those whom they themselves represent here-the employing section of the community, those who have vested interests, and whose methods often bring about the strikes that occur. Honourable members opposite lament the fact that today the military cannot be called out by a Capitalistic Government to shoot down people. They say that we are jubilant because such a thing cannot now take place. Let me say that if a Labour Government were to call out troops to shoot down men who often cause strikes, namely, the Capitalistic class, such action would not be a bit more condemnable than was the conduct of Capitalist Governments in the past, when they called out troops to shoot down the workers. But what is good for the workers evidently is not good for the Capitalistic section of the community, who are wild because they have lost the power they once had. We quite understand, however, that when every man in the community is trained to the use of arms, there is not so much possibility of calling out soldiers to shoot people down as there was in the past.",50
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Me n have been shot down in countries where every man is trained to arms.,51
242,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"When every one is trained, every one recognises that if he takes part in shooting down his fellow men he may himself be placed in a position of being shot down on another occasion. Consequently, any Government would think twice, under these circumstances, before they called out one section of the workers to shoot down another. Even in European countries, Governments may find a difficulty in future in calling out their troops shoot down other men belonging to the same class.",51
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The troops were called out for that purpose in France the other day.,51
244,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I know that.,51
245,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"And we have never had any troops called out to shoot down people j never at any time, as the honourable member is well aware.",51
246,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kooyong, like myself, is a Victorian, and he remembers the trouble that occurred in 1890 as well as I do.",51
247,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"Ver y well indeed, and that is my distinct recollection of what occurred.",51
248,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member recollects the charge against a man who died lately. I do not wish to revive old sores, but I do know that, in the position that I filled at one time in the Labour movement, I was well acquainted with the fact that we were preparing for an occasion when members of the Military Service would resist the troops who were brought out at that time to keep the workers in order.",51
249,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Shoul d they not be kept in order?,51
250,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Disorde r was caused by the Government of the day, and it behoves all Governments",51
251,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Does the honourable member believe in law and order?,51
252,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Of course I believe in law and order j but I do not believe in the kind of law and order that is supposed fo be enforced in Lithgow today, where the man Hoskins is goading men to resistance so that he can call for the military to shoot them down. It is he who is bringing about disorder where there ought to be law and order, as honourable members opposite know very well.",51
253,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The honourable member must be hard up for something to say.,51
254,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"We experienced in the past the fear of certain things that might be done, but which cannot be done now. Members of the Opposition do not like the change. They are ready enough with their condemnation when they think die wage-earners are to blame, but when they know that the other side is equally, to if not more, to blame, we do not find them so readv to condemn. Since this Parliament met last year, our party have endeavoured to carry into effect that which was promised on the hustings at the last election, namely, that we would endeavour to alter the Constitution in order to bring about a proper system whereby the workers of Australia could appeal to the Courts and get satisfaction of their claims, instead of resorting to the old method of strikes; and also whereby trusts and combines, such as exist in connection with many utilities in Australia today, might be controlled. T admit candidly that I was hurt when I saw the result of the referenda on the 27th April.",51
255,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The honourable member is the first of his party to admit that he was hurt.,51

258,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The so-called Labour Government in New South Wales did more to injure the Labour movement, and bring about our defeat, than any other factor in the whole campaign, bar one. am content to leave those gentlemen in New South Wales to their electors, who, I feel certain, will deal very effectively with them in the near future. The second factor was that champion amongst gutter journals, the Age newspaper. What were the methods adopted by those in charge of that newspaper to defeat the referenda campaign? Twelve months ago, when the Bills providing for the taking of the referenda were under consideration in this House the Age jeered and laughed at the efforts of the Opposition in opposing them. blowing hot one day and cold the next, before the session was finished it was trimming its sails for the right-about-face that took place afterwards. This newspaper controlled by, I suppose, the ablest journalists in Australia, prostituted itself for a passing gain, and in order to defeat the Labour party. It was conducted in such a way as to reflect discredit upon those controlling it, and, I believe, to bring about, before very long, what they will thoroughly deserve, namely, the lowering of the circulation of the newspaper by about 75 per cent.",52
259,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,That will take a long time.,52
260,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"We shall see. lt needs only a new newspaper to secure the subscribers and the advertisers will f o llow. I agree that a newspaper may be justified in very severe criticism of a political party. The Argus has criticised us severely. It has upbraided the Labour party and ridiculed our policy, but it has, at least, been consistent. The other journal to which I refer, which with its wide circulation should be a source of, great good to the people of Victoria and Australia generally, for some passing whim or anticipated gain, turned completely round and circulated throughout this State articles supporting contentions entirely opposed to Of those'which it had submitted a few months previously. It is to this I attribute, in a large measure, the defeat of the referenda proposals, assisted by the money subscribed I to the Liberal party by the monopolists of Australia.",52
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Thing s have changed since the Attorney-General said that he turned to the Age like the needle to the pole.,52
262,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Parramatta has always jeered at me on the ground that I am here by the assistance of the Age newspaper. I never I received the assistance of the Age at any time. I admit that during the last election my speeches were reported in its columns, though that was not done before, but the Age never asked any one to vote for me, and had nothing to do with my return to this Parliament.",52
263,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,Perhaps that is the sore point.,52
264,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Not at all. I represent constituents who do things in spite of the Age newspaper. It could not turn any votes in my constituency during the reBut, ferenda campaign. The Labour proposals were carried there by a majority of two and a half to one. It is clear, therefore, that the Age exercises very little influence in my electorate when it plays the game fairly, and none at all when it acts crookedly as it did in the referenda campaign. I have no objection to severe criticism such as we get from the Argus, which is an avowed Conservative journal. But I do protest when I find the Age, which pretends to be Liberal, and the leader of Liberal thought in the community in an effort to put down the only Liberal party in Australia today, namely, the Labour party, resorting to rrjethods that reflect no credit on those responsible for it .",52
265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member is digging his own grave.,52
266,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable member for Parkes would care very much if I were. Let me give an example of the methods adopted by the Age. After giving every assistance to the Labour party when the referenda proposals were under consideration in this House the Age, as I have said, turned completely round, and we then found that side by side with brilliant articles by some of the ablest press writers in Australia there would be a column headed in black letters> "" The Fisher Jaunt."" When Mr Murray departed for. the Coronation there were no reflections passed upon him.",52
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How many people did Mr Murray take with him?,53
268,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am not to be drawn aside in that way, but I will say that had honourable members opposite been in power they would have found it necessary to take with them the omcers who attended the members of the present Government.",53
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No .,53
270,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I have said that, alongside an ably written article, there would be an article headed "" The Fisher Jaunt."" You, sir, know the Prime Minisvernment, ter better than I do, and he had associated with him on his visit to the Old Country the Minister of External Affairs and the Minister of Defence. It is difficult to imagine any three men less likely to go a jaunt. A good dinner would be lost on all three. Yet the Age newspaper pubthan lished articles suggesting that these were going on a jaunt to Europe merely campaign. for their own enjoyment, while the fact that Ministers were going to attend Imperial Conference was purposely concealed. It would be asserted that they were going to attend the Coronation to port themselves in knee breeches and cocked hats, and to show off their beauty to people of Great Britain. The Age writers charged Ministers with leaving Australia before it was necessary tn attend the Coroit nation, and had not the manliness to exto plain that it was necessary that they referenda proposals. should leave early to attend the Imperial Conference which preceded the Coronation festivities. It was no doubt felt that ing the referenda campaign people who would be prepared to vote for the Labour proposals might be prevented from doing so by the publication of unfair statements suggesting that Ministers were going to the Old Country on a jaunt instead of to atwould tend the Imperial Conference.",53
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member really think that such tactics would induce the electors to vote against the enda proposals ?,53
272,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable memat ber knows just as much as I do about tricks to which newspapers will resort. After an interval of a few days the journal published another article'which was headed in big letters, "" The Labour Goknowledge vernment's policy. ^82,000,000 in deviously fence."" [8]",53
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"^82,000,000 ? Mr MATHEWS!-Yes , that is how the Age newspaper paraded the matter. Had it been truthful it would have pointed out that that expenditure did not represent the Labour Government's policy in reference to defence, but the complete scheme suggested by Admiral Henderson. However, any stick was good enough to beat the Labour party with at the referenda. The Age knew perfectly well that the Conservative element was not opposed to the expenditure of money upon defence, but it was also aware that ^82,000,000 would be regarded by the Democrats of Victoria as an enormous sum for a Labour Goto spend in that way. These were the electors which that journal persuaded to vote against the Ministerial proposals in many of the constituencies. We all know that a newspaper which day after on day hammers at one phase of a question must exert more influence with its readers any speaker-n o matter how able he men may be-ca n do during the course of a",53

275,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member, 1 may say without any disrespect, disis new to this House, and I do not think that he understands the position which is the occupied by the Age newspaper. These were big questions. But that journal was not satisfied to deal with big questionsresorted to petty, contemptible methods induce the electors to vote against the For instance, it harped continually upon the waste of puhlic money which was involved in the visit of dura parliamentary party to Papua. That visit was the outcome of a belief in this House that honourable members ought to be possessed of more knowledge of Papuan affairs than they were. Consequently, the Minister of External Affairs stated that, he give them an opportunity of visiting that dependency. When the project was first mooted there were fifty members of this Parliament who were willing to underrefertake the trip. Of course, we all know that any honourable member, if he feels so inclined, can visit any portion of Australia any time, and have his fare paid by the the Commonwealth. But the idea underlying the trip to Papua was that during the recent same recess honourable members should be afforded an opportunity of gaining a fuller of that Territory than they prepossessed. Only four days before polling-day the Age published an article upbraiding those who were about to visit I'apua,. and. declaring that the trip was a form of political corruption. The very next dav the Leader of the Opposition walked 'into the"" Department of External Affairs and withdrew his name from the list of those who intended to make it. 1 wonder if he thought that the visit was a form of political corruption. I do not think that he did. But so strong was the Age article that the party which visited .Papua did not include a single member of the Opposition. They were afraid of the Age. The idea of a newspaper with such a large circulation as that journal enjoys, lowering itself to score a point ing the referenda campaign by charging the Ministry with corruption merely because they had made arrangements by which honourable members might visit Papua to obtain first-hand information about that dependency !",53
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What would the honourable member do with that terrible journal ?,54
277,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member will make me believe presently that he has' been whitewashed. The Age has swallowed a lot during its career, and it may even swallow the honourable member, but it will require a good many digestive pills to enable, it to accomplish the feat.  the Opposition the blue funk?",54
278,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I think it was the Age which did it. It endeavoured to frighten the members of the Labour party from taking the trip, but it was unsuccessful. I might mention many other articles which were published in that journal with a view to persuading the electors to vote against the referenda proposals. It painted the Government in such terrible colours it achieved its object. It was this sort tactics, combined with the large amount of money which was expended by the Liberal leagues, that resulted in the defeat of the Government proposals. In Victoria alone the Liberal League must have spent £60,000 or £70,000. I have heard, too, that in New South Wales men in high positions had £750 placed to their creditto cover their expenses during that campaign. I know that in my own electorate money flowed very freely, and that money did not come from members of the Opposition.",54
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I never saw any of it.,54
280,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am satisfied that nothing less than ,£50,000 paid the expenses incurred by the Liberal League in Victoria.",54
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Now the honourable member is coming down in his estimate. The Attorney-General said that the expenditure was £250,000.",54
282,Mr WEST,Unknown,"It was £100,000 in New South Wales alone.",54
283,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I admitted at the outset of my remarks that I felt very sore over the defeat of the referenda proposals. Recent events have shown the power of monopolies, like the sugar monopoly, and when a vote is taken again, the people will durnot allow themselves to be led away by arguments like those which appeared in the Age. We had not the means of educating our people sufficiently, and could not successfully combat the influence of that journal. We were told that if we had' asked merely for the power to restrain monopolies, we should have got it. But, however much the legislative powers were mixed together, the power to nationalize was submitted separately. Nationalization ' is the only effective way of dealing with monopolies, and at the present time the Age is trying, ineffectively, to prove that the Government should start a national sugar refinery to put an end to the sugar monopoly. Although they were against us when we asked for power to deal with trusts, they say now that legislation of a drastic character is necessary to break up the Sugar Combine. In support ot their contention that the Government could establish a sugar refinery, they quote an American decision which was accepted by Justices Isaacs and Higgins in the Harvester Excise case, but overruled by the majority of the High that Court. Of course, the only object of the of Age is to' make the people believe that the Labour party could do something which it does not want to do. . The Age has also published a series of articles upon the laziness of honourable members. No doubt, they really attack the Opposition; but do not care to do so openly. In the last article, they spoke of the poor tired members of this House starting work after nine months of luxurious ease, and referred to the Ministers as if they had done nothing during the recess. I know that flesh and blood could not have done more than the Ministers did during the recess, and that a Labour member is more fully employed when the House is not sitting than when it is sitting. The Age writers know it, too. While the Opposition members can afford to treat their constituents with contempt, we cannot do so, and we do not wish to do so. Articles such as I refer to will eventually bring the Age into contempt, and have already greatly reduced its influence.  member know the cure?",54

I have been almost a prohibitionist, and would keep out of the try every article that could be manufactured in it ; but until we are able to protect the men who sent me here, I shall not vote for any further protection to the manufacturers. During the referenda campaign, the Age said that the workers already enjoy Protection. I deny it. It declared that myself new Protection was given by means of Victorian Wages Boards and similar triwere bunals in other States. I deny that the Wages Boards, as they exist, give Protecneeds tion to the workers in anything like the it to you."" same sense that the manufacturers are protected by the Customs duties. When, at the end of last year, the Victorian Council and the Assembly were fighting over the appointment of Wages Boards for certain trades, the Age warned the former refusing to appoint such Boards if was playing into the hands of the Labour party. The Council, nevertheless, persisted. We have many callings in which the wages and conditions of labour are not affected in any way by legislation. Yet they say that we have the new Protection ; they write articles, and get the manufacturers clamour for more Protection. The honorno able member for Echuca quoted what was said about the dearth of hatters. Another hat manufacturer, not' connected with the Denton Hat Mills, stated, in replying to toast, that more Protection was Australia on hats, as the importations were enormous, and finished up by saying, "" And we cannot get workmen enough to perform the work we have now."" These gentlemen, while they clamour for more Protection, want to import more workers to perform the work they have now. It must mean one of two things. Do they want workers brought here in larger numbers, to bring down the wages of those who are here already? If their trade Has gone off for the want of more Protection, why do they clamour for more workers to do it? We hear the manufacturers of Australia say that they cannot get workmen, and yet in all the strikes, such as those mentioned by the honourable member for Echuca, they say they can get black-legs enough to fill the vacancies twice over. They can never get labour in the. ordinary market, but when there are thousands of men out of work, apparently, they can get all the labour the}' want from the black scum of Australia. They ought to be consistent in their statements, or keep silent.",55

288,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I am talking about the present position. The manufacturers object to filling in the form, and they will not say what they object to. The honourable member for Parramatta knows that when the last Tariff was before this House I fought for as high duties as I could get. to I worked night and day for Protection, ancl one in this House will doubt that, in spite of the Age newspaper. If the manufacturers of Australia are really in earnest in their demand for more Protection, there a is nothing in the form put before them that wanted'in can do them any injury.",55
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The Minister wants them to show their profits.,55
290,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Exactly ; and 1 know the honourable member would do the same, if he were asked to give more Protection. The greatest contention put forward is that, because higher wages are paid in Australia than in other places, it is necessary to impose high duties as a compensation. But the peculiarity, and I speak as a Protectionist, is that there is no industry in Australia that pays as high a percentage of wages as is represented by the duty protecting that industry.",56
291,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We wanted MCKay to show his profits when the party apposite gave him a protective duty; but they would not support us.,56
292,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"-The honourable member is quite right. At that time. I expected fair dealing from the manufacturers of Victoria, and trusted them; but I shall not trust them and the Age newspaper any more, so far as that matter is concerned. T know we shall be taunted with deserting our principles, and honourable members will very shortly see me quoted by the Age as a Free Trader. If there was one ""action more than another that ruined the chances of higher Protection being granted to any commodity, it was that of the agricultural implement makers in refusing to give what they ' promised, after being granted higher Protection by this Parliament. In 1906, when the fixed duty of J£T2 per machine was imposed, they promised that they would give fair wages;-but when they obtained the duty, and secured the increased work, they broke their pro-mise. MCKay almost lived in the House during that time, and he and his company have amassed enormous dividends out of the increased work they have obtained; but they refused to give the workers what they promised. When they took the matter to the High Court, and it was proved that the conditions we made were unconstitutional, it sounded the death-knell of new Protection in Australia. ""The Victorian present. manufacturers who suffered because of the action of the - agricultural implement makers, swarmed round them like a 'lot of bees when the agricultural implement makers'- employees strike took place in Melbourne this year.",56
293,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Was that strike for wages? """,56
294,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Yes . ',56
295,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,"It was question of the employment unionists,",56
296,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member knows what the fight was over. These were the facts : The Wages Board had been sitting for seven months, and had come to no decision. The union, knowing it was useless to strike while their ranks were not half filled, issued an order that there would be a strike if the members did not come in by a certain date. They all came in, with the exception of about fifty. The union were getting them into the ranks, in order to bring about the raising of wages, because they felt that unless they took action the Wages Board would never come to a decision. That is the worse of a Wages Board. Until the chairman gives a casting vote, you may never get a decision. The day after the strike was declared, and not before, the chairman came to a decision; and as to whether it was a question of wages or of unionism, I can only' say that the desire was to bring the men into the union in order that they might obtain the wages which were subsequently admitted to be fair. The Prime Minister, with a view of ' terminating the strike, communicated with the agricultural implement makers, and offered at that stage conditions which were not as good for the workers as the conditions eventually obtained. But the Chamber of Manufactures would not allow the agricultural implement makers to give way on the point; and a letter was received from that body saying in effect that the men must ""eat dirt""-that they must come back unconditionally. The manufacturers, instead of condemning the men who ruined Protection in Australia, gathered around them, and we know for what reason; they knew that the referendum was approaching. These men, through the newspaper which represents them, are clamouring to uswho have been sold over and over again - for more Protection, although we have no chance of Protection for thosewe reAs an individual, and a representative in this House, I intend to support the Minister ot Trade and Customsand the Government in the-stand they have taken.",56

303,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I do not say but 1 think the honourable member will agree with me that much of the imported wage. literature might be excluded with advantage. I feel just as keenly now as ever that we must make Australia a manufactells turing country as well as an agricultural and mineral producer. But that must done under the new order, and not under no Protection. the old order; and I say to those who believe with the Age newspaper that we have not now new Protection. Experience has taught that where we have two sets of men, one representing the wage-earners wage. and the other representing the employers, and a chairman who must have a leaning towards tht; employers, because of the. class from whom he is usually selected, the results are not satisfactory. that many broad-minded men have occuenough pied the position; but the result is new Protection.

Indeed, it sometimes occurred to me that perhaps the people of Australia might come to the conclusion that, after all, since no great harm had come to the country while Parliament was not sitting, it might be dispensed with for an even longer period. I feel sure, however, that we are all of one mind as regards the sittings of this Parliament being for the benefit of Australia. One matter which attracted the attention of the people of the Commonwealth during the recess was the representation of Australia at the Conference which met at the centre of the Empire, and was also associated with the Coronation of our King. The ' people of Australia undoubtedly watched the development of the proceedings and the work and the sayings of our representatives there with a good deal of interest. That interest was in many cases, f believe, not unmingled with a certain amount of apprehension, which grew to positive consternation on the part of many in view of what took place at the Conference. Even members of the Labour party-supporter s of the-Ministry throughout Australia-fel t very grave concern regarding those Ministers who had gone Home to represent them. They saw in the newspapers wonderful statements of their amazing retinue, and of .the curious and usual company into which they had entered at Home. When they discovered that these stern and uncompromising Democrats had yielded to the allurements of the Court of London, and were appearing amongst other representatives of the Empire in the unusual garments prescribed by Court etiquette, many of them, I have no doubt. wondered whether they were not being betrayed by men who had so rapidly forgotten those who had sent them to the centre of the Empire. While these, perhaps, were only trifles, they indicated to many what undoubtedly took placethey indicated a complacency, brought about by the environment of Ministers, which had a rather unfortunate effect on any reputation that they might have sought to achieve at the Conference. I was rather surprised to find it stated in London, and reported here within a week of the arrival Mr Fowler, of Ministers in that city, that they were prepared to put aside their opposition to I the Declaration of London.",57
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In one week?,58
320,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Yes. In view of the fact that those honourable gentlemen went away, as we were given to understand, determined to oppose the ratification of that agreement by the Conference, I have been waiting very anxiously to hear from them the reasons, which must have been sound and substantial, I presume, that caused them to waive any opposition to the ratification of that agreement.",58
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,About what was infinitely the most important matter dealt with by the Conference we have not heard a word.,58
322,Mr FOWLEE,Unknown,"It is one of the most important matters that have been discussed at any Conference of this kind for many years- a matter affecting, in my opinion, one of the most vital interests of the Empire, arid affecting the interests of Australia even more than those of the Mother Country. I am surprised, therefore, that no word has been uttered by the Prime Minister, or by either of those Ministers who accompanied him, as to the reasons which animated them in withdrawing their opposition to the ratification of that very important agreement. "" Mr. JOSEPH COOK - We ought to know why. The Australian representatives alone abstained from voting on the question.",58
323,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The people of Australia are entitled to hear the reason for un- this volte-face on the part of Ministers. We have not yet heard it, and I take it that it is due to the people of Australia that the Prime Minister should avail himself of an early opportunity to enlighten them in that respect. Reference has been made once or twice to one episode to which I find it necessary to allude again very briefly, in view of a statement made in connection with it in another place by the Minister of Defence. The people of Australia, I believe, read with a great deal of surprise and disgust that the Prime Minister had been in a manner lost in the Coronation procession in London. He was discovered, by, of course, the enterprising pressman, riding in a carriage with the Prime Minister of Canada, and surrounded by Canadian horsemen. The Minister of Defence in another place gave as a reason why the Prime Minister appeared in London without a representation of our Military Forces, such as the Prime Mipister of Canada had, that the object of will the Ministry was not to lead the people of Great Britain to think of the any Australians merely as a military nation. Just imagine for a moment how the people uf Great Britain, and the crowds in don on lhat occasion in particular, would have jumped unhesitatingly to the conclugretted, sion that Australia was a great military nation if: they had happened to see Prime Minister surrounded vvith a squadall ron of Australian horsemen. It indicates, to my mind, that the Minister of Defence - a man who previously had no inclination towards military matters at "" all-ha become so obsessed by his office that he is actually under the delusion that Australia is at the present time a great military nation, and that it was necessary to refrain from, sending a handful of troops to Lonclose don lest the people of Great Britain might become apprehensive of the great military domination which might be exercised Australia in regard to our interests in the Empire. Surely that is about the poorest excuse that could have been given for feature of that procession which most Aushas tralians deplore. Then the Prime Minister has conof gratulated himself and the people of the Australia upon the fact that he, for the first time, as we are given to understand, in the history of the Empire, was taken the confidences of the imperial Government. I want to know whether these confidences were of a personal nature; whether they were conveyed to the Prime Minister, not by virtue of his office, but for some other reason. If they were of an official nature, opportunity. do I understand that they are shared vvith his Ministers? If they are shared with his Ministers, I want to know, also, if they are criticism of another. shared with his party. If they are not shared with his party, then a very singular position has been created in connection with always be observed. the Labour movement. The Prime Minister, and his colleagues I presume, have secrets from their party, and these, we given to understand, are of very grave imand portance indeed. They are fraught with much significance to the Empire, and natuand rally to Australia, and yet the Labour party, the Labour organizations, the people who sent these gentlemen here, and made rather than our possible assailants. them the leaders of this Parliament at the present time, are in entire ignorance of subject-matter. If that is the position, apprehend that in the near future there will be some difficulty in the Labour movemost ment. The result, I apprehend, will be that the people who constitute this party insist that there shall be no secrets held from them by their Ministers; that, at rate, the members of the parliamentary party shall know them. Tf that is so, 1 ain very much afraid that the confidences Lonbestowed on the Prime Minister by the Imperial authorities will be somewhat: rein view of such a development. There is one feature of the Conits ference on vvhich I believe we can congratulate ourselves and the Prime Minister for his efforts in that direction, and that is the conviction which is growing upon the minds of our statesmen in the s Old Land- a conviction which has been present in the minds of most of us, I believe, in the outlying parts of the Empirethat the time has arrived when we must up our ranks and present as united a force as possible to whatever danger we may be likely to meet in the near future. There by is no doubt whatever of the urgency of these steps. We cannot shut our eyes to the growing danger of a war taking place that a will throw into the shade anything which occurred in the history of the civilized world; and it behoves Australia-and I think that we are all keenly realizing this late-to wake up and take her share of responsibility. That Australia is rousing herself in serious fashion to take up the work vvhich devolves upon her by reason into of her position I have no doubtwhatever. But there are some features in the attitude of some of our people which I , for one, very much deplore, and I wish to refer to them now, because I think it is a fitting Throughout the civilized world we observe a considerable amount of restraint exercised by one nation in its There is a kind of law of courtesy in regard to international dealings, which I think it is wise should For some time we in Australia have felt reason to regard vvith apprehension danger from a certain are direction of the Orient, namely, Japan, we are pleased, I think, that the alliance which existed between Great Britain Japan for some years has been renewed. I think it is very well indeed for us that the Japanese people should be our allies But throughout the years we have been allied, their through the agreement of the Imperial I authorities with the Japanese, I have observed in certain sections of the press the cruel and uncalled-for writings and caricatures of that people. I . believe that in no other part of the world would these things have been tolerated to the extent they'have been in Australia. I believe that in many other countries that kind of thing, carried to the extent to which it has been carried in Australia, would have brought about international complications.",58
324,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"What about the newspapers of America-of San Francisco, for instance?",60
325,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"T am not concerned with America at present. I am speaking of Australia, and of things that I know. So far as I arn aware, I. have not seen in any American magazines or newspapers anything of the degrading and unnecessarily provocative character which I have seen in some Australian journals.",60
326,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,Look up some of the San Francisco papers.,60
327,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"That may be so, and it will probably be the duty of the American authorities to put an end to that kind of thing. I am calling the attention of the Government to these matters, because I helieve it is their duty to use their influence to put an end to anything of that provocative character towards a people with whom we are in friendly alliance. It is somewhat amusing to notice the only reference in the Governor General's Speech to the important matter of immigration. The subject is not altogether omitted, but the reference is of a character which makes it almost farcical. We are told that the policy of the Government in connection with land taxation has had the effect of bringing immigration to our shores. A statement of that kind will be regarded with a smile, even in the Labour ranks. There is no doubt whatever that this Government has so far failed lamentably in encouraging immigration. The work that has been done has been carried out by the State authorities. I am very much afraid that as long as this Government is in office we shall not see that energetic action in regard to immigration that the country has a right to expect, and that is of such vital importance to Australia. The Minister of Defence admitted, in the course of a speech in another place, to which I have already alluded, that, in the past, the Labour party had not been favourable to immigration; but he gave those who listened to him to understand that that was all changed. I challenge the Minister of Defence, or any member of this Government, or any member of the Labour party, to sbow in what respect the policy of the party has altered from' the time when the Minister admitted that they were opposed to immigration. They carry out the pretence of encouraging immigration, but they know that they dare not actively encourage it-no t even that kind of immigration that we want so badly above all other forms, namely, immigration with the object of settling our waste places with those who are prepared to cultivate the soil. Even when that is proposed the Government and Parliament are reminded from certain quarters that there is a possibility of a trickle of such immigrants into the cities, and' that, therefore, it is dangerous. As long as the trade unions control the policy of the Labour party, as they do at the present time, no active steps will be taken in connection with immigration by this Labour Government, nor by any other Labour Government; and I , for one, regret very deeply indeed the short-sighted policy that makes them put a mere present interest of their own, of the narrowest kind, against a policy that is of the very nature of life itself to Australia. We want immigration. We want an active policy in this connection by the Commonwealth Parliament and Government; and I believe that any Government that plays with the subject will not be tolerated very long by the people of Australia, who keenly realise the necessity for filling up our country with that human element without vvhich we cannot expect to hold our own, faced, as we are, by countless numbers of Asiatics so near to our shores. The attitude of this Government in connection with the Tariff is somewhat amusing. We are now told that Ministers want certain information from the manufacturers as regards the cost of production and the proportion of labour in the value of their products. I wish to remind those who, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, make that a condition of increasing the Tariff, that four years ago the Free Trade section of the Tariff Commission put all those facts and figures before Parliament. They pointed out what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has been saying to-night, that in the majority of cases, if it came to be a consideration of the exact amount of labour which entered into the production of commodities, there would practically be no Protection at all - that the proportion of labour in a given product in these days of labour-saving machinery was so insignificant that, in the majority of Australian industries of any consequence, the freights on imported goods were more than equal to the difference in the value of the labour, even taking the extreme difference between Australian rates of wages 'and the lowest paid labour that competes with us. The facts for which the present Government are asking the manufacturers are, 1 repeat, contained in the volume of reports presented by theFree Trade section of the Tariff Commission ; and I wish to warn the Protectionists that, if they insiit on entering into this ticular phase of Protection,, they will disclose a very weak point in the position indeed. I think it will be better, for them to proceed on the general question, because, undoubtedly, if it is merely a matter of protecting the labour employed in connection with Australian production, they will find the ground sliding rapidly from under them. I am very pleased to learn that the Government intend to introduce legislation dealing with banking. I have had occasion to bring before this Parliament, and other Parliaments, the great necessity for legislation on that subject. I hope that this will be one of the measures that the Government will carry through during the present session. There is another matter, Mr Speaker, of very grave importance, in my opinion, in connection with the welfare of the people of this country, that I have been waiting anxiously for some time to have dealt with, and regarding which there is no reference in the Governor General's Speech. VVe have had, time and again, and particularly cf late, a recrudescence of certain abominable and immoral offences on the part of aliens amongst us, and many people are crying out for a law which will enable us to send such people out of our country when they are convicted of such offences.' At the present time we can only deport alien criminals for crimes of violence. But there are other crimes, not classified as crimes of violence, to which these people have been particularly prone-crime s against the welfare of our girls and women, which they perpetrate, and for which they may be punished. But they are allowed, when their period of imprisonment is over, to . remain in the country and perhaps to perpetrate such offences again. I say that since we are determined to keep even the best of such aliens out of Australia, we should take measures to deport the worse of them wherever we find it desirable. I introduced a measure last session having that for its object, and if the Government do not intend to deal with the subject, I shall introduce it again, and ask the a.ssistance of honourable members to carry it into law. The intention expressed by the Government to carry out the transcontinental railway is one I am very glad to be able to compliment them upon. I hope they will lose no time in this important national undertaking. In view of the wonderful par- success which has attended the opening up of Canada by the construction of similar railways, I feel sure that the pessimistic predictions of some people, especially in this part of the Commonwealth, will be absolutely falsified by the results from that railway in a very few years after its construction. I hope that no time will be lost in carrying out the work, which, as a matter of fact, the people of Western Australia anticipated, wben they agreed to enter the Federation, would be well nigh completed by this time. There is another matter, also, in which the people of that State are - interested, and concerning which no mention is made in the Governor General's Speech. Following on the report presented by Admiral Henderson, we were given to understand that the Government intended to proceed with the construction of two important naval bases for the Commonwealth. One of these was to be at Port Stephen, on the New South Wales coast, and the other at Cockburn's Sound, near Fremantle. 1 hope that the omission from the Speech of any reference to these two important naval .works does not mean that they are to be shelved indefinitely. Surely the establishment of these naval bases ought to be taken'in hand and proceeded with side by side with the development of our general naval policy. We cannot have an effective Navy without these naval bases, and common-sense would suggest that they should be ready, as soon as the men-of-war and various naval fighting machines are available to make use of them. I shall not detain the House any longer. I hope that we shall be able to get through a considerable part of the work put .before us in the Governor General's Speech, and will be in a position to go into recess at about the usual time for the close of a session of this Parliament.

328,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.8] - I move That the House do now adjourn. In submitting the motion, I should like to say that yesterday, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I stated that the price paid to sugar-growers for cane was increased proportionately with an increase in the price of sugar. I find that that statement is not accurate, since only a' portion of the sugar-growers receive an increased price for their cane when the price of sugar is raised.",62
329,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,They profess that they give it.,62
330,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I am advised that only a portion of the sugar-growers benefit in the way stated by an increase in the price of sugar. Sugar-growers who are partners in central mills erected by the State Government do receive an increased price for cane when the price of sugar is raised. I am unable to say what proportion of the total number of sugar-growers they represent.,62
331,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Les s than half the growers benefit from an increased price of sugar. - Mr FISHER - Then the greater proportion do not derive any advantage from an increased price.,62
332,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I hardly think that the proportion of growers benefiting would' be as high as suggested, because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company manufactures about one-fourth of the Queensland crop and the whole of the New South Wales crop, which would be considerably less than half of the total crop.",62
333,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"However , I was inaccurate in conveying to honourable members and the public that all sugar-growers benefited in the way stated as the result of an increase in the selling price of sugar. Question resolved in the affirmative. 'House adjourned at 10.10 p.m.",62
