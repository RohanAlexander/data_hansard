2,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"Hindmarsh) (12.31 p.m.)On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the committee's report entitled Working holiday makers: more than tourists, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
3,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"The working holiday program, which the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has been investigating for the last year, is a valuable program for Australia because it enhances the cultural and social development of young people; promotes mutual understanding between Australia and other nations; generates economic benefits; and is an important component of the tourism industry. However, the program has given rise to legitimate concerns that Australians are losing out on jobs because some employers are employing working holiday makers in preference to Australians. The committee found that working holiday makers can help create jobs in the tourism industry, but it also found that some employers in the tourism industry are choosing to employ working holiday makers with foreign language skills in preference to Australians with foreign language skills. Accordingly, Australians are not being given the opportunity to use the skills they have. In Queensland, we heard from tour guides, especially those who speak Japanese, who were concerned that they were missing out on jobs because of the ready supply of working holiday makers. The committee also found that sections of the horticultural industry too heavily on working holiday makers to bring in the harvest. In Mildura and other horticultural regions across Australia, we heard from horticultural representatives who told us that they need working holiday makers to harvest their crops because there are not enough Australians who want the work. The committee has responded to the 95 submissions it received with recommendations to ensure that the working holiday program remains what it was intended to be-a chance for people to have an extended holiday in Australia, with work being incidental to that Report holiday. The committee is adamant that the working holiday program must not be used to solve labour market problems in Australia. It is also convinced that stronger action needs to be taken against people who flout the rules of the working holiday program by employing people illegally. We cannot let a program which is of such value to Australia be brought into disrepute by those who want a quick fix to their labour needs. For this reason, the committee has made a number of recommendations. Strategies should be developed to encourage the training and employment of Australians as tour guides, including mandatory accreditation within three years. Harvest labour strategies should be implemented, with appropriate government support to encourage more Australians to undertake horticultural work. A limit should be maintained on the number of working holiday makers allowed into Australia for the next three years so that appropriate judgments can be made about their impact on the labour market. Further recommendations include: enhanced investigatory powers for the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and more rigorous compliance activity against tourists working illegally; and significant financial penalties for employers where, following appropriate warnings, they employ working holiday makers beyond the permissible time limit, or employ backpackers without work rights. During the inquiry, the committee received a number of suggestions for improving the working holiday program. The committee has rely responded to those suggestions by recommending the following: easier access to the program for applicants who are 26 to 30 years old; more agreements with other countries in order to diversify the program; removal of unnecessary restnctlOns on people applying for working holiday visas; and better promotion of overseas working holiday opportunities for young Australians. If Australia is to get the maximum value from the working holiday program, more young Australians need to know about overseas working holidays and the benefits they offer. With high levels of youth unemployment, the committee was surprised that twice the number of working holiday makers arrive in Australia compared with the number of Australians travelling overseas on working holidays. We need to get the message to our young people that working holidays overseas are a great opportunity for personal development and for acquiring skills. In this way, we can tap into their spirit of adventure and help them to benefit from a worthwhile and valuable program. My thanks go to all those who contributed to the committee's inquiry. In particular, I would like to thank the Deputy Chair, Senator Jim MCKiernan, and my fellow committee members for their support. The committee is particularly grateful to its secretariat, including Andres Lomp, Catherine Cornish, Gabrielle Jess, and Denise Picker and Sophia Konti. Special thanks are also due to our adviser, Christopher Dorrian, and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for arranging his secondment. I commend the report to the House.",13
4,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"I endorse the remarks of the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) and I commend her for her work as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This is a very well balanced report. It is important, to begin with, to note that the committee recognises that this program is a valuable one. It is valuable to Australia in terms of its tourism interests. It is also valuable in terms of the cultural interchange that occurs in Australia as young people come here from overseas and spend some time working and developing contacts which they will then take back to their country. In that way, they form a network of people with direct and friendly experience of Australia. It is also valuable to the young Australians who take advantage of it, travel overseas and experience other countries for themselves. The committee is unanimously of the view that there is a real risk that this program may become significantly distorted and used for purposes other than for which it was intended. The member for Hindmarsh has mentioned our concerns regarding two specific industries-the tourism industry and the horticultural industry. The report's recommendations identify strategies which we will press the government to take in order to ensure that the working holiday program is not distorted into a phoney labour market program. Appropriate labour market responses should be developed involving training Australians for those labour market niches but we should not exclude working holiday workers from those areas, unless it proves necessary. But there is a sting in the tail of the report because it says that, if appropriate local initiatives cannot be developed with the cooperation of the tourist industry, then the government must act. So it is a tough report. Might I also say on behalf of the opposition that we have some real concerns that the numbers of people coming under this program are again becoming distorted. When the working holiday maker program was first capped, it was capped at the level of 33,000; it then rose to 42,000;. the current minister increased it to 50,000 in his first year; and now the provisional target is 55,000 people coming as working holiday visa holders. It comes at a time when this government has shamefully engaged in a campaign to argue that immigration to Australia should be restricted so that people cannot meet and marry persons of their choice and bring them or their dependent children here as their family. For the government to have unlocked the working holiday visa program, which has people working in this country for extended periods of time, seems to be a hideously inconsistent message. The minister ought to consider not only the framework of recommendations regarding the measures necessary in particular industry sectors but also the question of what is the appropriate capping level. By way of an example of the degree to which there is reciprocity, in 1995-96 there were only some 22,000 Australians went overseas under the working holiday program. I think we should do more to make this program known so that the advantages of Australians travelling overseas and working can reside in this country. We should be a little concerned that the reciprocity has got a little out of balance. In other words, there is less than half the number of Australians taking advantage of the working holiday scheme in overseas countries as there are of people from oversea- coming to Australia to take part in the program. The opposition strongly supports the existence and value of the working holiday program. It is a useful and constructive part of our tourism infrastructure; it does enable cultural exchange; it has some economic advantages to Australia, both directly and indirectly. However, we have flagged significant concerns with the way in which the scheme is currently operating, concerns that we will be giving attention to when the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) responds to the very significant recommendations contained in this report. I commend the report to the House and suggest it is one which correctly identifies the ployers. right balance. I commend to the minister the remarks of the member for Hindmarsh. I would press for the retention of the working holiday program because it is of value but I would note that it can be improved. In the absence of those improvements, there will be growing community concern.",14
5,Ms GAMBARO,COMMITTEES,"I would like to commend the report entitled Working Holiday Makers: More than tourists to the House and to endorse the thoughts expressed by the previous speakers. I would also commend the work of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). As the only Queenslander on the committee, it was a pleasure to play an active role in the preparation of this report and the inquiry into the working holiday visas, because Queensland is very heavily reliant on the impacts of the tourism industry. Australia has long been a drawcard for tourists and we take great pride in the tourism industry. Some aspects of the report were highlighted to us during our inquiry. In Queensland in particular, as a number of speakers have alluded to, there is a tour guide industry that needs to be looked at seriously. We often see large groups of Japanese coming to enjoy our culture. However, most of the tour guides that take them around from location to location have a very limited understanding of the Australian way of life and culture. Working holiday makers are drawn to this country for a number of reasons: the wonderful climate we have, a sense of adventure and the wonderful opportunities that exist for them. The committee during its inquiry looked at a number of areas including: the scope and criteria of the program, the granting of the working holiday visas, reciprocal arrangements with other nations and the effect of working holiday makers on employment levels. We went to substantial lengths to ensure that we received reliable, investigative submissions. There were 89 submissions in total. The committee travelled all over Australia holding public hearings and made a point of talking to both employees and emWe concluded that the working holiday program does play a very important role in Australia. Working holiday makers who do come to Australia take away with them many experiences, skills and a knowledge of Australian culture. They experience the Australian way of life in a much more detailed way than if they were just a normal visitor. We also have a reliance on these working holiday makers because they bring some $450 million to Australia in tourism dollars. I would like to stress the importance of the reciprocal nature of the program in that Australians can also experience those wonderful feelings by travelling overseas. We highlighted in the report, and I notice the previous speaker also alluded to this, the fact that not enough Australians are taking advantage of the program and that twice as many working holiday makers come to Australia as Australians go overseas. We need to have a better education process so that we encourage Australians to experience those wonderful programs overseas. I strongly emphasise that further promotion and greater strategies should be developed to ensure the benefits of the program are widely known throughout Australia. Promotional material needs to be provided which is targeted to age groups that are more likely to be working holiday makers, and we need to have access to those people. One of the focuses of the inquiry was on the labour market area, which has also been mentioned by a number of speakers. The impact on the horticultural industry is absolutely phenomenal. This was evident when we spoke to a number of growers, both in Mildura and in North Queensland, and were told that the horticultural industry could survive without working holiday makers. We need to be more responsive to this industry; we need to provide greater training opportunities; we need to promote horticultural opportunities for our young people; and we need to look closely at developing courses in T AFE colleges. I was very proud to be part of the committee. I would like to emphasise that we also need to look at areas and make sure that working holiday makers are not exploited and that insurance is taken out for them in the area of health. Similarly, employers need to play a very active and responsible role and ensure that they do the right thing and employ people with the correct visas. It has been my absolute pleasure to be on this inquiry. I would like to thank the committee support staff that we had in the whole process. They have been absolutely wonderful. I would also like to thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the House for the support that they provided. We enjoyed the report immensely, and I enjoyed working with a number of colleagues on both sides of the House. I would like to commend the report to the House.",15
6,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEES,"I, too, join with my colleagues in commenting on this report entitled Working holiday makers: more than tourists. At the outset, may I also extend our thanks and congratulations to the committee secretariat. They worked long and hard to put this particular report together for us, based on the information that we gleaned from both personal visits but also from the many and varied submissions which came before the committee for consideration. As the shadow minister for tourism, obviously my concern with this report is that issues associated with the role that working holiday makers play in Australia be not understated. As was noted by my colleague the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the government minister has decided that we will increase the number of people who can come to Australia under this particular visa program. I think that needs to be balanced by the fact that, on many occasions at least, the not people who are here under this program are carrying out work which, for some reason, Australians do not seem to want to do. The evidence that we received, for example, in fruit picking areas would seem to indicate that some Australians just are not prepared to do that. As a consequence, people who came from many of these overseas countries who were prepared to travel for the experience did get involved in that. As a consequence, many of the horticulturalists and others who took advantage of working holiday makers did so in the knowledge that they were contributing to their own education about that particular location but, importantly as well, that they were having their crops picked. As a consequence, economically it was so significant for them. I think the simple fact that in the tourism industry some concerns were raised with us in respect of guides and bus drivers does flag a problem that needs further review and further consideration. For example, I know that there are a number of people in Sydney, as well as in Queensland, who operate with tour companies as bus drivers. They are concerned that a number of tour operators from Japan-and this is something that seems to be spreading to tourists coming from other countries-are actually employing working holiday visa holders as the bus drivers, in some instances, but certainly as the tour guides. Many Australians who have taken the opportunity to train in languages, particularly Japanese or Chinese or Korean, are finding now that, even though they have those hardwon skills-often supplemented, I might say, by extended periods of time living in those countries to get an appreciation of not only the finer points of the language but also the social mores that accompany people living in those countries-they are being squeezed out of some of the markets. What we are finding also is that some of the more unscrupulous people, particularly in North Queensland, are, in fact, swapping workers around. They come here for a period of time. They are only supposed to work for a limited amount of that time that they are here. But those people are, in fact, being employed by one particular company and then three months later, by some sleight of hand, they are going on and being employed by another company. Really, at the end of the day, when you trace through the way in which this is put in place it is the same tourist wholesaler out of one of these foreign countnes. These are issues which need to be reviewed because I think what we need to always keep in mind is that the reason working holiday makers come to Australia is just that: they come as tourists, but they also have an opportunity to work for a period of time. They do not come here to work the whole time. They come here so that they can experience something of this great country of ours. They come so that they can then go back as ambassadors for Australia and tell other people about how important and how significant we are as a tourist destination. Too often in this place and elsewhere we understate the importance of tourism to the Australian economy. For Australia, it is a $14 billion a year industry. Yet people say that this is not a real industry; it is not creating real jobs; it is not genuine. In fact, this inquiry has shown that to be anything other than the case. As my colleagues have suggested today in this brief debate on this particular report, I think it has made a great contribution to a further understanding of the role played by working holiday makers when they come here. They do come here as more than tourists. They come here to supplement their income by working in different locations but, when they do come here, they come first and foremost as tourists and should always keep that in mind. On behalf of my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), the chair of the committee, I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. Leave granted.",16
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. National Crime Authority Committee Report",17
8,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the annual report of the committee for 1996-97. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
9,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,"This is the first occasion in its 13-year history that the committee has resolved to present a separate report to the parliament-hence, to the public-of its activities over the preceding financial year period. We have done so because there has been some criticism that the committee in the past has not been as diligent as perhaps it should in carrying out its functions, which are set out in section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984. I am very pleased to say that this current committee, which I have the honour of chairing and which was re-formed in May 1996, I think, has worked very well and has done its job very effectively. A cursory or careful reading of the report that I am tabling today should indicate to any interested observer that this committee has worked very well. I would like to pay tribute to the members of the committee: my colleague and the Labor Party member for Maribyrnong, Mr Sercombe, who is sitting opposite, as the deputy chairman of the committee; Labor Senator Stephen Conroy from Victoria; Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris from South Australia; Paul Filing, the Independent member for Moore in Western Australia; Labor Senator Brenda Gibbs from Queensland; National Senator Julian MCGauran from Victoria; Democrat Senator Natasha Stott Despoja from South Australia; Mr Warren Truss, the member for Wide Bay in Queensland; and my colleague and the member for Bowman in Queensland, Mrs Andrea West, who is in the chamber with me today. It is not easy to chair a committee such as this. It is not only a joint standing committee, including both senators and members, but probably more than any other committee in the parliament, I would suggest, it has wider representation-of all the parties in the parliament and the member for Moore, who is an Independent member of the parliament. The committee has worked together well. It is an important committee, and perhaps it is more important today than it has ever been in terms of its given functions, which are spelt out in section 55 of the act. The committee has a good relationship with the National Crime Authority itself. Obviously there is a fine line in preserving that relationcrucial ship in a workman-like way: we are not there to act in any respect as a rubber stamp for the NCA; we are there to offer advice and constructive criticism of the authority. The committee has probably found the right balance in that relationship over the past 12 months. I would like to thank particularly the current Chairman of the NCA, Mr Broome, for the cooperation that he has offered to the committee on occasions and, indeed, his availability both to me as chairman of the committee and to individual members of the committee who at any time may wish to discuss a matter with him. One important matter which is touched on in our report is the fact that this committee is currently carrying out a detailed evaluation of the NCA's effectiveness. I do not want in any way to pre-empt the outcome of that committee evaluation but, whatever the outcome, there is a general realisation in the community today that organised criminal activity has not diminished since 1984, when the NCA was formed. In particular, the war against drugs has assumed increased prominence over the last 12 months and, in recent days, the issue of paedophilia is very much on the agenda. Other than carrying out a strategic assessment of paedophile activity in Australia, which has recently been completed, the NCA at this moment has no direct role in that particular issue. Nevertheless, it may be a matter which the NCA picks up in the future. This report is the first one that this committee has done. It is comprehensive; it outlines the committee's activities; and, most importantly, it will give the correct impression that this committee has been a hard working and effective committee of this parliament over the past 12 months.",17
10,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"One of the things that immediately strikes members of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority in looking at the role of the NCA is the vital nature of the linkages between the NCA and other law enforcement organisations. Those linkages are absolutely critical for effective law enforcement from the Commonwealth level and are for success. The linkages that are critical are, obviously, Customs, the Federal Police and AUSTRAC from the point of view of the federal government directly and then, in terms of cooperative arrangements with the states, organisations such as the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. As the chairman of the committee, the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), has just pointed out, the crime environment with which the NCA is involved is a complex one and one that requires a cohesive effort by those sorts of organisations. It is therefore particularly depressing, I think, to see the way in which the government has in recent times handled the budget appropriations for the organisations to which I refer, particularly for the Federal Police, who are absolutely critical in terms of the NCA's effectiveness. Simple statistics speak for themselves. The Federal Police have 651 fewer officers in 1996 than they did in 1988, and that is against the background of a rapid expansion in the functions they are expected to perform. The Australian Federal Police Association recently published a newsletter which, amongst other things, says: The AFP is in real danger of vanishing into impotency. Only the enemy, and perhaps that includes some politicians, are laughing at this situation. Not only was a critical mass of AFP staffing reached some time ago, but the forecast reductions of 12% over the next two years will make recovery from our dire position of last year impossible. In other words, according to AFP forecasting, at least I in 10 of us will have to leave the AFP within the next two years to meet these cuts! What does that say about the environment in which this government is expecting the NCA as a colleague organisation to operate? I think it says a lot about the government's lack of seriousness in these priorities. The failure of the government to address these important issues is reflected in a letter the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) sent to the Australian Federal Police Association on 14 August. It is a truculent and a petulant letter. He says in conclusion to his letter: I do not intend to hold discussions with you ... I would not wish to enter into cooperative arrangements with a group that is attacking the government's policies and I would not think that the AFP would wish to do so. In this petulant letter the Attorney-General accuses the Federal Police Association of being patronising. He goes on to say that he could have discussed with them the government's reasons for commissioning a review of the financial practices of the AFP and that he might have discussed with them the importance of government and the parliament being aware of the work of the AFP and the impact of that work on the Australian community. He also said: I could have also discussed with youthat is, the associationthe possibility of the AFP A cooperating with myself, the Commissioner and the AFP in taking the kinds of internal steps that will be a consequence of the financial practices review ... But the Attorney-General is not prepared to talk to the Federal Police Association, because they have the audacity to occasionally make public comments that, in his own words, are critical of government policies. I find that to be, as I said, a truculent and a petulant attitude by this second-rate Attorney-General and one which really leads this House to have to question his competence. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) appears to have made some judgments about his competence by not promoting him to the cabinet. One can see from this letter perhaps some of the reasons why the Prime Minister's view on that was justified. I seek leave to table this letter to the AFP from the Attorney-General, because I think it does display his incompetence and his inability to adequately address the problems that his portfolio has. Leave not granted.",18
11,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEES,"That says volumes for how seriously the Australian people can take the commitments of this government to do something serious about the criminal problems this community faces, particularly in relation to the drug menace. The facts are that the Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement agencies are having their budgets cut to the bone. The response of the Attorney General to that is to try to shoot the messenger, to have a go at those responsible policemen and policewomen who, through their association, seek to question him and seek to involve him in dialogue and discussion. They get a kick in the teeth for their trouble.",19
12,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"The National Crime Authority has come under a fair bit of criticism in recent times. The Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), indicated that it is not our job to act as a sort of glee club or defence organisation for the NCA-to the contrary. In our evaluation inquiry, which we are undertaking at present, we have heard a fair bit of evidence from people who are either critics or supporters of the NCA's role. It is interesting to note that, in the evidence given by Mr John Elliott in a public hearing in Melbourne recently, he accused former Labor prime ministers Hawke and Keating of being involved in a conspiracy with the NCA to bring him down. It is notable that in that public evidence he indicated that there had been a settlement between him and the two former prime ministers. We are hoping that, as part of our evaluation inquiry, we will get to hear from Messrs Hawke and Keating as to what exactly that settlement was. I am sure many people would like to know what happened as a consequence of Mr Elliott's legal action against those two former Labor prime ministers. In the report a number of matters are raised. Amongst the most important is the question of complaints to the committee. One of the problems the committee has had ever since I have been a member and before I became a member-I joined in 1990 and I know from a number of previous committee reports that previous committee chairmen and committee personnel had the same problem-is that the committee is under-resourced or in a less competent position to be able to properly investigate complaints made to it about the behaviour of the National Crime Authority. That is something that really needs to be resolved, although, having had complaints coming forward from 1984 onwards, I am not holding my breath. Every time there is a report or a comment made by the committee asking for a resolution to this particular problem, the government of the day-whether Liberal or Labor-seems to ignore it. The next matter is this cutback problem. The member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) indicated that there is a problem. Just about all the evidence we have heard in public and privately would indicate that there is a serious problem in law enforcement, particularly in the area of drugs. We know that the country is awash in heroin and that there are, according to the Victoria Police, children as young as 12 and 13 selling heroin at $7 a pop in Little Bourke Street in Melbourne. Mr Sercombe-Cheaper than cigarettes.",19
13,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"It is cheaper than cigarettes. That is something of very serious concern. Overdoses are occurring at an extraordinary rate; there were 34 over the weekend. There are particularly strong strains of heroin coming into the country. From the perspective of being a member from Western Australia, which is one-third of the continent in terms of area and has the largest coastline of any of the states, we are particularly appalled by the fact that the federal government has cut back so severely the resources of the AFP, the Customs Service and the NCA. Notwithstanding that there was a grant of money to the NCA in the budget, that grant of money was in fact designed to increase its work involved in Commonwealth related fraud-that is, fraud on the Commonwealth governmentwhich is nothing to do with drugs, the No. 1 problem affecting our community today. I notice the chairman nodding his head. I hope that in the party room he, along with others, will urge the government to reverse this trend and in fact beef up Commonwealth law enforcement resources. I would suggest that we need a $100 million war against crime and drug trafficking. The proceeds and property and all the cash associated with the trafficking of drugs should be able to be seized and in fact used by the law enforcement agencies to resource themselves against these insidious organisations, who seem to be so very well resourced themselves. In the concluding moments, may I make two observations. We noted that Mr Kendall from Interpol appeared before the committee. He urged the government to support the candidature of Mick Palmer for the international committee of Interpol. I note that the government are going to do that. I hope they do that properly so that we can succeed at it. I also comment on the fact that the Adelaide bombing occurred in March 1994; still nobody has been charged with that. It is one of the most grave attacks on law enforcement and the justice system in this country's history. I cannot for one minute understand why it is beyond our wit to have been able to apprehend and charge the offender and have the matter before the courts by now.",20
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Nehl)Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for MCPherson wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,20
15,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,21
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Treaties Committee",21
17,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Amendments to the Bonn Convention-9th Report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",21
18,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"The report I have just tabled deals with a number of amendments to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, the so called Bonn Convention. These amendments propose the listing of two species of cetaceans in appendix II to the convention, one species of albatross in appendix I, and 10 species of albatross in appendix II. At the conference of the parties in April, Australia proposed the listing of the 11 albatross species, while the Netherlands proposed the listing of two northern hemisphere species. With the earlier listing of a northern hemisphere species, all 14 albatross species are now listed under this convention. The dolphin and porpoise, the cetaceans, proposed for listing are rarely seen in Australian waters and little is known about them. Nevertheless, the committee believes that Australia should continue to collect information on these animals and other species not often found in our waters. When the committee examined the 1996 subsidiary southern bluefin tuna agreement with Japan, seabird bycatch was an issue of concern. We made particular reference to the fate of albatrosses which interact with long-line fishing operations. The latest listings provide another opportunity to revisit the subject. We need to be aware that fishing provides many jobs, directly and indirectly, and that too many constraints will have an impact on fishing as a business. At the same time, Australia is a signatory to the Bonn Convention and is therefore legally obliged to introduce and to enforce measures which protect migratory birds like the albatross. Many Australians would be uncomfortable if this nation did not take appropriate steps. Our report supports the Report listings and we believe that our recommendations will assist in carrying out this published duty more effectively. We have therefore recommended that Australia continue its efforts to optimise membership of international agreements; that all Commonwealth departments and agencies involved in managing our membership of the convention harness the available expertise in the most effective way; that the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, examine the observer program to establish the costs and benefits of placing trained observers on all boats in Australia's fishing areas; and that AFMA discuss with the tuna fishing industry the testing of such techniques as night setting of bait on the high seas. However, we are concerned about three things. Firstly, it is regrettable that the first national interest analysis, NIA, which was tabled, omitted the listing of the two species of cetaceans. I understand that the oversight occurred in spite of a number of organisations involved in the process asking the sponsor whether any other species were involved in these listings as well as the albatrosses. Secondly, we are concerned about the time it took to produce the record of the proceedings of the conference of the parties. This ended in April and was still not available when the revised NIA was tabled in mid-June. While we have not made a recommendation on this matter we have suggested that Australia should offer the secretariat to the conference whatever assistance it can to ensure the results of the conference are available as soon as practicable after its conclusion. Thirdly, we are still not satisfied with the amount and timing of the consultation involved in the process of parliamentary scrutiny of treaties. Last Monday, in the course of some additional remarks on our eighth report, my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) drew attention to two examples of inadequate consultation in areas where particular organisations should have been involved in the process. In the case of the Bonn Convention, such consultation as did occur about the listing of the cetaceans was later than desirable. The contribution made by various NGOs to the inquiry and to an earlier one on restrictions on the use of blinding laser weapons and landmines was considerable and we thank them for their efforts. On the latter, our fifth report, I take the opportunity to acknowledge the courageous efforts of the late Diana, Princess of Wales and her acknowledgment of the committee's work on landmines early this year. We will treasure her response at a time when the world has a heavy heart at her sudden passing. I commend the report to the House and seek leave to table a copy of Princess Diana's letter to me of 28 February 1997. Leave granted.",21
19,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,COMMITTEES,"The opposition certainly fully supports the criticisms of the shortcomings in this area mentioned by the Chairman of Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). In making my contribution, I would like to acknowledge the strong role the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who is unable to be here today because of other parliamentary duties, played in the committee hearings and proceedings. The problem of human induced albatross mortality is not new. Indeed, it is pleasing to see the continuation by the current government of the policy of protecting these species that emerged under the Keating government. Albatross populations are declining at a rate of up to 90 per cent and several species are facing extinction if current fishing practices continue. The main threat to the albatross comes from their practice of feeding on bait, catch and offal discarded near long-lining boats. Bait is attached to hooks on lines between 10 and 80 metres long. Albatross swallow this bait and the attached hooks which become embedded in their gullet and they drown. In 1991, Nigel Brothers published the first of several articles which now provide the foundation for ongoing work in Tasmania and at Latrobe University. Based upon research from 1988, he brought the crisis facing albatross populations into the public sphere. His studies found that a 'conservative calculation' of the albatross take by Japanese long-liners operating in the Southern Ocean was 44,000 birds annually. Breaking this figure down, it was estimated that for every 1,000 hooks set a minimum of 0.4 birds become entangled and drown. Given that an average of 108 million hooks are set in southern seas each year, this translates to a threatening and unsustainable level of albatross take. In response to scientific information, developments are now occurring where a range of interest groups are working together to combat both species specific impacts and more broadly the formation of a Commonwealth bycatch policy. This is an unprecedented alliance of government, industry and conservation bodies wherein no party sees any benefit stemming from the bycatch of conservation significant species. Bycatch refers to species that are incidentally and unintentionally captured in commercial fishing operations. Technological innovations to combat bycatch include both gear and operational changes. In relation to albatross, this includes setting bait at night, when albatross do not feed, and the use of tori poles and streamers to scare birds away. Despite the initial outlay of capital needed, fishers are positively inclined to use such innovations. Indeed, one estimate suggests that the revenue loss due to seabirds taking bait is $7 million per annum. The research is, by no means, conclusive, however, and new problems are ever emerging. For example, the practice of setting bait at night has become problematic because, although albatross are not nocturnal feeders, petrels and other migratory seabirds are. One of the most crucial factors in reducing or eliminating the unnecessary destruction of wildlife in commercial fisheries is continued funding for research thereinto. There is a need to finance ongoing tracking of juvenile albatross. Moreover, investigations into long-term strategies such as underwater bait setting should be encouraged and appropriately resourced. The ninth inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties considered Australia's nomination of 11 species of albatross to the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, to which Australia has been a signatory for close to 20 years. The listing of a species requires that nations either take action to encourage their recovery or form international agreements to benefit such species.",22

23,Mr LEO MCLEAY,REPUBLIC,"Watson) (1.16 p.m.)Due to the inappropriateness of the day, and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), I fix Tuesday, 2 September as the day for the moving of Notice No.1, Private Members Business. NA Aung San Suu Kyi",23
24,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"In opening can I say that I think it is a great pity that the parliament at its opening today did not process a condolence motion to Diana, Princess of Wales. That is the normal time when proceedings of that character take place in parliament, and I think it is a great pity that that was not done today. It is demonstrably belated for us to extend birthday wishes to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. But the need for us to consider MyanmarBurma-and where that sad, sorely distressed country goes is as great today as it was when the motion was first introduced. I formally move: That this House: (1) expresses its warmest wishes to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on her 52nd birthday on 19 June 1997; (2) recognises her selfless commitment to the causes of peace and democracy in Burma for which she received the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize; (3) notes that she is still denied the right of movement, association and assembly, that access to foreign visitors can be arbitrarily withdrawn, and that she is denied regular access by her husband and two sons; and (4) endorses the strong diplomatic support of the Australian Government for the case of Suu Kyi, the cause she represents so eloquently and courageously and for the future well-being of the people of Burma. In a personal sense, we all hope that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's health soon recovers and, although she is only a ripe young 52 years of age, that she has many years ahead of her. As the daughter of the Burmese independence hero, General Aung San, she has spent a lifetime fighting for the Burmese people. She was deprived of her liberty for some six years between 1989 and 1995. Her family life has suffered. It is almost nine years since she has lived with her husband and her two young sons. And, as I mentioned, her health has deteriorated. I want to give strong personal support to Suu Kyi's campaign to restore not only democracy but a semblance of understanding in that sorely strained and stressed country of Myanmar. I do so because of what I see as the potential for Myanmar suffering exactly the same plight as North Korea. As Myanmar has been a part of ASEAN since 23 July there is a regional connotation which is particularly important for us. Becoming part of ASEAN takes Myanmar out of the prime sphere of influence of China. But for Australia it brings us into a position where we cannot ignore the economic consequences. The rice harvest is down. I am told rice exports have collapsed, due to harvest failure. Without talking about the level of rice exports, they have fallen very significantly from $198 million in fiscal year 1994-1995 to $47 million in fiscal year 1996-1997. In volume terms they have declined from 675 million tonnes to just over 250 million tonnes. The trade deficit has widened this year as exports fell by 36.4 per cent and imports rose by over 40 per cent. Average annual inflation has risen from 30 to 35 per cent in fiscal year 1995-1996 to over 40 per cent this year with very marked, sharp rises in domestic prices. Since the enactment of the November 1988 foreign investment law there has some $3.24 billion worth of investment approved with over $1 billion being used for the development of oil and gas fields in the Andaman Sea. However, investment in the non-oil sectors has been disappointing with less than a third of approvals resulting in actual commitments. The 'Visit Myanmar Year' tourist promotion has not lived up to expectations. Visitors, who were originally projected to total about a quarter of a million this year, are expected to total only about 130,000. Of course, foreign exchange reserves have now declined from an all-time high of $674 million in May 1995 to below $200 million today. That climate has profound political implications. The State Law and Order Restoration Council appears to be split between the hardliners and the moderates. Although talks have started between a representative of the moderates in Lieutenant-General Kyin Nyunt and representatives of the NLD, unfortunately, to date, they have progressed only a little. The concern that I have is that the internal splits within the SLORC and problems in the economy are going to force Myanmar even more into dependence upon the drug economy. I think in our region there are enormous consequences of instability that no-one in Australia can ignore. In moving this motion, I certainly extend to Suu Kyi and her party our best wishes. But I say to everybody that it is time for us to look at our constructive engagement policy. I do not agree with the policy of the United States, Canada and the European Union because I do not think that punitive economic measures will work. Now that Myanmar is part of ASEAN there is a unique responsibility on us to try to ensure that the SLORC regime resumes dialogue with Suu Kyi and encourage it to proceed to reform. The universities need to be reopened and we need to again try to ensure that some semblance of democratic rule is initiated in that sad, war-tom country. (Time expired)",23
25,Mr BARRY JONES,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am happy to second the motion about Daw Aung San Suu Kyi moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) on 19 June. Since the first part of the motion, as he said, congratulates her on her 52nd birthday, that would have been the ideal time to have debated it. However, two of us, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) and I, spoke about her that day in the adjournment debate. Aung San Suu Kyi is one of the most remarkable leaders of our time-unusual in being a leader who has never held office. She has been a role model for millions of women and it is a sad irony that we should be talking about Suu Kyi on the day that millions are mourning the unexpected death of another role model, Diana, Princess of Wales, who contributed so movingly, in what proved to be her last years, to important public causes such as changing community attitudes to sufferers from AIDS and leprosy and for the banning of landmines. Aung San Suu Kyi-the name means 'bright collection of strange victories' - was born in Rangoon, Burma, or, to use the names supplied by the current government of that beautiful country, Yangon, Myanmar, on 19 June 1945. She was the youngest of three children of Aung San and Khin Kyi. I appeal to Hansard and the organisers of the parliamentary database to index her name under 'A' for Aung, not 'K' for Kyi. Her elder brother, an American citizen, lives in the US. The middle child died in boyhood. Her father, Aung San, born around 1914, was an important nationalist politician and soldier who became the recognised leader of Burma after World War II and formed its first government under British rule. Suu Kyi never knew her father because, just six months before Burma became fully independent, Aung San, together with eight of his colleagues, was assassinated at a cabinet meeting on 19 July 1947 by a right-wing political group. In 1960 her mother was appointed ambassador to New Delhi, the first senior female Burmese diplomat, and she enjoyed a privileged life in India. However, in 1962, after years of ineffectual civilian rule, there was an army coup under General Ne Win, leading to the imposition of an army based authoritarian rule in which Burma, in effect, withdrew into isolation. In her years in India, Suu Kyi studied the works of Mahatma Gandhi, whose life and example had a profound impact. To that must be added the pacifism and respect for all forms of life of her Buddhist faith and her exposure to the Western liberal tradition with its openness to new ideas. She is a fascinating mixture of traditional and radical thinking. From Delhi University in 1964 she went on to St Hugh's College in Oxford to study politics, philosophy and economics. In 1972 she married Dr Michael Aris, an English scholar of Tibetan civilisation, and lived with him in Oxford. I have not had an opportunity to meet Suu Kyi as I was turned away three times from her house in Rangoon on 19 March this year, but I claim Michael Aris as a friend. I express some concern that clause (4) of the motion might overstate the case in the light of the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) last week which, in effect, gave a lower priority to environmental and human rights issues in our foreign policy and a far higher priority to trade: if there is a dollar to be gained in a particular area, you do not offend people by saying what you would like to say about issues like human rights. If there is a dollar be gained, that is where our interests lie. Commercial values are given priority over human values. When I was on the executive board of UNESCO I was the chairman of the mysteriously named Convention and Recommendations Committee, which was really coded language for the human rights committee of that organisation. We spent a lot of time talking about the problems of Suu Kyi. We called in the ambassador for Burma. We had an absolutely memorable discussion where he said that, in the view of his government, they were not prepared to throw Burma open to democracy because, in their view, democracy was an experiment which, after 200 years in Europe, could not be seen to have succeeded. I said, 'How long before you think you can form a judgment?' He said, 'Perhaps another century.' I said, 'And in the case of the lady?' He said, 'Thirty or 40 years. Who can tell?' Suu Kyi is, for practical purposes, still under house arrest. Although she is not formally under house arrest, for practical purposes access to her is denied. (Time expired)",24
26,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Boothby) (1.26 p.m.)I am pleased to support this motion by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Having in Australia one of the oldest stable democratic traditions, we largely take those liberal democratic forms for granted. We achieved democracy in Australia without a struggle and without any sort of revolution. There was no reign of terror in Australia. There was no Boston Tea Party. All too often we take the liberal democratic forms we have for granted. Taking democracy for granted is not an option for Aung San Suu Kyi and the 45 million people of Burma, who continue to suffer under the despotic rule of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC If asked to think of an image that characterises the struggle in Burma, most people would think of Aung San Suu Kyi and her weekend addresses from the walls of her compound, where she has spent six years under house arrest. Just as Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi symbolised their nations' struggle for democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi has become a to potent symbol of the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people. As the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) referred to, we know that Aung San Suu Kyi draws great inspiration from the struggles of both those men. As we send our warm birthday wishes, albeit belated, to Aung San Suu Kyi, it is worth reflecting on her life. Born in the middle of Burma's struggle for independence, her father, General Aung San, was the architect of Burma's independence from Britain. General Aung San was assassinated five months before his country achieved independence in 1948. Educated in India and at Oxford, Aung San Suu Kyi married an Englishman and had expected to continue her life in England in the cloistered world of English academe. How different it was to the way she spent the last nine years. In 1988 she returned to Burma to care for her mother, who was iII. She returned to a Burma that had been in a state of impoverishment and repression as a result of three decades of the mismanaged ideals of army commander General Ne Win. As we have seen former Warsaw Pact countries slowly adopting the practices of market economies and making treaties to join N ATO over the last 10 years, Burma, in keeping with the successful tradition of other isolated countries like Albania and North Korea, has remained closed to the world and watched its economy stagnate, its currency depreciate and its people persecuted. Aung San Suu Kyi became deeply involved with the democracy movement in Burma and became leader of the newly formed National League for Democracy in September 1988. In 1989 she was placed under house arrest, where she remained until 1995. In May 1990, in the first multiparty elections for 30 years, the National League for Democracy won a landslide victory with 85 per cent of the The SLORC refused to hand over power and, instead, clamped down further on democracy activists. It has been conservatively estimated that well over 100 NLD supporters, including 23 representatives from the 1990 election, have been detained and or sentenced in the last 12 months. Today, Aung San Suu Kyi is a free person. However, that description is loose. She needs permission to leave her compound, and her phones are frequently disconnected. As we heard from the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), he was turned back three times and not allowed to meet her. Despite everything, Aung San Suu K yi' s determination to free Burma remains strong and remains a shining example of the human spirit. How do we in Australia get Burma to change? As the right honourable member for New England and the member for Lalor said, there have been two approaches made to pressure Burma to reform. The approach of the United States, Canada and, to an extent, Europe, has focused on economic sanctions to isolate Burma. That is not an approach that I think will be particularly fruitful. The Association of South East Asian Nations has sought to encourage political reform through constructive engagement, fostering links in the hope that economic growth will lead to political liberalism. Unfortunately, those two approaches are in conflict and tend to cancel each other out. The recent admission of Burma into ASEAN has placed both opportunity and responsibility firmly in the lap of ASEAN members. ASEAN must ensure that the admission of Burma is not seen as a reward for its despotic leaders, and that its ensuing leverage is used to pressure Burma into fundamental liberalisation of its political processes. Australia must continue to encourage ASEAN countries to use their links with the junta to encourage change in Burma. I commend this motion to the House,",25
27,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"As a veteran participant in debates on many similar motions where we have found vote. common purpose in regard to human rights, and without detracting in any manner from the speakers opposite in this debate who have a very strong record of concern in this matter, I do, however, have to associate myself very strongly with the comments made by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in regard to the fourth clause of the motion. Quite frankly, I think it severely overstates the government's performance. That can be witnessed on a number of fronts. On 27 May last year the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) said that Australia neither encouraged nor discouraged trade with the regime in Burma. I for one certainly feel that this regime-and we have to be very careful about the overuse of these kinds of sanctions-does merit such action. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commented on the state of the economy. The sad fact of life is that recent international monetary organisations have indicated that the importance of the drug trade in Burma is such that there is a major discrepancy in the country's accounts. That is how extensive it is. By absorbing certain guerilla forces, and by allowing them to be legitimate businessmen, they have actually brought into the economy, into the mainstream through laundering processes, such an amount of money that international agencies are actually focussing on it. In 1988, this regime shot down demonstrators who were protesting about economic conditions. In September 1988 there was the decision to seize direct power in a more formal sense through the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Then there was the 1989 detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. In May 1990, the electoral victory of the National League for Democracy was basically ignored, and this led to the final process, of course, of people being incarcerated. When the results were ignored a supposedly national convention process was established whereby, once again, a self-appointed majority essentially totally ignored the views of those people who could claim to represent the people. So we have a track record of very little concern for what the world thinks and we have a track record of allowing very severe restrictions to be placed upon people's rights. This is not a case of an occasional problem with human rights a la Singapore with regard to trying to bankrupt opposition politicians or with respect to other countries in our region where, essentially, as a leading democratic country, we might be able to undertake some occasional questioning. This is intrinsic regime, and it is continuing. To my mind we are seeing no signs of significant movement in the regime's attitudes. There are different analyses of what will happen with Burma's absorption into ASEAN. Despite quibbling at the sides by ASEAN over events in Cambodia and concerns at the way in which the Hun Sen forces sidelined the other parts of the government, essentially the tone of the organisation is still non-interference in internal affairs, basically business as usual-that is, 'Let us all make sure, regardless of what our partners do and regardless of how few rights people have within their regimes, that we do not interfere internally.' So I must be pessimistic about the possibilities of this organisation, ASEAN, being used in any real sense to undermine the regime. Australia has a special responsibility in the region. I want to associate myself very strongly with a number of the demands of the opposition: the closure of the Austrade office; the active discouragement of Australian trade with Burma; the active discouragement of Australian citizens from visiting Burma for business or tourism, and the suspension of the issue of visitors' visas to Burmese officials. Apart from the fourth clause, I strongly associate myself with the motion, and I acknowledge the determined attitudes of a number of government members in regard to Aung San Suu Kyi's situation and that of the country.",26
28,Mr TAYLOR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I also wish to strongly support the motion of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). To take up the point of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), I will refer the House to a media statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in May last year so as to put into balance what the honourable member just said. I quote in part from the Minister for Foreign Affairs' press release at the time. He said: I have been deeply disappointed to learn that almost 100 members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) have been detained in Burma in recent days, in the lead-up to the seventh anniversain this ry of the democratic elections. He went on to say: Freedom of political expression continues to be curtailed in Burma. I understand that 204 NLD members and supporters have been detained since May 1996. Our records show that about 60 of these people have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms and a further 15 have been charged and are awaiting trial. Many of the rest remain in detention, and little information is available on their situation. He goes on: Despite the SLORC's decision to release her from house arrest in 1995, there remain a number of oppressive restrictions on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She must seek permission to receive visitors or leave her compound. Her telephone is often disconnected leaving her completely isolated from the outside world. He went on to say: These tactics are clearly designed to destroy the political opposition and create a climate of fear in Burma. But this approach will never bring legitimacy to the SLORC Government in the eyes of the outside world, and will only increase opposition to the SLORC inside the country. Minister Downer went on to say: The only long term solution to the situation in Burma is a negotiated settlement. I calion the Government of Burma to open a genuine dialogue involving all interested parties-the SLORC, leaders of political parties represented in the elections and representatives of the ethnic minorities. He completed his statement by saying: I also calIon the Government of Burma to cease its repressive attempts to suppress political freedom in Burma, and to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally. I urge the SLORC, as a sign of commitment to national reconciliation on the seventh anniversary of the national election in Burma, to allow the peaceful gathering and expression of views at the NLD conference. Those views were encapsulated back in 1995 by Ian MCPhedran in the Canberra Times when he said in part that she 'remained a potent symbol of the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people'. He went on to say: Burma is a complex mix of ethnic and religious groupings all of whom should be vying for a place in the scheme of things if and when democracy arrives there. A unified Burma is not a concept easily grasped by anyone who has experienced the divisions of internal Burmese politics. He finished by saying: What the numerous groups with claims to participate in the process have in common is Aung San Suu Kyi. She is the one hope for unity and democracy in Burma. In a few weeks time, as I understand it, John Dauth, a senior diplomat in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will travel to Burma as the special envoy of the foreign minister. His task will be: ... to report on the reality of claims made by the Burmese Foreign Minister ... that real progress towards democratic reform is being made by the military junta in Burma. On 18 August, very recently, Ian MCPhedran went on to say again: Dauth's biggest problem will be that from the moment he sets foot in the country until he leaves, he will be under constant surveillance, his conversations will be bugged and he will get nowhere near any of the grim realities of the place such as the appalling border refugee camps or the torture cells at places such as the notorious Insein prison. He went on to say that 'the intelligence services pay particular attention to the activities of influential opposition political figures'. Again, he talks about telephone conversations being monitored and, if the conversation is not to the SLORC's liking, being cut off. He went on to say: The SLORC's allocation of scarce resources (including precious foreign exchange) to the blanket surveillance of the entire population means that other critical areas of Burmese society, such as education and health services, suffer the consequences. He finished by making a point that: Human-rights issues aside, serious questions must also be raised about the stability and ultimate survival of the system ... (Time expired)  member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), I too wish to rise on this occasion to support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I just say to the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who just sat down, that I do not know that one wants to endorse the suggestion that foreign affairs is practised by press release and that press releases determine the veracity of a particularMr Taylor-It'S a start.  the honourable member for Reid was 100IGng for the middle and the end. That is the whole point. In talking about human rights, particularly in countries of our region-and BurmaMyanmar being a case in point-I think it is important that we reiterate the point that human rights are not inimical to economic progress. Human rights are not inimical to the preservation of states. Certainly, I believe that to be the case and we need to make that point often and repeatedly. Aung San Suu Kyi is a Nobel Prize winner, someone who has won an election fair and square and has been denied the opportunity to lead her party in democratic government. Australia and the Philippines in ASEAN have special responsibilities in drawing to the attention of the rest of the region, if not the world, the situation in Burma. I was very pleased that, with respect to the report in the last parliament entitled Human rights and progress towards democracy in Burma, the now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) was able to deliver in person a copy of that report. I hope that Aung San Suu Kyi certainly took heart from the efforts of the human rights subcommittee of this parliament. The SLORC is nothing more than a military dictatorship. Burma is paying a very high price for a lack of democracy in that country. As far as Australia is concerned, we have to decide whether or not we wish to exploit the trade opportunities that may exist in Burma or whether we wish to stand firm against a totalitarian regime like the SLORC and insist there be some vestige of democracy before we accord that country the full engagement that we are able to offer. I am one of those who believe that, more than mere press releases, more than mere words, a country like Australia must take positive action in wanting to assert the need for due regard to human rights-particularly in restoring an outstanding woman, a leader of a political party, with the right to lead her country-and at least to have the very best fresh elections. I am sure that she would do as equally well at those elections as she has done in the past.",27
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Order! It being 1.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Blood Glucose Meters: Test Strips",29
30,Mr WILTON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The media has recently indicated that the government is proposing to introduce benchmark pricing principles for blood glucose meter test strips supplied through the national diabetic services scheme. This will significantly increase the cost to many users for their specific strips which are not the generic brand. This type of product is not appropriate for this type of pricing structure. Unlike other prescriptive products, blood glucose strips are simply the consumable product used in conjunction with a rather more expensive blood glucose meter. Forcing users to switch brands of strips will also require the purchase of a new blood glucose meter. On advice of medical staff, several constituents of mine recently purchased blood glucose meters in order to test their sons and daughters who have had, in various cases, insulin dependent diabetes for up to 12 months. These meters were purchased in these cases at considerable expense. Test strips and meters operate as a system, not as a standalone item. If this proposal is permitted to proceed, those who have purchased blood glucose meters requiring test strips that attract a premium will have to pay the extra cost, in addition to the standard patient co-payment. Effectively, this will increase testing costs by a minimum of 40 per cent per annum. This premium pricing strategy is an illadvised, cost cutting measure that cannot be rationalised on medical or economic grounds. I urge the government to rethink this proposal so that it will not be allowed to proceed. The government has persisted in its attempt to attack the minorities and the most vulnerable in this community in order to save a few dollars. My fear is that, if we allow it to continue this trend, the community will be divided into the haves and the have-nots. (Time expired) Tariffs: Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay)- Mr Speaker, do you like my suit? It actually cost $60 down at Springfields in Penrith. My shoes were $20. In fact, I went to a mayoral ball on Saturday in a gown that cost $80. My point is that textiles, clothing and footwear have never been more affordable. The battlers of Lindsay complain about many things. They complain about the amount of tax they pay, the direction of young people today, unemployment and youth suicide, but they do not complain about the cost of clothes. They are very happy to pay a 25 per cent tariff on textiles, clothing and footwear to keep jobs in Australia. So my shoes cost $25 instead of $20. Do you think the retailers are going to allow me to benefit? If my ball gown had cost $60, would it really have made a difference to my choice of gown? Would I have picked that gown for $60 instead of $80? A manufacturer in my electorate, Elegant Knitting, makes all of the jumpers for the army, navy and air force. In fact, it exports to Malaysia and currently has a $5 million contract with that country. All it is seeking a freeze on tariffs between 2000 and 2005, to get off this disastrous path that Labor has taken us on in the past. The factory at Elegant Knitting is run by the Holmick family. (Time expired) Tariffs: Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",29
31,Mr OKEEFE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Let me say a little more directly what I think the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) was saying obliquely. In my electorate, we have not only got car and vehicle manufacturers which now have a secure future because the government was forced to adopt Labor's tariff plan, but we have got textile industries which are now campaigning actively to get the government to agree to make the same decision. What this government member was signalling in an oblique way was that she understands the stupidity of the government's Industry Commission review of tariffs in the textiles industry, and she is mirroring our call that the government end this speculation now, adopt Labor's textile tariff plan now and give the industry a secure future. Prime Minister: Overseas Trip",30
32,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Wednesday in the House, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) reported on his successful trip to the United States and Great Britain, only to be followed by a negative, small-minded and parochial point-scoring reply from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It should be remembered that prime ministerial visits overseas are designed to achieve largely bipartisan policy positions for Australia, such as positions on greenhouse gas emissions, indexation of pensions for UK citizens in Australia, APEC free trade goals-although the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) seems to oppose this-US and Australia security ties, and attracting of overseas investors to Australia. Unlike his predecessor, Mr Keating, the Prime Minister represented all Australians in a statesmanlike manner by not raising domestic issues while overseas. I remind the House that on his trip to Great Britain and the USA, the Prime Minister met is with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair; opposition leader William Hague; the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown; the Home Secretary; the foreign secretary; Deputy Prime Minister Prescott; former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major; the US President, Bill Clinton; Dr Alan Greenspan; as well as members of the US Congress. It was the opposition leader who used his parliamentary reply last Wednesday to talk about cricket matches, baseball games and Shirley MACLaine. When the Prime Minister of Australia represents our interests overseas in a statesmanlike manner, tackling difficult issues on which there is bipartisan agreement in this parliament, he deserves the respect and support of both major political parties-as did Labor Party prime ministers Hawke and Keating when they represented Australia in international forums-not the petty denigration and point-scoring which we heard from the Leader of the Opposition in this House. (Time expired) Employment",30
33,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman)Australian jobs and job security are guaranteed by creating the right environment for investment in Australia's future. The Howard government, with its hands off the lever attitude to the Australian economy and Australian jobs, cannot deliver new jobs and cannot create job security. And the Hanson formula of fortress Australia and hostility to foreigners-both investors and new Australians-is also doomed to fail those Australians who are looking for a solution to our No. 1 problem, jobs and job security. The Labor Party argues that the solution to job creation is creative and intelligent intervention in the marketplace by government, something neither the two Hs-Hanson and Howard-seem to appreciate. That is why, when we left government, Labor was developing a new policy focus to work with superannuation funds-whose massive funds are, after all, workers' money-to secure and assist job creation in Australia. Labor also believes that we have to create an environment for overseas investment so that we can create Australian jobs. Overseas companies investing in Australia-such as Toyota at Altona, Mitsubishi in Adelaide, Simplot in regional Tasmania, Kodak in Coburg, Nestles, Ford, Sheraton Hotels and a variety of other companies-are companies that we ought to be proud of. They are creating jobs in Australia. The Hansonite formula may well scare off further overseas investment to create jobs, to build job security. The Hansonite formula of a simplistic rhetoric of raising and reintroducof ing tariffs may actually hurt Australian companies which have created good jobs by exporting their products overseas. There is a role for tariffs, but let us be clear: it is about ensuring that we compete on an equal playing field internationally and that we also support foreign investment and job creation and security in Australia.

34,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Lilley)Recently, the Lilley community and Nundah's Organisation To Improve Our Neighbourhood-NOTION-lost one of its hardest working members. That man was David Prince. His fellow NOTION members best sum up David Prince's deeds in a tribute article in the Northern News on 21 August 1997: Whatever task David Prince took on, you could guarantee he would explore every avenue to be able to fulfil it to the smallest detail. David was like a terrier with a bone, returning time and time again until he achieved his mission. David spent many hours sitting outside Food for Less Nundah and at Toombul Shoppingtown selling raffle tickets for Nundah-Fest and promoting the festival. Leading up to ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, David could once more be found at the same locations selling badges and poppies for the RSL. On Australia Day 1996, David received a Lilley Australia Day Award for his services to the community. The local spring festival known as Nundah-Fest will be held on 13 September, and the NOTION members have decided to dedicate to David's memory the Great Wheelbarrow Race which will help raise funds for a defibrillator for the local ambulance. Apart from working for NOTION, NundahFest and Northgate-Nundah RSL, David worked tirelessly for the Nundah Community Centre, the Golden Years Senior Citizens Centre, Meals on Wheels, his church and Nundah Red Cross. (Time expired) Currency Exchange",31
35,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Given the collapse markets in South-East Asia in recent days, the number one question arising from the bailout of the Thai economy with a $1.35 billion currency exchange is to what extent taxpayers' money has been lost as a result of that bailout. I want to touch on two things. The first is that this matter should have been raised in the parliament by way of an appropriation debate. It is absolutely critical that, when Australia participates in a rescue such as this, it is transparent and able to be overseen by the representatives of the people-that is, us here in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is interesting to see that Dr Greenspan, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, criticised the fact that there was limited information available in relation to Thailand's economic activities. In fact, he compared the limited information to the situation that arose in Mexico in recent years-something that has caused considerable difficulties with US investors. The behaviour of Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia has given serious concern to international investors. He is citing the people responsible for the problems in Malaysia's economy as being foreign beasts. Quite clearly, his behaviour is a matter of concern, I would have thought, to those involved business ventures with Malaysia. It is time that Dr Mahathir also realised that lashing out in such a way is not likely to generate confidence amongst investors in the region. (Time expired) St Helena Tramway Project",31
36,Mrs WEST,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to commend the efforts of a local service club, the state and federal governments and the business and local community of Wynnum Manly to establish a project known as the St Helena tramway project on St Helena Island in my electorate of Bowman. St Helena was for a number of years the main prison for Brisbane. It was established on an island in beautiful Moreton Bay only 20 minutes from the Wynnum Manly foreshores. The efforts of a number of Wynnum Manly Rotary Club members and of the local Rotary clubs nearby have been the initiating force in furthering this project to benefit the whole local community. Originally, St Helena was a self-sufficient prison farm catering to the needs of 200 to 300 prisoners, with a support staff as well. What was achieved on St Helena Island was the re-creation of a tramway to transport visitors and inmates from the jetty to the prison enclosure. Funding was provided by the federal government through a labour market program to construct the rail line. Club members supervised this project voluntarily. Construction of the shed was made possible by the efforts of club members from the Port of Brisbane Rotary Club. To those men and women, congratulations for your extensive time and effort in completing this structure. The local business and community network supported this project through fundraising. The state government, represented by the environment minister, Mr Brian Littleproud, are to be commended for their efforts to assist with the progress of this project. The completion of this project was made possible only with the highly specialised effort of the Army in transporting the tram engine from nearby Fisherman Island to the island by Chinook helicopter-a most spectacular event. (Time expired) Community Aged Care",32
37,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Friday I had the honour of launching the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre's community aged care package. The launch was very opportune, with the federal government's controversial new rules relating to nursing homes coming into effect in October. The package provides for funds to the migrant resource centre to provide care for the elderly in their own homes. These packages will prove very popular in areas with large multicultural popUlations, where elderly migrants, due to language problems, may find it difficult to settle i-to nursing homes. This pilot program will enable the government to assess the value of assisting people in this way. It may well prove to be the most economic and caring way of providing care for our elderly citizens. The Blacktown program employs a full-time coordinator, Maria Skibinski, and six part-time multilingual people who go into the clients' homes and assist them with their everyday chores such as shopping, cleaning and taking medication. The migrant resource centre is targeting the Polish, Ukrainian, Maltese and Filipino communities, but the need is there to expand the program if more funds were available. I congratulate the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre and their coordinator, Maria Volcano, on the great work they are performing In assisting our multicultural communities.

40,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That an address to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the following terms be agreed to: YOUR MAJESTY: We, the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, have received with profound sorrow the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. On behalf of the Australian people, we express deep sympathy to Your Majesty and other members of the Royal Family, especially Their Royal Highnesses, Prince William of Wales and Prince Henry of Wales, and we mourn the loss sustained by so many people. The news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in such harrowing circumstances League yesterday was one of those events that can fairly be said to have grabbed the attention, in a profound way, of the entire world, not only because of the news coverage extended but also because of the suddenness of and the shock that always accompanies such events, emphasised by the very public character of the life of the person involved and the particularly distressing circumstances of her death. I know that the thoughts and, indeed, the prayers of many Australians went immediately to her two sons, William and Harry. The loss of a mother for two boys aged 15 and 12whoever the people involved and whatever the circumstances-is always a situation of particular sadness and grief. Their grief will not be entirely private because of the very public character of their lives and those of both their parents. The death of the Princess of Wales has gripped the attention of the world in a way which makes us reflect for a moment on the continued force of the human personality in a world that is meant to be becoming increasingly depersonalised. Our responses to and the emotions caused by these tragic events have absolutely nothing to do with the attitudes we may have about the role of the monarchy or the royal family in our society. Those things do not belong to this condolence motion or to the reactions of the Australian people to these events. I hope that we react like men and women who share the emotions, as best they can, not only of their own circumstances but also of others. Diana, Princess of Wales, was a beautiful, stylish woman. Of that there is no doubt. But she was more than that. She was one of those people who managed, through a combination of circumstances, to fascinate and interest millions of people around the world. Diana was only 36 at her death, and she leaves, as we all know, two sons. She was a person who, in her relatively short life, experienced what many would regard as both the highs and lows of the ultimate as far as public life is concerned. I doubt that there is a woman in the world who was more talked about or reported on in recent years than the late Princess of Wales. I doubt that there has been a marriage in recent years whose disintegration was more public and more reported upon than that of Diana and Prince Charles. That adds all the more to the poignancy of the feelings we have for her two sons. Diana demonstrated a commitment to many worthwhile causes. One of the things which gave her a particular appeal to people right across the social spectrum was the spontaneity of her involvement in so many causes. Her appeal was not an elitist appeal-although she undoubtedly did appeal to many people who might regard themselves as elite-but it had its greatest force amongst the mainstream of not only the British community but, I dare say, the communities of Australia, the United States, France and many other nations of the world. The outpouring of emotion and sadness from so many people within the mainstream of our society and other societies is a testament to that. Diana's spontaneous commitment to the campaign against landmines, her very early disavowal of some of the myths of association with people who had AIDS, her ready embrace of the cause and the interests of people who suffered such debilitating diseases as leprosy and her constant involvement with charities involved in the care and nurture of children all stamped her as a person willing to associate with those less fortunate in our community. Some may say that, whatever the circumstances of her life, particularly over the last 16 years, she certainly did not live in straitened circumstances. That is undeniably the case. It is also undeniably the case that many who live in relatively equally comfortable circumstances do not have the commitment that Diana demonstrated to those sorts of causes. Diana was welcomed many times to Australia. The four-week royal tour of Australia in 1983 broke with tradition when the infant Prince William accompanied his mother and father. The Prince and Princess of Wales also visited in Australia in 1985, going to both Canberra and Melbourne. They came again in 1988 to celebrate the bicentenary and they handed over Britain's gift to Australia, the sail training ship, the Young Endeavour. They joined our Australia Day celebrations and took the salute from the parade of the Tall Ships in Sydney Harbour. Many will remember Diana's last visit to Australia in November last year to attend a charity event for the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute-ironically, in memory of a man who had given so much to Australia and to the world and who also died in very sad and tragic circumstances. At that time she took in a visit to the research institute, St Vincent's Hospital, the Sacred Heart Hospice, a charity lunch for the Commonwealth Day Council and the Royal Rehabilitation Centre at Ryde. Many Australians will remember the images of her embracing people suffering illness and many will remember how she was reunited with Ben Robertson, aged 18, who had struck up a friendship with her some years ago when his father worked as her equerry on a previous royal tour to Australia. Ben had become a quadriplegic the previous June after injuring his spinal cord in a rugby match. As I have mentioned, she was patron to a variety of charitable causes. As well as those associated with AIDS, antipersonnel mines and leprosy, the causes included chari ties helping people suffering blindness, deafness, cancer, Parkinson's disease, lung disease, nervous diseases and meningitis. It is a very sad event for her family and for many people around the world. It reminds all of us of the fragility of life. It reminds all of us that, no matter what our presumed lofty station in life and whatever our financial and other circumstances may be, it is a very fragile existence. It is an event that has stopped the world; it is an event of very great sadness. I want on behalf of the government-and I know these sentiments will be shared by the opposition-to convey particularly to her two young sons and to other members of the royal family the deep sorrow of the Australian people. Diana was a person that did capture our imagination. It was not only her style and beauty but also her spontaneity, her friendliness, her warmth and her capacity to evokeparticularly in the young in our communitythe image of a warm and modem woman. People will remember her in different ways. Many Australians who met her on her frequent visits to this country will remember her with very great affection and will want to be associated with the sentiments that are being expressed here today. Mr Speaker, can I simply say that, on behalf of all of my colleagues on the government side, we mourn this tragic event. We feel for and we pray for her two young sons left so bereft by this tragic accident.",33
41,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"The opposition supports the motion and associates itself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I am privileged to be able to speak on our behalf here today and agree with those sentiments well expressed by the Prime Minister. I think all of us will remember what we did yesterday. It is one of those seminal events such that, when a personal life which has become such a public life and so broadly shared is terminated, it impacts upon the lives of all of us. In the same way that most of us of an age can remember what happened on the day of the assassination of President Kennedy, most of us will remember what we were doing yesterday. The shock was all the more profound because the early reports from the hospital were somewhat more hopeful as to what had been the outcome of the accident, tragic though it had been for the others involved. There seemed to be a possibility that she had survived. But, of course, she has not. The Prime Minister was right to identify two sons as the people who will suffer most from this, but there will be many sufferers. First, with her sons, she was a loving mother and a caring mother; she was a mother who obviously meant a great deal to them. She obviously had a rapport with children and she incorporated many within her ambit of affection. I suppose it stemmed somewhat from her background as a kindergarten teacher. I guess not many people remember that, but that is what she was trained to be. She obviously learned her lessons well as she extrapolated her professional experience, mixed it with her natural emotions and became a friend to many children everywhere. Many in this country and I think most of us in this parliament will have met her at one time or another. Certainly I have on a number of occasions-two of which were referred to by the Prime Minister: in 1983, when, I suspect, he probably met her then himself, and then again in 1988, when she was out here for those celebrations of ours. I met her basically because her then husband was the Honorary Colonel of the Armoured Corps in Australia and there was a reception and parade at Puckapunyal. I had an opportunity to have more than just some cursory words with her and was taken quite by surprise at the considerable depth that she had. It was not quite what I had expected, but it was something that we all came to know over succeeding years and probably should have known by then. The Prime Minister listed an extraordinary array of charities. It is not uncommon for members of the British aristocracy to associate themselves with charitable activity. What is uncommon is what she chose to associate herself with. There is nothing lovely, nothing necessarily even uplifting, about the circumstances that caused the charities with which she was associated. HIV-AIDS sufferers went for many years unrecognised and then, when recognised, despised. When she took up their cause, they were still despised. They are not now. Then she took on charities associated with leprosy. That is still despised. That is still a charity that people find very difficult to come to her grips with in many countries, but it was not a problem for her. More recently, of course, there were the tragic circumstances globally associated with profligate mining activities of various armies serving various political causes-all of them devastating to the countries that their profligate activities have impinged upon. She did all of these things with great daring, great joy, great spontaneous affection. There were pictures of her walking down the roads in not-yet-cleared mined areas. It must have given her guards heart failure. That was not a very sensible thing to do. Nevertheless, she was prepared to put an image of herself alongside a terrible problem-likewise, sitting for a long period of time holding hands with lepers; likewise, sitting for a long period of time holding an HIV-AIDS affected baby. So she won a place in the hearts of all of us through those spontaneous and warm gestures. I think it was probably a surprise to many of us that we missed her. It was a surprise to me when it occurred yesterday. I have to say that the issues affecting the British royal family are not the first thing on my mind every morning, and even the concern about whether or not they should be our head of state is not on my mind first thing every morning as I wake up. All of a sudden, all that service of hers, all those images of her in those circumstances in which she chose to place herself, all came home. I think that the best conclusion I could make would be to go through the words of Tony Blair, who was, I know, a very close friend. He says: I feel like everyone else in this country today. I am utterly devastated. Our thoughts and prayers are with the royal family, in particular with her two sons, the two boys. Our hearts go out to them . . . We are today a nation in a state of shock, in mourning, in grief that's so deeply painful for us. She was a wonderful and a warm human being, although her own life was often sadly touched by tragedy. She touched the lives of so many others in Britain and throughout the world with joy and with comfort. How many times shall we remember her in how many different ways-with the sick, the dying, with children, with the needy. With just a look or a gesture that spoke so much more than words, she would reveal to all of us the depth of her compassion and her humanity. ... We know how difficult things were for her from time to time. I am sure we can only guess that. But people everywhere, not just here in Britain, kept faith with Princess Diana. They liked her, they loved her, they regarded her as one of the people. She was the People's Princess and that is how she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and our memories forever.",35
42,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I rise with great sadness to support the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on the death in tragic circumstances of the Princess of Wales. Let me say at the outset that the role and the contribution she made to the role of the spouse will stand as one of her singular achievements. She provided for an upgrading and updating of that role and then took that further and faster as she moved on to support so many causes, which have been mentioned by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Whilst it is true that this has been a time honoured function of so many members of the royal family, particularly the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, and so many other spouses, I think it is also true to say that the momentum that Princess Diana created for so many charitable causes which were not the flavour of the month or regarded all that well at the time and since, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, does deserve our praise here this day as we consider this motion and message to Her Majesty the Queen. I guess, as part of that equation, that involved a use of the media and even elements of the paparazzi. But that did not in any way justify the unfettered and very much on the edge of the law, if not beyond the law, intrusion which came from elements of the paparazzi as they hounded Princess Diana through much of her life. I guess we can also ask the question: was her role as a spouse and her role as a free-standing charity worker a circus for the sake of a circus and attention? The answer to that question must clearly be no. Given the choice and the level of commitment to the task, it is clearly obvious that she carried a very genuine and determined will to assist those who were worse off: those who were afflicted by leprosy, by AIDS and by antipersonnel mines right around the world. Lady Diana Spencer had fame thrust upon her as a young woman through the simple twist of fate that the man she married is the heir to the British crown. She quickly became the darling of the British media-and, indeed, the world media-who just as quickly reinvented her as a fairy tale princess. It is one of the tragedies of her short life that the media, having created the myth around her, then expected her to live on that myth in the full glare of constant and unremitting publicity. I met the Princess of Wales on two occasions: once at a reception at the New South Wales state parliament and once during a visit she made with Prince Charles and Prince William when she lived for a period at Holbrook and travelled through Albury to and from various functions around Australia. I remember a beautiful and elegant young woman who was remarkably at ease with ordinary people, notwithstanding her subsequent remarks as to how much a challenge she found this to be initially at places like Alice Springs. She went out of her way to overcome that feeling of nervousness and to really carryon that contact with ordinary people right around the world. She did give a modem face to the monarchy, a face that reflected the society in which we live in the second half of the 20th century with all its pressures and difficulties. Sadly, that reflection of society extended to the breakdown of her own marriage. That very private part of her life, too, was lived on the front pages of the tabloid press. She was a woman who lived the second half of her life under enormous pressure. We must all admire the way she came to deal with that pressure and to find her own place. Her devotion to her children, Prince William and Prince Harry, was extraordinary and the efforts she made to raise them, to the extent possible, in a normal life reflected that devotion and commitment. Just as admirable was how she found a way to use the intense media interest, as I mentioned, to carry charitable causes forward. There is no doubt that, as a public figure, she could give those causes a huge boost. She knew that and she did that. She did not have to do that, but that was very much part of her commitment. The royal family being what it is and the media being what it is, the personal life of the Princess of Wales is likely to be the part of her life that is most discussed in coming months. It would be a great pity if we were to forget her huge contribution to the causes she championed and a greater pity if those causes themselves were to slip from our minds. To all of the families connected with the victims of the horrific car accident in Paris on the weekend and to the royal family, as part of this motion before the House this day I extend on behalf of the National Party our deep sympathy.

46,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen today' s dismal building approval figures which follow last week's feeble investment expectations figures? How can the government say that the recovery is on track when business investment expectations are 2.4 per cent lower than last year, and housing approvals, despite the successive interest rate cuts, have fallen by almost 10 per cent in the last three months? With even Treasury and the Reserve Bank saying that the government has slowed the economy, will the Treasurer now admit that the government has failed on jobs and has failed on growth?",37
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for a question on the economy, which we so rarely get. It is very interesting that he should refer to the CAPEX figures today. The CAPEX figures came out last week. Mr Gareth Evans-I said 'last week'.",38

Whenever there is good news in the Australian economy, you see big faces on the Labor Party. Poor old Labor Party. Whenever there is good news, people come out and say, 'Aren't things going well,' and things get worse for Labor.",38
50,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Treasurer had a straight question on a couple of economic statistics, and he is going on with this bluster and blah. It is irrelevant.",38
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer was digressing, but I noted that he was moving very quickly to get to the substance of the question.",38
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, I was talking about the capital expenditure survey released last week, the balance of payments released last week. I could go on and tell you about the stocks figures released today, which were much stronger than expected. No doubt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will catch up with them in two weeks time. Building approvals released today for the three months to July 1997 were down, but seasonally adjusted over the year they were up 8.6 per cent. The Citibank REIA index of home affordability increased 5.1 per cent in the March quarter and is now at its highest level since September 1994. The Commonwealth Bank HIA index of housing affordability remains at a very high level, despite a slight fall in the June quarter. Housing approvals and building approvals will vary from month to month and quarter to quarter. We had an exceptionally strong one in May, as I recall, because Olympic building was coming through. But for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition it is not enough to look at year long developments, nor is it enough to look at trends, because that does not suit the argument. What he does is ignore all of the strong ones until he can find one that corrects, and then he gets up and asks one of these juvenile questions that he just engaged in. The fact of the matter is that the housing cycle will recover-as we have always said-gradually over the course of 1997 -98, as it comes off a dramatic excess of supply over demand which pent up in 1994. Unquestionably, the economy slowed throughout the course of late 1995, early 1996, as it was intended to, as a result of the Labor Party raising interest rates at the end of 1994 by 2% per cent in a determined effort to slow the economy, and it worked. We said at the time that that was necessary because an economy that was running at growth rates in excess of four per cent with huge current account deficits and budget deficits could not sustain growth. We would be in the same position if we had not addressed structural problems in the Australian economy. If we had not taken the steps to rein in the budget deficit, we would not be able to sustain higher growth, as we will now be able to in 1997-98. If we had not been raising savings, we would not have been in a position to sustain increased growth over 1997-98 as a result of the current account deficit. If we had not locked in low inflation with a new statement of monetary policy, we would have just gone through the cycle again. These were the big changes that were necessary to set Australia up for sustainable growth. They are the changes which now have the prospect of holding out strong sustained growth throughout 1997-98-the kind of growth that can only be accomplished by structural change.",38
53,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. In his answer, the Treasurer accused me of selective quotation of housing figures. I ask whether he recalls saying in this place on 19 March: The house building industry is quite a crucial industry to Australia. It has always been a driver of economic growth, and the turning-up in relation to the housing industry is consistent with the strengthening economy through 1997. How does he feel about that quote now that the housing industry has been turning down for three months?",39

56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the appointments that have been made by the government represent an outstanding cross-section of the Australian community. They represent all age groups. There is a very appropriate balance between men and women. Within the ranks of those the government has nominated there are a number of people who have identifiably republican views, there are a number of people who have identifiably anti-republican views and there are also a very large number of people who, I think, have an open mind on the subject. I was quite fascinated that not even the Leader of the Opposition could quite summon the courage to attack the 36 names that I had announced. When he was asked the question, ' Mr Beazley, is Labor satisfied with the government's appointments to the repUblican convention?' he answered, 'Well, it is very difficult to tell exactly how they will come up in the republican issue.' That is not a bad start. 'Suffice it to say we did not get terribly many of our nominees up. Those that did get up were very welcome.' Let me say that three of the people nominated by the Labor Party got up; five nominated by the Australian Republican Movement got up. There were 900 altogether.

68,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We got a swing in Fannie Bay.,40
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is what you were doing. The other thing I am really very proud to say is that the promise that my government made to the indigenous community of Australia has been well and truly honoured. I am very happy to point out that amongst the 36 people are Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, the current chairman of ATSIC; the former chairman, Dr Lois O'Donoghue; George Mye of the Torres Strait Islander community; and the Young Australian of the Year, Nova Peris-Kneebone, who is also a very outstanding member of Australia's indigenous community. As promised-and, once again, a promise delivered in full-there are eight delegates between the ages of 18 and 25. I am also happy to say that the ranks of older Australians are also properly represented, as they should be within this community. The government has delivered 36 very eminent Australians to attend this convention. It is a balanced group. It is balanced in every sense. I think they will dignify the proceedings and make an enormous contribution. Any narking, nagging criticism to the contrary will fall to the ground. Foreign Debt",40
70,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer-the real, self-confessed pedlar of snake oil in this place. Has the Treasurer seen today' s foreign debt figures showing that net foreign debt has now burst through the $200 billion mark, despite a flat economy? Is the Treasurer aware that Australia's net foreign debt has now increased by $15.7 billion since March last year? How does this massive increase in foreign debt-almost 50 per cent more foreign debt in a year and a quarter than was accumulated during Labor's last 2I1z years-compare with your 'debt truck' promise to actually reduce foreign debt?",40
71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Labor's last 2Y2 yearsso what do we make of the first IOY2 years; they were just practice, were they? The shadow Treasurer says, 'The first 10Y2 years we were just warming up, ignore them, and just take into account the last 2Y2 of the first 13' - actually 2Y2 out of 13 is not a bad pass mark, a great success. All I can say is some mothers do' ave 'em. The shadow Treasurer gets up here and asks about foreign debtwhen the Labor Party came to office, foreign debt was $23 billion and you took it to $187 billion-and he says, 'Oh, but ignore 10Y2 years; we were only practising. Only take into account the last 2Y2 years.' I can also remember one PJ. Keating standing at this dispatch box. In answer to a question from Barry Jone.s, the member for Lalor, in the caucus meeting, he said that foreign debt was not a problem and he was going to circulate notes to the caucus to prove it. That was a year before the election. Did they ever come? I think the member for Lalor is still looking for them. They might be down at the Hill of Content bookshop, if you have a look down there. In relation to Australia's international investment position-for the elucidation of the Labor Party-net external liabilities as at 30 June 1997 were $202 billion and the net equity and other investment was $105 billion. Between the March and the June quarter, net foreign equity in Australia rose 6.3 per cent. I have noticed that there have been complaints in some quarters that Australia is not doing well in relation to foreign investment but let me say again that, between the March and the June quarter, net foreign equity in the Australian economy rose 6.3 per cent while net foreign debt rose 2.2 per cent. But the significant thing is the debt servicing ratio. The debt servicing ratio, which is the cost of servicing net debt in relation to the GDP, actually fell from 11 per cent to 10.6 per cent. If the coalition had its way, Australia's exposure to net foreign debt would not be of the dimension that it now is, but we inherited an economy which had had 13 years of Keating-Beazley Labor mismanagement. If we had inherited foreign debt of $23 billion, as you did, we would not be in the exposed position that we are now. But we had 13 years of Keating-Beazley Labor mismanagement that took foreign debt in this country from $23 billion to $187 billion. Here is the Labor Party pretending it was not doing anything for those 13 years and saying, 'We weren't here. We weren't responsible.' But the fact is the Labor Party made foreign debt a problem in this country, just as you made the budget deficit a problem and just as you had no idea how to manage the economy. It is going to take years to stabilise that position; it is going to take a very long time, I can tell you. But the good thing is that by next year, as a result of this government's efforts, we will not be running further budget deficits. When this government was elected the Commonwealth was spending more than it took in revenue-$10,000 million of Beazley failure. But, instead of having the decency to own up during the election campaign, you went around trying to cover it up. You did not have the decency to come clean to the Australian people. By the end of this first term, we will have turned that deficit around. We will have taken a $10.3 billion Beazley deficit and we will have turned it into a surplus. This is a government that is making the big changes to the Australian economy; this is the government which is taking your failures and righting them.",40
72,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question: if, as the Treasurer said, his fiscal consolidation has been so successful, why has Commonwealth government net foreign debt increased from $13.2 billion last March to $19 billion in June this year?",41
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,41
74,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just take you through the figures: the outcome for 1995-96, the last year when Mr Beazley was the finance minister, was a $10.3 billion deficit.",41
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order: the Treasurer has had a specific question on the foreign debt position of the Australian government. What he is dealing with is a totally different proposition-the John Fahey budget that he is talking about apparently at the moment that he brought down last year. What we are interested in is the foreign debt component.",41
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have listened carefully. There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,41
77,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And when you run a $10.3 billion deficit, how do you think you finance it?",41
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You don't understand it!,41
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Here is a question for an ex finance minister: how would you fund a $10.3 billion deficit? Mr Tanner-There isn't one!,41
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Melbourne.,41
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How do you fund it? You do it by racking up Commonwealth debt and you racked up $10.3 billion of debt in 1995-96. In 1996-97 we have a preliminary outcome: the coalition government got debt down to $5 billion but there was still a financing requirement. The first time we will free ourselves from financing requirements will be in the forthcoming financial year as a result of asset sales. But, in underlying terms, we will only free ourselves from financing requirements when we get the budget back into balance, which is not in this but in the forthcoming financial year. That is the way in which you stabilise and then begin to reduce Commonwealth debt. The reason why the failed finance minister does not know how it is done is that he never did it. Not once did you balance the accounts. In fact, over five years of your finance tenure, you racked up $70 billion of Commonwealth debt. In the last five years of Keating-Beazley Labor mismanagement, they took Commonwealth debt from $20 billion to $90 billion. You have the hide to stand up here and ask about Commonwealth debt. When it comes to Commonwealth debt, you were the unquestioned champions. Northern Territory Election: Native",41
82,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would be aware of the Country Liberal Party's resounding success in last Saturday's Northern Territory election. Has the Prime Minister seen remarks by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Shane Stone, regarding the workability of native title legislation? Will the Prime Minister advise the House of progress of the government's proposed reforms to the Native Title Act?",42
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for race the Northern Territory for that question. Can I take the opportunity to congratulate Stone and the Country Liberal Party on an indigenous outstanding win last Saturday. It is the sixth successive win by the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. Can I say that it overwhelmingly due to the good government that Mr Stone and his colleagues now, before them, have delivered to the Northern Territory. It is remarkable that, despite the fact that the Country Liberal Party has in office since self-government was granted in 1975, it was able to secure a swing in favour.",42
84,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The Prime the ALP. Minister is not referring to any matter of Commonwealth responsibility. Mr MCGauran-Oh, come on; native title!",42
85,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not a matter of Commonwealth responsibility. He is simply expressing his opinion about a state election. It is not relevant to the Commonwealth's responsibilities.,42
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat!,42
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The outcome of the have election on Saturday was not only a triumph for the CLP but a disaster for the Labor Party and Kim Beazley. It was also a disaster for the member for Banks. This pathetic attempt by the Labor Party to introduce the charge of racism into the debate backfired completely. The only people who played the race card were Kim Beazley and Daryl Melham. You are the only two who played the race card in Title the Northern Territory election.,42
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What rubbish!,42
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says, 'What rubbish!' Do not rely on that.",42
90,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When? When? Give us a quote! When did I say anything? Give us a quote. He is misleading the House. That is the existing what he is doing.,42
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Banks is to date testing my patience.,42
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Shane Stone did not play the race card; Kim Beazley did. You brought into it. You fell on your face, and you deserve to fall on your face. The people who Shane helped to push you onto your face were territorians. Do not just accept this as a political judgment from the other side. Can I remind you that in the urban seat of is Millner, with a large Aboriginal constituency, there was an 11 per cent swing to the CLP. In and Victoria River, which has a 68 per cent Aboriginal population, Labor's support dropped an estimated 29 per cent. In Macdonbeen nell, which has a 70 per cent Aboriginal population, the primary vote for Labor is its estimated to have fallen by 43 per cent. In Amhem, which has a large Aboriginal population, there was a 16 per cent swing against The people of the Northern Territory, both European and indigenous, voted for their future. They voted for development. They voted for jobs. They rejected the Labor Party's baseless smear campaign. They also voted for native title reform. They voted in favour of decisions that are going to promote a harmonious Native Title Act between all the members of the Australian community. I am asked by the member for the Northern Territory: what plans does the government in mind in relation to reforms of the Native Title Act? I can tell the member for the Northern Territory, because I know of his very deep interest, that we will be introducing into this parliament this week the amendments to the Native Title Act. The Native Title Amendment Bill will restore fairness and certainty to native title legislation in Australia. That Native Title Amendment Bill will restore predictability to the pastoralists of Australia. That Native Title Amendment Bill will protect the basic principles of the Mabo decision that the High Court of Australia brought down in 1991. That Native Title Amendment Bill has followed the most extensive discussion and consultation between the representatives of the government and the representatives of the various stakeholders within the Australian community. Can I say that I was absolutely fascinated to read of some comments this morning from the Leader of the Australian Democrats in relation to this amendment bill, in which she is quoted as warning of a six-month delay on the bill. She has not even seen the final form of the bill, but she is telling us that there is going to be a six-month delay. That, may I say, is in very stark contrast to what happened in 1993. It would be useful to recall that Democrat support for the committee reference of the Native Title Bill in 1993 saw it dealt with in 15 days. The original native title legislation introduced by the Labor Party was referred to a committee on 25 November and a report was furnished and tabled in the Senate on 9 December 1993. That particular piece of legislation was more complex and more controversial than the amendments that we are going to introduce. It has turned out to be a disastrous piece of legislation. It has not delivered native title justice to the indigenous people of Australia, but it has delivered uncertainty and unpredictability to the farmers and miners of Australia. It has taken a coalition government to summon both the courage and the capacity to bring forward an amendment bill. What do we have from the Australian Democrats? Instead of the fast passage, the carte blanche, the do anything you like approach that they adopted to the Labor Party's legislation, they are already threatening a sixmonth delay. Let me say to the Australian Democrats and let me also say to the Australian Labor Party, that the Australian people, just like the people of the Northern Territory, will not accept obstruction and delay on native title amendments. What the Australian people want is this issue tackled and resolved. We have had discussion over months and months. They want predicability; they want certainty; they want clarity. They have got it from the government. You will be very unwise to try to obstruct the legislation. Forest Industries",42
93,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Does the minister agree with the plan of his colleague the Minister for the Environment to undermine the Tasmanian regional forest agreement process by swapping areas of importance to the veneer and sawlogs industry for comparable areas of more scientific and environmental importance under the nationally agreed Janis reserve criteria?,43
94,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is absolutely committed to the regional forest agreement process-something that those opposite were never able to achieve. For a very long time indeed, they had the entire country in total and absolute turmoil when it came to forest industries. They had regional communities right across the country that could not wait to throw them out. They had lost the plot so badly that not only did they have the forest industries completely offside and destroyed but they were not getting conservation outcomes either. In so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, we have continued and will continue to progress sensible, rational, robust regional forest agreements, which will secure industry confidence and turn around the uncertainty that has seen us importing $3 billion worth of everybody else's timber and paper products whilst we cripple our own industries. In so far as Tasmania is concerned, we are putting forward to the Tasmanian government a sensible and rational approach. There are some details yet to be finalised, but they are for us and the Tasmanian government to work through.",43
95,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister said that the government was committed to the RFA process. Is he committed to the scientific basis of that process?",44
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,44
97,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I suspect the member opposite knows, we are committed to achieving the broad objective of the Janis criteria. It is not always possible to achieve that to the last crossed 't' and dotted 'i'. is well known and well recorded-it simply will not be possible. But we are aiming to set and meet that objective and, wherever possible, we will fulfil those requirements. Where a maximisation of the Janis criteria proves impossible, there will always be an attempt in the end to take into account other things such as socio-economic factors. We have always made that plain. We care about jobs in rural and regional Australia and, from time to time, there may be a willingness to consider what committed conservationists might like to see included in a package. Budget Strategy",44
98,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,ANNE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What efforts has the government put in place to improve the budget position? What effect would irresponsible spending proposals have on it?,44
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As members in this House would know, when this government was elected, the Commonwealth was running a $10.3 billion deficit-it was spending $10,300 million more than it was raising by way of revenue. The principal author of that was the then Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. When this government came into office it was necessary to attend to the failures of Mr Beazley as finance minister and to turn them around. It should not have been that way. Mr Beazley had claimed during the election campaign that the accounts, which were $10,300 million in deficit, were actually in surplus. On 1 February 1996, in the Age he said: We're in a position where we've got no plans to increase taxes. Why would we? We're operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future. That was on 1 February 1996. It was then known that the budget was at least $8,000 million in deficit. The final outcome was $10,300 million of deficit in June of 1996. This government immediately put in place a plan to rescue the Commonwealth accounts. After one year, the outcome for 1996-97 in June of 1997 was to have that $10.3 billion That deficit down to a $5 billion deficit. We could not abolish Labor's failure overnight, but we halved the damage that Labor had put in place, and came in by June of 1997 with a deficit of $5 billion. In this year, 1997-98, the budget will still be in deficit. We have projected a deficit in the budget of $3.9 billion. But next year, 1998-99, the budget will be in surplus. So over the course of one term we will have taken a budget deficit two per cent of GDP and have put it into surplus. We will have done that by taking a very strong line in relation to Commonwealth expenditures. We did not take the Keating policy of putting up wholesale sales taxes, taking away income taxesMr Gareth Evans-At what cost to jobs?",44
100,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Keating policy of the 1993 election was to get elected and fraudulently go about increasing taxes. We did not do it that way; we did it the honest way by going in and making sure that Commonwealth expenditures were put under control. As I said before, by next year in the parliamentary term, the accounts on current estimates should be in surplus. We already see wanton, irresponsible political opportunists, such as the Labor Party, deciding to spend next year's surplus. There is no surplus in the Commonwealth accounts at the moment. On current policy, we should have one next year. We already see the wanton irresponsibility of the Labor Party even now thinking up plans about how to drive the Commonwealth back into deficit again. On the Meet the Press program on 24 August, Mr Beazley said when asked by Mr Bongiorno if he would be prepared to use the surplus-that is, next year's surplus-for personal tax cuts: We have a very open mind on the way in which that operates and we would demand the same rights that they have in regard to it. The Labor Party has no rights in relation to the Commonwealth's surplus. It fought every measure to tum around the Commonwealth accounts and now, once we get the Commonwealth accounts back into order, it wants to go and wantonly waste it again. Have no doubt what the Labor Party policy is: higher deficit, higher debt and higher interest rates-all of the things that they championed over 13 years when Paul Keating had the home mortgage interest rate at 17 per cent and when the Labor Party was mortgaging the future of young people in this country with its wanton irresponsibility. On the weekend we saw Senator Kernot from the Democrats come out with a $2 billion expenditure package. She thinks that, if this government can do the hard work of producing a surplus, she has the right to spend it too. You can sit up there in the Senate and do everything possible to try to prevent this government from reversing the deficit and, once the government overcomes your opposition and succeeds, you then get rights to go and spend the money again. Senator Kernot said that she would like to spend $2 billion, that the plan would not add to the underlying deficit for next year because the proposals were mainly one-off. So her logic is that, if you spend it this year, it will not add to the deficit next year. This is what she says. The plan would not add to the underlying defeat for next year because the proposals are mainly one-off. As I said before, it is Winnie the Pooh to the honey pot. You sit around and do everything you can to make sure that this government is frustrated in its efforts to do the hard work, to make the structural change to the Australian accounts. If you are defeated in that-if you are defeated in your attempts to stop us from fixing the economy-what you want to do is then get the opportunity to try to run it down again. I can assure the House that this governmenthaving worked hard to stabilise the Commonwealth debt, to bring the accounts back into surplus, to get interest rates down, to get benefits to families, to get benefits to home buyers-is not going to stand by and see the Australian Labor Party try to step in and wantonly destroy all of that effort again. We will not allow it. Civil Aviation Authority",44
101,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer the minister to a judgment recently handed down by the Federal Court in a dispute between Hughes Aircraft Systems and the Civil Aviation Authority over the awarding of the advanced air traffic control system contract. Is it true that the court found that the CAA had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct and had committed a number of breaches of contract? Is it true that the court found that an industry minister in the former Labor government had made an improper attempt to influence the contract process? Is it true that Hughes is seeking massive damages, suggested to be up to $50 million, all of which will be paid either by the taxpayer or by an increase in airline tickets? Is it true that a former chairman of the CAA, Ted Butcher, has written to you calling for a review of matters surrounding the TAAA TS contract? Is it true that another former chairman of CAA",45
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is excessively long and excessively complex. I think it would be much more appropriate to put your question on notice.,45
103,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just to conclude, will the government show some leadership and some recognition of the major concerns emerging",45
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. Trade Union Membership,45
105,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Has the minister seen reports of a poll commissioned by the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council showing that the standing of trade unions continues to decline, despite attempts by the ACTU-such as the announcement yesterday of a 'union card' - to arrest this slide? How do these developments compare with the government's policy of encouraging choice in the workplace?",45
106,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I did see that report of a poll commissioned by those great supporters of the ACTU leadership, the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council. It is very interesting that Mr Sams should put this poll out on the eve of the ACTU congress. Perhaps it might be a reminder to his fellow trade union leaders of the challenges before the ACTU. The poll shows that, compared with 1996, in 1997 the percentage of workers who wanted to be in unions had declined from 47 per cent to 43 per cent, and it showed that 42 per cent of workers agreed with the statement that unions did not look after their members. That is actually shades of an earlier report which the government released last week, the Australian workplace relations survey, which chartered the declining influence of unions in the workplace. One of the figures that caught my attention was that only 46 per cent of unionists agreed that unions take notice of members' complaints and problems. The survey also found that 88 per cent of managers at workplaces with 20 or more employees-a higher percentage in small business-would prefer to deal directly with employees rather than through a trade union. That is a common sense and practical affirmation of what we have been saying; that is, you ought to have a system to allow people at work to sit down directly and in a cooperative, sensible way manage their relations at work in that direct sense, subject to a set of reasonable safety net criteria. I think these are very significant issues the ACTU congress. The labour council from New South Wales does have a record of calling for reform and I do think that the ACTU leadership should be taking note of what it has to say. Jennie George yesterday launched a union card, as if this were sort of a response to their problems.",46
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The last card.,46
108,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is certainly not the first time they have had one of these cards. They have been involved in these sorts of things before. It goes all the way back to ACTUSolo and Bourkes and all that sort of stuff. Regardless of what you think of the card, in a sense it is symptomatic of their problems. They have massive problems with their own members saying, 'You are not taking any interest in the membership. We are paying good money by way of subscriptions and we are not getting anything back.' Their response is a union card, which they have done before. If you go back to 1995, the ACTU set themselves a recruitment target of an extra 200,000 members. If you look at the numbers, you see that they have actually declined by about 85,000 or 90,000. So something is seriously wrong within the trade union movement. It reflects on the fact that there has been a continuing decline in union membership, down one-third from roughly 46 per cent in 1986 to 31 per cent of the work force. I do not think there is any doubt that Jennie George and Bill Kelty are going to be re-elected. But I do think that people within the trade union have to ask themselves, 'What policies are we endorsing?, The truth of the matter is that, if you look at the policies, at what has happened to the trade union movement, they have been losing members and they are more and more out of touch with the rank and file. In a sense, that ultimately deprives their own members with the key to higher wages; that is, a system which allows them at work to come to sensible arrangements which can give us the higher productivity, which can give us the wages. This is a critical congress-an important one for the ACTU. It is also an important one for the Labor Party because, let us face it, their major constituency is still the trade for union movement and they are basically going out of business. We wish them well for the congress. Forest Industries",46
109,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Tasmanian regional forest agreement cannot remotely achieve the Janis criteria, particularly conservation of 15 per cent of pre-1750 forest types, biodiversity and protection of rare and endangered species, unless significant areas of forest on private land are protected? In light of Premier Rundle's statement today in the Tasmanian parliament that the RFA was being delayed because of the Commonwealth refusing to accept financial responsibility, has the federal government further damaged the prospect of a successful outcome for the Tasmanian regional forest agreement?",46
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have not seen that statement. Any suggestion that the Commonwealth has not been willing to shoulder both its financial responsibilities and its other responsibilities in negotiating with Tasmania could not be further from the truth. I have had a number of discussions with the Tasmanian Premier. The last of those discussions involved the making of a very generous Commonwealth offer and I am yet to hear from him. Australian National,47
111,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of claims by the opposition shadow transport spokesman that the government should have taken more money for the sale of Australian National? Could the minister advise the House of the employment benefits, both now and in the future, particularly in regional Australia, will flow from the sale of Australian National?",47
112,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I did hear at the end of last week criticism emanating from the member for Melbourne, who represents the Labor Party on transport matters. The criticisms from the honourable member for Melbourne were along the lines that somehow or other we had sold AN too cheaply. I will quote some of the comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne. He said, 'It's a serious under-repayment for the taxpayer,' 'It's only reaped $95 million,' and 'It's a serious worry.' I hope all AN workers heard those comments of Labor's spokesman on transport. I would have to admit that this government could have reaped more money from the sale of AN, but, of course, this government did not put as its top priority for the sale of AN the reaping of money. We put as our top priority jobs and regional development. By accepting a lower bid we were able to obtain more jobs for workers at AN. We were able to guarantee every one of the apprentices at AN a job in the future. We were able to get contracted agreements from the winning bidders-some $97 million in capital expenditure to go into improving the services of AN. We got a commitment by accepting a lower bid from the new owners of AN that there would be no line closures, unlike the former Labor government which had 16 line closures when they were in office. We got a commitment that there would be more passenger services operated by the former AN, unlike the former Labor government which saw eight passenger services closed during their tenure in office. We were able by accepting a lower bid to give more regional opportunities to places like Port Augusta and Broken Hill. Had we taken Labor's advice and reaped more money those benefits that are so vital to the people who work at AN and to the people of South Australia and Tasmania would not have materialised. Had we done what Labor had done then those things would not have happened. Labor would have taken the money. The obvious consequence of what the that honourable member for Melbourne was saying is that Labor would have taken the money and damn the consequences, much like Gordon Gekko. Do you remember Gordon Gekko? He said, 'Greed is good.' This coalition is not about looking just at the money. This coalition, when given the choice of the money or the jobs, went for the jobs. The young and the heartless on Labor's front-bench would have taken the money and damn the jobs. This government, in the successful sale of AN, gave the benefits to the workers, to the apprentices, to the people in the workshops at Port Augusta, to the people at Broken Hill and to the people in Tasmania. It is those people, who would have heard the comments of Labor's spokesman on transport, who would have said to themselves, 'This just confirms what we always thought-Labor is still out of touch after all this time.'",47
113,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports that all of Tasrail' s 182 workers, except one apprentice, will be made redundant after last week's decision to sell the state's rail network? What assurances will the government give to those workers that they will find work with the new owners?",48
114,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is false in the terms on which it was based. Every one of AN's workers will receive an enormously generous redundancy. Opposition members-Oh!,48
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left.,48
116,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Every single one of those people will receive a generous redundancy. Why? It is not because they will be losing their jobs when the new owners take over; it is because they cease employment with the Commonwealth. Under the terms of their award, when they cease employment with the Commonwealth, regardless of whether or not they have a job the next day with the new owner, they get a redundancy payment. This attempt by the honourable gentleman on the other side to try to portray that every single worker of AN in Tasmania will lose their job is completely wrong.",48
117,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question was directed to the future of the apprentices employed at AN and the minister has conspicuously failed to answer that question.",48
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,48
119,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As we have already outlined in the details of the sale, the vast majority people who work at AN will not only get a redundancy payment but also, the very next day, get a job with a new employer. The vast majority of all of AN's employees will go on and receive a job with the new owners of AN. Every single one of them, under the very generous terms in which this government has dealt with them, will get a redundancy payment, because that is what the award requires under their terms of employment with the Commonwealth. Tasrail I just contrast the treatment of the workers at AN under this government with the treatment the workers got under the former Labor government. When they came into office there were some 10,500 people working for AN. When they left office 13 years later there were some 2,500 people working for AN. When the people in the Labor Party go on about job losses in AN, there is no-one in the history of AN who is more guilty of applying more job losses to that business than the former Labor government in their 13 years of administration. If anybody should be ashamed about their handling of the workers at AN, it is the people sitting opposite us today. Every one of those people working for AN will get a generous redundancy payment and nearly all of them will go on the next day and start employment with the new owner. Hospital Billing",48
120,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware that many people in my electorate of Canning find, upon being discharged from hospital, that accounts payable relating to their illness and the treatment they have received for it are very confusing. Is the minister able to inform the House of any recent government initiatives designed to improve the situation?",48
121,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Canning for her question. I am aware of the matter she raises. It seems extraordinary to me that you can take a twoweek holiday overseas and pay one fee for transport, accommodation, meals, visas and sightseeing, yet you go into hospital for a two-day stay and you may end up with of something like 60 bills, as was the case when my son had two days in intensive care after he was born. Given that the majority of people going into hospitals are actually older people, this makes it particularly difficult because it is very confusing, even if you understand the system. What we announced two weeks ago related to encouraging doctors and hospitals to work together for something that is clearly in the benefit of consumers. What we are proposing is that within nine months doctors and hospitals will need to have a system of simplified billing in place in order for hospitals to qualify for a higher default benefit. This basically gives hospitals a guaranteed safety net in a situation where the negotiating contract is with funds. We do not mean to mandate any particular system of simplified billing. Some hospitals will choose to have one bill; another hospital may choose to have three or four bills. We need to give them nine months to get this in place because, again, given that there will be a variety of systems in place, we are not sure which will work best. But what it will mean, for the benefit of the honourable member, is that within 12 months we can be highly optimistic that rather than it being near impossible to find a hospital now that can send out a single bill for a measure of stay, within 12 months time it should be commonplace. Industrial Relations",48
122,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to comments made recently by the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mark Patterson, to the Northern Territory Industrial Relations Society about your so-called rock-solid guarantee that no worker would be worse off. I am advised he said this: You have to remember that the statement was said in the context of a political campaign. It was a casual comment. It was an ideal, not a commitment.  ment of the worth of your rock-solid guarantee?",49
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer is no. Unfair Dismissal Law,49
124,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware that many employers still believe that it. is impossible to dismiss an employee \Vl-out becoming tangled up in legal action? ;what improvements has the government made to the unfair dismissal laws to ensure that the legislation is not one-sided?,49
125,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I was watching 60 Minutes last night and I saw the representative from P&O say that you could not dismiss an employee without giving three notices in writing by way of warning. If that was the case under Labor, I can tell the honourable member that that is no longer the case today under the new law. That is simply not right. One of the sensible changes we made was that we said that under the unfair dismissal provisions there should be procedural fairness, but we should not give it such weight that it overrules common sense. We applied the principle of a fair go all round. As to whether or not you should give somebody some warning, that depends on the circumstances. If someone has worked for you for 20 years, they have been a very good worker and they make one mistake, then maybe it is in the interests of the employee and of the employer for you to say as an employer, 'You did make a mistake; we will give you an opportunity to redress it.' But the three warnings situation is over. There are a whole lot of other practical, sensible changes that we have made. For example, there is now an onus on the employee to show that the dismissal was unfair. That is a significant change to the system. Now the system requires that all these matters be heard in the Industrial Relations Commission instead of the Federal Court because we think that gives just a more commercial approach to the issues and, therefore, a more realistic approach to the question of what goes on at work. We now have a new system which requires people to pay a $50 filing fee. I will tell you what: that makes a difference to people's attitude when it comes to lodging vexatious applications. There is a new jurisdiction now which will allow the commission to actually award costs against an employee where a vexatious claim has been lodged. Many employers will be amazed to hear that the other day an employer actually won a case in the Industrial Relations Court and an employee was ordered to pay the employer's costs because of the vexatious way in which the particular claim had been made. Under Labor's scheme there was no definition of 'serious misconduct', for example. You could have somebody who were conducting themselves in a way which, as a matter of common sense, represented serious misconduct but no-one could tell you what it meant. We have introduced a new regulation which gives some definition to that particular term. Under Labor's scheme you could appoint somebody for a probationary period but there was no way known you could know in advance what was a reasonable probation period. So you could employ somebody on probation for a couple of months and sack them during that period and then find out that the court's view was that a month was the most you should have given them. We now have a clear rule-and that is, up to a period of three months is probation. If you tell somebody when you are employing them that the probation period is three months then you can deal with them in those three months if they do not work. That is a simple measure but, from a practical point of view, a great help to employers and employees. We have excluded term contracts from the unfair dismissal law. If you have a contract for a two-year period and you are unreasonably terminated during that period your redress is damages for the unexpired portion of the contract. Under Labor's scheme those contracts beyond six months were all subject to the unfair dismissal scheme, which was, again. an unreasonable measure and an impractical one from the point of view of running business. Whilst we still want to go further, we have a bill before the House in respect of unfair dismissal for small business. They should be completely exempt in accordance with what a lot of other countries do overseas. But look at the practical measures. One last example of what we have introduced is that where an order is being made against a business we say that the commission should take into account the impact on the viability of that business of any decision is made. It would be a nonsense if you have three employees in a business and one of them wins an unfair dismissal claim but the damages are so great that the business goes out of work and the other people lose their jobs. We have imposed upon the commission a requirement for some sort of commercial reality in the interests of both employers and employees. The three warnings are gone. Like a lot of things in Labor's scheme they have gone out with them. Vocational Training: T AFE",49
126,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Has the minister seen comments by his Victorian Liberal colleague Phil Honeywood comparing him to Billy Hughes such that when he did not want to hear something he turned his hearing aid off? If, as the minister claimed in the House last week, his vocational education policies have the support of the states and territories, why is Mr Honeywood calling for the minister to be sacked from his responsibility for the TAFE sector? Minister, doesn't this again demonstrate the shortfall in your T AFE funding policies and the total lack of confidence among the states and territories in your performance as minister?",50
127,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the shadow minister must have come down in the snowfalls of last week. We are talking now about a very generous offer that has been made by the Commonwealth to the ·states. One thing that distinguishes this government from the Labor Party is its commitment to ensure growth in quality training opportunities for young Australians. We do not believe in putting them through these short-term training programs that the member for Hotham believes in that demoralise young Australians. We put in place quality training through the new apprenticeships agreements. These agreements have been fully discussed with the states and fully agreed to by the states and territories and they represent a very significant element of Commonwealth-state cooperation. The Commonwealth and the states are now engaged in discussing an offer which the Commonwealth has made to the that states-a very generous offer. That offer is that the Commonwealth will maintain funding in real terms for five years to the states for vocational education and training on condition that the states will continue to grow their TAFE systems through efficiencies which are clearly able to be obtained. There is no reason whatever why the Commonwealth should continue to put money on the table without asking the states to look at the efficiency of their own T AFE system and to grow the number of places in those TAFEs. It is very clear from analysis done by the Australian National Training Authority that there are very significant numbers of places to be gained in growth from the state TAFE systems. The states would like the Commonwealth to put this money straight down on the table without conditions. The Commonwealth is saying, 'We owe it to the taxpayer, we owe it to families, to make sure that taxpayers' funds are properly spent.' We are not going to spend those funds unless the states come to the party and agree to match that level of Commonwealth commitment. Of course the states would like the Commonwealth to provide this money guaranteed for five years without any sort of matching commitment at all. But the Commonwealth is determined to put first the interests of young Australians in making sure that they have excellent and adequate vocational education and training opportunities. That is why at the present time the Commonwealth is spending some $144 million on vocational education and training over and above the sum that was spent by the Labor Party in its last year of government. Quarantine",50
128,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the government prepared to move towards greater transparency, improved consultation and the more efficient use of resources in our Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service? Can my constituents in the horticultural and cattle industries, and indeed the Australian community at large, expect the strengthening of quarantine effort to protect Australia's plant and animal industries?",51
129,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a very important issue, and I know that in his electorate his constituents are very interested in this because it embraces one of the largest small crop growing areas in Australia as well as quite a slab of Queensland's beef industry. So it is an important issue and an important industry for him, as it is for a lot of other Australians as well. For example, the agricultural industries of this country are directly responsible for the jobs of around 400,000 Australians in rural and regional areas, and they are also critical in underpinning the jobs of a further 200,000 Australians in the biggest part of our manufacturing sector, the food and beverage industries. The damage that can be done by the incursions of unwanted pests and diseases is really quite mind-boggling. The papaya fruit fly alone has cost something in the order of $63 million in terms of outlays by the Commonwealth and state governments, let alone the industry damage that has been sustained and the jobs that have been lost. If foot and mouth disease were to get here it is estimated that we could do another $3 billion to $4 billion worth of damage annually, and karnal bunt would add $4Y2 billion to $5 billion a year. It can be said quite fairly that quarantine services represent a critical insurance policy for these great agricultural industries. In pursuit of, if you like, a very serious and significant underwriting of that insurance policy, this government has now provided a $76 million package for the upgrading of quarantine services. In fact, if you add the northern area quarantine strategy to it, it is about $90 million. This gives us a professional, scientifically-based and properly resourced quarantine service, one of the fundamental planks on which Australia's reputation as a producer of safe, quality product for international markets is based. We all have a role; it is a shared responsibility. That is the major theme of the Nairn report into quarantine in Australia which examined animal and plant quarantine policies and programs, particularly in relation to Australia's relative pest and disease-free status, our international obligations and environmental considerations. It was the first major review for nine years. The government's $76 million response will enhance operations across what Nairn described as the continuum of quarantine: pre-border, border and post-border activities. There will be a major upgrade in our plant health and quarantine services and in consultation mechanisms for risk assessment. Quarantine awareness and the operation of quarantine programs will be substantially upgraded, and an independent advisory council, which I have asked Professor Malcolm Nairn to chair, will be appointed to advise me on quarantine policy and to monitor the implementation of the government's response to the Nairn report. At the same time we are acting on the key issues in relation to fish health fish policy identified in the report of the national task force on imported fish and fish products. I was very pleased to note that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Burke, issued a press release welcoming the announcement and observing that quarantine measures are vital to protect Australia. I was pleased because I was somewhat surprised earlier on at the time of the budget, when we announced that $76 million for quarantine, that he issued a statement saying, 'Fire blight shows up stupidity of quarantine cuts.' We put $76 million in on top of the $14Y2 million that had already gone to Nairn, yet he called for cuts in quarantine, which I thought was pretty amazing. He went on to have another bit of a niggle about a couple of matters, which I thought was also pretty out of order given that it was really someone on their side-the then minister for agriculture, the honourable member for Hotham, the clean green Crean himself-who never stopped talking about Australia's clean green exports at the very time that he was emasculating Australia's quarantine services. The injection of $76 million into quarantine over the next four years demonstrates this government's commitment to this critical activity which gives Australia an animal, plant and fish health status which is the envy of the world. Defence Personnel: Northern Territory Election",51
130,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs representing the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. I refer to the written answer from the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel in reply to my question last Thursday. That answer confirms that rank and personal details were, in fact, provided to the Northern Territory Chief Minister, and says: Had any other candidate made a similar request, they would have been responded to in the same manner. Minister, were similar details disclosed for defence personnel who did not live on base or and who lived in other electorates? Do you stand by the advice that the same information would have been made available to 'any other candidate' making a similar request?",52
131,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the question, I really have nothing further to add to the written response. If you would like to know about the affairs of the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs under your regime I would be happy to disclose them in relation to the Labor mayor of Brisbane. Adult Learners Week",52
132,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My. question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Many people in my electorate of Longman are embracing adult education as a means of enhancing their continuing employment prospects and social contact. I welcome the minister's launch today of adult learners week, and I ask the minister: what are the details of adult learners week and how can my constituents become involved?",52
133,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. Earlier today I had the honour of launching adult learners week 1997. As members of this House appreciate, adult learning provides its participants with many rewards, including professional and personal development, improved health, more life options and new friendships. The nation also benefits through increased productivity, innovation, creativity and strengthened communities. Lifelong learning is a principle that has an enormous power to help us move forward in our education and training policies because it recognises that all Australians, of whatever age, have something to contribute to this country. It recognises that many older Australians, with a lifetime of experience behind them, have the capacity to build on that experience, to learn new skills, to build on their abilities and to contribute to their community. The message of adult learners week is clear: no matter how old or young you are, no matter what you want to learn, you can do it by doing an adult and community education course. There are two themes for adult learners week this year-promoting learning amongst small business people and amongst Australia's migrant population. Over half the courses taken as a part of adult and community education last year, some 70 per cent, were designed to assist those who took them with their employment prospects. Further information-and I will give this to the member for Longman-on courses and activities being run throughout the week can be obtained from local libraries and from local adult education centres. I encourage all Australians to get involved in the excellent courses which are being offered through the adult and community education sector in Australia.",52

135,Mr COSTELLO,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"In commenting on the international investment position, I am advised that I said that 'net external liabilities as at 30 June 1997 were $202 billion'. Of course, it was net debt which was $202 billion. I then went on and said, as is the case, that the net equity and other investment was $105 billion. NA",53

139,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,53
140,Mr OKEEFE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) sought to convey the impression that-and he should have quit while he was ahead-a press release that I issued recently commending the recommendations of the Nairn inquiry and the comments I made about the funding he announced were in some way contradictory to a statement. I made on budget night. This is not the case, as you know very well.",53
141,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,We are not going to debate the issue. You have shown where you have been misrepresented.,53

145,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"We are not going to debate the issue. The honourable member for Burke will resume his seat. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it seems to arise quite often that, when somebody gets up claiming to have been misrepresented and begins to explain how they have been misrepresented, you seem to cut them short. It must be the case that you can do more than utter a simple denial.",53
146,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! There is no point of order. NA Supplementary Questions,53
147,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker, and it concerns supplementary questions. In view of the increasing number of supplementary questions being asked in the chamber, will you consider counting each question and supplementary question that each member asks as 1V2 questions in determining the overall allocation of questions to the opposition?",53
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have listened with some interest to the honourable member's question to me. These are not questions for me to resolve. The number of questions to be asked in anyone question time is definitely within the hands of the House. This is well outside my jurisdiction. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I might just say on that matter, though, partly to be of some assistance to the honourable member, that I do think it is important that the Chamber Research Office make a note and running tally of not only the questions which are answered but also the questions which are put. Those questions, as they are put, are an opportunity for a member to ask a question. Whether or not they are later ruled out of order is in the hands of the person who asked the question. Whilst it is true that House of Representatives Practice refers to supplementary questions as being part of the one question, that is a statement of the requirement to the standing orders that they must elucidate the first question. I can say this from the government's point of view: supplementary questions, whether answered or not, whether in order or not, are certainly part and parcel of the informal arrangement whereby the opposition gets a certain number of questions, which I might say is incredibly more generous than anything that has ever existed.",54
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Has the Leader of the House concluded his comments? Mr Reith-Yes. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, seeing as though you let him finish, my point of order becomes a question to you.

The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Andren (from 47 citizens), Mr Andrew (from 26 citizens), Mr Richard Evans (from 167 citizens), Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 27 citizens), Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 79 citizens), Miss Jackie Kelly (from 60 citizens), Mr Kerr (from 27 citizens), Mr Latham (from 24 citizens), Mr MCClelland (from 43 citizens), Mr Marek (from 51 citizens), Mr Miles (from 58 citizens), Mr Allan Morris (from 51 citizens), Mr Neville (from 26 citizens), Mr Ronaldson (from 26 citizens), Mr Slipper (from 22 citizens) and Mrs West (from 23 citizens). Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Sydney draws to the attention of the House that: The Federal Government has cut funding to the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. We petition for an immediate restoration of funding in view of the essential service the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation provides in giving information and assistance to senior citizens in respect to issues affecting financial security and quality of life. by Mr MCClelland (from 31 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need to support the textile, clothing and footwear industries of Australia and protect the jobs of over 100,000 workers, their families, communities and associated industries. Your petitioners request that the House reject proposals by the Industry Commission to reduce tariffs and instead freeze tariffs and encourage the development of a viable Australian industry. by Mr Adams (from 1,000 citizens), Mr Robert Brown (from 1,008 citizens), Mr Crean (from 1,000 citizens), Mr Gareth Evans (from 1,000 citizens), Mr Martyn Evans (from 1,000 citizens), Mr Martin Ferguson (from 2,414 citizens), Mr Fitzgibbon (from 999 citizens), Mr Hollis (from 1,000 citizens), Mr Kerr (from 827 citizens), Ms Macklin (from 2,010 citizens), Mr Martin (from 1,008 citizens), Mr O'Connor (from 1,007 citizens) and Mr Tanner (from 1,037 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Sydney calls to the attention of the house that the proposal to allow nursing homes to charge an entry free or bond discriminates against the most vulnerable frail and sick members of our community. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals to permit the introduction of nursing home entry fees and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes. by Mr Albanese (from 245 citizens) and Mr MCClelland (from 494 citizens).

The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the house that the proposal to allow nursing homes to charge an entry free or bond discriminates against the most vulneraTariffs ble frail and sick members of our community. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals to permit the introduction of nursing home entry fees and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes.  Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Newcastle calls to the attention of the house that the proposal to allow nursing homes to charge an entry free or bond discriminates against the most vulnerable frail and sick members of our community. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals to permit the introduction of nursing home entry fees and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes. by Mr Allan Morris (from nine citizens). Royal Australian Navy: Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas: 1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and RAAF. casualties; 2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; 3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is. Members of the Army and RAAF. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya. In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was 'operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points. Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from 'age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to 'service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. by Mr Miles (from seven citizens), Mr Neville (from 22 citizens) and Mrs Vale (from 17 citizens). Royal Australian Navy: Repatriation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that there is only one exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas 'active service' by Australians. That being under 'Operational Service' at Section 6.(l)(c)(ii) of the Act members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960. The various claims used to date to maintain their exclusion have now been proved wrong by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere in the public domain. Some of the claims used to support the exclusion are: (a) members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted (which applied to all service personnel everywhere); (b) they were in no danger (they shared the same dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and were also required to serve under the United Nations command in Korean waters in case that war had started again); (c) they were never 'allotted' for operational service (a letter from the Secretary to the Department of the Navy dated II November 1955 categorically stated the date from which the RAN was 'allotted' for operational service was I July 1955); (d) they were not on 'Special Overseas Service' (such Service began with the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act of 1962 i.e. two years after their service ended and did not therefore apply to them); and (e) they were not on 'active service' (their service complied with all but one of the requirements of the only Defence Department definition of 'active service' the exception being 'or in military occupation of a foreign country' which did not apply to Malaya). Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition and treatment with all other Australians who have honourably served their country on active service overseas. by Ms Hanson (from 25 citizens). Royal Australian Navy: Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that Benefits members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable 'active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the for costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded. There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for 'Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. It is claimed that: (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on 'active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial; (c) the Royal Australian Navy was 'allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently 'unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced; (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WAG 130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been 'allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found. (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the 'Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended; (f) as Australian citizens serving with the Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for 'active service'. The fourth, for 'military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya. Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and able 'active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960. by Mr Billson (from five citizens) and Mr Neville (from nine citizens). Australian Hearing Services To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petitioners of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that as of 1 July 1997, the Howard Government has declared at least 33,000 Commonwealth Seniors Card Holders ineligible for hearing services through the Australian Hearing Services. Your petitioners request that the House note our protest that many elderly people will no longer get free hearing aids or access to vital hearing services. This is deliberate discrimination against those in our community that can least afford these Budget cuts. by Mr Martin Ferguson (from 158 citizens) and  Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the certain students and residents of South Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. In the 1996/97 Budget the Coalition Government cut $150 million from the Children's Services Program. 2. These cuts included the abolition of operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres, restrictions on the numbers of hours for which Child Care Assistance is payable and the means testing of Child Care Cash Rebate. 3. All Child Care Centres across Australia are faced with increasing fees to keep centres open, forcing parents to pay more for child care. 4.The program will not be sustainable for families or providers if any further cuts are made. 5. Student parents are already disadvantaged in Royal accessing Higher Education. Any further cuts to child care will increase this disadvantage. Your petitioners request that the House: 1. Exert pressure on Members of the Coalition to reverse any budget decisions which will result in further reducing the Federal Government's role in funding and protecting Australia's quality child care recognition of honour- system. 2. Ensure that all families continue to have access to affordable, quality and accessible child care. 3. As a minimum maintain the Children's Services Program at $1 billion. by Dr Southcott (from 103 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the certain residents of the State of N.S.W. draws to the attention of the House that: I. In the 1996/97 Budget the Coalition Government cut $150 million from the Children's Services Program. 2. These cuts included the abolition of operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres, restrictions on the numbers of hours for which Child Care Assistance is payable and the means testing of Child Care Cash Rebate. 3. All Child Care Centres across Australia are faced with increasing fees to keep centres open, forcing parents to pay more for child care. 4. The program will not be sustainable for families or providers if any further cuts are made. Your petitioners request that the House: I. Exert pressure on Members of the Coalition to reverse any budget decisions which will result in further reducing the Federal Government's role in funding and protecting Australia's quality child care system. 2. Ensure that all families continue to have access to affordable, quality and accessible child care. 3. As a minimum maintain the Children's Services Program at $1 billion. by Mr Andrew Thomson (from 59 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled: The petition of the citizens of Australia brings the attention of the House the Federal Government's plan to make major cuts to Legal Aid funds. The Federal Government plans to cut $40 million annually from Legal Aid funding. Last year, 250,000 people were assisted nationally. However, if these cuts go ahead, many Australians will be denied access to a wide range of services, and only the well-off will be able to access the justice system. The undersigned petitioners therefore ask the Housc of Representatives to call on the Federal Government to protect every Australian's right to equal access to the justice system by continuing to fund Legal Aid at its pre-election level. hy Mr Albanese (from 967 citizens). da Camara, Mr Joao Freitas To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Housc of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: This petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: (a) Mr 10ao Freitas da Camara, an East Timorese political prisoner, was charged under the Indonesian Government's Anti-Subversion Law; (b) has since 1993, been serving a 10 year prison sentence and is currently held in Cipinang Correctional Institution in lakarta, Indonesia; (c) and that Mr 10ao Freitas da Camara's trial and subsequent improvement followed his arrest during a peaceful demonstration in Jakarta on 19 November 1991, a week after the Dili Massacre at the Santa Cruz Cemetery in East Timor. Your petitioners therefore request the House to make representations to the Indonesian Government asking for clemency on behalf of Mr 10ao Freitas da Camara in view of the extreme severity of his sentence. by Mr Albanese (from 419 citizens). Tariffs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division of MCEwen draws to the attention of the House our concerns of legislation over tariff reductions in the year 2000 to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industry. Such legislation would also cause a severe Legal Aid impact on the local economy and well-being of our community if they were to drop lower than 25% beyond the year 2000. Your petitioners therefore request the House not to to reduce the tariff duties on garments beyond 25% in the year 2000. by Mrs Bailey (from 1,168 citizens). Timed Local Calls A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the harsh and regressive decision by the Howard Government to allow telecommunications carriers to charge timed local calls for data communication services such as electronic mail, facsimile, the internet and other on-line services. This measure will adversely effect business and individual uscrs of the above services, and particularly hamper the operations and growth of small business. Your petitioners calion the House to request that the Howard Government rescind their decision, and ensure local data communication services are charged on an untimed basis. by Mr Bevis (from 2,250 citizens). Television Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned, being residents or visitors of Wiseman's Ferry and surrounding districts, consider the failure of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to provide television services to the Hawkesbury Valley to be discriminatory. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives will calion the Government to investigate the provision of a community service based on a microwave transmission after consultation with the appropriate Government authorities and the community of Wiseman's Ferry. by Mr Cadman (from 1,074 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales hereby expresses their dismay at the proposal to charge entry fees for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners are extremely concerned that the charging of entry fees will force people to sell their house in order to gain a bed in a nursing home. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives act to ensure that nursing home care is available to all who need it and further that the family home is exempted from any asset test relating to payment for such care. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Laurie Ferguson (from 107 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain members of the Australian community affirms our commitment to a culturally diverse Australian society which is unified by a common desire to see all Australians, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or ability treated with respect and dignity. We recognise the contribution that all Australians have made to the cultural, social and economic development of Australia, and reject the views expressed by Pauline Hanson as divisive and not based in fact. In recognition of the need to debate these issues honestly and publicly, we request the House to call upon the Federal Government to mount a high profile anti-racism campaign (for which funds were provided in the 1996-97 budget) and fulfil its obligations to build and maintain a harmonious and united Australia. by Mr Martin Ferguson (from 58 citizens). Australian Active Service Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That those citizens of Australia who served in Korea between June 1950 and 27 July 1953, should be eligible for an Australian Active Service Medal. That those citizens of Australia who served in Malaya between 1948 and 1961 and Borneo between 1963 and 1966 should be eligible for an Australian Active Service Medal. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: Take all possible action to ensure that an Australian Active Service Medal is awarded forthwith to such ex-service personnel. by Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 774 citizens). Van Oostveen, Mr William To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the treatment of Mr William Van Oostveen of Brassal in Queensland. Mr Van Oostveen, having followed all known practices of request and exhausted all avenues of appeal, petitions that he has been unable to obtain satisfaction to requests to obtain personal records about himself-particularly all 'Log Book Report Racism Forms' applicable to his course of active employment during the period 21 November 1989 up to 19 March 1992; 'Motor Vehicle Running Log Books' during the period 21 November 1989 to 19 March 1992; Department Regulations applicable during the period 21 November 1989 up to 19 March 1992. We therefore calion the House to take note of the grievance of Mr Van Oostveen and take age whatever action is necessary to ensure he receives proper and just treatment within the process of the administration of the Australian Government. by Ms Hanson (from three citizens). Native Title To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully shows: That the Federal Government take full account of the recent Wik decision of the High Court of Australia which accepts that Native Title can coexist with pastoral and mining leases. We strongly encourage the government to initiate a process of negotiation between aboriginal title holders and other leaseholders to resolve the practical use and management of those lands subject to joint title. We strongly disagree with any approach which proposes that Native Title be extinguished on land subject to such joint title, or which alters the Racial Discrimination Act, or the Native Title Act (Mabo), to facilitate the possibility of such extinguishment. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Holding (from eight citizens). Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Campbelltown and Liverpool draw the attention of the House to the fact that our suburbs and quality of life will be severely depleted by the construction of Holsworthy International Airport. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to immediately abandon any plan to construct an airport at Holsworthy. by Mr Latham (from 19,724 citizens). Holsworthy Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that the decision to conduct an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) of Holsworthy as a possible site for Sydney's second airport is the cause of great distress and concern to the many residents that live in the surrounding suburbs. Your petitioners pray that the House firmly oppose the construction of an airport at Holsworthy. by Mrs Vale (from 2,485 citizens). Medicare Provider Numbers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives: That we the undersigned are totally opposed to the Government's intention to legislate to restrict the issuing of Medicare provider numbers to doctors. We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women, rural communities and medical research. We believe that it is the essential right of all Australian registered doctors to have access to provider numbers that allow them to provide services to the community which attract Medicare rebates for patients. We believe that the proposed restrictions are an attack on the most defenceless and vulnerable strata of the medical profession. We consider it to be a denial of natural justice and an attack on Medicare. Your petitioners therefore request the House of Representatives to: Call upon the Federal Minister for Health, the Hon. Michael Wooldridge MP, to not proceed with the proposed restrictions on provision of Medicare provider numbers to doctors and to enter into discussions with representatives of the medical profession to identify alternative measures to resolve the problems facing Medicare and the Australian medical workforce. by Mr Lee (from 83 citizens). Medicare Office: Rockdale To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the electorate of Barton calls to the attention of the House that the proposed closure of Rockdale Medicare will cause hardship to many families and significantly affect local commerce. Your petitioners therefore request that the House abandon such proposals and allow Rockdale Medicare remain open. by Mr MCClelland (from 191 citizens). Education Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales calls on the Federal Parliament to initiate and promote an education program aimed at: Informing citizens of the benefits obtained by Australia and it's people from our immigration program, and; Promoting the richness of the cultural diversity and tolerance that exists in Australia which has gained the respect of the international community and has benefited Australia through trade links and greatly influenced the selection of Sydney to host the year 2000 Olympic Games. by Mr MCClelland (from 11 citizens). Torrens Parade Ground To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of South Australia draws to the attention of the House the possible disposal of Torrens Parade Ground and Training Depot, Adelaide. Your petitioners therefore request the House to retain Torrens Parade Ground and Training Depot for Defence purposes for its significant military heritage to the citizens of South Australia and that the value of the Parade Ground as a Defence controlled community resource be recognised. by Mr MCLachlan (from 3,027 citizens). ATSIC Funding To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that with the massive reduction in funding to ATSIC in the 1996-97 Budget and the restrictions placed upon ATSIC in allocating funding, the process of 'reconciliation' has stalled. 'Reconciliation' can only be achieved when Indigenous Australians regain the fundamental human right of being able to control their own destiny. Your petitioners therefore request the House to return to ATSIC the funds that have been withdrawn and to abolish the restrictions that have been placed upon ATSIC. by Mr Melham (from 15,242 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain guests at the Friends of Tranby Dinner draws to the attention of the House that we support the decision of the High Court with regards to Native Title. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House uphold the High Court's decision. by Mr Melham (from 187 citizens). To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of the Newcastle region draws to the attention of the House a statement hereon, supported by Newcastle community and church leaders, in support of our diverse community. 1. Newcastle, is a community rich in diversity-a community which celebrates the contribution of men and women from diverse ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. As a city we affirm that such diversity has contributed to the vital and positive life-style which is enjoyed by everyone in our region. We are proud of the ""social mix"" which creates cohesion in our community. We welcome all peoples to our region, regardless of race, colour or creed. 2. We understand that some in the community are apprehensive about their employment prospects, others are anxious about crime and violence and many people are under considerable emotional stress. We believe that recognising and understanding these difficulties can help to unite us. We call upon all our community to protect the democratic rights of freedom of speech and the need to treat each other with respect and accept our individual dignity. 3. We encourage all fellow Australians to recognise the place of Newcastle in the world scene. We call upon the citizens of Newcastle to be outward looking and responsive to the needs of those less fortunate than ourselves. As a Nation we have committed ourselves to develop a framework for relating to each other and that is marked by a strong sense of cohesion and mutual respect for our differences. All are offered equality of esteem and community services. All are offered a place of belonging. We believe this to be a social contract that must be defended and protected in the name of God's justice and a truly democratic society. Your petitioners therefore ask the house to actively promote all of the above principles to all Australians. by Mr Allan Morris (from 35 citizens). Native Title Medicare Office: Deer Park To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws attention of the House the opposition in the Deer Park community and surrounding areas to the proposal by the Howard Government to close the Deer Park Medicare Office. The Deer Park Medicare Office carries out an essential service to a large area of the Western suburbs of Melbourne. It allows convenient and Newcastle local access for Medicare users who are unable to travel to other more distant offices for immediate processing of their claims, or who require for budgeting purposes ready access to cash rebates. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to urgently review this decision, and allow the Deer Park Medicare Office to remain open. by Mr O'Keefe (from 589 citizens). Medicare Office: Mount Droitt To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the House that proposed closure of Mt Druitt Medicare will cause hardship to many battling families. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals and allow Mt Druitt Medicare to remain open.  Stolen Generations: Formal Apology To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, the urgent need to extend on behalf of the nation, a formal apology to the stolen generations of this country's indigenous people. We believe this apology to be essential to the process of reconciliation. Your petitioners therefore respectfully urge the House to promote a sincere and unreserved apology, officially delivered on behalf of all Australians by our Prime Minister. by Mr Ronaldson (from 1,600 citizens). Buderim: Old Post Office To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth 'that the majority of the people of Buderim support the transfer of title of the old Post Office building to the community and that it be retained on its present site for community use'. Your petitioners therefore pray that 'the House of Representatives ensures that the old Post Office building in Burnett Street, Buderim, Queensland 4556 is retained on its present site for community use and its ownership is transferred to the community' . And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Somlyay (from 2,624 citizens). Nuclear Waste: Sutherland Shire Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament No nuclear-waste reprocessing plant in Sutherland Shire I strongly oppose construction of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant in Sydney's Sutherland Shire. Such a plant would be a health hazard to residents, would send radioactive waste into coastal waters, and would accumulate reprocessed radioactive waste for which Australia has no repository. Your petitioners pray that the House will join them in opposing this plant. by Mrs Vale (from 1,129 citizens). Petitions received. NA Out of School Hours Services",54
153,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Barton) (4.49 p.m.)I move,62
154,Mr KERR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,A great member. Very busy with the petitions.,62
155,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Thank you. I move: That this House: (I) expresses its concern at the cutting of the operational subsidy to Out of School Hours (OOSH) services and the imposition of an increased threshold of eligibility for child care assistance to families; (2) notes that: (a) cuts to Out of School Hours funding will result in OOSH services having to increase fees to cover the loss of the operational subsidy which will threaten the quality of child care as OOSH services will be forced to cut costs to meet budgets; (b) the loss of the operational subsidy means that OOSH services could be facing high administration costs in order to meet the new fee relief system which could result in the closure of smaller services; and (c) the consequences of cutting funding to OOSH services will result in a situation whereby parents will be dropping children off at school early in the morning to unsupervised playgrounds and picking them up from school well after the school day has finished, or allowing their children to remain in an unsupervised home in the morning and return to an unsupervised home in the evening; and (3) calls upon the Federal Government to revoke its decision to cut operational subsidy to OOSH services and to restore the previous access to child care assistance for eligible families. I have moved this motion because the government's decision to cut operational funding to out of hours school care services will drive up fees and force children into substandard services or, worse still, make them latchkey kids. The history of the out of hours school care service is that it was a federal government initiative in the early 1970s. It caters for children five to 12 years of age and provides supervised and planned recreational and homework activities. The success of the program is demonstrated by the numbers. In 1982 there were 7,900 children in out of hours school care; in June 1996 there were 71 ,846 children, a massive increase in that period. The funding structure that currently exists is that the services are funded on a per capita enrolment basis in the form of an operational subsidy. That operational subsidy represents a constant stream of income, no matter what variations occur in the student population. Most out of hours school care services are school based and non-profit. The community has come together in the interests of the children. The government's proposed changes to the system will completely cut operational subsidies, which will mean a cut of between $24,000 and $41,000 to individual out of hours care services. As a sweetener to that reduction, however, the government has offered a sum of $12 million which is being spent on consultants. So each and every out of hours school service is being given $3,000 to engage a consultant, and that consultancy report is a precondition to an application for a capital grant of $7,000 and a possible grant of $3,000 for equipment. So there is a compulsory expenditure of $3,000 for these consultants for a potential $10,000 grant. It is an administrative absurdity and a gross waste. In addition to that, the list of consultants was provided only last week, and those consultants have to now be briefed by the out of hours services and they have to provide their consultant's report by October. These are going to be very cursory reports or they are going to be variables filled in on a word processor, all for the princely sum of $3,000 a pop-a ridiculous situation. But the government is working to a timetable where the operational subsidies are going to be cut on 1 January. It is a completely unworkable timetable, and the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) should immediately review it. It is absolutely stupid, and I understand that she is receiving that feedback from the sector. As it stands, the additional funding that parents of children in out of hours school centres are going to receive-or, at least, a limited number of them are going to receive by way of child-care assistance paymentsjust will not compensate for the loss of the operational subsidy. The consequences are that many parents, particularly those with several children requiring out of hours care, will be forced to move their kids from the current services. They will have two choices: to put their children into untrained, backyard services or to drop their kids off early in the morning and let them go to an empty home in the afternoon-so that they will literally become latchkey children. Last week the minister said that as a nation we can do no more important task than 'ensure the safety and the protection of our children'. If the minister allows these operational subsidies to be cut, she is a blatant hypocrite.",62
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Fitzgibbon-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,63
157,Ms GAMBARO,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Petrie) (4.54 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the private member's motion of the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) on outside school hours child care. Child care has played a very important role to play in our community. For many families, it has become an essential daily service. I acknowledge the important and necessary role that outside school hours care centres play in our community, particularly in the Petrie electorate. I would like to put on the record my particular support for Jabiru Community Youth and Children's Services and its coordinator, Ken Morris, who provides a very valuable service in the Bracken Ridge and surrounding areas, in particular at Norris Road and Bracken Ridge state primary schools. However, the fact is that there needs to be an effective and efficient child-care sector at all times. Under the Labor system, in 199596, 21 community centres closed and a further 16 community centres needed to have additional government assistance. This government inherited a child-care sector that was on its knees. It was in a terribly unmanageable situation, where services were oversupplied in some areas and undersupplied in a great many others. The redirection of the operational suhsidy grants through the new school age child-care assistance scheme will actually provide benefits for many thousands of Australian families, and they will have a greater choice as to where they place their children for afterschool care. The federal government has also ensured that it will support the service in a two-year establishment phase. With this two-year phase, assistance will be provided for business and marketing advice with $12.2 million-as the member for Barton mentioned-over a four-year period to specifically target the outside school hours care program. A capital grading initiative is also being offered, with grants available to maintain a service which caters for the needs of families. If these measures ensure a more effective sector for child care, then the result will be a very positive one. I think that it is also important to note that these decisions were not made lightly. They were made only after extensive consultation and research with parents and child-care providers about the development of an affordable and sustainable child-care system. It is disturbing that the assumption in the member for Barton's motion is children will automatically be left unsupervised in schoolyards in the early hours of the morning and late at night. As a parent, I find it absolutely unacceptable that he would even suggest that children would be left alone and unsupervised at home. It is also disturbing to hear that the member for Barton believes that family values have fallen to such a low level that people would leave their children unattended. To suggest that parents do not care about where their children are left is an absolute disgrace and a taint on all families in Australia. Does the social value of security mean nothing to the opposition? Are values such as responsibility held in such contempt?' Does the member for Barton honestly want us to believe that Australian parents do not care about their kids? It is a sad indictment to hear this put-down of parents, and it is a slap in the face for the values this government believes in. The Labor Party continue to be in the wilderness when it comes to family values. That is clearly borne out here today. They underestimate the love and care that parents have for their children. It is this attitude of the Labor Party that has made them more out of touch with Australian families than ever before. Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (4.58 p.m.)-I rise to support the motion of the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland), and I congratulate him on it. It is effectively a condemnation of the Howard government's attack on child care generally in this country. It is particularly an attack on those parents who rely upon out of school hours care and an attack on those organisations whose members strive so hard to provide decent care for those working families who need a safe place for their children while the parents are at work. This is where the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) misunderstands the member for Barton. He is not suggesting that parents do not care enough about their children to find proper care for them. He is sharing his own experience in his electorate, which is that families in this country are being so squeezed by the Howard government in so many areas that they do not have any choice but to continue to work and often they are faced with very difficult choices. It is more than 20 years ago that Cessnock's Beryl Simpson was becoming increasingly concerned about the growing number of Cessnock children who were being dropped off in school playgrounds up to two hours before school commenced. She was also becoming concerned about the number of children roaming the streets and going to empty homes after school, because their parents had no choice. So this is not a question about moral standards; this is a question about very difficult choices. In the early 1960s this was a need that went unrecognised by governments but, thankfully, by the time we got to the 1970s governments were beginning to see the need for the funding of such care. Things improved in the mid1980s and into the early 1990s, but now people like Beryl Simpson are seeing this very important area of public policy tum the full circle. We are going back to the Dark Ages, back to the 1960s, at a time when families, like never before, need a place to safely accommodate their children while they are at work. More and more Australian families need to work. They need two incomes to survive, particularly under the pressure being applied by the Howard government. More than 20 years on, I am delighted to say that parents in my electorate can gain access to out of school hours care in Kurri Kurri, Singleton, Muswellbrook, Beresfield, Thornton and Cessnock-but, unfortunately, having spoken to a number of coordinators and a number of people involved in that area of care, I am not confident that that will remain the case. It is appropriate that the member for Barton and I joined together on this motion because we represent two very different electorateshis metropolitan and mine rural. Both areas are under enormous pressure as a result of the government's decision to cut operational subsidies, but in my case I think it is more critical because the decision is hitting hardest in rural and regional Australia. The government says that it wants to introduce a level playing field, it wants community based operators to be working under the same rules as those seeking profit, but what the government does not understand is that there is no profit in child care in rural and regional Australia. Indeed, community based centres, even with operational subsidies, struggle to maintain the numbers they need to keep a service viable. In some cases, only two or three kids have to withdraw to render that service unviable. That will be the result for the providers of out of school hours care in my electorate, where the fees will double-in most cases from $4.50 a session to $9 a session. The result will be that parents, as the member for Barton has indicated, will have no choice but to withdraw their children and put them into the care of backyard, unqualified operators. Centres will lose their numbers, become unviable, and close. These are not simply my views. These are the views of my local government councils. These are the views of parents in my electorate. These are the views of the people who operate out of school hours care in my electorate. I know that the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) does not believe the views she just shared with the House. (Time expired)",63
158,Mrs GASH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I would like to speak against the motion and present some of the real facts on child care. This government's new child-care planning system is about one thing-choice. It is about choice for families, choice for parents who wish to work and choice for women who wish to have a career. In short, the system gives Australian families more choice. It is not about scaring parents, as the Labor opposition continually tries to do. In my electorate of Gilmore, as in many electorates throughout Australia, there is a group of child-care providers who provide the vital service of quality child care out of school hours. These services are vital in that, if they were not provided, many parents-and in most cases women-would not have the freedom to work; a choice which many women and many parents in the Gilmore electorate make when they access out of school hours child care for their children. One of the most important issues facing parents, certainly those in my Gilmore electorate, is the location of these services. Out of school hours care is not provided by all 36 child-care places in the Gilmore electorate, it is not even provided in every village, so parents are forced to decide how far they must travel for out of school hours care. In some cases this can mean a 30or 40-kilometre drive every morning and every evening. Those parents must then decide whether this warrants the choice that they make to work. Since the 1997 federal budget, when the government first announced proposed changes to the child-care operational subsidies scheme, these same parents still have the same need to access quality child care outside school hours. That has not changed. This government has recognised this need and it has recognised the need to make the system more equitable for parents seeking child care and, in particular, access to out of school hours care. This year, this government will provide $1.2 billion in child care alone: $100 million more than last year, and $200 million more than was provided in the 1995-96 budgetyour budget! This government is providing more than 330,000 Commonwealth funded places throughout the country. One of the main aims of the budget changes will be to create more equitable access to child care, particularly out of school hours care. We are committed to ensuring that childcare places are located where they are most needed. The cuts to operational subsidies for Commonwealth funded operations mean we are better able to target the areas of greater need for out of school hours care and child care in general. Better targeting of services means the government can allocate funds so that parents do not have to spend 20 minutes in the car getting their children to appropriate care before or after work, and do not have to leave them unattended. The government's child-care planning system, which was developed in consultation with community groups, professional childcare representative bodies and parents, will improve access to out of school hours care for parents, and they will continue to have that choice and the freedom to work if they choose to. The quality of child-care services that is now provided will be maintained through the government's quality improvement and accreditation system-an accreditation system which child-care professionals have been asking for for many years; a system which will provide good quality child-care practice; and a system which will be extended to include accreditation in the most appropriate form to out of school hours care in terms of assistance for children and parents, which, after all, is what child care is all about. The government will introduce a new school age child-care assistance scheme for out of school hours care, with a maximum rate of $1.62 per hour--compared with the current maximum of 73c per hour. On top of this, we will also extend the eligibility of child-care assistance to out of school hours care at the same income cut-off as family day care and long day care; that is, up to $65,743 per annum for one child, instead of the $27,125 per annum which currently applies. This will significantly improve the affordability of out of school hours child care for about 70,000 low and middle income families using these services. In fact, we are extending access to out of school hours care, not diminishing it. The budget also included establishment funding of $20 million over four years to assist new out of school hours care services during the two-year establishment phase, and recurrent funding will be provided for extra regional out of school hours services to ensure families in rural and remote areas do not lose access to care. To assist out of school hours care services to make a successful transition from the operational subsidy phase, the government will also provide grants to assist child-care providers access business and marketing advice. We have allocated funding for infrastructure upgrades and equipment purchases where services demonstrate the need for capital improvements to remain viable. As you can see, this government is committed not only to providing parents with more choice and more equitable access to child-care services but also to providing the support out of school services need to provide the high quality services that parents and children require. This means better services, better access and more choice.",65
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Truss)Order! The time allotted for this debate has almost expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",66
160,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (I) notes with concern the draft recommendations of the Industry Commission on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries; (2) notes, in particular. the likely loss of thousands of jobs throughout Australia. mainly in the regions. if the recommendations of the report are adopted; and (3) calls on the Government to reject the recommendations and to legislate for a tariff pause from 2000 to 2005 to enable the full benefit of micro-economic reform to be achieved, thus strengthening the economy and industry, and maintaining jobs for Australians. This is a very important motion that has to do with jobs, it has to do with trying to repair the damage caused by the previous Labor government in Australia for the last 13 years and it has to do with fighting very hard to let this country have the benefit of reforms that should have been introduced by the previous government years ago, thus enabling investment, risk taking, incentives and business to progress, jobs to be secured and new jobs to be created. The TCF industries in Australia currently employ 100,000 people, which is much fewer people than were employed 1 years ago because the previous Labor government has driven people out of work in this country. Notwithstanding that, the 100,000 men and women employed in the TCF industries throughout Australia-both in metropolitan areas and in regional areas, such as in my electorate of Indi-are proud people who have achieved a lot. Despite policies of the previous government preventing the companies they work for from consolidating as well as they might have and from winning additional export trades, they have achieved a lot in design. A company called Bruck in Wangaratta, which is one of the cities I represent, exports about 20 per cent of its high quality, high fashion furniture fabric to Paris, New York and London where you can see the products made by the skill of the Wangaratta workers. But we could have done so much more. Those 100,000 people are employed by about 3,000 firms in Australia-small, medium and large. This motion is about helping those people to cope with the challenges in the future. Both the workers and the owners of the TCF businesses across Australia very strongly support the fact that this country needs to work very hard to gain more trade overseas. We all know that our future is as a trading nation. The employees and the owners of the businesses across Australia all agree in principle with the world trade objective by the year 2010. They are not asking for protection for protection's sake; they are asking for a fair go. The number of people employed in the TCF industries is about twice the number employed in the car industry. Without wanting to be disrespectful to the car manufacturers of Australia, they are 100 per cent owned by foreign interests while most of the 3,000 TCF firms are owned by Australians. This debate is about recognising that fact and rejecting the Productivity Commission's draft recommendations. It is common ground that, if the recommendations were adopted, at least half of those jobs would be decimated. This debate is about putting a stop to job losses and calling for a pause in tariff reductions from 2000 to 2005 to enable the Howard ° government to work, to be re-elected, to introduce after the election-because it will have a mandate from the people-urgently needed tax reform and to complete the tasks of industrial reform and also of long overdue waterfront reform. By 2005 a coalition government led by John Howard will have bedded down those reforms. It is the view of the TCF industries-it is the view of the communities that most of the regional members of the coalition very proudly representthat after 2005 we can then move to addressing the challenges of trade liberalisation and of further tariff reductions. The Productivity Commission's draft recommendations propose a dramatic decrease in tariffs from 2000 to 200S-from zero to five per cent. I do not have time in this debate to outline the inconsistency and the stupidity of those recommendations in the sense that many other countries which compete with us have not moved that rapidly. This motion that I have moved, which I am sure will be supported by many members on both sides of the House, is about being smart and rejecting the notion of the so-called level playing field. This motion calls on the government to have a measured reduction in tariff protection to enable the reforms in this country, which should have been introduced before, to be achieved-reforms to the economy in taxation, industrial relations and on the waterfront-and to be bedded down so that our companies, small and large, in our industries can then make the necessary moves. Most of us now believe that we need a broad based consumption type tax, which I notice the Democrats are now apparently going to support. If that is the case, then I congratulate them because that is a good thing for this country. It is a good thing when a political party that has had its head in the sand takes its head out and starts thinking about Australia first rather than its own selfish political agendas. I call on the Labor Party not to tamper with this motion by moving an amendment, for example, that will try to impose-stupidly at this stage-some detail of the industrial policy that government must adopt in tandem with the broad thrust of our recommendations for a tariff pause. Tariffs will be reduced by a further 30 per cent under the Labor Party's legislation by the year 2000, and the industry, the communities and the workers support that. They say, 'Do not tamper with that. We can cop that. We will accept it to the year 2000. We ask you to be smart. We ask you to not do what the previous government did' - that is, to introduce 70 per cent tariff reductions over a period of a decade without reforming the country's economy and without reforming the tax system or the waterfront system and, in fact, paying huge taxpayers' moneys out. The former government borrowed more money than they could pay back, driving interest up and, in fact, increasing unemployment. So the bottom line is that there are no jobs available immediately-you all know that in your hearts-for the workers in the regions in Australia if they lose their jobs. There are none. As Australians we all have to come together and work smarter and harder. Politically, we have a duty to put their interests ahead of our own in any shape or form. We have to ensure that, if you have 3,000 companies in Australia which are prepared to hang in and try to keep investing and employing people, for God's sake get to the conference table with them and work out a plan, such as we propose, which involves a pause from the year 2000 to the year 2005. You have to get out amongst the people and get the people to understand the need for tax reform, waterfront reform and the like. We should have the election and then get on with the job which we all want to do, that is, introduce reforms, so that they can then get on with their job of expanding their export trade-as I am confident they will-and of consolidating jobs. It was a tragedy last week to see what happened with DuPont and the result of the previous government's expenditure of millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers' moneyapparently to no avail. We do not want that any more. We have had enough of that. It is all of our responsibilities, including the members on the other side. I know they care about Australia and the future, but they cannot because they are prevented and hindered somewhat because of the problems that they have in their leadership. Members of the Labor Party should get into their party room tomorrow and insist that Beazley announce that he will no longer oppose the complete reform of the tax system, that he will no longer stand in the way of a broad based consumption tax type concept. If he does not do that, he is sentencing Australians again to more indecision and frustrating this government from moving to the reforms that the previous government should have introduced, to their everlasting shame. I can tell you now that, if you had introduced those reforms in the previous 13 years of your government, we would not need today to be talking about a pause in tariffs for five years from the year 2000. The reason is that the industries would have had a decade to adjust and to benefit from tax reform and waterfront reform. Their export trade would have grown, and their exports would be cheaper because they would not have embedded in them the stupid inefficient tax systems that this country has because of the Labor Party's negligence and failure to address the problems. Nor would we have a waterfront system where the Labor Party spent $80 million in paying off inefficient work practices in the waterfront and then apparently hiring them back. (Time expired) Mrs Bailey-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",66
161,Mr JENKINS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The discussion of the future of the textile, clothing and footwear industries is one of the most important debates that confronts the government at the moment. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity presented by this motion for the House to debate this issue. I regret that not more of my colleagues who represent regions with involvement in the TCF industries will be able to participate because of the time constraints. I also regret that the motion of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) does not go far enough. The electorate that I represent is part of north-eastern region of Melbourne. There can be no other region in Australia where the combined decisions about the futures of the automotive and the textile, clothing and footwear industries are of such devastating importance. Of the 100,000 Australian TCF workers, around 9,700-nearly 10,000 of them-are employed in the north-eastern region of Melbourne. The north-eastern region of Melbourne includes the municipalities of Whittlesea, Darebin, Banyule and Nillumbik. If we take into account the neighbouring municipalities of Hume and Moreland, there is quite a distinct concentration of TCF workers in a region. In fact, 48 per cent of TCF employment is located in Victoria. So TCF is twice as important to the Victorian economy as it is to the national economy. The Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia has estimated that about 5,000 jobs would be lost in Victoria in the TCF industries should tariffs be further reduced, as per the draft recommendations of the Industry Commission. Mr Lieberman-It is 50,000.",69
162,Mr JENKINS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Sorry, it is 50,000 overall. On top of this, another 2,000 would be lost in other related industries, pushing total job losses up to around 7,000. These estimates are at the conservative end of the scale, and I acknowledge that the honourable member for Indi acknowledges that. The region's employment base has already undergone massive restructuring during the 1980s and 1990s. This is a point that was raised by the honourable member for Indi. I do not dispute that the prospect in this employment climate of a further drop in employment of this magnitude would be intolerable for the region that I represent, the state of Victoria and Australia as a whole. In its submission to the Industry Commission, the city of Darebin-which is one of the municipalities within the north-eastern region of Melbourne-made mention of the multiplier effect that a decline in TCF employment would have on other sectors of the economies in the north-eastern suburbs. It would have serious consequences in the machinery and equipment manufacturing sector of the regionthe al economy, on personal and household goods wholesaling and retailing, and on road transport and business services. I recently visited a firm in my electorate which manufactures textile dyestuffs. This is the Australian branch of a transnational company, which would relocate some or all of their Australian operations to another location in the Pacific region should tariffs go. I acknowledge that nationally the job losses in the TCF industries over recent times have been substantial. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, employment declined from 126,000 in August 1986 to 93,600 in November 1996. It must also be remembered that TCF industries employ 20 per cent of all women in manufacturing and that women bear the brunt of employment in these industries. A study by Ms Sally Weller, who is from the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies at the University of Melbourne, looked at the experiences of some 500 TCF workers who had been retrenched. Ms Weller's study indicated that only 15 per cent of them found further employment in TCF industries. She also indicated that only 47 per cent found any employment at all within two years of being retrenched and that, of this 47 per cent, 37 per cent were forced to take on work that was less well paid than their original TCF jobs. The government must take these people's experiences into account when it decides on its TCF policy. In today's Financial Review I was disappointed to see that the Australian Consumers Association, in concert with the National Farmers Federation, is to lobby for the TCF tariff reductions. This represents an extremely narrow view of what it is to be a consumer. Consumers need jobs, too. Organisations like the Australian Consumers Association must realise that, without viable TCF industries in Australia, there will be fewer consumers. The Industry Commission has been pushing the furphy that the measures to assure viable TCF industries cost consumers $1.9 billion. Sadly, the Australian Consumers Association appears to have fallen for this. The industries themselves dispute this and claim that present government assistance means only an extra 20c 'on a pair of underpants or $2.44 on a pair of shoes. I am sure that the vast majority of Australian consumers are willing to pay this very small price to keep TCF industries in Australia. The statistics on what the TCF industries contribute to the nation speak for themselves. TCF industries consist of about 3,000 companies employing about 100,000 Australians, as the honourable member for Indi outlined. They are represented in all states and have an annual industry turnover of $10 billion and a retail turnover of $15 billion. They make up $4 billion of Australia's value-added manufacturing. Their exports are now at $1 billion, with a target of $2 billion in the year 2000 and $3.5 billion by the year 2005. It is to be remembered that, whilst the honourable member for Indi has spoken about the past and has criticised what has happened under Labor policies, there has been an achievement in these industries of that increase in export. Most importantly, the industries believe that, with the right support of government, they can achieve $5 billion worth of exports by the year 2010. The conflicting pieces of advice demonstrate the importance of having multiple sources of advice to the government and not relying solely on the Industry Commission's position. Just as some may claim that the advice from the industries has a particular case to put across, the same can be said about the Industry Commission having its own agenda. As I mentioned in the debate last week, an Age editorial told of the decision of the telecommunications equipment industry to boycott the Industry Commission's inquiry into it, because the industry believed that it could not have any confidence in the objectivity of the commission and that the recommendations by the commission were predetermined without regard to the evidence. If this is true, then the Industry Commission is not serving the government or the taxpayers of Australia well. As I indicated earlier, the opposition welcomes the opportunity that the motion moved by the honourable member for Indi gives us to discuss TCF matters. However, in some respects, the motion does not go far enough. Although the motion acknowledges that the pause in the reduction of tariffs between the years 2000 and 2005 is vital to the industries, this motion does not take into consideration the importance of the import credit scheme. As important as the tariff freeze is, the retention of the import credit scheme-or an equivalent scheme-is necessary for the continuation of TCF industries in Australia. The opposition's position, as outlined by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) earlier this month, commits Labor to maintaining the import credit scheme or a similar alternative scheme. I am pleased that the resolution of the Senate last Thursday also mentioned the importance of the scheme. This scheme is just as important for the TCF industries as it is for the automotive and automotive component manufacturers. The opposition's position on TCF industries, importantly, calls for a review of future assistance arrangements in 2004. This review will examine what needs to be done for the industries after the end of the tariff reduction freeze in 2005. This review would take into account what our trading partners are doing with regard to forms of assistance for their own TCF industries. The Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia states that the Industry Commission's report ignores the fact that government assistance to TCF industries has already been reduced by 70 per cent over the last decade. It ignores the fact that the rest of the world has not lived up to its side of the bargain. The debate should be about ensuring a fair trade environment rather than simply about a free trade environment. Labor's suggested review in 2004 counters the perception that Australia will unilaterally reduce tariff barriers as some kind of experiment for a free trade environment. RegrettabIy, this is a perception that has existed in the community for some time. I remind those who use this perception and the fact that firms like Berlei and DuPont have recently made decisions to reduce their operations in Australia to berate the opposition that business does not necessarily make decisions based on what has happened in the past but on what is happening now and is likely to happen in the future. Berlei and DuPont are not examples of the previous government's policies; they are examples of this government's indecision and inaction in the here and now. They are results of this government's lack of coherent industry policy. There can be no attempt to sheet blame on the former government. Like all firms, Berlei and DuPont have made what they believe to be strategic decisions based on their estimates for the future, not on what has occurred to them in the past. Just as the government decided to use our plan for the automotive industry, I call on it to do the same for the TCF industries. The opposition is happy for the government to continue to adopt its policies.",69
163,Mrs BAILEY,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I seconded this TCF motion moved by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and I rise today to speak in support of it. I would like to say that I have listened very carefully to what the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has had to say. I acknowledge his sincerity and his beliefs in this very important issue to his electorate. Some of the areas he mentioned also come into my electorate. I want to make a couple of points initially. The first is that the recommendations of the Industry Commission for the TCF industries are a continuation of the policies of the previous Labor government over the past 13 years. It is hypocritical for the opposition to criticise the Howard government for a policy of tariff reduction that they strenuously advocated and implemented over a period of 13 years and it is hypocritical of the opposition to criticise this government for the vulnerability of many TCF industries when it was the lack of action of the previous government to implement changes to industrial relations, taxation, transport and the waterfront that have caused this very vulnerability and have failed to provide our TCF industries with the means of reducing their production costs and with the means to be internationally competitive. It was this inaction that failed to implement the pace of micro-economic reform that the rate of tariff reduction was predicated on. It was this inaction of the previous government that caused the TCF industries to produce and compete in a market with a handicap their competitors did not and still do not have. The task of micro-economic reform that should have been completed by the previous government is now one that we must achieve, and we have begun that process of hastening the pace of reform. The decision facing us now, however, is similar to that which we faced with the car industry . We must maintain the critical mass of our TCF industries if we are to ensure that as industries they remain internationally competitive, because without viable local industries, there can be no export industry. In order to achieve that, we must reject the recommendations of the Industry Commission report with regard to the tariff reduction rate. We must pause and hasten the pace of microeconomic reform. To do otherwise would see not just a loss of employment in our TCF industries, especially those in regional areas, like those in my electorate of MCEwen-the Can't Tear Em factory, Maloufs, the Seymour Dyeworks and Haymag, to name just a fewbut also the destruction of those regional industries, with flow-on effects into the local communities. There is no doubt that the reduction of tariffs since 1985 has seen employment decline by 18 per cent: that is, 21,000 people who used to work in the TCF industries no longer do so. Thanks to research conducted at Melbourne University, where 585 people have been surveyed over a two-year period since their retrenchment, we know that almost half of these workers have not found any employment. The Australian Wool Processors Council has produced similar findings from a case study of one factory closure in rural Victoria where, again, almost half of retrenched employees remain without any work. This evidence refutes claims made by the Industry Commission in its report on page 157 that, 'People can find new jobs in the same region, perhaps in another industry,' or 'people can relocate to find work in a new region'. If only that were true-that our regional areas had been able to attract investment to start new industries. What nonsense! What planet do the Industry Commission members inhabit? By making those sorts of statements, they demonstrate that they have no real understanding of the true position of regional industry and the lack of employment opportunities. It is stated on page 146 of the report that the decline in employment in the TCF industries has been countered by growth in employment in other industries. (Time expired)",71
164,Mr FITZGIBBON,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Hunter) (5.33 p.m.)The member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) spent a fair bit of time beating their speeches up with issues relating to micro-economic reform. If micro-economic reform is so important on this issue, I cannot understand why it did not form part of their motion. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Industry Commission did not afford the same amount of time to issues of micro-economic reform as did the speakers that we have heard from the government side today. I recently visited a number of firms in my electorate that are involved in the textiles clothing industries. The 1,300 workers that work at National Textiles, Depict Fashions, Bondwear, Tycon Manufacturing and Hunter Valley Curtain Manufacturing in my electorate will be delighted to learn that, from today, the members of this House are all at one on tariff reform. We all now collectively reject the Industry Commission's recommendations on tariff reform beyond 2000. We now know that the member for MCEwen is absolutely committed to freezing TCF tariffs at year 2000 levels. We now know that the member for Indi supports a pause for a cause. No doubt the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) will jump to his feet soon after me and also commit himself absolutely to a freeze from 2000 and beyond. It appears that we are all at one. But are we all equally committed to the almost 100,000 Australians who are directly employed in these industries? Are we equally committed to all those Australian women who rely on these industries for their livelihoods? Are we all equally committed to these industries that now export goods to the tune of a billion dollars and will export goods to the value of $3.5 billion by the year 2005, if only this parliament does the right thing by them? Are we all equal on this issue? We will see. Later today, or maybe tomorrow, a message from the Senate will be, transmitted to this place. This message will, among other things, recognise the fact that it is absolutely necessary for the survival of these industries that we see a pause in tariff reductions between the years 2000 and 2005 at the very least, recognise that the industries in Australia are now furlongs in front of their competitors and deserve a pause in tariff reform, and recognise the importance of this industry, particularly to regional Australia. There will be an opportunity to move one step on from the rhetoric. There will be an opportunity for members of this place to say yea or nay. When that message comes from the Senate, members in this place will have an opportunity to stand up for their electorates. If they do not, the 47,000-odd people who work in the industries in Victoria will be entitled to ask, 'Where were the members for and Indi, MCEwen, Deakin (Mr Barresi) and CorangamiteT The 37,000 people who work in the industries in New South Wales will have an opportunity to ask the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) where he was during this debate and why he did not vote in support of the Senate message, if in fact he chooses not to do so. Let us not get around that by saying that it was only a procedural motion to carry the debate over to another sitting day. That will not be good enough. The 47,000-odd people in Victoria who work in the industry, the 37,000 people in New South Wales who work in the industry and the almost 100,000 people around the country who work in the industry will want better than that. They will want you to say, 'We concur with the message from the Senate.' They may also ask why Hunter based senators, Senator Tierney and Senator Sandy Macdonald, chose not to vote in support of that motion last Thursday night. They are absolutely entitled to an explanation as to why those Hunter based senators did not join with Senator Cook, the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in calling upon this parliament to reject the Industry Commission's recommendations. (Time expired)",72
165,Mr MCARTHUR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I have argued in this House and publicly that tariffs have never protected jobs. That fundamental truth is clear if you look at the data and information over the last 20 years. The benefits of tariff protection, as members of the former Labor government would understand, have flowed to consumers and exporters. The protected industries have improved under a reducing tariff regime. All the evidence suggests that tariffs have never protected jobs. Jobs have declined in the car and TCF industries in recent times. However, if you look at the available information you will find that when tariffs reached their peak in the 1970s jobs still declined. I challenge anyone in this House to argue the case that tariffs have protected jobs in the long term. Members of this House would fully understand that productivity and profitability were poor in the TCF and car industries when tariffs were at their highest peak. The attitude of both management and those employed in TCF industries was that they were owed a job. Investment was at a standstill under the high tariff regime and capital stock from the 1900s was not replaced. When tariffs were reduced in both the TCF and car industries productivity, quality and profitability improved-a fact borne out in the Industry Commission report. It is important for members of this House to understand that these industries need to remain profitable-in those terms jobs will be retained. People are suggesting that the Industry Commission have not provided factual information. An in-depth reading of the Industry Commission report indicates that they have talked to employees and management in that industry and that they have given accurate advice. The important point that is driven home to me is that members of this House and other commentators wish to shoot the messenger because they might be observing factual information about the TCF industries. I draw the attention of the House yet again to the fact that the Labor Party, when in government, introduced the reduction in tariffs. They reduced tariffs in 1984 to apply to the year 2000. The current debate is about a comparatively small reduction in tariffs from the year 2000 to the year 2008. Everyone in the TCF and car industries knows that tariffs should come down. I have not yet met anyone in those industries who has suggested that tariffs should go up. Let us establish that clear fact. The APEC objective is that by 2010 there should be negligible tariff levels of between five and 10 per cent. The former government agreed with that, the present government agrees with that and most commentators in Australia agree with that. The World Trade Organisation is moving towards that objective as all nations will be better off under those arrangements. The current debate in the House is about the rate of reduction of the tariff regime. No other industry receives protection-apart from the car and TCF industries. We need to remember that protection is paid by every other Australian in the form of tax. General manufacturing gets only about five per cent protection. The orange juice market has received a lot of attention in recent times. It is interesting to observe the key features of that market. Orange juice imports were 24 per cent less last year than they were in 1995-96. At the same time, our own production doubled. a Those are very important features to undersurvive. stand. The important factor to remember that we must move to become a global trading nation. Globalisation is here for the TCF industries. I appreciate that the apparel try is facing competition from low wage countries. The footwear industry can find niche markets if they have quality products and good delivery times. The textiles part the TCF industries will depend upon investare ment in new capital. The key element of this debate is the timing of tariff reductions not the tariff reductions themselves. Members opposite who are you suggesting that the removal or a pause in tariffs will save jobs have been misled. History proves quite conclusively that the tariff reductions and high tariffs under Labor government did not save jobs. Tariff reductions encourage the industry to remain profitable and, in that way, jobs will be in the electorate of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). (Time expired)",73
166,Mr CAMPBELL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"-Listening to the predictable ideological diatribe from the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) is very depressing. This member went to great lengths to protect the greedy group of second rate marino stud breeders when we sought to stop the export of marino genetic material overseas. What said does not equate with the facts at all. What you have had under the policy of the of that? former government-and there is no doubt about that-and the policy you continue to advocate is this mad ideological obsession with so-called economic rationalism. It is marvellous when it comes to promotion, but it is certainly not rational. It is not economic policy. It is political ideology of big business. If I were to say that this is a policy of mainly American big business to dominate world trade, people would look at me sideways. But I did not say it. Bob Santamaria said it and Bob Santamaria is absolutely right. The truth is that we know that tariffs isolation will not save jobs, but they do you a breathing space. There are lots of other things governments can do, and governments have not done, that can stem them. If there is will for these industries to survive, they will But there is no will in government is for this to happen. The member talks about the lowering of tariffs making these industries efficient. It certainly has made them more indusefficient, and now he wants to kill them. I am reminded that that is exactly your position. Four years ago last August we closed down in Sydney the last company of capable of making truck wheels. Truck wheels very important for Australia. They are something for which we have a strategic need. They failed because Keating said to them: 'If you cannot survive with a 15 per cent tariff, deserve to die.' And die they did. Within weeks of that happening, of course, the price of Malaysian imports had gone through the roof. Blind Freddy could see that happening, the but not the likes of the last member who spoke or the likes of the previous government. Let us look at orange juice. We are told that kept we cannot do anything about it because of GATT. The Americans do, of course. The Americans levy a flat rate of duty on their juice at 80c a litre of concentrate. That puts in protection for their growers when prices are at their lowest. When prices are at their highest it is not very significant. In Australia we put on an ad valorem tax which gives growers some protection when prices are high and they do not need it but no he protection when they are low and they desperately need it. How can you justify the logic It is not Brazilian farmers bringing orange juice into Australia; American big business is doing that. Once they have killed the market here, as they have tried to do with bananas and many other commodities, they will have the market to themselves. At the moment, Australia constitutes probably less than two per cent of their export market, but if they killed the market altogether we would become much more significant-six or seven per cent. The Americans have said that early next century they will be self-sufficient in orange in juice, that they will not be taking Brazilian give orange juice. They will need that bigger market in Australia. They know that once they kill that industry it will not revive because of the lead time needed to grow oranges, and no-one in this climate is going to invest their money for a possible return five years hence. No-one is going to do it because of the instability created. The previous speaker and the government are advocating that these members rip out their orange trees and plant vines, thereby killing the one industry where there is some glimmer of hope. The wine industry is doing quite well. But, if everyone enters that industry, that industry too will be crippled. That exactly what is going to happen. It is absolute nonsense. Under the policies you represent we have had increasing unemployment, increasing foreign ownership and increasing foreign debt, and the solution being put forward by the likes of you and your government is more of the same. You want to take us further down the road which has already demonstrated what a disaster the policies of the government and, I might add, the policies of the previous government are. If you want to go back to the culprit, go to that senile old phantom Gough Whitlam and look at what he did when he cut 25 per cent across the board off tariffs and killed all the electronic industries which should be employing our kids now. Within a couple of weeks of him imposing that cut in tariffs, they had all folded up and gone back overseas. That was the tragedy. That is the legacy we have been left by this nonsense which has been around permeating the ranks of government since 1974. This policy is a failed policy. It is the policy of the international companies. If you want to say to the Australian people, 'Are you prepared to sacrifice your domestic economy for world trade?' then that is fine, but you never have the nerve to say it. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The time for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Cooked Chicken Meat: Importation Legal Aid Funding",74
167,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"This evening I wish to grieve about two issues and the first involves this pile of letters beside me here. This pile of letters consists of 6,000 letters which the residents of the Central Coast of New South Wales have individually signed in an effort to persuade the Minister is for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) not to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat. This issue is of enormous importance not just to the residents of the Central Coast but to the 17,000 Australians who work in and rely on this industry throughout Australia. The reason I have brought these letters into the House this evening is that since May I have been trying to get the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to accept these letters from my constituents. For more than three months we have been writing to the minister asking him for only five minutes of his time so that the people who have taken the trouble to sign these letters objecting to the importation of cooked chicken meat can ensure that the minister hears their voices. The reason I have been urging the minister to receive these letters is that they deal with the very crucial issue of the future of the jobs in the Australian chicken meat industry. In refusing to accept these letters, the minister is not only thumbing his nose at me, as the federal member for Dobell, but thumbing his nose at the 6,000 local residents who have taken the trouble to sign all of these letters. When you realise that people have taken the trouble to sign the letters, send them back and allow themselves to be identified, it is quite clear that there is a very strong view on the Central Coast of New South Wales opposing the importation of cooked chicken meat. These letters have come from as far south as Wyoming and as far north as Kanwal, from Bateau Bay to Wyong. Right across my electorate there is a very strong view that the government is taking the wrong path in allowing the importation of cooked chicken meat. The minister was arrogantly bragging in the parliament this afternoon that he was intending to strengthen our quarantine protections in Australia. The minister certainly needs to do something about the proposals that are now before the government seeking to allow the importation of cooked chicken meat. Let us have a look at what the industry is doing today for the Australian economy. We have 900 independent chicken producers in Australia and they employ about 17,000 people Australia-wide. The capital investment in the Australian chicken industry to date is in excess of $2 billion and the current value of retail sales for cooked chicken meat is $1.7 billion per annum. If this minister does what we all expect-he has already flagged that he is going to allow a final round of trials before the government allows the importation of cooked chicken meat-and ignores the view of the 6,000 people who have signed these lettersMr Fitzgibbon-And 3,000 in the Hunter.",75
168,Mr LEE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"And 3,000 in the Hunter. I thank my colleague the member for Hunter, who is also a very strong opponent of the importation of cooked chicken meat. If the minister ignores the view of the 6,000 people who have signed these letters and ignores the view of the 3,000 people who have written to my colleague the member for Hunter, that will mean that he will allow imported chicken meat from countries such as Thailand, the United States and Denmark. We have to question whether we should be placing the 17,000 jobs in the Australian industry at risk by allowing imports from countries such as Thailand, Denmark and the United States. The United States currently has a complete ban on the export of Australian fast ferries to their country; Denmark, a member of the EU, has been notorious in placing barriers on the export of Australian agricultural products to the European Union; and Thailand imposes tariffs of up to 70 per cent on Australian motor vehicles. What would happen if we allow the importation of cooked chicken meat from these three countries to Australia, which, as we all know, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy supports? What we would get is something similar to what happened in Japan. Japan allowed the importation of cooked chicken meat from Thailand, resulting in 20 per cent of the Japanese market being supplied by Thailand. If the same penetration happened in Australia, there would be a $670 million reduction in Australia's gross national product and the loss of 9,000 jobs. As a result of the government allowing chicken meat imports we would not only see damage done to the Australian economy but also see a severe risk of new diseases brought into Australia. Of greatest concern in my electorate amongst the 1,000 central coast residents who work in the chicken growing and chicken processing industry is the threat posed by Newcastle disease. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are aware that, if introduced, Newcastle disease will be extremely difficult to eradicate. We might well ask: who will pay for the loss of jobs if the government does allow these imports from Thailand, Denmark and the United States and Newcastle disease is introduced to our country? Who will pay for the loss of endangered species, given that there is clear evidence that Australia's native bird life is extremely susceptible to Newcastle disease? I understand that studies have shown that there is a 100 per cent fatality rate for eastern rosellas within six days of exposure to Newcastle disease and that 170 Australian native birds have no antibodies at all for this disease. There is a severe risk of a massive environmental impact on Australia if the government allows the importation of cooked chicken meat and Newcastle disease is introduced. We need to understand that, despite the government's claims that there will be checks made in Denmark, Thailand or the United States to ensure the meat is properly cooked before it is exported to Australia, the reason why people have been sending these letters to their members of parliament is that they know it is very difficult to ensure 100 per cent compliance. All we need is for one batch to come in from a small operator somewhere in Thailand who does not ensure that the meat is properly cooked and we could have Newcastle disease introduced to our country, which would undermine jobs, the Australian environment and our clean green image for Australian food exports. One of the concerns we have is that Australian chicken producers and processors are forced to go to elaborate lengths to make sure that Australians have access to food that has been produced under the proper standards. The CSIRO has carried out tests for one of the manufacturers in my own electorate which ensures that, wherever the birds are located on the cooking belts, there is sufficient heat and that heat is maintained for sufficient time to ensure that the core temperatures of those chickens kill any disease or bacteria. How do we know that will be the case with some operator in Thailand? How do we know that even if it is the case at the beginning when the plant opens it will always be the case? This is too big a risk to take with Australia's environment and too big a risk to take with 17,000 jobs that will be placed in jeopardy if the government goes ahead with this decision. That is why those of us on this side of the House will continue to oppose the importation of cooked chicken meat. The second issue I wish to grieve about today concerns a change that the government has made to funding for legal aid. I am pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is at the table. I have written to the Attorney-General about this matter. He has acknowledged the letter and he has promised me a reply in due course. For the benefit of the House, I would like to read a letter from the Central Coast and Hunter Valley Vietnam Forces Association to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) about this matter of legal aid. The letter states: Recently, through Liberal Party policy, the Government, through their funding cuts, has stopped veterans from having advocates assist them at the Veterans' Review Board when pursuing a claim for their war caused disabilities. This decision has put all veterans, from no matter which war or conflict, at a great disadvantage when they are applying to have a decision that has been made by the Repatriation Commission, overturned on appeal at the Veterans' Review Board. The Veterans' Review Board (V.R.B.), as you would be well aware, usually consists of three members, one, the Chairman, being a person of retired legal standing, two, usually a Medico/Legal person, and a third person being a representative of a recognised ex-service organisation. Could you please advise this Association how a person who is in severe ill-health and would be extremely agitated could be expected to present a case to these three eminent people clearly and concisely with any amount of composure so that he/she can receive his/her correct entitlement or at the very least a fair hearing. Any person, notwithstanding their age or health, would be intimidated when subjected to such a situation. This Association does not believe that this decision is in the spirit of the Veterans Entitlement Act, but is a product of self-centred, ignorant politicians and bureaucrats who wouldn't have a clue or couldn't care less what these ex-service people have done for their country or the medical conditions they now suffer. Many years ago, the Government of the day made a commitment to look after the men and women who represented this country at war, however, it would now appear that latter day Governments have decided it is no longer necessary to honour that commitment, for reasons best known to themselves, and at every opportunity they slowly erode away the war veterans' entitlements or implement new rules to discourage veterans from pursuing their just entitlements. This is a decision that should be reversed. (Time expired) Finding a Balance: Fair Trading in Australia Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (5.59 p.m.)-Following on from my speech earlier today, the Elegant Knitting factory in my electorate is run by the Holmick familythree generations of Holmicks-who have manufactured various knitwear in Australia, especially in my electorate, since 1981. Prior to that they moved with the government's Federal decentralisation policy to Tamworth and before that they were in Bankstown. The daughter of the family is employed, as well as the sons, sons-in-law and grandchildren. There are 35 employees in my electorate, as well as outworkers. They are mainly female with the traditional skills of sewing. They compete very well in the current marketplace and believe that they could meet some reductions in tariffs and still perform, still operate and still employ people in Australia. At the moment, they are looking at exit plans for moving offshore. The worrying thing for them is the reduction of tariffs in isolation. It is something that this government would not consider. If we were to reduce tariffs, it would be in accordance with a preset plan as well as a reduction in tax, which is something this government has given a major commitment to. We have already reduced capital gains tax for business. We have looked at reducing the provisional tax uplift factor. We have looked at reducing the on-costs for business in terms of compliance with A TO requirements. We have developed a one-stop shop with various government reporting agencies. We have gone a long way in the interest of small business which has largely been ignored for the last 13 years. We still have a long way to go and we are still working that way. That is why the small businesses in my electorate still support me. With regard to the situation of Elegant Knitting, it is something that needs to be looked at very carefully. Their views are fairly well in line with the motion moved by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) earlier today. There is virtually no manufacturing left in Australia after Labor's economic rationalism of the last 13 years. It is something that has really got the goat of people in my electorate. It is certainly not a road this government will go down without a whole policy looking at the entire business environment in which people are operating, where their costs are coming from and where their competition is. We are not unmindful of the tyranny of distance. We are not close to Europe. We are not close to America. We therefore have enormous costs in transporting our goods to market. For those of you who saw a recent 60 Minutes program on the situation on our docks, it should be obvious that a company like Elegant Knitting bears quite substantial on-costs to comply with a contract for delivery to Malaysia. With changes to industrial relations policy and the unfair dismissal laws, this government is doing things to address that situation. We are going a long way. Labor stymied business for the last 13 years. However, given that tyranny of distance, it is important that Australia maintain some capability in Australia. It would be absolutely disastrous to our national interest, given our need for self reliance in defence policy and our geographic position in the world, if no manufacturing remained in Australia. A number of these low skilled jobs have gone already. What is to replace them in this area? Another point in my contribution to the grievance debate today comes from petrol station operators. They wish to know where we are going with the policy on the removal of sites act and the retail petrol pricing act. It is something that is of great concern to them. It is an area where there are prospects of employment, and that is the number one issue in my electorate. A lot of service station operators are working long hours seven days a week. If they could make the margins, they would be more than willing to employ other employees, even if it were for only two or three days a week, to give themselves and their families a break. Between two stations that would be one extra job in Lindsay. A lot of petrol stations are making 1c a litre mark-up on fuel. That is $140 a week for some of them. On that, they have to pay wages, rent, lighting, electricity and a number of other things. The only way they can make a living from their petrol stations is from the shop and from the workshops that are attached to the fuel pumps. Even now a lot of larger oil companies are looking to move in on that. They are putting black boxes on the cash registers and demanding a certain percentage of the gross turnover. Something similar has been looked at with retail tenancies in large plazas. I have had a number of complaints in that direction, especially from the Penrith Plaza in Penrith. It was something that was looked at very closely in the report, Finding a balance: fair trading in Australia. It is something this government is considering. During 13 years of Labor, these issues were not even raised. They certainly did not extend themselves to look at where a massive amount of employment is able to come from. Traditionally, in Australia's history, if you were unemployed you could virtually go out, work hard, create your own job, have your own interest, and bingo, you went from being someone who was on a pension, costing the government, to someone who was employed and paying tax. The long-term benefits for this nation are immeasurable. We need to get people back to work in the work force. This is an initiative and a community standard and a work ethic that Australia just cannot afford to lose given our geographic position in the world. At this stage our primary emphasis should be to protect jobs. We need to look at that, given current unemployment levels which are a hangover from the 1991-92 recession from which Penrith never really recovered. It sent the shops in our area into a tail-spin. We are doing an enormous amount to lift their performance. We are trying very hard to regenerate jobs. In fact, we have had some excellent employment results in Lindsay. I commend a number of the recommendations in the fair trading report which should see a lot of benefits for franchisees, such as security of tenure. That is incredibly important. People are put in an non-viable situation when large organisations have the ability to determine whether or not leases will be extended, as is the case with a number of petrol operators in my area. They are frightened to be associated with me on this issue. It is something about which they cannot individually turn to the media for assistance because they have no security regarding the termination of their leases. Disclosure statements are to be provided to purchasers on the assignment of leases. If large fuel companies are aware of competition that is going in--quite often, across the road-near the site that they are leasing to a franchisee, this should be made quite clear. I have examples where this has not occurred. The other issue I would like to raise today is the access to finance, the securing of finance for business. There is a practice of securing small businesses against their real assets, especially in areas like IT. It really is not commercially viable to do that, and they certainly need a lot of assistance when banks and lending agencies look at the ability or the commercial viability of the small business rather than the assets. Again, that is something our government has addressed in the business innovation fund, which is looking at promoting that area. We can relieve a lot of the grievances in my area by lowering the cost of government and giving the people tax breaks. We have got the books of Australia back into the black. Certainly over the next two years we will be in a much healthier position in order to allow these industries to help themselves but, in the meantime, their jobs need to be protected. They need to find some status quo while recognising that this government, as compared to the previous one, certainly has a vision, a depth and a compassion for the battlers of Lindsay that they have not experienced in the last six years, and possibly not in the last 13 years. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",76
169,Mr OCONNOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The decision confronting the government on Australia's textiles, clothing and footwear industries is one with profound implications for the Geelong regional economy. I cannot put the situation more bluntly than this: if the federal government accepts the recommendations contained in the draft Productivity Commission report on TCF industries, it will have a devastating effect on many Geelong TCF businesses and cause further job losses on a massive scale in a regional economy already badly affected by the policies of the Howard government. At stake in Geelong are the jobs of over 3,300 workers and the economic well-being of their families. They are industries that pump around $100 million in wages and salaries into the Geelong economy and have an annual turnover of some $400 million. In addition to the 3,300 people directly employed in TCF industries in Geelong, it is estimated that another 4,200 jobs are at risk if massive job losses were to occur in this sector. These are not only my concerns that I echo in this chamber today; they are the concerns of the workers themselves, articulated to me during my visits to their workplaces. They are the concerns of their union representatives and the Geelong Regional Trades Hall Council, which has carried the public fight on their behalf on this issue. They are the concerns of the Geelong Chamber of Commerce, which in a letter to all members, I understand, recently warned of the dire consequences to the private sector in Geelong if the Productivity Commission's recommendations were ever implemented. They are the concerns of the local government representatives of the City of Greater Geelong, who is sponsoring a Geelong delegation who will be lobbying the government over the next couple of days on behalf of the Geelong community on this issue. So I ask the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today on the floor of this House to heed the concerns of the Geelong community. I ask other federal ministers involved in this decision to listen carefully to the united voice of the Geelong community on this matter for what is at stake is the economic survival of a key manufacturing region of the Commonwealth. The Labor Party has set out a clear blueprint for these industries beyond the year 2000. We did the same for cars, and many of those recommendations were sensibly adopted by the government. We are calling on the government to do the same in this instance in the plan that we have put before it with regard to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Labor's position on TCF industries beyond the year 2000 has been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and our shadow industry minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). In government, we would freeze tariffs from the year 2000 to the year 2005, we would retain the import credit scheme and we would conduct a further review of the industry in the year 2004 to judge the performance of our trading partners in granting Australian firms access to their markets. The plan that we have suggested for these industries would see an increase in jobs and investment. So the choice before the government is a very clear one. It is either that very structured and clear plan or what is being proposed by the Productivity Commission in its draft report. The Productivity Commission has proposed to reduce all tariffs to five per cent by the year 2008 regardless of what our competitors do. It has proposed to end the import credit scheme by the year 2000 and to conduct no further reviews of this industry at all. By its own admission, the Productivity Commission says there will be 5,000 job losses in this industry. I expect there will be more. I visited many TCF companies in my electorate and they have echoed many concerns to me. I visited Godfrey Hirst, a firm with annual sales of $200 million, which employs 1,200 employees in Geelong. It is the largest carpet exporter in Australia, exporting some $21 million worth of product to 18 countries throughout the world. It is the largest wool spinning company in the world, and it uses 9,000 tonnes of spun woollen yam per annum. This particular company knows their market, and they say a couple of very important things about their industry. They believe there is a trigger tariff figure of between 15 per cent and 18 per cent where manufacturers will reduce production investment and some will invest in infrastructure to provide imported product to the marketplace, not Australian made product. It is a very important point that ought to be understood. Godfrey Hirst also' made another very important point. They said that their particular export plan was developed on two dynamics-the import credit scheme, which the Productivity Commission has recommended ought to be terminated, and a strong domestic base. It is that domestic base that they consider is under threat from the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. I have also visited Candy Footwear, which employs around 200 people in Geelong. That company has asked for a freeze on tariffs from the year 2000 to 2005 and a retention of the import credit scheme. Both of those elements are inherent in the plan that Labor has put before the Australian community on these industries. Candy Footwear made the very important point to me that further investments will depend on that tariff freeze, and that is a point that must be understood by the government-a clear signal needs to be sent to these industries in pausing tariffs between the year 2000 and 2005. I have visited Class weave Industries, which employ 180 people in my electorate. They are a company run by good management, a very efficient company with a good industrial relations policy. Classweave Industries have restructured their operations in response to the 1986 plan and they believe they can compete head-on with imports if the right signals are sent to them about this tariff question and if the right economic climate is engineered by the government for them to operate in. The opportunity is here for the government to send a very clear signal to these companies in Geelong and elsewhere throughout Australia that they are wanted in Australia and that employment in those industries at this point in time will be sustained while they re-invest and seek out the niche markets that are very important to their long-term survival. A very effective promotions campaign has been waged by those companies from Geelong, and many members on the floor of this parliament have received a particular gift which really says it all about the opportunities that are in Geelong for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The particular firm that produced this garment is one which has sought out a niche market; it has invested and done what the previous Labor government asked it to do. It has grown from a couple of employees to 20 and is exporting throughout the world and exporting some of the finest garments that you would ever hope to see manufactured in the world. That company is Hedrena Textiles and it produced this very effective promotional garment. Out of deference to the procedures of the House, I have not donned them here today to wear into the House, but I will show them to you. The message is very clear to the government and to the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur)-that is, 'Don't stich up Geelong.' This is a beautiful garment made from the finest wool from the western district and crafted with the skills of the work force in Geelong. What this company and the other companies are saying to the government is, 'Take a great deal of care with the decision you make with regard to these industries, because the future of Geelong is at stake.' I heard the member for Corangamite in here earlier in the day debating the motion by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). But he is one who has advocated zero tariffs for this industry in the past-the Hewson line-which would have seen every single worker employed in Geelong in these industries, as well as those in the automotive industry, lose their job. (Time expired) Tariffs The Media",79
170,Mr WAKE LIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I noted with interest the comments made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). I would just observe on the issue of tariffs that the car industry tariffs were quite a hot topic here a few weeks ago and now it is the TCF tariffs. But cabinet has made a decision and life moves on. The point I would like to make in the South Australian context is that the agricultural export industries of South Australia are responsible for about $3 billion worth of exports. By a very large margin, they are the most significant export products of South Australia. More importantly, in the context of the tariff debate, there are just as many jobs and, in actual fact, a lot more commerce created by food processing in South Australia. In the balance of this debate, I really wish that the parliament would look at the wider context of employment, not just at single industries. I think that is a very important point. Nevertheless, I move to the matters of the day. Tonight, in this grievance debate, I would like to talk about the media and the parliament. I would like to begin by reading into the Hansard what I would regard as a brilliant piece of prose attributed to R.G. Menzies in the New York Times Magazine on 28 November 1948. For those who are interested, this quotation is actually in the cabinet at the House of Representatives entrance for all to see. It reads: I believe that politics is the most important and responsible civil activity to which a man may devote his character, his talents, and his energy. We must, in our own interests, elevate politics into statesmanship and statecraft. We must aim at a condition of affairs in which we shall no longer reserve the dignified name of statesman for a Churchill or a Roosevelt but extend it to lesser men who give honourable and patriotic service in public affairs. It is true that most men of ability prefer objective work of science, the law, literature, scholarship, or the immediately stimulating and profitable work of manufacturing, commerce or finance. The result is that our legislative assemblies are a fair popular cross-section not a corps d'elite. The first class mind is comparatively rare. We disadvantage young men of parts by confronting them with poor material benefits, precariousness of tenure, an open public cynicism about their motives, and cheap sneers about their real or supposed search for publicity. The reason for this wrong-headedness, so damaging to ourselves, is that we have treated democracy as an end and not a means. It is almost as if we had said, when legislatures, freely elected by the votes of all adult citizens, come into being, 'Well thank heaven we have achieved democracy. Let us now devote our attention to something new'. Yet the true last of the democrat only begins when he is put in possession of the instruments by which the popular will may be translated into authoritative action. In brief we cannot sensibly devote only one per cent of our time to something which affects ninety-nine per cent of our living. I like to quote those words of Sir Robert Menzies, because I think that he summarises the role of the parliamentarian as well as anyone that I have known who has worked in this place or in the institution of the national parliament. I move to what I believe is the role of the journalist. It is a somewhat more tenuous issue, because I do not have experience in it. I would have thought that the role of the journalist and the media is to report honestly and to respect honourably our institutions of democracy and the constitution. That may be a little too high-minded and too high-principled for many. Nevertheless, I think that the main aim should be the seeking of truth and its reporting to the general population. Since the Menzies era, and particularly since the time of the above quote from 1948, the media industry has no doubt moved on considerably to television, to radio-in all its talkback guises-to the modem printing press, to the tabloid, and to a technological process of instant information which is way beyond that of the mid-20th century heading into the 21st century. Nevertheless, I believe there are significant problems for our democracy and for our country, if we do not have a greater look at the balance between the parliament and the media. I have some personal interest in the matter, because I became involved in a minor skirmish with my own metropolitan daily, the Advertiser. It is quite interesting to note the view of a leading journalist from the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Mark Riley, when he was addressing a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association seminar on 1 October 1996. He said: If a politician fails to act as a contact, or refuses to talk, either on or off the record, then-and this may seem crueland I am quotingbut this has happened to me a few times-I think he or she has no right to complain about the stories that a journalist writes. It is simply no good to ring the journalist the next day and give him or her a spray about what he or she has written that day. If a journalist is writing a story, and the politician is aware of that and decides not to talk to the journalist, not to give certain information that may provide a broader understanding of the issue and a more complete story, then, as I say, the journalist is perfectly at liberty to put it all on the politician, not on himself or herself. That is a leading journalist's comment about his right to print whatever he thinks is appropriate, regardless of the politician's position. In my own case with the Advertiser, a Mr David Penberthy and a Ms Miranda Murphy decided that they would take me to task on similar grounds. The basis of their story was that certain federal sources had said that my wife and I were planning a seven-week trip at the taxpayers' expense. This was certainly shown subsequently to be incorrect, but it did  printing the story. I took some exception to that. That is by the way. What I really want to try to explore here is the balance between the parliament and the media. I make a few observations. In Australia today we have two main contenders. I apologise to others who have significant interests, but I think we know that there are the Packer group and the Murdoch group. It is probably no coincidence that these gentlemen and their associated organisations are amongst our wealthiest citizens. There is nothing wrong with that I am quite happy to accept that as part of our free enterprise system. But I do pose a question to the parliament in the context of what I was quoting from Menzies. Where is the balance, where is the fairness, and where is the truth? And I quote again my journalist friend, Mark Riley, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald: Any law passed by a government, or any regulation imposed on an organisation by itself, is only as good as its enforcement. We have to be seen to be enforcing our rules, otherwise we will not be taken seriously and the rules will not be seen to be an effective mechanism. Of course, we are talking there about the general issue of the media policing itself. I believe that the country has a serious issue in front of it in terms of the way that media proprietors, their editors and their journalists report the news in the best interests of the country. I think that it is time the parliament had a good, hard look at it to ensure that the interests of the people, not just the interests of the profits of a few but of the general community, are fully considered.",81
171,Unknown,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Sitting suspended from 6.29 p.m. to CARE Credit and Debt Counselling,83
172,Ms ELLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Tonight I want talk about the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service which was started in the Australian Capital Territory in 1983. CARE's services include, among other things, legal advice on consumer credit and debt matters for low-income people. It has one full-time solicitor and financial counsellors-paralegal workers who are tertiary qualified counsellors. CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service offers a holistic approach to its clients. The problems can include: inability to service debt due to illness or some misfortune; problems with credit firms; and a wide range of financially based concerns. Over the years, I have referred many people to CARE-in fact, I did so only last Friday. The role of CARE is extremely important to the lower income sector of our community. Last year, CARE saw some 2,047 clients. When we translate that to over 60 per cent of its clients being families, you can see the number of people who come under the care of CARE. Sometimes, the initial interview could take up to two hours. A lot of personal information and family detail is required to fully understand the extent of the problems facing the family concerned. In past times, but unfortunately not now, a local child-care centre was able to offer support by caring for the small children of those families during those initial interviews, in most cases free of charge. It was really like the community helping the community. But unfortunately things are different now. All this started to change with the Liberal government's budget of last year. Let me give you some background. The Commonwealth government provides a small funding program of, in this current year, $l. 99 million for financial counsellors nationally. The program is administered by the small business and consumer affairs division of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism. The ACT's share of this funding is paid to CARE. The history of CARE's funding from the 8 p.m. program is as follows: in 1991, $51,307 employed one full-time financial counsellor; in 1993-94 it was $52,892; in 1994-95 Service $54,837 employed one full-time worker-a 3.67 per cent increase, thus keeping pace with inflation; and in 1995-96 it was $55,676. On recommendations from the department and in direct response to unmet demand the program received a small increase and CARE received an additional $7,090 in March 1996. CARE took the funding on the understanding that if it increased hours the funding would not be short-term top-up funding. CARE increased hours to one full-time and one part-time worker. At the time, CARE had a waiting list time of some 13 weeks for a first appointment. In 1996-97, this government reneged on the commitment to maintain the modest increase and CARE funds were reduced to $51,030hardly sufficient to employ one full-time worker. This year, no provision was made for CPI increases. In the same period, the federal government also totally defunded the peak body, the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association, that had provided so much support and guidance to agencies like CARE. Conversely, Labor made significant increases to the program. In 1995, Labor provided the program with $6.4 million over four years in the Justice Statement. This was reneged on by this government. The cut in the current government's 1996 budget to the Commonwealth financial counselling program was approximately II per cent, however that cut amounted to around 25 per cent when taking into account the Justice Statement funding allocated under Labor. This allocation was cut when the coalition gained government. The situation in my electorate of Namadgi and in the ACT generally is of huge concern. By sacrificing longer term case work, CARE absorbed a 38.6 per cent increase in the number of people seen. The choices they must make are heart-rending. The level of unmet demand continues and is growing. There can be no doubt that financial counselling returns a net benefit to government. CARE is already an efficient and effective service, with no excess or discretionary budget items that can be cut. The overall meanness of the reduction to this already inadequately funded program seems almost punitive rather than having any rational basis or analysis of the social cost. The government has targeted Canberra for massive cuts to its employment base. We are already seeing an increase in new clients presenting as a result of unemployment and underemployment. A 59.89 per cent increase in personal bankruptcies in the ACT for 199697 is a further indicator of financial failure increasing numbers of Canberrans. It is incomprehensible that, at a time when its policies are hurting so many people, the government would reduce the safety net Jf programs like financial counselling. CARE's clients are increasingly drawn from those whom we would have considered as middleincome earners three to four years ago. A very noticeable change in attitude has been reported by counsellors. Formerly, clients had hope. They would say, 'When I get a job I will be able to manage and life will return to normal.' Now there is an overwhelming belief that their situation will not improve and that their future in Canberra looks grim. These people are increasingly cynical about the promised benefits that the current economic policy is supposed to deliver. They are understandably afraid that by the time the benefits from that economic pain arrive, their situation will have deteriorated to such an extent that they will not be in a position to participate. Overarching the growing sense of frustration and very real anxiety is a belief that, at the highest levels of government, this community is held in contempt and treated accordingly. It is no good the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) coming into this community, as he did last week, and parading himself and his government with some caring, compassionate 'we really didn't mean to hurt you all, we really like Canberra' charade. While this government continues to make these disastrous decisions, all the hyperbole in the world will be just that-a distortion of the facts. The service of the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service must continue to be delivered. The government must reconsider the funding for the financial counselling program both here in the ACT and nationally. I can only reiterate the instance of a lady coming into my office last week who was in dire financial circumstances, mostly not of her own making, and who desperately required the services of the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service, a service proven worthy since 1983. CARE cannot continue to hope to deliver the services to the community as for required whilst facing the sorts of funding cuts that they are currently attempting to endure. The lady whom I referred to them did get phone counselling today and I am sure that she will eventually receive the benefit of the advice from the CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service. But she and many others in Canberra who are awaiting that service are going to have to wait an inordinate amount of time. It seems to me quite unacceptable and pretty deplorable that, at the very time the government is putting pressure on the community which means more people require this sort of service than one would wish to see, we see a counterattack, and that is an attack on the services that can help to alleviate the difficulties faced in this financial climate. I cannot impress enough upon this House the distress that is being felt within my local community in a financial and social sense. The CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service simply must be given the ability to carry out the service it is professionally qualified do. I implore the government to reconsider its whole position in regard to the funding of CARE Credit and Debt Counselling Service and of similar services around the country. Dugong: Gillnet Fishing",83
173,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Tonight I rise to address a recent Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority report to the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council. This report entitled Report to governments on actions necessary for dugong conservation in the Great Barrier Reef and Harvey Bay Great Sandy Strait has resulted in bans on gillnet fishing and restricted gillnet fishing in areas of the Great Barrier Reef southern region. I have a number of concerns with the decision not least of which is the credibility of the aforesaid report. The report depends on unpublished papers for its baseline data, anecdotal evidence and unsubstantiated assumptions. It focuses entirely on gillnet fishing as the sole cause of the decline in dugong and focuses, too, on the banning of gillnet fishing as the sole solution to the decline in dugong. I would like to give the House some idea of the number of dugong that we are speaking about. The dugong is a unique marine mammal and, naturally, we want to see the numbers not only maintained but also increased. According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, there have been 35 dugong mortalities in the southern Great Barrier Reef area of which 16 were directly due to gillnet fishing. While the report that I have mentioned was very disparaging of the Queensland commercial fishing recommendations, it does state that those recommendations will reduce deaths by 50 per cent. So, if the recommendations of the report were to be implemented, we would be looking at eight deaths due to gillnet fishing. According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the potential biological removal-that is, the number of creatures that can be accidentally killed and still maintain the species-is 3.3 dugong; so the number of dugong that we are speaking about is five. Certainly any loss of this unique marine mammal is very unsatisfactory, but we are to talking about five dugong deaths in the Great Barrier Reef southern area-from Cooktown down to Hervey Bay-whereas, in my electorate alone, we are also speaking about the livelihood of 114 commercial fishermen. Some six months ago the fishermen in the Mackay area brought in a voluntary code which incorporated features such as a partial closure to rocky foreshore nets and a total ban on off-shore nets in the dugong protection areas. A number of other recommendations were put in the local QCFO report. These have been implemented as a self-regulatory measure and, according to the fishermen in the area, we now see nil mortalities which is a very satisfactory outcome. Unfortunately, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has chosen to ignore this self-regulation and has imposed its own bans. I would now like to share with you the economic impact of the gill net ban in my area. There are 114 gillnet fishermen in my electorate of Dawson: 45 in Mackay, 22 in Bowen, 15 in Proserpine and Midge Point and 32 in Ayr and Home Hill. The flow-on effects, particularly in the Burdekin, are going to be severe. I have here a petition that has been signed by over 2,000 residents of the Burdekin, which gives you some idea of the concern in our area about the impact of a ban based on what I would have to say is an unsatisfactory scientific report. I would like to share with you an independent scientific assessment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's report. These are not my views-although I am certainly very critical of the report-these are the views of an independent scientist with a doctorate in zoology. That scientist has the following to say: From the data it is difficult, in fact it may even be impossible, to determine the level of mortality of dugong due to gillnetting. Within the qualifications on the conclusions of the report, it is not reasonable to say it is bad science. However, whether a decision that has such an effect on people's lives should be made from this report is questionable. The political decision should not be made on the evidence supplied. The third point is what the report does demonstrate is that gillnetting is a significant cause. However, you cannot conclude from the report how significant gillnetting is. The scientist goes on further to say: The report is inconclusive on the other significant mortality factors: motorboat strikes, illegal fishing, indigenous fishing and other natural causes. Finally, they say that the dugong may have just migrated, bearing in mind that a single dugong can move from 50 kilometres up to 500 kilometres within a matter of days. My other concern with this report is the level of compensation. I had a fisherman come into the office recently- Mr MCKenzie. Although the report says that he is not going to be affected by the dugong protection areas, in fact, his livelihood is going to be wiped out. He is not going to receive any compensation. His investment in his business, with his boat and his licence, is worth $92,000. His house repayment is $140 a week. Frankly, his livelihood is going to be ruined. I am very concerned that there is not going to be adequate compensation for those who are going to lose their livelihood as a result of this decision. I firmly believe that what we need to be looking at to protect our dugong adequately and to ensure a livelihood for the fishermen in the Great Barrier Reef's southern area is an independent study of the dugong. We will be writing to Senator Hill soon, from the University of Central Queensland, asking for such a study. That study should look at remapping the seagrass beds. The existing maps are over 16 years old. Recent studies done by fishermen in the area show that, where there are seagrass meadows on the maps, there is no seagrass. In relation to an accurate aerial survey of dugong populations, as our independent scientist has said, transect aerial surveys are an extremely awkward way to measure dugong numbers. We need to do a study of the reproductive biology. We need to look at dugong eating habits. Not all seagrass is palatable to dugong. They are very particular about the types of seagrass that they choose to eat. We need an analysis of why seagrass beds are declining in some areas and regenerating in others. Finally, there is the effect of environmental stress and fungal pathogens on seagrass. Labyrinthulia is a fungal pathogen well known to destroy seagrass. It is believed now to be established in Queensland, yet there has been no study of that. I believe there can be a win-win from the situation we face in Queensland, whereby dugong numbers can be maintained and the livelihood of commercial fishermen can be ensured. There is a number of other aspects of the report that were not examined. Dugong have very acute hearing, yet pingers and acoustic devises on nets have simply not been looked at at all. They are very effective for certain species of dolphin, and there is no reason why a particular acoustic device could not be adapted to help protect dugong. There is a number of other issues that have not been addressed in this report, and I think that it is a lose-lose situation to look at one cause of dugong decline-hence, one solution-when, plainly, there are complex intermeshing causes for dugong decline. I also think it is unsatisfactory to destroy the livelihood, certainly in my area, of 114 people without adequate compensation. Second Sydney Airport: Minister for Transport",85
174,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the grievance debate tonight, I would like to focus on the conduct of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), over both his handling of the publication of the draft EIS on Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy and his actions in relation to Goulburn City Council and the hundreds of people in the Goulburn area-his own constituents, might I add-who have been lobbying for him to at least consider Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second international airport. We all know that the minister for transport has stubbornly refused to even consider Goulburn as a site for Sydney's second international airport-a site that when serviced by the very fast train offers a win-win situation to both the citizens of Sydney and the citizens of the Southern Highlands. We all know how prone our minister is to exhibitions of outlandish and impetuous behaviour. Now his most recent actions in relation to the draft EIS and those lobbying for an airport at Goulburn have added another chapter to this minister's record as one of the loosest cannons on the Howard government's front bench. Firstly, let us look at what he has done in relation to the draft EIS. We were told initialnormal ly that the draft environmental impact study would be published in late JUly. It is now September. Through the media we have learned that the draft EIS will not be available for public scrutiny until the month-two months later than first expected. If this were a case of a delay caused by a minister who wanted to make sure that the report for which he was responsible was comprehensive or error-free, then I believe that would be acceptable. If it were a case of a delay because of unforeseen technical errors in the publishing process, then that, too, would be acceptable. What is not acceptable is that the delay has been caused by the minister's own outrageous case of megalomania. We have a minister for transport who has now taken his neuroses to such a level that he is currently forcing public servants to participate in bizarre rituals of secrecy, which could only have sprung from the minister's own paranoid imagination. It is the minister's own addiction to control which has now delayed the publication of the draft EIS for some two months while the rest of Sydney waits unnecessarily. I would like to give the House an insight into what the minister has been up to. For example, the minister is allowing only one copy of the completed draft EIS to be seen by the auditors employed for the project by this government-the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. I can imagine other public servants participating in the final stages of the draft EIS publication have also been subjected to such outrageous behaviour. One copy of the draft EIS is kept in a room, under lock and key, roughly a block away from the offices of the auditors in North Sydney. Consultants for the company can only enter the room while under the supervision of an employee from the minister's department. No copies of the document, or even portions of the document, are allowed to be made. Consultants have to bring all of their material into that room in order to conduct their work. Mr Allan Limbury, the sub-consultant on the project for the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, has said that, under circumstances, each consultant on the job would have been supplied with a copy of the draft. Mr Limbury says: Given that everyone entered into a confidentiality undertaking, that would have been the appropriate latter half of this thing to do. The technical manager on the audit, Gillian Eckert, has admitted that the company has now been forced to register its concern with the minister over the most unusual arrangements-and quite understandably too-as the restrictions have now made their work extremely laborious and time-consuming. All this adds up to millions of Sydney residents being left in the dark needlessly for two extra months while the minister plays his little power games. But to put the icing on the cake, a member of the minister's own office, when asked by a local Sydney newspaper why such over-the-top security was necessary, replied: We don't want to see information ... going to the community. Come again? I really thought my eyes were deceiving me when I read that. The minister for transport in this Howard government does not want the information on the draft EIS going to the community, especially to those communities which will be most affected by an international airport in the Sydney basin. What is this government trying to hide? In particular, what is the minister for transport trying to hide? The people of Sydney were promised an open and honest EIS process. The people of Sydney were promised transparency, not closed doors and secrecy. The people of Sydney were promised that they would be involved in the draft EIS process, not locked out of it. They were promised information as soon as it came to hand, not unnecessary delays at the behest of a minister for transport who is out of control. The transport minister's arrogance and contempt for the public has also strayed into his dealings with his own constituents; namely, the Goulburn City Council and hundreds of its supporters who are in favour of their district at least being considered as a site for Sydney's second airport in conjunction with the very fast train. Goulburn City Council has recently joined with members of its community, both business leaders and ordinary families, in a campaign to have their voices heard on this matter. Goulburn City Council matched a public contribution of some $5,000 to the campaign with a donation of its own for the same amount. The money has been used to place advertisements in local papers on the benefits to the region of an international airport at Goulburn and to bolster the group's lobbying efforts-efforts which, I might add, despite the transport minister's attempts at destabilisainappropriate tion, are still going strong. Following the news that the council had matched the public's contribution with its own donation, the minister for transport-and remember these people are his own constituents-took to the airwaves and rubbished their efforts and initiative. He said that the council was taking part in a cruel hoax of the community. I believe that is an outrageous accusation. It is the minister for transport and this government who are conducting a hoax on the citizens of Goulburn and, indeed, on the citizens of Sydney with their continual denigration and dismissal of Goulbum as a site for Sydney's second airport. The minister for transport and the members of the Howard government use the arguments of distance and weather to dismiss any proposal that Goulburn should at least be looked at as a site for Sydney's second airport. Only two weeks ago at a meeting of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) said that Goulburn should be ruled out because it was 'too far and too foggy'. This is a complete and utter hoax, which also needs to be debunked. Firstly, let us tum to distance. Linked by a very fast train, an airport at Goulburn would be only 45 minutes away from Sydney. As I have said countless times before, that is less time than it takes to travel from Heathrow to the centre of London on the Underground. The consortia bidding for the right to construct the very fast train between Sydney and Canberra have gone on the record about their willingness to build, at their cost, a station which services an airport at Goulburn. Just last week Andrew Mason, the spokesperson for Transrapid, which is proposing to build a magnetic levitation train, said: Goulbum is automatically included if we get the go ahead. That would place Goulbum 45 minutes from Sydney. A spokesperson for a competing consortia, Dale Budd from Speedrail, said his company would readily negotiate the construction of a station at Goulburn. Distance is plainly not an issue with the very fast train. And what about the argument in relation to weather? The proposition that Goulburn is an site for an international airport because of heavy fog is completely fallacious. The minister for transport in answer to a question of mine on notice said his most recent advice from the Bureau of Meteorology indicated that in 1996 there were 32 days of fog at Goulburn. I would like to take a look, for the interest of the parliament, at the international airport at Seattle-Tacoma in the United States. It is the 18th busiest in the United States. In 1994 it had over 10 million emplanements-people embarking and disembarking from planes--or 345,000 operations, which are take-offs and landings. Remember, under the coalition's plan, Sydney's second airport will eventually have the capacity for 360,000 operations-a difference of only some 15,000 operations. Interestingly, Seattle-Tacoma is one of the worse fog affected airports in the United States. The US government publication Weather Almanac, records Seattle-Tacoma as suffering 'heavy fog' where visibility is 'one-quarter of a mile or less' on an average of 47 days per year-that is 47 as opposed to 32 at Goulburn. Yet the government says it cannot build an airport there because of the fog. What an outright fabrication. The minister is contemptuous of the draft EIS process; he is contemptuous of the people of Sydney who were promised an open and honest EIS process; and he is contemptuous of the aspirations and enterprise of hundreds of his own constituents. Compounding these facts he insists on spreading and perpetuating deliberate untruths about an airport at Goulburn. If the minister cares so little about the need for jobs and investment in his own electorate which would flow from an airport being built there, I find it difficult to imagine he is at all concerned about the rights of Sydneysiders to clean air, freedom from debilitating noise during sleeping hours and the violation of pristine wilderness, which are the certain by-products of building an international airport at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. People are not going to sit down and be quiet about this. They are continuing to be annoyed. They are continuing to gather and express their outrage that either of these sites, despite the advances of modern technology and the advent of the very fast train, is still being contemplated by this government. As I said earlier when the second EIS was contemplated in Holsworthy, if it is good enough to have an EIS for Holsworthy, why not Goulburn? (Time expired) Tariffs: Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",86
175,Mr BOB BALDWIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today in this grievance debate to truly represent the textile industry workers in my electorate of Paterson-some 2,100 employees and 1,800 outworkers in the Hunter-who are aggrieved at the actions of the former Labor government and also, in part, of this government. The debate over tariff reform in this country has in past years been a debate built as much around pure emotion as pure economics. The Industry Commission's assessment of the issue for the government's consideration has once again reignited that debate. The Industry Commission is not and has never been the policy mouthpiece for the Howard government. Indeed, nobody could say, after the pragmatic approach to the future tariff reform of the local car industry, that this government is in any way the mere wagging tail of the Industry Commission beast. Yes, these industries have a future-a very real future in Australia-and, as a member of this government, I am determined to help facilitate that. That is why I endorse the direct thrust of the TCF industries' collective 'pause for a cause' reform package, which specifically demands, in part, a freeze on tariffs between the years 2000 and 2005. The reason for that is the need to balance the rational and the emotional-marrying job security with economics-has become more urgent than ever. A key component of that balance is the need for government to face the hard and fast economic reality that pushing on in the short term with further tariff cuts will have a significant impact on jobs directly linked to the TCF sector. Getting the balance right--of the emotion of wanting to sustain jobs as part of a viable, ongoing local TCF sector-did not work in practice, even if it was half-heartedly attempted to be reflected in principle by the economics driven by the former Hawke and Keating Labor government for the industry. Getting the balance right certainly did not occur in the eyes of the people involved in the TCF game in the Hunter. Peter Rundle, former owner of the Hunter based Rundles clothing manufacturer, and whose company, whilst still operating, is now in the hands of the Westpac Bank and a receiver, portrays a damning indictment of some of the former government's actions towards the TCF industries. These actions-if you had been listening to members of the Labor Party around the country during the winter parliamentary recess-apparently did not happen now that they have embarked on a sudden Paulian conversion on tariffs. Peter Rundle just today went back over the past with me on issues that stick in his craw-and they certainly stick in mine-over the former government's poor performance on TCF policy. As a publicly proud wearer of the Rundles suit label, I was in Newcastle getting fitted for a suit back in 1994 when one Paul Keating made his famous remarks on the radio concerning Italian Zegna suits being his exclusive choice. The Rundles staff at the time were flabbergasted, to say the least. Whilst Paul Keating's choice of clothes is his prerogative, the manner and the way which he portrayed his abandonment of the local product had a damning financial impact. Rundles assessed that his comments alone cost the group jobs. What made the issue even worse was that Rundles made an offer to the former Prime Minister to try a locally made Hunter suit on for size. He declined. Indeed, the company never heard back from him. Another damning issue was the direct impact of Labor's 1991 determination to escalate tariff reform in the TCF industries, despite the country being in the throes of the worse economic downturn since World War II. Peter Rundle expressed to me that this fresh reform stance by the then Labor government drove the Australian clothing trade from a position of 75 per cent Australian made domestic suit sales, spiralling downwards to 50 per cent in just a matter of a few short years. To add fuel to the fire, clothing manufacturers from New Zealand and Fiji are bringing in material and clothing with no duty. Those from China are coming in with a favourable tariff rate. On the day of the federal opposition's public call to arms during a rally in Sydneyattended by many TCF workers from the Hunter and all over the state-urging the Commonwealth to instil a tariff pause, I put my fellow Hunter Labor politicians on notice that they match their brave new policy world on the tariff debate by supporting Australian made clothing manufacturing in the clothes they wear. You may say that that is a moot point, but when the cry went out in the community for people to support Rundles by purchasing garments to help an immediate cash flow problem, it was certainly not heard by a former recent member of this House from the Hunter area who felt justified in sending one of his suits to Asia with his wife to have another one made because it was perceived to be cheaper. That is not supporting our industry, is it? In the Commonwealth's ultimate response to the final report of the Industry Commission inquiry into the textiles, clothing and footwear industries that will be forthcoming in the days and weeks following the tabling of the report in next Tuesday, 9 September, the emotion of sustaining or holding the line on TCF jobs with a new reform package will become paramount. As a member of that government, I am acutely conscious of that and I will be driving that emotional but also very rational view that holding the line on tariffs in the short term is a legitimate tool to sustaining textiles jobs in the Hunter and across the nation. Put simply, textile workers in my electorate of Paterson and, I assume, right across the country, do not particularly care who is or was in government at the time of such decisions. They simply care about their jobs, their families and their collective futures. That message was reinforced loud and clear on 21 August when I met, during their lunch hour, with the work force at the King Gee Workwear factory based at Rutherford. It was an interesting and, at times, most vocal meeting. Most of the workers present were angry and vocal-and I have to say justifiably so. They had felt aggrieved by government decisions of the past which disregarded their needs. As I told them and the local press, including the Maitland Mercury: I'm going into bat for a tariff freeze ... we were successful in lobbying for the car industry, and we'll push equally hard, if not harder [now] for the rag trade. Not one person amongst them wants to be cast aside onto the unemployment queue. They all want to work. They believe in the quality of the product they are making-the King Gee workwear and fashion label, which are some of the best and most sturdy clothes around. Whilst many of the workers, like any employee from any company, have the odd gripe about the daily work grind, they love their jobs and they are passionate about hanging on to them. My unequivocal support remains for their cause. As I am a proud and long standing wearer of the Hunter suit label Rundles, so my choice of work or dress shirt for many years now has been Gloweave, because their patterns just happen to fit a person who is on the larger end of the size spectrum. Due to the difficulty of getting larger sizes, I purchase bulk numbers of the shirts at a single time. It used to be a simple case of walking into a department store and buying half a dozen Gloweave shirts, taking them home and peeling off the 'Made in Australia' label. However, about four years ago on such a shopping crusade for shirts, I noticed on getting them home that four of the shirts were made in Indonesia and the other two in Australia, yet all were sold for the same retail price. On my latest expedition to buy more of those fine fitting Gloweave shirts-you guessed it-they were all made in Indonesia yet with no real effective change in the sale price. So what we have seen over the past decade is that jobs at the Australian production end for Gloweave have unquestionably shifted offshore, yet with little or no perceived benefit to the Australian worker or, more importantly, the Australian consumer. I agree that there had to be rationalisation in trade and tariff policy, but I stress that timing is everything. The New South Wales Farmers Association Chief Executive, Peter Comensoli, said in a press statement on 20 August: Australians should be able to choose to pay more in the shops if they wish to support Australian clothing and footwear manufacturers rather than being forced to pay more across the board because of higher tariffs ... He went on to argue that Australians would soon pay as much as $l.2 billion a year more for their clothing, textiles and footwear than they need to because of the present tariff regime. Peter Comensoli is right to a great extent, but the government also needs to be equally balanced on the argument and address any threat which may increase protracted joblessness and contract further domestic spending on other goods, including Australian food products. The industry's own figures recently submitted to me by the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia show that there are real hard truths that need to be seriously addressed. Despite the increased competitiveness and the productivity outcomes derived from Peter Reith's workplace relations legislation, Australia's TCF labour costs remain about tenfold that of Thailand and closer to twelvefold that of Indonesia and China. We have an industry that needs support. It needs breathing space. It has been ignored, abused and bashed by the former government who only got one part of the triangle correct. There are three sides to it: tariffs, economic reform and industrial relations reform. They drove down the tariffs without any regard to taxation reform and without any regard to industrial relations reform. With that attitude it is no wonder that it failed.

179,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997, which is now before the House, contains amendments to the Native Title Act 1993 that amend the qualifications for appointment of presidential members of the National Native Title Tribunal and provide for the temporary appointment of the registrar to the National Native Title Tribunal by the president. The explanatory memorandum says that currently only judges may be appointed as presidential members and only the Governor General can appoint an acting registrar. The explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech also say that these amendments ensure that a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates may be considered for presidential membership. also ensure that the National Native Title Tribunal can act quickly and efficiently deal with a temporary vacancy in the position registrar. That is contained in the explanatory memorandum. Again, the assertion that released currently only judges may be appointed as 15: presidential members is in the second reading speech. The true situation when one goes to section 110 of the Native Title Act is that the president or deputy president can actually be a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge. A former judge is defined in section 253 of the definitions section as 'a person who has been a justice of the High Court or judge of another federal court or of the supreme court of a state or territory'. It is not current judges but former judges who can hold that position. The explanatory memorandum and second SENATE reading speech are technically not correct. The amendment bill seeks to expand the qualification at the end of section 110 dealing with persons who may be appointed as presidential members by adding section (3) which states: A person who is, and has been for at least 5 years, 1997 enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory. The opposition will be opposing that extension of the appointment of presidential members. I think it is important to outline the reason for that. It will come as a bit of a surprise to some members of the government because it is a change in the earlier position put by the former government in a position paper. We say that up-front. There is no hiding from that. We believe that, as a result of consultation and recent events, it is important that that particular provision not be changed. We believe that the current provision, as it is, and the experience over the last 18 monthsparticularly since the change of government and since there has been discussion over amendments to the Native Title Act-have shown that to have someone of the stature of Justice French in that position has, from the opposition's point of view, added to the tribunal and add to the acceptance of the They tribunal by all stakeholders. The position in relation to section 110 was of put in the Attorney-General's Department outline of proposed amendments document in September 1995. It stated at page This section will be amended to broaden the qualification for appointment as presidential members to include persons who have been legally qualified for five years. There was no further justification of that. But I think it is important to put the qualifier, the purpose of the outline at page 2 of that paper of September 1995, on the record. It says: The following pages contain an outline of the proposed amendments in order to provide a basis for consultations on the proposals. It was not a final position of the former government. Indeed, further down in paragraph 7 on page 2 it says 'Although the bill has yet to be drafted'. So that position was put out in the public domain. The current president of the tribunal, Justice French, has a particular view, and his view was put openly in a discussion paper of 14 March 1995 on proposed changes to the Native Title Act. Justice French says: Under the proposed amendments the present organisational arrangements of the Tribunal would remain unchanged. The Registrar would continue to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Tribunal under the President and would maintain the Registers of Native Title Claims and Native Title Determinations. Then he goes on, and this is the relevant part: Having regard to the desirability of distinguishing the role of the Tribunal from that of a court, it would be appropriate that no serving Judges be involved in its ongoing work. This would also have the advantage of limiting the diversion of resources from the Federal Court which will, on any view, have a significant role in the hearing and determination of native title cases or substantive issues arising out of them. That was Justice French's view. Indeed, in submission No. 63 in August 1996 on section 110, Justice French says: This section as it presently stands sets out the categories of membership of the Tribunal and the qualifications for appointment to those categories. The amendment extends the qualifications of Presidential Members to include persons who have been legal practitioners for five years or more. The comment by Justice French is: The amendment is supported. It will provide greater flexibility in the appointment of Members to the Tribunal. But there was an opposing view put by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, in his report entitled The Native Title Report: July J995-June J996. That is in chapter 8 on page 188. In relation to the proposed amendment, the Social Justice Commissioner says: Currently, only judges of the Federal Court or former judges can be presidential members of the NNTT. The proposed amendment provides for lawyers with five years of experience to be eligible for appointment as presidential members. This proposal may undermine the standing of the NNTT. In the establishment and consolidation phase of a body with the significant and unusual functions of the NNTT, it is vital that it be perceived as credible and impartial. This perception would be undermined if the President and Deputy President of the NNTT were not required to have judicial experience. I therefore believe that the proposed amendment is inappropriate. That is a view that Mr Dodson put back then, and I believe that that view has been confirmed in recent months. I believe that having someone of the stature of Justice French as the presidential member has helped the debate. It has given stature to that position. It has also maintained a confidence in the tribunal that might otherwise be missing if it were not a Federal Court judge. I repeat that the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum fail to point out that former judges can be appointed to this position. I think that in the current climate it is important that that position be maintained. That is why in the consideration in detail stage of the debate I will be moving an amendment. The opposition will be supporting the other amendments in the amendment bill. We have had the benefit of further amendments that are proposed to be moved by the government being circulated to us and we will be supporting those amendments as well. I understand that there will be some disappointment on the government side, but there is a lot of misinformation about at the moment in relation to the tribunal, among other things, and there are a number substantial proposals that are certainly being considered as to whether the national body will be maintained in its present form or, indeed, whether we will have exclusive state bodies exercising a similar role. I have a particular view-it is not the concluded view of the Labor Party at this stage-that we are better off with the present structure. I believe in the uniformity of our system. I believe that what you need is a national overarch. I believe that the 1967 referendum says that the responsibility of this parliament is to protect indigenous people and to legislate in their interests. I think a national overarching body which will have uniformity is preferable. I want to see, with some amendments to make it work better, the tribunal remain as it is. I am not in favour-and I repeat that I am expressing a personal view here-of having eight different bodies under the auspices of particular state or territory governments. But that is another issue that will be debated at another time. There has been a very hysterical debate. We have had members of the coalition, one in particular in the other place, launching quite inappropriate attacks on the tribunal-quite personal attacks on the current president of the tribunal-and misrepresenting the situation. I think that particular member has got a problem because he is obviously looking for votes. I think Justice French has done an exemplary job, and that is to the credit of this government. We applaud what they did in extending his term of office so that he can be there while the amendments to the Native Title Act are being considered, and that gives continuity to the process. On this side of the House, we now believe that this recent experience adds to the position that we are taking, and that is that the tribunal really should remain the same. I do not believe that the tribunal will have as much credibility from the stakeholders themselves or from the community if it is someone who merely has been for at least five years enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a state or territory. I believe that the presidential member or the deputy president should be a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge. What can happen is that the Attorney General and the government can appoint someone from the Supreme Court. I know that Justice Mathews, for instance, was a District Court judge at one stage and then a judge of the New South Wales Supreme Court and then became a judge of the Federal Court. We think that adds to the stature of the tribunal and the acceptance of that tribunal. We do not believe it is a natural consequence of the Brandy High Court decision that you just have to take away or water down the current proposals. I think there are a number of other arguments that can also be used to support why the status quo should be maintained. In short, having someone who has that stature I think does send a signal of impartiality, integrity, authority and status to the tribunal that is sadly needed at this point in time. One of the arguments we had in relation to another bill was that as a result of a High Court decision the government is now proposing amendments to do with telephone intercepts where those warrants that are fairly intrusive should be able to be issued by members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We believe that sends the wrong message. In the current climate it seems to me that long standing principles are being changed. We do not believe this does take away from the resources of the Federal Court. We are not advocating that Justice French maintain his position in that office. The appointments are for five years. It is not just present judges; it is former judges. If there is a question about resources, you can get former justices of the High Court. I repeat the definition: a person who has been a justice of the High Court or a judge of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a state or territory. So there is not that limitation. This is about bringing and maintaining confidence in this system. I repeat-and I cannot repeat it enough-that it is the experience of the job Justice French has done in recent months that we believe confirms the view that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, has expressed in his reservations. That is why we put on the table the earlier positions of the outline paper and Justice French's position. We believe that they are legitimately held, but if this provision is expanded and the government goes the other way then I think that is going to create problems. We think it should remain the same. It also means that the person, even though it is not necessarily a judicial function, is possessed of relevant legal decision making skills. We have sought the advice of others. The preference, again as a result of recent experience, is that the tribunal remain the same. There is a fear that this will be used in effect to run another agenda. There is no evidence of that-none whatsoever, I might say-but that is the view, that is the fear and that is the misconception. Sure, it might give tlexibility, but we believe that the tlexibility of having former judges there is enough for this government in the current climate. In relation to the tlexibility of appointing acting registrars, we think the government has made out their case. Further amendments that are being proposed in relation to the experience that the acting registrar should have-it is worth reading those out-list the same qualifications as those for other members of the Native Title Tribunal. They state: (2) A person is not to be appointed as Registrar unless: (a) the person is enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; and (b) the person has substantial experience in relation to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander societies; or (ii) the law; or (iii) administration; or (iv) any other activities relevant to the duties of the Registrar. We believe those amendments improve on the present situation. They improve on the availability of persons to be appointed as Registrar and they send the right message. But in the current climate-and, frankly, given the current government's signals that seem to be going out-we believe that further expanding the qualification of a presidential member or a deputy president from a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge is inappropriate. We would be prepared to review this further down the track if the government deems that to be appropriate. But take heed from us on this. This is not something that we are trying to score party political points on. This debate is integrated with some substantial amendments that we will get the benefit of on Thursday. This government talks about workability and certainty, but it is all doublespeak. What is the good of having legislation that is unconstitutional and that might be struck down by the High Court? That is not going to provide certainty or workability for the miners or the farmers. What is the good of allowing mixed messages to go out into the community? There are criticisms of the member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson. I think she is entitled to her legitimate views. She should be attacked in relation to policy on moral grounds, but what we get is a special person set up in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we are told that it is bad for business in Asia. What sort of message does that send to our region? We should be attacking her and saying, 'Not only is she bad for business; what she is saying is wrong.' It is perception. That is the problem with this amendment. The perception is that you are watering down the status of this tribunal and you are watering down the status of the position at a time when all stakeholders require confidence in the system. The community requires confidence in the system. We believe that to water it down in the way that the government is now proposing at this time sends the wrong message. It leaves the tribunal open for further attack and further undermining. I believe the senator who attacked Justice French and the tribunal did themselves damage-not only because of the way Justice French handled himself but also because of his status. There was no doubt about his integrity. I think that came with his qualifications. I know the Attorney-General, who is sitting at the table, came out in defence of Justice French. A presidential member who might be appointed by this government and who is not a judge of the Federal Court or a former judge is open to attack from either side, from the stakeholders and from indigenous people saying, 'Why are we being treated as secondclass citizens? Why are you downgrading this particular position?' It is for that reason that we have changed an earlier view of the outline paper. I repeat that that outline paper was merely a discussion paper. It was as a result of research, talking to stakeholders and looking at what Mick Dodson said in his report-that is, the situation had been reviewed. If there is a situation in relation to urgency on the registrar, we are happy if the government wants to sever the bill, because the amendment I will move is a very small amendment that takes away that part in relation to a presidential member. If the Attorney-General wants to expedite the bill in relation to the amendments on the registrar, we think that is stuff that can be expedited. It improves the situation and gives further tlexibility. We say to you: think again. Take on board what we are saying. We are doing it because this is a difficult time. There are genuine views held on both sides of the House. But, on this issue, we believe the qualifications of the current presidential member has served the tribunal well. He has given credibility to the system. I think it would have been a lot worse if it had not been someone like Justice French with his position, his good sense, his integrity, his impartiality and his experience. Without all of that, the tribunal would have been in a worse situation in terms of the confidence of all the stakeholders. For that reason, when it comes to the consideration in detail stage, I foreshadow that I will be moving the following amendment: Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (lines 1-8), omit the item. We will divide on that amendment because we are serious about it. I wait to hear what the member for Swan (Mr Randall) has to say on this matter. This will be debated in the spirit of what is best for the tribunal. As I say, we think the case on the registrar has been made out substantially by the government. We are prepared to accommodate them if they want to sever the bill so that it is not locked up in the Senate, although I do not know that it will be getting great priority in the Senate if it goes through in its present form. With that, I commend the amendment that we will be moving to the government because we believe it is the right choice to make at this time in what is a very difficult debate, and it is only going to get more difficult.",92
180,Mr RANDALL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I inform the member for Banks (Mr Melham) that I certainly will be conducting my comments on the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 in the same reasoned manner that he did. I would like to comment very brietly on some aspects of the bill and its administration. The Native Title Tribunal has its principal office in Western Australia, which is a very appropriate place in light of the significance of native title to our state. I would like to make a few preliminary comments before I get on to the nub of the comments that the member for Banks made. It is helpful that the tribunal is located very close to the people who are probably most affected by the operation of the act, given that approximately 80 per cent of Western Australia is currently under claim. I will talk later, though, about the significance of the act to the wider Australian community because I am very aware that this is not an issue just affecting my state. As I said, I want to make a few comments about the administration of the act and the tribunal which this bill addresses. The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997will remove the current stipulations of the Registrar of the Native Title Tribunal by relaxing the criteria by which the registrar can be appointed, and we know that. This will be opened up to attract a far wider selection of appropriately qualified people which the shadow minister, the member for Banks, has already said he agrees with. This relaxation of the criteria is retlective, I believe, of several aspects of the Native Title Act. Firstly, the government's amendments to the Native Title Act are designed to simplify the act. It is important to note that we want to simplify it and make it clearer and more workable. The coalition's 10-point plan and the amendments to the act will bring long overdue changes, which we intend to introduce this Thursday. Secondly, and importantly, the role of the Native Title Tribunal will change with these amendments. The tribunal's role, after a few initial years of operation, has necessarily changed and evolved, and so have the roles of its administrators. Proposed amendments to the Native Title Act will significantly alter the role of the registrar as far as they will no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted. The amendments provide that applications for native title or compensation determinations will be made directly to the Federal Court. Proposed amendments will see an increased focus on the registration test and, in the context of the duties of the registrar, it is timely to allow the position to be held by someone with a very hands-on, administrative approach rather than an academic or legal approach. In the National Native Title Tribunal annual report 1993-94, the changing administrative objectives were acknowledged, and it said: ... many of its administrative objectives to be worked out through a process of consultation and planning over the next six months ... Clearly, some aspects have taken longer than six months, but we are facilitating this process of change now with these amendments. Banks Although the registrar will no longer be required to have been admitted to legal practice for five years, with this bill there still be sensible and reasonable criteria for position. One of the problems with the current legislation is that it does not necessarily attract people who are actually practising they only have to be able to be, not actually, practising law. So, in effect, it is precluding other people because of the wording of the requirements. I believe the intent of this Smith). aspect of the act is to have someone who is actually practising-not someone who is well simply able to be practising and who, therejust fore, is not. There may be some concern with this bill that the presidential appointments will be hand up. downgraded, which the member for Banks has alluded to, but that is not the case, It is, as I said earlier, simply a reflection of the changing and evolving role and the will requirements of the Native Title Tribunal. The role of the registrar over the current period has evolved into a much more adminisAboriginal trative role than previously conceived. The tribunal now acts principally as a mediation service to help indigenous people make native title agreements with governments, industry and other people whose rights or interests may co-exist with native title rights and interests. The tribunal is not a court and has no power to call evidence or make judicial decisions about whether native title exists. I am not disputing the value that an extensive legal background would bring to this role, but the tribunal has no power to call evidence or make judicial decisions. Clearly, there are a great many people who would be suitably qualified in mediation, arbitration and administration, particularly with relevant experience in indigenous issues or in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. These people should not be precluded from making a significant contribution to the tribunal and will need to the administration of the act. I point out to the member for Banks and others opposite that they would be suitably qualified under this current criteria. In fact, the legal qualifications of the member for and his interest and obvious qualifications in his current role would make him a suitable applicant for both the presidential will position and the registrar's position. So, this effectively, he is trying to rule himself and other suitably qualified legal people from the opposition out of a job. Those people may well include the member for Holt (Mr Gareth law; Evans), the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), Senator Nick Bolkus, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), Senator Neal and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen There are a number of people who could be qualified for this position, and they are ruling themselves out of a job. I am sure they would be more qualified than some of the judges they are hoping might put their",96
181,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,I'll stick to being an advoI believe. cate; I'm happier with that.,97
182,Mr RANDALL,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Right, thank you. There still be a requirement for the registrar to be legally qualified. They will be required to have substantial experience in relation to and Torres Strait Islander societies. The boundaries will be widened to include the relevant duties as they evolve of the registrar. This amendment also brings the criteria, or qualification provisions, in line with the appointment of registrars in other federal courts and tribunals. I point this out because this is bringing consistency to these types of appointments. It happens in other arenas. Why should it not happen in this federal jurisdiction? The administration criteria for the presidential members of the Native Title Tribunal are also proposed to be relaxed, as we have already found out, under this amendment and in a similar manner to that of the registrar. Under existing legislation a presidential member-that is, the president or the vicenecessary presidents of the tribunal-must have been Federal Court judge, a High Court judge, state or territory Supreme Court judge or, the member opposite said, a former judge. This amendment proposes to expand eligibility to anyone who has been admitted as a legal practitioner for five years or in Australia. Naturally, by removing this requirement to be a judge or former judge, the amendment clearly introduces a far greater pool of suitaba ly qualified candidates for this tribunal position tion. In fact, the aim of this amendment provide for the appointment of the best person for the job. There are fewer judges with organisation extensive experience in native title matters than there are barristers and solicitors, numbers with experience in this area are tribunal continuing to increase. Justice Robert French-who, I might add, defended me when he was an articled clerk many years ago on a minor traffic infringemade ment; and I do agree that he is a fine man-is to be commended for the role he has played as President of the National Native Title Tribunal, for the experience he has brought mediation, land management and Aboriginal issues, as well as for his impressive legal background. He has also brought experience gained from his chairmanship of the Aborigian nal Legal Service some years ago. But it is my understanding, unless somebody corrects me, that Justice French feels he has been politicised somewhat by this position, and that registrar. goes with the territory in this job. It is not everybody who would want it, in other words. While acknowledging the significance of the Native Title Act in Western Australia, it has to be said that it is a national issue and one which all Australians have to come to grips with to properly develop ways to resolve conflicts caused by the issue. This is a sentiment reflected by the majority of Australians. Australians have to realise that they are affected by the Native Title Act. As I have said in this place before, it is not just an issue for pastoralists and miners; it is an issue for people in the metropolitan area also. It is important that the Native Title Act is consistently reviewed and amended where in line with changing requirements a and changing times. This assists in the proa cess of giving people confidence in the act as and the issues contained in it-which, unfortunately, often cause a lot of suspicion and the division in the community. Another aspect contained in this amendment more addresses the issue of providing a more transparent act for the Australian people by providing further clarification of when a member of the tribunal is considered to have conflict of interest in relation to an applicaor inquiry before the tribunal. It is prois to posed that where members are, or were, employed by or engaged as a consultant to an that has an interest in native title applications those members are not eligible to whose participate in any proceedings before the in relation to the relevant application unless the parties agree. Having discussed the role of the registrar, I would like to acknowledge the contribution by Ms Patricia Lane, the first permanent Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal. Ms Patricia Lane brought considerable expertise to the tribunal. Before taking the in position of registrar, Ms Lane-who holds a Master of Laws degree-was the Senior Deputy Registrar of the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney. She has also worked as associate to judges of the court, as a researcher in the law courts library and as a lecturer and tutor at the University of Sydney-an eminently qualified person as the It is widely acknowledged that Ms Lane has done an exemplary job of setting up the administrative framework for the National Native Title Tribunal, and it is to her credit that she leaves the position in a manner clear of controversy. In light of the particularly controversial nature of native title issues as a whole, this has been quite remarkable on her behalf. As of this month, 1,383 applications have been lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal. Of those, 596 were claimant cants; 128 were non-claimant applications, that is, applications seeking a determination that native title does not exist; 471 were objection applications, that is, applications indigenous people who have applied for recognition of native title on an area listed the government as attracting expedited prois cedure for mining or exploration as set out the Native Title Act 1993; 179 applications; and just nine were compensation applications. This amendment also seeks to amend a flaw in the existing legislation which currently prevents the president from appointing an acting registrar in the event of an untimely departure of the registrar. I am pleased that the member for Banks has no problem with that. Presently, the appointment of a registrar or acting registrar is the province of the Governor General, but any vacancy of the registrar's position would impede of the tribunal, which, it has to be said, cannot afford further delays due to the sensitive nature of native title claims. In conclusion, I must make a number of observations. Naturally, the registrar's criteria are relaxed and, when they are relaxed, the position is opened up and presents an opporto tunity for a wide range of suitably qualified people. The presidential member's criteria are also relaxed and the position is therefore opened up to a greater range of people with unabated. expertise-not the narrow focus that it currently contains. I must take some exception, in a nice way, to a number of points made by the member this for Banks. I do not accept his suggestion the status of the tribunal president is eroded by not appointing someone of Justice debate French's qualifications. There are many people-including the member for Bankswho would be eminently qualified. I find it a little alarming that Mr Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner, seems to be the one driving the policy from the Labor Party's point of view. In fact, as the member opposite has already said, the ALP did have an outline paper which was quite different to this, and the main reason the member seems applito be advocating a change-and I know he will not agree with me-is that Mr Dodson has had a word to him. I do not think policies should be driven by Mick Dodson. I do not by believe there would be a perception of a downgrading of the position. The framework by is now in place and is running well, and there a fair and wider field of applicants who in could apply for this position because of its were future act evolving nature. In reference to a point made by the member for Banks, I do not believe there is a wider agenda. I believe that most people who would view these appointments would say that time has moved on since their initial construction and it is about time this process was just as transparent as it was before. The perception would be that more people are being given an opportunity. The amendment addresses the issue of a conflict of interest as well as the provision for a president to appoint the acting registrar, which we have said addresses the the progress problem of continuity. I believe that we have a number of points of agreement, but I must confirm again that I cannot agree with the fact that the status of the president is seen to be eroded for the wrong reasons or the wrong agendas. The legislation is simply allowing the right person be appointed. This position may grow after the 10-point plan is introduced into the House this Thursday. I ask members opposite to give it a go and allow the process to continue",97
183,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"in reply-I rise to close the debate on rather short bill, the Native Title Amend that ment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997, which seems to have generated more than its length warrants. As foreshadowed by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) and the member for Swan (Mr Randall), there are government amendments to be proposed. Since there is only one issue of contention between the government and the opposition, which I will address, it may be appropriate if I mention briefly the uncontentious amendments that I will deal with when the House considers the bill in detail. The amendments the government will move will alter the provisions for the qualification of the registrar of the tribunal and will amend the conflict of interest provision in the Native Title Act to give further clarification on when a member of the tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest in relation to a particular application before the tribunal. The proposed changes to the native title regime in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996to be introduced into this House in the near future will alter the role of the registrar. Those amendments will provide, as foreshadowed in the 1995 bill of the previous government, that applications for native title or compensation will be made directly to the Federal Court. The registrar will therefore no longer have any role in deciding whether or not applications should be accepted, and it is appropriate that qualifications for appointment should therefore be changed. The first amendment removes the requirement that the registrar be admitted to legal practice for five years and replaces it with a requirement that a person be legally qualified and have substantial experience in relation to: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies, or the law, or administration, or any other class of activities considered relevant to the duties of the registrar. The proposed amendment, as speakers have indicated, will ensure that a more diverse field of suitably qualified candidates may be considered for the position of registrar of the tribunal. The second proposed amendment is a consequential amendment. The third amendment provides further clarification of when a member of the tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest in relation to an application or inquiry before the tribunal. The amendment relates to majority recommendation 9 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund in its report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996. That recommendation considered the possibility of a conflict of interest where members of the tribunal may be conducting consultancies in native title matters. This provision addresses the concerns of the committee that members of the tribunal are impartial and are seen to be impartial, but it is flexible enough to allow people experienced in native title matters to continue to be appointed to the tribunal. It may be convenient at this point to hand up a copy of the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments. The principal matter to which I wish to invite attention is the issue raised by the member for Banks on behalf of the opposition. I thank members who have participated in the debate: the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) who, in the absence on Thursday of the member for Banks, was able to speak second on the bill; and the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), who stepped in for a brief cameo performance. It was not until today that we actually had the pleasure of hearing the formal opposition put by the member for Banks. There seemed to be an element of personal view involved in what was put to the House by that member. The member for Banks is arguing that the position of president of the tribunal will be downgraded and that the tribunal itself will be downgraded or 'watered down' - to use another expression he used-if the amendment proposed in the original bill relating to the qualifications for the position of president is passed. The member for Banks was right to acknowledge that this is a change of an earlier position. He referred to a position paper put out by the Keating Labor government in 1995 and sought to highlight that this was only a proposal for public debate. What might have been added by the member for Banks was that the 1995 bill that was introduced by the previous government did follow up on that amendment and did propose exactly what the present government is proposing. The member for Banks made something of the views of Justice French. I have discussed this matter with Justice French on occasions over some considerable time. He explained that initially the very name of the tribunalthe National Native Title Tribunal-led to misapprehension, particularly on the part of native title claimants. They had a belief that native title could in effect be awarded by the tribunal. That was not what was contemplated under the initial act, and it certainly is not what is contemplated under the amendments the government has foreshadowed. As a result of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case, the previous government was obliged to amend the Native Title Act in order to ensure that there was no breach of the principles in that decision that the tribunal should not exercise judicial power. That in itself would have significantly changed the role of the tribunal from being one where determinations were possible to one where its principal role was mediation. I think Justice French was right to highlight, as he did in his discussions with me, that the role of the tribunal is not necessarily reflected in the name, particularly post Brandy. Equally, it might be added in this context that since the Brandy decision there have been other decisions of the High Court relevant in defining the role of the tribunal. The decision of the High Court in Wilson and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has focused attention on what judges of federal courts can and cannot do outside the work they actually do in their courts. The High Court has laid down what is referred to as the 'incompatibility condition', under which chapter III of the constitution requires that judges not be required to do things incompatible with their position of independence and, equally, that they do not have thrust upon them roles in relation to the court itself of which they are a member that are inconsistent with the impartial and objective fulfilment of the judicial role. In this case, the future of the National Native Title Tribunal is not in making determinations; it is in conducting mediation. Mediation is not a judicial function. On that basis, it is unnecessary that the president or a presidential member be a judge. The argument put by the member for Banks and the opposition for maintaining a judicial involvement is in essence a very simple one. It is simply to add some status and give an appearance of independence. I do not think that is necessary. If one looks at the members who constitute the tribunal, there is, for example, a former member of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the Hon. Paul Seaman. Other persons on the tribunal have held high public office: the Hon. Fred Chaney was a former minister in the Commonwealth government and the Hon. Chris Sumner was a former Attorney-General in the South Australian government. They add some standing to the tribunal, as would anybody with appropriate qualifications. In our view, the fact that somebody has the title 'Justice' - which they would not be exercising in acting in a presidential role in relation to the tribunal-is not enough of an argument to warrant using the scarce judicial resources of the federal court or whatever court is involved. The member for Banks has expressed his confidence in Justice French, as has the member for Swan. In my view, that confidence is very rightly placed. Justice French has done an excellent job as the inaugural president. He has, by dint of his skills rather than his status, achieved a lot for the tribunal. He has also presided over a tribunal whose role has significantly changed from that envisaged in 1993, and it has changed even while he has been the occupant of the office. It will significantly change again if and when the proposed changes under the forthcoming 1997 bill come into operation. The member for Banks applauded the government's extension of the term of office of Justice French. It is appropriate to say that the government is grateful to Justice French for accepting an extension of time because it has enabled the consultation process in relation to the Wik bill to be completed without any significant disruption of the work of the tribunal. Justice French has laid the groundwork for his successor, but his successor does not have to be a judge or even a former judge; he has to be an appropriate person who has requisite managerial and administrative skills, decision making skills and the requisite legal knowledge. In the government's view, the sort of person who can properly perform the functions of the president in that context need not necessarily be a judge. That is not to say that the amendments are excluding judges from consideration. They are just adding a further category of potential member who can be appointed. The government will seek to appoint the right person for the job. I commend the bill, subject to government amendments, to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. Amendments (by Mr Williams)-by leave-agreed to: (1) Schedule 1, page 3 (before line 5), before item 1, insert: lA Subsection 95(3) Repeal the subsection, substitute: (3) A person is not to be appointed as Registrar unless: (a) the person is enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court a State or Territory; and (b) the person has substantial experience in relation to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander societies; or (ii) the law; or (iii) administration; or (iv) any other activities relevant to the duties of the Registrar. (2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 17 to 20), omit subsection (2), substitute: Qualifications (2) A person is not to be appointed to act as Registrar unless: (a) the person is enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court a State or Territory; and (b) the person has substantial experience in relation to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander societies; or (ii) the law; or (iii) administration; or (iv) any other activities relevant to the duties of the Registrar.",99
184,Mr MELHAM,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I move: Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (lines 1-8), omit the item. I will not go over all the points I made during the second reading debate. The purpose of the amendment is to leave the appointment of the presidential member in particular the same. We think it has worked well. I want to make a couple of points arising out of what the Attorney-General (Mr WilIiams) said in closing the debate. It is pretty obvious from the comments the minister made that the reason this extra qualification is being added is that the government-this is more probable than not-is going to appoint someone who is not a judge of the Federal Court or not a former judge. The Attorney-General mentioned the High Court case of Wilson. This position is not incompatible with judicial office; Wilson does not say that in relation to this position. The of government is maintaining that it can still appoint a judge or a former judge. By maintaining the current qualifications, I think we can dismiss the inference that this current position is not compatible with judicial office. It is, because the qualifications still remain that the government can appoint a judge or a former judge. The fact is that the tribunal conducts mediation. We believe that mediation would be assisted by having a judge or a former judge in this position. I do not want to go over the old arguments. However, our reservation-that this is really a backdoor method of basically the next presidential member not being a judge or a former judge-has been confirmed by the comments made by the of minister in closing the debate, and that is what we disagree with. I assure the member for Swan (Mr Randall) that I have not spoken to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner on this matter, but I do rely on the arguments that he put forward. We are not running his agenda. We have researched the different arguments. As I quite properly put, this is a change from our earlier position in the outline paper which, I acknowledge, the former government put in amendments. What we do say is that the current experience-the current performance-of Justice French, with those attacks on the tribunal and the current debate, has confirmed the view we are putting in this amendment: that is, it is in the interests of all stakeholders in terms of credibility and of assisting in the mediation process for the qualifications to remain the same. There is not much more that I can add. The dividing lines are there. As a result of what the minister said in closing the debate, I suspect that if this amendment does go through and passes the Senate, then we will have someone other than a judge or a former judge being appointed. We just think that will be a mistake. I commend our amendment because it is not incompatible. That is why the government is maintaining the current qualifications. We think it is the proper way to go. We are prepared to sever the bill in terms of the registrar because that case has been made out. As I offered in the second reading debate, we can have another look at this down the track, if you want, but at the moment we think we should keep it with the status quo. In all honesty, the reason is that we do not take the government on trust. We believe that this is a backdoor way of basically downgrading the position. We do not believe the government has any intention of appointing a judge or a former judge. I commend my amendment to the House.",102
185,Mr WILLIAMS,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"I will respond very briefly. I mentioned the Wilson case. I am not arguing that there is a total incompatibility, what I am pointing to is a trend. It is a trend that I think is appropriate-that judges be confined to acting as judges and not be given every other job that someone wants to add stature to. You are using judges for the wrong purpose. It is hard enough to get the right people to act in what is a very difficult and skilled role, without finding them placed in positions where other people are quite appropriate and can do the job. In my submission, the opposition really has not made out a case for the amendment at all. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Melham's) be agreed to. The House divided.

NOES Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Williams)-by leave-read a third time. NA BILL (No.2) 1997 [No.2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion  That the bill be now read a second time.",103
186,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I Ronaldson, M. J. C. understand that the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 [No.2] is an omnibus bill and has a number of components. We are not proposing to oppose any of them, except the fifth component, which is the section relating to the sugar tariff. When discussion on this bill is completed, I intend to seek that the vote be taken on the first four components of it as a collective and that the sugar component of it be dealt with as a specific item. PAIRS Having said that, let me outline the reason for taking this position. Prior to the winter break, we had quite some debate in this House about the government's move to remove the sugar tariffs without, we believe, appropriate consultation, in breach of an undertaking to the constituency and at great risk to the future of the sugar industry, particularly to producers in the sugar industry. We made it clear at all times that we believed there was no good reason for this. We believed that the industry had a solid regime in place. It was consistent with the agreements that Australia had made internationally under the GAIT arrangements and the Uruguay Round. In fact, we demonstrated time very amply in discussion that a number of gains had been made in the sugar industry during the regime that was in place following the adjustments to the industry made by the former government. Most surprisingly, the then opposition campaigned strongly within the sugar industry that they would leave this tariff regime in place. If I remember correctly, it was the 'no ifs, no buts' statement from Tim Fischer, the member for Farrer and now the Deputy Prime Minister. He made that statement very clearly. Mr Fitzgibbon-It was not a core promise.",104
187,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It was not a core promise, no. Down the coast from Far North Queensland, through North Queensland to northern New South Wales there are deeply betrayed sugar producers. They were told one thing by the people who are now in government when campaigning, but have seen them do another thing in the House. We did attempt to bring this measure forward earlier. We found a number of government members up to all sorts of antics to avoid at the time being pinned down on their actual vote. I remember a couple of them saying to us, 'Wait until we have the proper vote, then we will be able to show where we really are.' Here is another opportunity now. During the winter break, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission approved a merger between CSR and Mackay refineries. I make it very clear that we are very comfortable with and are in support of that measure. It is something which we sought the approval of the commission for during our time in office. In the decision relating to the approval of that merger, the commission does make note of the fact that the sugar tariff was removed from 1 July. It has noted that as a change in the arrangements which operate in the Australian economy. It was one of the factors which it took into account. In opposing this legislation, I am saying to the House that we have seen the basis of the ACCC's decision. We have noted that, while it was a matter which was taken note of, it was not something upon which the ACCC made conditional their approval of the merger. Therefore, we do not accept the claim which will inevitably come from the other side that, by continuing to seek to overturn the decision to scrap the sugar tariff, we are in some way or other putting at risk the merger that has been approved. We do not accept that argument. We know very well that the ACCC was well aware of our pOSitIOn and took our position into account when making that decision. What are we doing? We are seeking in this House to overturn or-to use the technical term-to not give validation to the decision that was made by the government and the regulation which pertains from that. The government is required, as it is now doing, to bring this forward and to win the approval of this House and those in the other place. We make it very clear that we have not changed our position. The arguments have not changed. Let me summarise again the arguments which were used at the time and which are equally valid now. There is no need to reduce the sugar tariff below $55 per tonne, which operated at 30 June. The removal of that tariff from 1 July simply amounts to a loss of income for producers in the industry. It was in breach of plans upon which investment in the industry have been made since the regime was put in place. I know a number of members on the other side have made the point that they do not expect the major users of refined sugar in Australia-Coca-Cola Amatil and others-to suddenly take this windfall gain in their domestic purchase price and pass it on to the consumer. That is what is supposed to happen in theory, but we will all be watching to see. It is very clear that there was no need to scrap that tariff and that there was no need to break the undertaking. I go back to the words of the Deputy Prime Minister when he said 'no ifs, no buts' on this. Not only were there no ifs and no buts, there is now no tariff. Mr Martin Ferguson-And no leadership.",105
188,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"And no leadership, as my colleague the member for Batman points out. I noticed at the time that there was a statement which I guess sums up this question of leadership and the sense of 'betrayal in the bush', a term that those who are now in government used to wander around talking about when they were in opposition. I have seen the effects of the decisions they have been taking in rural Australia. Do not take my word for it, take the word of someone like David Crawford, the deputy manager of the Australian Cane Farmers Association. In the Pyramid News, which is a local newspaper published in the Far North Queensland region, he said: The lack of support for people on the land shown by the political partiesby that he means the governmentis making the bush into a series of ghost towns. If the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr John Anderson), who is at the table, think Mr Crawford means us, then he is badly mistaken, because Mr Crawford has made it very clear who he is talking about. He is talking about you and your crew, who broke this undertaking that you gave those in rural Australia in the lead-up to the election that you would not withdraw the sugar tariff. Then we had the rather curious episode of why you actually did this. I remember distinctly the interview-I think on the PM program-in which the minister at the table said, 'Oh well, they asked for it.' When pressed on what he meant he said, 'They came along and asked to have their tariff removed.' It is interesting to quote his words here. When asked, 'Why did you break the promise?'-this is after promising that they would not remove the tariff-he said: We were not able to foresee a circumstances in which the industry would come to us. I suppose he will explain later that the industry review that was carried out recommended that the tariff be scrapped. That was recommended on the basis of a whole lot of assumptions, very few of which have since been carried through. There is a very deep sense of aggrievement now. For instance, those sugar cane farmers were promised that, if they went along with their tariff removal, they would be setting the example for the rapid restructure of the Australian economy, because the car tariffs were going to be removed. Mr Martin Ferguson-They lost that one.",105
189,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The textile tariffs were going to be removed. They are going to lose that one. Those opposite are already caving in on that. One member opposite was quite funny here today during the 90 second statements. That member was trying to say, in the nicest of words, 'What on earth are we on about with this removal of textile tariffs?', but was not quite able to say that. There are a whole lot of very uncomfortable government members. Why are members opposite, particularly those who claim to be representing the farm sector, taking such a terrible hiding in the cabinet? Let us go back to the words of the member for Murray (Mrs Stone). The member for Murray was recently featured as a panel member on a program on the ABC which I think is called the Wednesday First program. Mr Anderson-First Wednesday.",106
190,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It is the First Wednesday program. The minister who is at the table, Minister Anderson, was being grilled by the panel about what is happening in rural Australia-why there is this sense of betrayal, what is happening to our country towns, why they are being turned into ghost towns, why they lose at the cabinet table. Out came the member for Murray, who said, 'You have got to understand that there is an A team and a B team.' Mr Fitzgibbon-Tell us what she said about the former member for Murray.",106
191,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"She was talking with respect to the former member for Murray as well, who was Deputy Leader of the National Party in his time here, and was proudly defending the National Party. She was saying that there is an A team and a B team. She is a member of the Liberal Party, who in preselection battle pinched the seat of Murray off the National Party, and they are still smarting about that. There she is, as the Liberal member for Murray, proudly announcingMrs De-Anne KeUy- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. This has got nothing to do with the debate or the bill before the House.",106
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I thank the honourable member. The honourable member for Burke will, of course, be relevant.",106
193,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Absolutely. I am addressing the bill, alright, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is with respect to how we have a situation where a rock solid-no ifs, no buts-guarantee was given to the farm sector, particularly the sugar sector, prior to the election by the then opposition, now government, and in particular by people such as the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, National Party B team, and by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, National Party B team. Mr Martin-What did Larry Anthony say?",106
194,Mr OKEEFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The question is raised about the member for Richmond, Mr Anthony. He signed up the declaration on sugar tariffs. It says: NA That the continued prosperity of the sugar industry is paramount to the fortunes of the nation. Accordingly, we as national party politiciansthat is, the B teamersfight to resist the removal of this sugar tariff. This will be yet another chance for them to resist this measure. I give full credit to the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) because he had the courage of his convictions. He was the only one. When the first vote was taken and he had to stand up and be counted he was there. Now we are going to see what this declaration means to the member for Richmond and the rest of the members of the B team-the team that loses. The thing about the member for Murray is that she was very honest about how this came about. It is clearly the case that this does not deal with just sugar. I will not go into all the other issues because I am sure I would be pulled up on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I started to go through the long list of B team losses at the cabinet table. Where do we go from here? We are providing yet another opportunity for those government members who have been purporting to stand up for the sugar industry and sugar producers to have their vote. We are very confident that the proposal will be rejected in the other place and that the tariffs will be reinstated. Mr Anderson-It would have been different had you been in government, wouldn't it?",107
195,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"The minister at the table interjected that it would have been different had we been in government. You are absolutely right. This is one thing we agree on. We do not agree on everything, Minister, but here is one thing we do agree on. We put this regime in place. We signed up for $55 at GAIT. You wandered around promising that you would leave that $55 in place. Your members know that there is no explanation that you can give as to why you have done this. You may have traded the sugar industry off for something else in trade negotiations that we are yet to find out about. I suspect that they may find that that is the case. It will all come out because somebody will blab, 'We got this. We were told this by Mr Fischer or Mr Anderson. We learned that we got this because they missed out.' I suspect that is what will really come out here. You either traded the sugar off for something else or you convinced the sugar industry that if they would be the bunnies, if they would agree to your drive to remove tariffs it would set the example for everybody elsemost particularly, the car and textile industries. Everywhere across rural Australia they are talking about the undertakings you gave with regard to car tariffs and the decision that you took which ratted on those undertakings. I happen to think that the decision on the tariffs for the car industry was very good. It was Labor's plan, you adopted it and it gives the car industry a strong future. Last week, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was in here actually claiming credit for that and talking about the wonderful things that will come from that decision. I have no doubt that the same sort of decision will flow through in the textile industry. The A team backbenchers in this chamber are getting up and making statements on behalf of the textile industry, fighting the case to keep the tariffs and lining up to support Labor's textile tariff plan-I think that is wonderful; that is the way it will turn out. But who is being ratted on? It is the poor old B team again. The B team is out there asking their industry to set the example. This issue should have been finally resolved prior to 30 June. The industry should have known exactly where members would be lining up in both houses. It was not as though this were any great secret. In an article in the Bulletin on 17 June, Laurie Oakes made a very clear statement that this is not just a sugar tariff issue, it is an important political issue for government. His words were, 'The sugar seats are not to be sneezed at.' He then went on to outline that these are in fact significant seats politically to the coalition. They are significant to us and of course they have been a major focus. Laurie Oakes said that it is not surprising that they are in trouble. He went on to say: Howard, Anderson and their colleagues use the defence that the sugar industry in Queensland wanted the tariff to go. You do not have to take my word for it, you can take his word for it: That is simply untrue. The industry was mugged Mr O'Connor-Mugged by mugs.",107
196,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,The B team was mugged. Mr Anthony interjecting,108
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WE DECLARE,"Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Richmond, a little less passion, thank you.",108
198,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"In the end the member for Murray will carry the odium within the government for actually coming out and publicly stating what is painfully obvious to everyone and that is that, at the cabinet table, the people representing the primary sector just cannot take a trick and have continued to lose as they have moved on. In summary, as I said at the outset, we are comfortable in giving passage to the other components of this tariff amendment bill. We are happy for the first four components to be considered collectivelyMr MCGauran-You are not finishing, are you?",108
199,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"I may not. Would you like me to keep going? Mr MCGauran-He is running out of things to say. Come on, you have eight minutes to go.",108
200,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"We are happy to give passage to the first four components collectively, but we will be seekingMr MCGauran interjecting",108
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WE DECLARE,Order! The Minister for Science and Technology will restrain himself.,108
202,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"We will be seeking to have the vote on the sugar component of the tariff bill considered separately because, to put it simply, we believe that the scrapping of the sugar tariff was a direct breach of an election commitment to the sugar industry. We believe that it will cost jobs and it will lead to millions of dollars of lost revenue in the industry. Not only do we believe that, but so too do a number of members of the government. We not only have the member for Richmond, Mr Anthony, signing up the declaration with Senator O'Chee and others, but also we have had the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, proposing all around her territory how she would she be in here fighting against this vote. But what happened when the vote was on? She scampered out the door. Go and read the Hansard-she was not here. But for this matter she was here; she was right here in the chamber asking someone, 'What is this vote all about?' When she found out it was the sugar vote she scampered to the front door. She did not want to be pinned down on behalf of her constituents.",108
203,Mr ANTHONY,WE DECLARE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, can you get the A-team in?",108
204,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,Thai is not even B-team stuff. If you are going to be here you have got to at least have your vote. So we are seeking to reinstate the $55 tariff from 1 July. Mr Anderson-You don't want the merger.,108
205,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"If you had been in the chamber you would have heard what I said. We anticipated the fact that you would raise the merger. I have already made the point that when you read the finding of the commission in relation to the merger they make the point that they have taken account of the removal of the sugar tariff as a condition, but they have not made it a condition.",108
206,Mr ANTHONY,WE DECLARE,Have you actually read it?,108
207,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,Absolutely. I have read it.,108
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WE DECLARE,The member for Richmond does not have the call. He will be quiet.,108
209,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"I make the point that the ACCC knows our position very well and that is why you will note, when you read it, that it is not a condition of the merger. If we to be successful in the other place-we understand that we will not be here-in overturning this regulation, then I believe that the merger will stay in place because the other matters that are conditions of the merger are still perfectly valid. As I said, we will be taking that position for those reasons. I do not think it is unreasonable to state all that this industry has been unfairly sured. They were also told that they were faced with the choice of a having a single desk or keeping the tariff. Mr Anthony interjecting",108
210,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WE DECLARE,I warn the want honourable member for Richmond.,109
211,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"That was not a requirethe ment of any agreements anywhere. It has become painfully obvious that the industry can have whatever marketing arrangement wants that meets the WTO and GATT rules and the government will facilitate it within those rules, as would we. There was no need to pressure this industry into believing that it was either the tariff or the single desk. Of course, what is emerging now is that single desk meant Queensland operated single desk, and we are starting to find from some other components of the industry that that is not what they thought. It may well be that this industry will not even finish up operating under a single desk, as the minister knows very well. What is going to happen then? They will have lost both the tariff and the Abbott, A. 1. single desk. Mr Leo MCLeay-What did Laurie Oakes say?",109
212,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"What did Laurie Oakes say? I said that before, Mr Whip, but I will tell themMr Crean-That they were mugged.",109
213,Mr OKEEFE,WE DECLARE,"They were mugged by the B-team, which was in tum mugged by the Ateam. For that range of reasons, why would you take this pay cut? Why would you voluntarily, as the minister said in his interview on PM, come along and ask for a pay cut? Why would you come along and ask for a pay cut if you had not been pressured into doing so? are On the basis of those arguments it is a direct breach and a no ifs, no buts undertaking. That was the statement that was made. The industry was, in fact, misled into believing that it had to have one or the other-a tariff or a single desk. The industry was misled about the nature of the regime and the fact that the $55 tariff that was in place at was perfectly acceptable to remain in place presunder our international obligations. We have had a range of members from the other side making all sorts of public pronouncements about what their position would be on this. Laurie Oakes did sum it up absolutely beautifully when he said that the industry did not the tariff to go; it was mugged. For all those reasons I think I have probably reached point of explaining why we are intending to seek that vote and I reiterate to the House that this particular component of the Customs it Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 will be opposed by this side of this House. Motion (by Mr MCGauran) put: That the debate be now adjourned. The House divided. [10.27 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B.

The following answers to questions were circulated: International Conferences (Question No. 577) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What conferences have been organised in (a) Geneva, (b) Paris and (c) Vienna in 1996 by the (i) UN, (ii) UN specialised agencies of which Australia is a member, (iii) international governmental organisations to which Australia belongs and (iv) international non-governmental organisations to which Australian organisations are known to belong. (2) Which of the conferences referred to in part (1) have been, or will be, attended by Australian delegations at the expense of the Commonwealth. (3) Which of the conferences referred to in part (2) have been, or will be, attended by (a) Ministers, (b) other Members of Parliament, (c) officials and (d) other advisers. (4) What are the names of the persons referred to in part (3) and what was, or will be, the cost of each person's (a) fares, (b) accommodation and (c) allowances. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Conferences and meetings organised by the UN, its Specialised Agencies and various subbodies in Geneva, Paris and Vienna are published Geneva: Paris: Vienna: From 1 January to 30 June 1997, Geneva: Paris: Vienna: NA in the Calendar of Conferences and Meetings by the Office of Conference and Support Services of the United Nations. Copies of the Calendar published on 1 January 1996 and 1 January 1997 are available in the Parliamentary Library. The Calendar (for the current year) is also available on the Internet (http://www.un.org/Conferences/Calendar/). The honourable member will note that more than 100 conferences and meetings were scheduled to be held in these cities during each of these years. No comprehensive information is readily available on other sorts of international meetings held in the same cities during 1996 and 1997. (2) and (3) The conferences and meetings referred to in (1) which are held on a regular, sometimes daily basis, have been for the most part attended by officers of our Missions to the UNlDisarmament and WTO in Geneva, our Embassy to France and Delegations to the OECD and UNESCO in Paris and our Mission to the United Nations in Vienna. In cases where Ministers or officials from Australia have attended, decisions on representation are taken by the Ministers and Departments whose responsibilities are involved. Apart from these general observations, my Department does not maintain the comprehensive information sought by the honourable member. During 1996, Australian missions in Geneva, Paris and Vienna had assisted the following number of official visitors attending conferences and meetings: Ministers Other MPs Officials Advisers 3 1 210 13 4 11 204 4 Nil Nil 27 Nil the relevant details were as follows: Ministers Other MPs Officials Advisers 4 2 89 10 1 1 115 1 Nil Nil 16 3 (4) To provide the honourable member with the names of each of these persons, and details of their fares, accommodation costs and allowances paid, would unduly consume scarce resources in a number of Departments, agencies and overseas missions. The Department of Administrative Services holds details of the entitlements of and payments to Ministers and Members of Parliament in respect of their overseas travel. Details on the overseas travel entitlements of Government officials are contained in the Department of Industrial Relations Determinations, copies of which are available in the Parliamentary Library on CDROM. Details of actual payments to officials for their overseas travel are held by their respective Departments and agencies. US Disarmament Conventions (Question No. 1247) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 February 1997: (1) Is he able to say which UN disarmament conventions have not been ratified by all the permanent members of the Security Council. (2) When did the other permanent members ratify each of the conventions referred to in part (1). (3) What are the texts of any reservations lodged by the permanent members. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) The Secretary General of the United Nations is the depositary of four arms control and disarmament conventions and treaties. These are: the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW); the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD); the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (CWC); and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). All five permanent members have ratified the CCW. China and France are yet to ratify ENMOD, while Russia is the only permanent member of the Security Council not to have ratified the CWe. None of the five permanent members (P5) as yet has ratified the CTBT, which was opened for signature last year. In addition, there are a number of major multilateral arms control and disarmament conventions and treaties for which individual states, not the are the depositaries. Of these, the P5 have ratified the Antarctic Treaty, the Treaty on Principles governing the Activities of States in the Exploration ties. and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty); the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (BWC). Other major multilateral disarmament conventions and treaties include the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water (Partial Test Ban Treaty-PTBT) and the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof (SeaBed Treaty). Russia, the UK and the US have ratified both treaties. China has ratified the Sea-Bed Treaty, while France has ratified neither. (2) Following are the dates of ratification of those UN disarmament conventions and treaties which have not been ratified by all of the P5: ENMOD: Russia (1978), the UK (1978), the US (1980). CWe: China (1997), France (1995), the UK (1996), the US (1997). A table providing the dates of ratification of major arms control and disarmament treaties is attached. (3) The texts of any reservations and statements lodged by the permanent members upon ratification of the above mentioned UN disarmament conventions and treaties are as follows: CCW United Kingdom: ""(a) Generally (i) The term ""armed conflict"" of itself and in its context denotes a situation of a kind which is not constituted by the commission of ordinary crimes, including acts of terrorism, whether concerted or in isolation. (ii) The United Kingdom will not, in relation to any situation in which it is involved, consider itself bound in consequence of any declaration purporting to be made for the purposes of article 7 (4), unless the United Kingdom shall have expressly recognised that it has been made by a body which is genuinely and authority representing a people engaged in an armed conflict of the type to which that paragraph applies. (iii) The terms ""civilian"" and ""civilian population"" have the same meaning as in article 50 of the 1st Additional Protocol of 1977 and to the 1949 UN, Geneva Conventions. Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Convention unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostili(iv) Military commanders and others responsible for planning, deciding upon, or executing attacks necessarily have to reach decisions on the basis of their assessment of the information from all sources which is reasonably available to them at the relevant time.

The purposes, objectives and principles of CWC should be strictly observed. The provisions concerning challenge inspection shall not be abused and the national security interests of States parties not related to chemical weapons shall not be compromised. China is firmly opposed to any act of abusing the verification provisions which endangers its sovereignty and security. 4. Any country which has abandoned chemical weapons on the territory of another country should effectively implement the relevant CWC provisions, undertake the obligations to destroy those chemical weapons and ensure the earliest complete destruction of all the chemical weapons it has abandoned on another state's territory. 5.

(2) Was the funding referred paid over a 10 year period based on a formula of 65% of the long term bond rate applied to the acceptable cost of the project. (3) Is she able to say whether the payments were introduced by the Government in recognition of the need to provide special funding for upgrading of nursing home premises. (4) Is her Department a party to an agreement with eligible nursing homes requiring it to honour payment of that funding over a 10 year period. (5) Is it a fact that (a) payments did not commence until 1991-2 and (b) there is a considerable sum owing to certain nursing homes. (6) Have many nursing homes signed agreements with the Commonwealth and are in the stages of completing upgrading work or are about to commence upgrading work. (7) Is she able to say whether nursing home upgrading work mainly will be financed by loans for which estimates of income to be received throughout the additional recurrent funding systems was contingent on the loans being approved. (8) Will the Government discontinue the funding referred to in part (1); if so, how. (9) Is she able to say what would be the consequences for a nursing home which has received, or has reached an agreement with the Commonwealth to receive, funding referred to in part (1) if that funding was discontinued. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes Operational Childcare Subsidy Assistance Total 46 118 164 46 104 150 52 147 199 45 167 212 49 178 227 (3) Yes (4) Formal agreements were not part of the funding arrangements. (5) (a) Yes; b) Amounts vary according to the size of the project and progress with payment. (6) Nursing homes are not required to sign agreements with the Commonwealth for additional recurrent funding. Yes, a number of homes are in the stages of completing upgrading work or about to commence to in part (1) to be upgrading work. (7) When applications for additional recurrent funding were assessed, two of the criteria were: (a) The ability of the applicant to finance the project; and (b) whether the applicant could meet the cost of servicing the loan. (8) The Government will continue to provide additional recurrent funding to holders of approvals where the holder chooses to retain that funding. (9) Under the new Aged Care Bill 1997, a service may receive certification to charge accommodation bonds if it meets certain building and care standards. To receive certification, any outstanding additional recurrent funding would need to be relinquished. The service will then be able to receive funding through the alternative income stream from charging accommodation bonds and receiving concessional resident supplements for eligible residents. Concessional resident supplements would be paid under the new Bill for people unable to afford an accommodation bond or only a very small bond. The choice of income stream is the provider's. Nursing Home Projects: Funding (Question No. 1677) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (l) How many nursing homes undertook building projects under the 10 year building program formulated on the basis of 65% of the long term bond rate applied to the acceptable cost of the project. (2) How many nursing homes proceeded on the basis that they could finance their projects out of future returns which had been agreed to by the Government when approval in principle for the works was given. (3) How many nursing homes which are unable to use the new funding system will be abandoning their rebuilding projects. (4) Will the Government review this situation and assist nursing homes which have commenced projects using the former funding formula. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Approvals in Principle were granted in respect of 51 projects involving the building or rebuilding of nursing homes and 384 projects where the home was to be upgraded. (2) To be granted approval for additional recurrent funding, applicants had to substantiate the availability of sufficient funds to meet the full cost of the project. Government subsidy is paid only after the project is completed. Nursing homes may continue to receive this Government subsidy under the new funding arrangements. (3) Under the new arrangements, nursing homes approved or approved in principle for additional recurrent funding may retain access to that funding if they so choose. Alternatively, they may choose to receive accommodation bonds and concessional resident supplements. There is no need to abandon their rebuilding projects. (4) As at (3), nursing homes approved or approved in principle for additional recurrent funding may retain access to that funding if they so choose. Alternatively, they may choose to receive accommodation bonds and concessional resident supplements. The choice of income stream is the provider's. For this reason, there is no need to undertake a review. Werribee: Waste Dump (Question No. 2013) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a project by CSR to establish a large, centralised toxic waste dump in Werribee, Vic in the electoral division of Lalor. (2) If so, is the proposed dump close to areas devoted to the growing of high quality vegetables by producers who have achieved success in exporting premium products to premium markets, especially in Asia.
