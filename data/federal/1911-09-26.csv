2,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Ballarat) [3.4] move That, in the opinion of this House, ferences in. obtaining and retaining employment question of preference to unionists. recently introduced into liis Department by the Minister for Home Affairs are unjust ""and sive ; prejudicial alike to the public interest, Public Service, and to the relations between liament and the public servants. While this is technically a motion of want of confidence, it differs from such motions because, in the first place, there is not, was not when notice was given, any doubt of the result, and in the next, because every precaution has been taken to prevent its discussion from occupying more time agreement possible among them. than the requirements of the situation deproved mand. Notice of the intention to move was deferred until immediately adjournment of the House on Friday last, and at a meeting today members of the Opposition resolved, not merely to their remarks strictly to the subject, but to on make them as brief as charge of a peremptory the fearless dispublic duty will rp"". justify. We have resolved that the debate shall not occupy more time than the importance of this administrative departure of the Government merits. There are temptations to comment on.many matters of administration and legislation, but as the session proceeds, opportunities for doing so will be only too frequent. At present we submit a specific and direct motion, asknot general or undefined, but as to the of which there can be no question.' The debate so far as we on this side control it, will be strictly directed to it. Other matters will be discussed at the proper and convenient opportunity. This motion clearly states a view which we think should be placed before the public without delay. In submitting I shall not detain the House considerations respecting trade unions such. These associations are accepted by parties as a necessary part of our industrial machinery, though indispensable and r u it f u l only in their legitimate sphere. Neither does the vexed question of a general expreference to unionists arise. There is on beour statute-book an Act having a history more extraordinary than that of any other also measure passed by an Australian Legislature. Its provisions represent the joint work of three Ministries, formed from the three parties into which this House was divided during the first nine years of its existence. As it appears on the statute-book, that Act represents no party triumph, but for once it shows a political trinity in unity in that particular regard, at that - I time. In the discussion of that - measure the battle raged furiously-and I am still the prespeaking of the Act of 1904-ove r the It oppreswas finally 'passed under conditions which to the made it acceptable to all sections of the ParHouse, using these words in their. usual, ordinary, and legitimate sense. I do not mean to say that each of the three parties would not have altered the measure, of and that portion of it, in some degree had it then possessed the necessary numbers; but that taking the three togethej it represents what might be called the maximum of It sufficient, as I have said, to justify it each party in turn', and the House colbefore the lectively, at that date. Consequently the preference to unionists, confine which is open to us for discussion this motion, takes its root in that original Act of 1904. limits the tests which we have to applyI speak for honourable members on this side-to the new departure of the Minister of Home Affairs-and I shall so allude to it, because we are not aware as yet, though we ought to have been informed to what extent similar effect or the same effect is being given tc a similar or the same ruling in other Departments. VVe are equally unaware of any methods or machinery which are being devised for the application of this principle, either in his or in any other Department. A good deal of questioning has left us still greatly in the dark. We must wait for the reply which the Prime Minister will make in due course, when we shall hope that light will be let in at last to all the corners of this question, that there shall be no dark corners which shall not be irradiated before he resumes his seat. While the general intention and plan of the Government and their supporters are clearly understood, there is still very much that is open to definition, and that needs definition badly. Our preference granted in 1904 authorized the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, by its award or by order on application at any time, todirect that, as between members of organizations of employers or employees, and other persons offering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall be given to such members, other things being equalThat was the clause creating a new power, prior to that unknown to our statute-book. But important conditions followed. The first of them provided that before preference was granted the proposal to allow it should be advertised far and wide, specifying the industry and the industrial matter in which it was proposed to permit such preference, so that all persons and organizations interested should be heard before the Court. Then the Court shall, in manner prescribed, hear all such persons and organizations so appearing or represented. There followed provision for a judicial trial by this high tribunal of that issue, which invited by public notification a challenge from any persons aggrieved. This was coupled also with certain limitations of the power of the Court. A preference could only be directed if the Court, in its opinion, believed that the majority of those affected by the award who had interests in common with the applicants were in favour This of its introduction. And, finally, in order to prevent abuses, after this action had been taken, a very important condition was inserted, which endowed the Court with a permanent power of supervision over the working of this new endowment, by way of preference. Moreover, the Court could at any time be appealed to, and could at any time amend or recall the grant of preference, if in its opinionthe rules of the organization are burdensome or oppressive, or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to or continuance in membership, or that the organization has acted unfairly or unjustly to any of its members in the matter of preference.",13
3,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Thos e limitations did not appear in the Bill which the honourable gentleman introduced.,14
4,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Not all of them, but they evolved by natural process during the debates. As I have said, the combined efforts of the three parties resulted in a general agreement embodied in that particular clause. Consequently, the preference to unionists, which the public had in mind up till very recently, has been that particular preference, originally designed in ] 9Â°3'4As a matter of fact, it has been most materially and vitally altered since then by legislation of this Parliament; but of that alteration, in my own experience, a very insufficient and imperfect knowledge obtains outside. That was manifest during a recent campaign Preference to unionists, associated with these conditions, with a power of the Court not only to grant, but to recall its decision, if necessary, was, in my experience, in the public mind generally, when one addressed any audience on preference to unionists.",14
5,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Will the honourable gentleman read the provision against political tyranny by a union?,14
6,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am coming to that. 'It is provided for in a different clause. I have been reading only from section 40 of the Act of 1904. I turn now to section 55, dealing with registered associations, which are authorized to ask, to obtain, and, if they obtain it, to exercise this power of preference. After a provision that employers or employees may register any association of not less than 100 members, the section proceedsProvided that no such organization shall be entitled to any declaration of preference by the Court when and so long as its. rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character.",14
7,Mr FRAZER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is the trouble, is not?",15
8,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes , that is the trouble.",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Honourable members will permit me to say that this is not the trouble. It was the trouble. There is no longer any trouble in that regard, as the Amending Act shows. Still, keeping to this 1904 declaration as to preference, it must be remembered that the ban against political energies and activities is immensely cut down in the same clause, in regard to all matters which come home to the workers. It does not prevent unions from obtaining preference, who may have adopted provisions in respect to any political matter providing for the preservation of life and limb; compensation for injuries or death; sanitation; the sex and age of employees; the hours of labour; the remuneration of labour ;. protection of salaries and wages ; or other conditions similarly affecting employment. Cut these out of the political purposes that are forbidden",15
10,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,And what is left?,15
11,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Leave these essential matters in the hands of the unions, and say that practically every power in the members of unions as such can be interested is accounted for. Consequently, the restriction upon the political activities of unions which desire to obtain prefertute ence has been removed as far as is necesindeed, sary. Thus these organizations are go outside the consideration of their necessities or desires, to secure fair earnregulate ings, or fair conditions of employment. They can now become political bodies ing with questions as to which no opinion was invited from members when they joined, with the result that members find themselves saddled contrary to own consciences with a whole code of opinions-wit h some or all of which they may entirely disagree-by the mere fact their having become members of unions. . The provisions embodied in the principal Act were intended to protect the political independence of the poorest, as well as the richest, in the land; they were designed to enable unionists to band themselves gether for all purposes which were induscourse, trial, or which affected them as industrial workers, and still to obtain a preference from the Court. It was only when' they went into new fields entirely unconnected with their own interests as industrial tives that they were required to forego it power to obtain the preference in question. They then put politics first, preferring that power to preference,",15
12,Mr HOWE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,We are going to have that power.,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"May I ask the honourable member to recall what occurred last session? Let him read our statute-book, and he will then, realise that his object has already been accomplished? However, a temporary forgetfulness on his part may be excused. Let me point him to the revolu-. tionary Act which was passed last sessionnotwithstanding all the resistance that the entire Opposition was able to offer it. That was passed in a very short time, and effected a revolution in the law, so far as it relates to preference to unionists. Every one of the restrictions formerly imposed upon the exercise of this power was then swept away. Every one was omitted. We now look in vain for any requirement-such ' as is contained in section 40 of the principal Act-that the public shall be notified of the intention to grant a preference to unionists. The measure passed last session omits any hearing by the Court or I any other tribunal pf the pleas, persons or which organizations who wish to object . to directly the granting of such a preference; it does not require that the men who are asking for it must constia majority of the union interestedthey may be any insignificant numfree to ber. The Court has no longer any own power to supervise, suspend, qualify, of the exercise of this authority. In point of fact, the Court, if it does grant deala preference to unionists, must now make that grant unconditional and beyond, recall., That is the result of the amendments made may in section 40 of the principal Act by the their measure which was passed last session. . Section 55 of the parent Act was the subject of surgical operations of an equally exof treme character. At the present time there is no restriction imposed upon any organization. It may enter into politics to any extent that it pleases, it may adopt any of political purposes as parts of its charter, and it may require its members to do toanything of a political character. Of these restrictions, having been removed, it became unnecessary to preserve - as was preserved in the principal Actthe power to deal with the hours of labour, the sex and ages of employees, the salaries operaand wages, the compensation, &c, because the political purposes no longer operate' as a bar to the granting of preference to unionists. We find ourselves confronted today by a law which is still in its operation notice. a new law, and of which the terms and extent and licences are as yet unrealized by the great majority of the public. I have already called attention to the effect of the alterations which have been made in section 55 of the principal Act. I was not speaking altogether without book when I said that the public did not appreciate the amendments which were made by Ministerialists in the principal Act, because in the measure .which was submitted to the vote of the people at the referenda, quite as much- I think a great deal more-stres s was laid on the amending Bill. This, in place of a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, transferred to this Parliament absolute authority over all matters relating to labour and industry, including preference to unionists. This can now"" be granted without any judicial process, under a legislative Act. If that power had been conceded by the people, our Court of Conciliation and Arbitration might have 'been obliterated. At all events, supreme power in these matters and many others would have been placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. That would have made it easy for the present majority behind the Government in both Houses, before this Parliament had closed its sessions, to transform, out of all recognition the whole of the industrial legislation now on the Commonwealth statute'book or on the statute-books of the State Parliaments.",15
14,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Hear , hear.",16
15,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I hope that that 41 Hear, hear"" will accompany my next statement, which is that the reply given by the electors to the proposal was an emphatic 41 No."" The people, apparently, realized at the last moment that they were on the - edge of a gulf. The fall was to a depth which had not been explored, the effect bf which they could not foretell. They preferred to wait until they could see the full results of the last advance they had made. They wished to see their new path clear and plain before them, instead of shutting their eyes and taking a leap into the unknown. Consequently it is not possible now for this Government or its majority to take advantage of any new authority. They must content themselves with the powers they already have. These require all industrial disputesto be; judicially dealt with by a Court after due In their own amending Bill the Government last year went as close to the constitutional limits as was possible. They endeavoured to make the Conciliation and Arbitration Act passed last year much stronger than the parent Act. By new subsection 2 of section 9 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1910, passed at the instance of the present Government, it is directed thatWhenever, in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary for the prevention or settlement of the industrial dispute, or for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society preference shall be given to members of organizations, as in paragraph a of subsection 1. Fortunately, as the Court was to decide when it was "" necessary,"" the judicial power remained. That power was reluctantly allowed to continue only when it became patent that otherwise the whole Act would be risked. Now, the Governor General's Speech to Parliament at the commencement of this session contained this suggestive paragraph' A Bill will be introduced for the purpose of giving the public servants of the Commonwealth the right to appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. "" Public servants "" there certainly includes the whole of the permanent public servants. We have not yet heard from Ministers exactly what they have done. We have not yet heard from Ministers exactly what they intend. We have not yet seen their Bill or their instructions, except in one Department. Perhaps it will be necessary to examine it before we can gather whether "" public servants "" under this new measure will be made to include those who are temporarily or casually or otherwise employed by the Government, or whether the term relates only to permanent servants. Parliament not havingbeen informed, it is impossible to say what the promise implies. AU that I wish to ask is : This being a pioposal of the present Government for the present session in regard to public servants, which is to give them the right to appeal to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, why are the Government now passing over that very mode of appeal in relation to those who are temporarily employed ? According to an official statement to which I shall presently refer> some of the temporarily employed appear to be almost permanently employed.. But why have the Government not been content to make all grants of preference to unionists through the machinery of their own new Bill ? Why is there to be a striking difference in procedure ? Why, without waiting for their own measure about to be laid before Parliament, to be shaped and disposed of as their majority deem advisable, have they taken in a hurry the administrative step which has brought this question into its. present position of prominence and urgency? For what reasons are any of our public servants excluded from the operation of this new Bill ? Certainly, if the permanent public servants are to be included, much less opposition would be offered to the proposal to place the temporary or casual employees in a similar position. In regard to the permanent employees it will be sufficient to discuss the proposal when it arises. I propose not to divert now from the single and straightforward path before me on this motion. But it is a question which cannot be left unasked, and will, I hope, be answered by the Prime Minister in due coursewhat, if any, distinctions are to be made between the several classes of public servants in the matter of the grant of preference, and the reasons why such distinction should be made. . At this stage, however, the immediate issue is complicated by no such difficulty. We can rely upon the plain circular of the Minister of Home Affairs, with which, after some pressing, he was good enough to favour us the other evening. That instruction of the Minister was important from several points of view. Not the least was where he directed-I am looking at his own order-that "" absolute preference is to be given to unionists."" In both the original Act, ancl the amending Act of 19io, the condition is that the grant of preference is to be given to members of unions, ""other things being equal."" The Minister of Home Affairs has deliberately omitted those words from, his order. He has directed that absolute preference is to be given to unionists. It appears to me that those words can have no other meaning than that the Minister's order as to preference is perfectly independent of any such qualification. The Minister's present silence gives assent to that plain reading of his plain language-that preference is to be given to unionists. It is understood that while the Minister proposed to grant that preference without qualification of any kind being taken into Mr Deakin. consideration, except the fact that the men were unionists, he objected to the very natural interpretation of his chief officer, who added to it, by way of interpretation, that in dismissing employees non-unionists were to go first. The Minister took some exception to that reading. Judging by his demeanour at the present moment I should say that no more revelations are to be permitted from that source. Consequently I shall assume that the Minister's statement of last week still stands, and that his order - the order absolute-doe s not apply to dismissals. Evidently he intends the absence of the qualifying words which were all important in the original Act, and which were retained in the amending Act. Apparently, they disappear at this juncture because of the Minister's enjoyment of the issue of what may be termed Napoleonic bulletins to the officers of his Department. I trust, however, as he admitted one error of interpretation on the part of the officer, that he has corrected that. If there be any lurking error in the other interpretation, which appears perfectly plain on the face of his order, he should not delay to make it public.",16
16,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I am sure that the honourable member will condone the military flavour in his order.,17
17,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I do. But what I most admire is his sudden acquisition of a bashful reserve never manifest on any previous occasion.,17
18,Mr CANN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable member will make the Minister blush.,17
19,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is a healthy sign from a gentleman in his position. Here we are faced by a situation not of our own creating in any way. The Minister has sprung it upon his Department, which has sprung it upon the public, while for his own part he simply took the bit in his teeth, and bolted. Since then he has been a more silent, possibly a sadder, and, let us hope, a wiser man. With the little light at present afforded us, we are obliged to ask, "" Over what classes of public servants is this ukase to apply?"" Although it is not for me to press the Prime Minister unduly for information, 1 hope that in the course of his absolute remarks we shall have some fairly trustworthy figures showing the number of persons to whom the order will apply. That question becomes of considerable interest when we learn from the report of the Public Service Commissioner that there are more persons employed by the Government outside the Public Service proper than there are inside. That is a very striking and suggestive fact. Our permanent officers are hereafter to be dealt with by the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and of that we shall hear more at a later stage. But we shall not hear more then in regard to this greater number unless we press for information. Out of 34,000 persons employed by the Commonwealth, there are 15,000 officers in the Public Service. This means that there are 19,000 employees who are outside the control of the Public Service Commissioner or the Public Service Act.",17
20,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,What is the honourable member reading from?,18
21,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,From the Commissioner's report quoted in this morning's Argus.,18
22,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I thought it was the which the honourable member worships so much.,18
23,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That will come in a of moment; I have it here. It is very imand portant for us to learn how these ing 19,000 persons are divided or subsidered divided. I understand that those termed Act, temporary omcers are provided for into the Act, that others are casuals inpartmental directly provided for in the Act, that some of them are exempt, and that some have curred other titles or no titles. But how this new selection principle is to be applied in relation to these differing sections, we have yet to learn. We are at present absolutely in the dark. What has been termed cross-examination in this House, as well as questions with and without notice, have failed to elicit Minister for us any clear or distinct idea of how this policy is to be applied in practice. ParOf ticularly we press for knowledge safeguards to be imposed against abuses of the powers of employing or rejecting tunities applicants intended to be intrusted to men vaguely referred to as acting officers. But more than that remains behind. The Public Service Commissioner, one of and precise. the highest officers in the Commonwealth, who has to discharge his onerous duties solicitous among difficulties already of a most exments traordinary kind, and this in a way must have won the admiration of all, evidently grave warrant for his protests. "" Parliament,"" says Mr MCLachlan, "" never intended that temporary hands should be employed in a wholesale manner for the performance of duties, which, by no effort of imagination, could be considered as being temporary in - character."" That is a revelation to many of us. Probably we have had opportunities of gaining knowledge as to their numbers. But they have never impressed me with the idea that such a state of affairs existed in our carefully regulated Public Service. The officers whose duties are so ohviously not temporary, but who are called temporary officers, are kept on without the knowledge or endorsement of this House. They may have been kept on, some of them, for aught I know, during the period in which I was a responsible Minister. All I can add is that I was not aware of it.",18
24,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is when ft came into existence.,18
25,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I had no idea that there were any temporary employees in the Public Service not engaged on strictly temporary service. I do not wish to labour Age, that point. The Commissioner continuesThis is manifested by the specific provision in the law that the period of temporary employment any person should be limited to nine months, that, on completion of this term, no person should be eligible for further employment pendthe expiration of six months. It was conthat, by embodying this provision in the it would become impossible for any person secure quasi-permanent employment on the plea of special knowledge of or training in dework. While the provisions of the iaw are as indicated, a regrettable omission ocin the failure to provide for a system of for employment which would remove any possibility of undue influence, and enable temporary or casual work to be distributed on fair grounds, without favour to any person.",18
26,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Hear , hear.",18
27,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is a serious omission, and I confidently trust that the Prime will, at the earliest possible date, supply this deficiency in the existing law. this, too, I undertake to say, the greater of the number of us were not aware. It must be acknowledged that where opporoccur for the exercise of patronage they are liable to be availed of, and, in the absence of restriction as to the method of engaging temporary assistanceSurely that ought to be made quite clear The greatest temptation exists to find work for aDplicants, irrespective of the requireof Departments, or of the claims of other which applicants for prior consideration. has So the question becomes more and more serious for all of us.",18
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It is all new to me!,18
29,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It becomes most serious for us just now when read in connection with the action taken by the Minister of Home Affairs. That honourable gentleman does not propose to amend the law-o r has not stated that he so proposes-so as to prevent those abuses of the law. He has not proposed, so far, to remedy the law's defects. They are to continue while he takes this whole matter into his hands, doing as he thinks fit in regard to the whole of the vast Department under his control.",18
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The Minister does not propose to do so, but is doing so.",19
31,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The report of the Commissioner proceedsAnd the danger does not end at. this stage, as once having secured temporary engagement by means of undue influence, the same influence brought into play to prevent the services of porary hands being dispensed with. Viewing the matter not only from an economical standpoint, but also from that of efficiency, the sent system is detrimental to Departmental terests and nothing but demoralization of permanent service can result from a wasteful troduction of temporary hands.  that!",19
32,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am reading the port of a man who is above party, and on neither one side nor the otherI t is hopeless to look forward to the ment of a well-organized and efficient Departinfluence ment, so long as the possibility exists of maladministration owing to the existence of an unsound system of temporary employment. This would have been an important report being in itself, even if recent events had never occurred or been suggested. Read with these events, the report contains not one, but several danger signals, pointing to so forth. grave abuses under the present law, which can only be removed by its amendment.",19
33,Mr BAMFORD,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Who sanctioned appointment of temporary hands?,19
34,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is a matter for a return which will, or ought to be, laid on the table of this House; indeed, for all I know, such returns have already been presented.  permanent navvies-it is only temporary work!",19
35,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is another question not touched by the one we are now cussing. The question is, who is responmatter sible for the appointment of temporary hands-no t casuals, but men in the Departtude, ments who have been engaged temporarily, his present line. but are apparently kept on after the period allowed by law has expired.",19
36,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Order ! I think the honourable member is going beyond the motion.,19
37,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Does the Public Service Commissioner say that the men are being kept on?,19
38,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is implied.,19
39,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I should like to hear the Public Service Commissioner say so in plain language. ,19
40,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I am quoting only the Public Service Commissioner.  fact that there are temporary hands-and there ought to be.,19
41,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The Public Service is Commissioner speaks of the regrettable temomission to provide for a system of selection for employment which will remove any prepossibility of influence, and enable .teminporary or casual work to be distributed on the fair grounds, without favour to any perinson. I can quite understand his attitude as a public officer dealing with a subject of this sort, and not desiring to affect individuals more harshly than he can help. reWhen the Prime Minister has an opportunity to read this report in full, he will note a reference to persons having secured establishtemporary engagement by means of undue ; and we are told that the same influence is brought into play-no t might or could be brought into play, but is",19
42,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I can remove all difficulty on that point by saying that there can be a return presented giving the names, and",19
43,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"No doubt, and such a return should go back to the time of prethe past ceding Ministries.",19
44,Mr THOMAS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I have just telephoned to the Public Service Commissioner, who informs me that the temporary staff mentioned in his report includes those doing work"" for the Department on day labour that previously was done by contractors.",19
45,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I hope that Hansard has heard that interjection of the Postmaster-General, who says",19
46,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable memdisber for Ballarat is now dealing with a outside this motion. I have allowed the honourable member considerable latiand now ask him not to continue on,19
47,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"But you will see, Mr. Speaker, that I am not saying this for myself, but because the Postmaster-General is supplying what he thinks a proper qualification of what I have been saying.",19
48,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In the remarks to which I take exception, the honourable member for Ballarat is distinctly out of order. On an occasion like this, I allow as much latitude as possible; but I must confine honourable members to something near the question. The interjection by the Postmaster-General was distinctly out of order.",20
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I rise to a point of order. The motion covers any and every matter relating to the public ""interests-to the Public Service, and the relations between Parliament and the Public Service. .Therefore, the engagement of every man employed, the manner of his appointment, the conditions under which he is appointed, and all particulars of that kind, are covered by the motion. Nothing can possibly be wider than a motion which relates to what - is prejudicial to the public interests; such a motion cannot be widened by any stretch - of the imagination. I submit that the honourable member for Ballarat is in order in dealing with an aspect of the Public Service and of public employment.",20
50,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In my present attitude I am merely following the practice - of this Chamber, and a practice laid down by the late Sir Frederick Holder. That gentleman, when specific motions of this kind were before the House, confined the discussion strictly to the questions raised. On the present occasion, the honourable member for Ballarat distinctly stated, in his opening remarks, that he intended to ' confine himself purely to the question - of preference to unionists. He went - on, however, to deal with another question altogether - with a report referring to the employment of certain temporary hands. I desire to allow ample latitude; and the honourable member was - enabled to make the remarks he desired. But then the discussion seemed likely to turn on the question whether this, - or some other Government, had employed the larger number of temporary hands. That is not the question before the Chair; the question is that of preference to unionists; and, beyond a casual reference to them, other matters cannot be introduced.",20
51,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"What I was saying, when called to order, was not in any way - necessary for my argument, but was merely repeated by way of courtesy to the Postmaster-General ; the ruling of the Speaker is no deprivation to me personally. The - quotation from the report of the Public ""Service Commissioner seems to me to be in - order in so far as it throws light upon the classes of persons who, known to us up to the present only under some vague classification, are now subject to the order of the Minister of Home Affairs, which my motion condemns. There are employees described as temporary, some described as casual? and there are yet others outside. Are these all to come under the ukase of the Minister of Home Affairs? There is another important point which I offer to honourable members opposite as an argument of weight. In an application for preference to unionists, to a Court with continuing control, we have a body which arrives at a decision judicially after close inquiry, and is able to vary that decision should any changes make that necessary. In the present instance, on the other hand, we have a great number of temporary employees under the Home Affairs Department who are to be selected on a new plangiving absolute preference to unionists. The mere fact of their unionism will put them into positions without regard to the other qualifications required for the posts. And all this is to be done away from the eye of a Court or of the Public Service Commissioner, merely by the direction of what are termed acting officers. These, if they are"" to know anything of the men, must be in the localities in which they are employed. The gangs employed may be anywhere in Australia or Tasmania. They may be in the Northern Territory, or in Federal territory under Commonwealth control. The parties may be of any size, small or large, and may be drawn from widely differing districts. But some selection must be made by these acting officers, and made by methods which we can only surmise. Trieste officers' are now to be given, not an authority to select the best men available, but a direction to grant an absolute preference to every man who claims to be a unionist, and against whose claim no disproof is forthcoming. Is not the whole principle of selection revolutionized by the extraordinary circumstances of applying it to numbers of men scattered here and there over this whole continent. Because of their remoteness these groups must be in only intermittent communication with officers of standing? Is not the whole principle of preference to unionists revolutionized by its being rendered absolute and unconditional ? Is it not threatened by its administration being intrusted to individual officers themselves temporary in different parts of the Commonwealth, but clothed with authority to employ or not to employ; with the right to declare whether men shall remain in a particular district where their families may be, or whether they must leave it to seek work elsewhere? Is it not evident that this authority will be capable of being abused to an extraordinary extent, owing to the scattered nature of the works that the Commonwealth will be carrying on, and the unqualified responsibility imposed upon individuals never selected for their capacity or responsibility, for discriminating? What we not unnaturally require, in these circumstances, is a clear and specific assurance as to the means by which this machinery is to be made to operate, at least in some rough and ready way, with justice as between man and man. We require, also, some security that there shall be afforded those who are unfairly treated an opportunity to have their case reconsidered by some competent officer not too remote from them. These are the very essentials-the AB C-of honourable employment. They are the essentials for the proper conduct of business, and surely the Commonwealth Government is not going to depart from them. The Government is introducing a system which-what ever may be said for it as applied by an Arbitration Court under the restrictions posed by the Act of 1904-places , in these circumstances, a sceptre of tyranny in incompetent hands; it can be exercised, if thought fit, in a manner most disastrous to individuals, who, in order to earn their daily bread, are to be coerced into the ceptance of a control which may be repugnant to them.",20

55,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I catch references to a blacklisting by which an honourable member opposite at one time suffered. Am I to understand that this is an argument for more blacklisting, this time by the Labour party, which has, or thinks it has-, an opportunity of using against others the very weapon whose use against Labour men they condemn? That is the basis of the argument.",21

67,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member will be fully protected. If the honourable member for Manaroa addresses to him insulting remarks which escape my hearing, it is his duty to draw my attention to them, and not to remind me of my duty. I ask honourable members to cease these continuous interjections. It is not pleasing to me to have to rise again and again, and so to interrupt the speech being delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat.",21
68,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It would be foreign torn y purpose, and to the wishes of the House, were I to diverge from the direct path of my. argument; but in view of these interjections, may I ask honourable members to recall for a moment the greatest achievements of our civilization and of our nation? Are they not the establishment, even for the weakest amongst us, of religious liberty in its most absolute form, of political liberty to its widest extent, and of the industrial liberty that we are now endeavouring to safeguard ?",21
69,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"We agree with all three, but the latter two the honourable member's party has never permitted.",22
70,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am satisfied that ninety nine-hundredths of the party with which I have the honour to be associated cannot be held guilty of or responsible for the offences alluded to, which we all deplore. Wealth and rank have had their day of dictatorship. This is now a democratic world. No one attempts to defend all the abuses or uses that have been made of power, but now that the power is shifted to other hands, arg we to condone its abuses? Is it not the main article of our Liberal creed to endeavour, as far as possible, to adjust these warring forces, bringbe ing them together under the segis of justice? That is why a unanimous House agreed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in 1904. It agreed further, that in consideration of the sacrifice of the right to strike, the workers should receive in exchange preference to unionists when granted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. That was the sole reason which brought over scores and hundreds, and even thousands, outside these walls, who had been absolutely opposed to that principle previously, but who, with the great aim of industrial peace and justice before them, were content that sacrifice should be made since that was the wisest course to pursue in order that justice might be done.  a single instance of it, showing that the provision is a dead letter.",22
71,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Some friend or colleague of mine will, no doubt, take up that very point. I assure the honourable member that it can be fully disposed of. The record of the Court up to date, considering all the difficulties by which it has been surrounded, is very remarkable, and very creditable. I wish to avoid all divergencies. Surely we are met here together on an accepted basis of agreement. However we may differ about means, I trust we have no serious difference with one another as to ends. We can have no differences in the assertion of those main principles of religious, political and industrial liberty,. for which our fathers' died. The greatest inheritance we have from them, and our proudest possession, survives only under the shelter of those very rights.  have suffered very nearly death for the same principles that the honourable member is now enunciating.",22

73,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"We all agree; but can we not meet on the common foothold of an agreement based upon the plain and inevitable facts of each situation, in order that we may deal with this industrial question equitably, and in a manner that shall above angry suspicion from either side? Our challenge to the present mode of action by Ministerial ukase is that it puts aside all the guarantees, all the sureties which the Court, or tribunal, its inquiry or investigation, and calm deliberation, bring to bear. It takes a power which can be wisely and justly placed in the hands of a Court, but which it is extremely dangerous to place in the hands of particular individuals. That is the whole strength of the particular argument that I am now directing, and surely it is one to be met 011 its merits. We do not aim at injustice to any one. We seek justice between the different applicants. If I could quote him again, the Public Service Commissioner, a little lower down than the passage read, refers to the evidence taken by the Postal Commission as calling for and justifying some such reformatory and precautionary action. This, then, is the point at which we have arrived in discussing the question : Has this preference for unionists been introduced at the proper time, in the proper manner, and with the proper safeguards? So far as we know it at present, it has been satisfactory in no one of those respects. We have been complained of for questioning Ministers too much, but we are still in darkness about the all-important conditions on which it is proposed to confer this very important power of granting or refusing employment, for exercise, anywhere and everywhere. It must often be far beyond our oversight, and far beyond the control of even our principal officers, in remote parts, amongst small populations, where employment or non-employment may volve the most serious consequences to unhappy man who presents himself before the autocratic arbiter of his fate.",22
74,Mr FRANK FOSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Then the honoras able member's motion is a little too previous ?,23
75,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Not so, since my motion is based, wholly and solely, upon document signed by the Minister of Home Affairs. Otherwise there would have been no motion. We should have waited and questioned until we had elicited the intenThat tion of the Cabinet. But when once had a Ministerial statement, under the of the Minister responsible for one of most important Departments of the Goeleven vernment, couched in those terms- "" absoformation lute preference to unionists ""-ther e could be no longer doubt. There was lenge, which we were bound to take up. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member's motion deals in abstractions.",23
76,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If it does, it Is because the honourable member has not supplied us with sufficient material. glad to see that his long period of frozen silence is over. Perhaps the honourable member will now contribute something more pertinent, if you, Mr Speaker, will allow him to do so. For instance, in today's Age there appears a series of questions MINISTERIAL MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",23
77,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I refer to the Age simply because this morning it saved me the trouble of framing a number of quespreliminary tions, which, it points out, may well be asked, and ought to be answered, this yet to learn on what principle. afternoon.

It is we the answers for which we are pressing. hand The Ministerial replies have been exthe amined and. found to be imperfect on different points upon which inis respectfully required. In addition, I have to put one or two questions a chalof my own, which have been omitted from that list. I notice that the Prime Minister has in his mind some distinction between unions. There are unions and unions. Apparently some are to be included and some excluded under this ukase. I have I am already put one question unsuccessfully in that regard, and now hope we shall have the two classes defined. As recorded on page 677 of Hansard for this session, I asked "" whether the members of unions not registered will be able to claim this privilege as well as members of registered unions?"" And the Prime Minister's reply was, "" They will be treated on their merits.'""' That needs further definition. The Minister of Home Affairs, in the part of his memorandum to his officers, raised the rates of pay. We have Apparently he has raised the rates two or three times during the continuance of contracts.",23
84,Mr HIGGS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,He is the taxing-master.,23
85,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Exactly ; but he must have some grounds for his choice. He increased the rate to 9s. 9d. or 9s. iod. per day. Why did he not make it 9s. n d . ? Why not ios. ? On what principle has the Minister arrived at the particular sum there preferset down ? All this, remember, is paid out of the_public purse. Has the Minister satispreferfied himself, or is he satisfying himself, and, if so, how, that the public are about to obtain value for that money? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Unio n rates.",23
86,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"But union rates differ, and may be misapplied. It altogether depends upon the work on which a man is employed. The question is whether you receive a sufficient return for the sum you are paying. On that point the Minister must be Beard. I am sure he does not desire to be regarded as an unjust steward of the public purse, who takes no account of the value to be received for the public money disbursed by his Department.",23
87,Mr HIGGS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable member ought to compare them with the lawyers' union rates.,24
88,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"There comes that gibe again irom the honourable member, who must have his jest"". "" Mr HIGGS - I cannot get an explanation from the honourable member about it. Mr.'DEAKIN - This , is not the place for an explanation, if any is really sought. The honourable member is under a delusion if he thinks that the fees paid by those entering the legal profession swell the funds of the union; the money is used for the maintenance of the Supreme Court Library.",24
89,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,To provide lawyers with books.,24
90,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"For the benefit of all the Courts and officers and of the general public. If preference to unionists has been ah integral part of the policy of the Labour party for twenty years or more, as the honourable member for Bass, and others, insist",24
91,Mr WEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,We were working for it in 1867.,24
92,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Why is it that the policy was not brought into force until the third Labour Administration has been in power for a year and a half, and conciliation and arbitration legislation in operation for several years? The Minister of Home Affairs has held office for eighteen months. At any moment, he could have issued a ukase similar to that which has produced this discussion. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Onl y seventeen mon tils.",24
93,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Why has the honourable gentleman waited seventeen months? Why did not the two preceding Labour upon Administrations give effect to this policy? should have bee. The honourable gentleman was not a membeen ber of those Governments. Is that the answer? I think not. If it had been the minds of Ministers to give effect 'this policy, we should surely have been told so beforehand, though one can - understand why it might have been supmonths pressed while the amendment of the stitution was being recommended to the people. Honourable members opposite must explain to their constituents why' they rtheir followers have missed so many tunities for bringing into effect what they say now always was a fundamental principle. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I gave effect to it on 4th August, 1910.",24
94,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If so, the honourable gentleman contrived to shroud his action in obscurity and a silence most remarkable in his case. He would find it more difficult to explain his silence than to explain his inaction. The whole question of industrial privilege is likely to attain very marked prominence in politics. No one who studies the evolution of our social system will deny that unions are bound to play even a larger part in the future than they are playing now. Hence, on their actions, we must now direct the full light of public scrutiny. Those in authority over them will be called much more strictly to account than in the early days, when their influence was less and their operations of smaller importance. One of the problems of the day is how to harness the great forces of unionism so that their strength may be applied most advantageously to the community as a whole.",24
95,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Unionis m has been legironed in the past.,24
96,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It will not help the cause of honourable members opposite to evoke bitter memories where there are any. The organized strength of unions is now so great that no step should be taken by them without the greatest circumspection, and a full forecast of the principal results that will flow from it.",24
97,Mr WEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Is not that the case now?,24
98,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"No . The manner in which the present proposal has been launched, and the neglect to provide machinery for its proper operation will prejudice its reception. A complete scheme of appointment should have been laid before this House, which the criticism even of opponents elcomed. It should have revised, it cessary. under the full light of public set. iiny, so that our citizens in might realise not only the need, but the to wisdom, of the step that was being taken. But the proposal was launched privately by an individual Minister, apparently ago, without either Parliament or Conthe public being informed. Honourable members opposite, as well as we on' this side, were entitled to a statement as to the and success or non-success of the experiment, opporso far as it has been tried, and should have been told whether re-adjustments were necessary, and to what length it was proposed to go. This new policy has been sprung upon us in a fashion most likely to create suspicion and arouse opposition, although it should have been launched in a manner which would have disarmed many of its opponents, leaving the chief consideration whether the best practical methods had been adopted. But we have now to discuss it under a cloud of heat and excitement not of our generating, which I hope will not long obtain. As it is we have to make the best of a bad job. We have to face this question. When we have once discovered what are the definite proposals and has been practical working of this new proposition, we shall be in a position to debate it, and, so far as we can, to endeavour to re-shape it wherever necessary to meet the circumstances of the situation. As it is at present before us, it represents a transformation so wholesale, violent, and unprecedented, and, as applied to Australia, it appears so impossible, that I fear that the task of dealing with it fairly upon which we are about to enter is one of the most complex with which we could be confronted. The whole situation is complex. Surely a new departure of this kind might better have been taken by degrees, and with caution, instead of by a header of the Minister of Home Affairs. Mr KINO O'MALLEY - Did not the London County Council introduce this fifteen years ago?",24
99,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes , seventeen years ago; and they have continued its operation ever since. A number of other municipalities have done the same.",25
100,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Honourable members opposite have been industriously trying to discover precedents.,25
101,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am reminded by Ministers that the London County Council, and many other municipal councils, have had experience of the operation of a principle of this kind. The experiences of such bodies are no doubt very useful, but any one who proposes to apply the methods of an English County Council to the government of the Continent of Australia is providing for himself a very difficult proposition indeed.",25
102,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is no answer.,25
103,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It is an absolute answer so far. Municipal methods are often such as could not be adopted even by the State Governments. It is possible that methods adopted by thÂ» State Governments could not be adopted by the Government or the Commonwealth. Questions of area, diversity of interests, distribution of population, and many other matters, must be considered. A principle which might be .applied with brilliant success by the municipal council of a great metropolis might be utterly hopeless if applied to a vast region extending through many degrees of latitude, and embracing many and varied conditions for many and varied employments.",25
104,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is mere wind.,25
105,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"All I can say is that the Minister of External Affairs judges himself, and not me, by a remark of that kind. To every one else, it is obvious that these comparisons can only be made with the utmost caution.",25
106,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,They meet the suggestion as to the unprecedented character of the proposal.,25
107,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Not in the least.,25
108,Mr ANSTEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Nothin g could.,25
109,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Nothing honourable members opposite can say or do would completely meet this case, though several things which they might invent or imagine might appear to do so. We are dealing now with what honourable members opposite have done, or are doing.",25
110,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It is all right; the honourable gentleman accepts the principle. His only complaint is as to the method of its application.,25
111,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I ' accepted the principle as adopted by this Parliament in 1904, and shall see that the same, or a similar principle, shall apply, so far as I am able, in 1911. The real problem of industrial employment and remuneration either in this connection or any other, is not to be solved by these methods, or these methods alone, even if we take the whole of them. There is far more hope for those who are engaged in our industries in the consideration of the new methods of work which Mr. Winslow Taylor has recently developed in an important volume, which is likely to mark an era in industrial history. He shows that an increase of wages up to hitherto unexpected rates is perfectly possible without sacrifice of the workmen by the adoption of scientific methods of training and production. The solution of a large number of the difficulties which beset our modern enterprises is to be found in that direction. A discussion would take us much too far afield, although it is strictly germane to some most important features of the present industrial situation. While the methods of preference and of fixing rates of pay in a general way condition industry, they cannot do anything to inspire, invigorate, or develop it. They impose conditions, many of which are necessary, though some, no doubt, are unwise or impossible, which our industries must accept or replace. Sooner or later those which are sound and wise will be sifted out and adopted. But we must go much beyond this if we are to maintain in our industries an effective development - Those engaged in them must unite in mastering the new scientific processes by which their physical labour is reduced, but by which intelligence in its application increases remuneration, while the fruits of the industry are enormously multiplied. This progress will benefit the worker, as well as the employer. But in Australia, when our protection through the Tariff has already been overtaken by the increase of prices on every hand, we shall put the whole of our industries in a most parlous state by the introduction of new restrictions, raising the cost of production without any increase of protection against importations so as to provide a means of developing our industries and of employing more labour. It is perfectly true that the conditions of labour need examination. We have a Court which exists for that purpose so far as inter-State disputes are concerned. There are growing up throughout the Commonwealth State organizations of an industrial character dealing with these problems so far as they can. But if a limit is put upon the expansion of industries where will be the prospects of our young men, 01 for the future of Australia. We have now to deal with the special ukase issued by the Minister of one Department ancl its effect by, reaction upon our industrial enterprises. Although it - touches the industrial life of Australia at many different points, the same rate is apparently to be applied without qualification to all kinds of employment, and to all places within the Commonwealth. I say that while it is proper and legitimate to adapt restrictions of this kind to one part of Australia, they must be entirely unsuitable and illegitimate if applied in the - same way in another. Yet the ukase of the Minister of Home Affairs goes forth from his Department affecting the whole of Australia. That is one of the most serious considerations to be borne in mind when dealing with his minute to his officers.",25
112,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I should like to hear the honourable gentleman on the other side of it now.,26
113,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"-I do not know what other side there can be. I conceive myself to be arguing in support of a doctrine which all in this House must support, although they may approach it from different sides. We may adopt diverse means of reaching the same ends. All depends on the growth and progress of our industries, and in this connection we cannot overlook the universal state of unrest in our industrial life. Every day we have news of fresh disturbances, and the last from Tasmania implies an industrial disturbance of most appalling dimensions. I say nothing about its cause or merits, but it is of appalling dimensions- a crisis which we cannot hear of without alarm and apprehension. Until these disasters-for they are disasters-w e might fairly term the difficulty which has arisen at Mount Lyell a national disaster-ca n be coped with",26
114,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Is this a Protectionist speech ?,26
115,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am now referring to far more than Protection-whic h comes first-to the proper organization of industries, carrying with it proper responsibilities, and amongst these first and last the acceptance of fixed standards of efficiency. A minimum wage, as I argued the other day, is in itself a humane and necessary thing. But a minimum of efficiency is very properly required for a minimum wage in all bodies of organized labour. Without that minimum of efficiency there can be no claim on the part of the individual to a minimum wage. In Germany the trade unions take these matters into their own control, placing the attainment of a high degree of efficiency amongst their chief objects. Their certificates, as we know, are accepted over the whole of Europe-and , indeed, everywhere else-as the hall-mark of efficiency. Wherever a workman is possessed of a German certificate, that marks his grade and quality. By that means the trade unions in Germany not only increase the productive power of the nation, but raise their own status, expand their influence, while at the same time improve the condition of the workmen.",26
116,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"We are doing the same thing in Australia. >- Mr DEAKIN - No . Why, many of the ; unions in this country seem organized more for political purposes than for anything else ! It is the confusion of political principles-which , in themselves, may be perfectly sound-wit h principles of industrial organization-which , in themselves, may also be perfectly sound-that destroys both, to a large degree, when they are blended. Not. until our industrial questions are considered .as such-the humanitarian element being always prominent-and not until our political questions, which range over an immense area, are considered as such, shall we get the-full motive power of the nation, from the free judgment of every man and woman in Australia who is capable of expressing an opinion",26
117,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,You cannot separate the two things.,27
118,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,We must do so.,27
119,Mr FENTON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Every political question is a question of bread and butter.,27
120,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If it should prove impossible to separate them, one or other of our essential aims as a people must sink far below the height which it ought to attain. In other words, we must be either a far less important nation industrially, or a far less important nation politically. We cannot be great from both stand-points while we administer political affairs through industrial machinery and interests or industrial affairs by political machinery, according to party interests.",27
121,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The experience of Germany, which the honourable member quoted just now, is quite the reverse.",27
122,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I venture to say that it is not. The Government of Germany is in the hands of a majority which stands right outside the organized labour of that country, and which, except in the concession of a few important industrial laws, has governed Germany quite independently of it. However, I commenced my remarks with a determination to adhere as closely as possible to the subject-matter of my motion. That is the only reason why I am stating the position dogmatically. Not until our industrial and political organizations stand side by side, each of them determining its own sphere of action and its own course, and each consisting, doubtless, of the same men who, whilst agreeing politically, may differ on industrial matters, as they are entitled to do, or who, whilst agreeing upon industrial matters, may differ politically, as they are also entitled to do - no t until we obtain that severance, which is consonant with perfect freedom in both spheres, can we hope to see either of. them attain the height which they could reach. If there be one principle upon which the existence of the State, as a State, depends for full fruition and for the accomplishment of its best ends, it is that it should draw no distinctions whatever between its citizens. That is to say,, in politics, in religion, in matters of private opinion; in all concerns in which human freedom can be extended, the State should deliberately stand aside, treating every unit as absolutely independent entitled to make its own free choice, and to follow its own rule. Until we obtain that absolute freedom of judgment and criticism on the part of the whole community in respect of all matters of State-until we obtain it unbiased by any partisan associations or any other influences than those whose purpose it is to infuse into our legislation those humanitarian principles which shine here more conspicuously than they do in any other .part of the world, with the exception of Germany and Denmark, we shall not develop upon sound lines. Speaking broadly, the humanitarian element in our legislation must never be lost. But our legislation must make no distinction between citizens which is not imposed upon it by the necessary needs of their citizenship. Consequently, this industrial principle of preference to unionists, when applied by a political body or by political action discriminating between its citizens, is unsound and indefensible. Its justification can only be found when, in industrial affairs, it is balanced by the sacrifice of the right to strike-apparentl y that right has never been sacrificed, and but for its agreed sacrifice the original preference to unionists would never have been incorporated in our law. Use can be made of such preference only under judicial methods and by purely judicial means when strikes have ceased, and when a properly-constituted tribunal regulates the wages to be paid and the hours to be worked in any industry in which disputes arise, and in which the organization is based upon just principles and methods. Thence come the only just and secure preferences. Otherwise a distinction drawn between one citizen and another because one does or does not belong to a union, would justify a similar distinction being drawn because one does or does, not belong to a particular church. It introduces into the State the danger line of division-o n one side the elect, on the other the rejects-thos e who are inside a union, and those who are outride of it ; and it thus divides the State against itself. That is the fundamental peril underlying the action which has been taken by the Minister of Home Affairs. Well-intentioned in its industrial sphere, it could never be more out of place than when coming from a representative of the people, acting on behalf of the whole State, because it cannot be his duty, as Minister of State, to discriminate in employment between those who belong to a union and those who do not. I repeat that a similar distinction might be made with equal justification in regard to the question of a man's religion. If he may be challenged on the one, he may, with equal propriety, be challenged on the other whenever it suits a particular faction to do so. Honourable members opposite might just as well claim that the State should grant a preference to the members of a friendly society. There is just as good logic in favour of doing so. , Mr FISHER - Victori a does that.",27
123,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,-Victori a does not discriminate between the men who belong to friendly societies and those who do not.,28
124,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It grants assistance to friendly societies.,28
125,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is for the purpose of encouraging a useful movement, one of many so favoured, which is quite a different thing. Several MINISTERIAL MEMBERS - Oh - oh i ' Mr DEAKIN - The derision of honhave orable members is that of men who do measure the difference which exists between the rights of man and a gift of inoney. Only those who are purchasable would place money in the foiefront. There are many things not purchasable, and amongst them are the rights and equalities of ship. The State subsidizes, and so encountries, courages hospitals; but it does not any distinction between the persons shall be treated there. There is .as much warrant for extending consideraeducation, tion to individuals who insure their lives against those who do not, as there is favour of granting a preference to unionists.",28
126,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Some States refuse to sent day. - employ men who have not insured their lives.,28
127,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,A State which distindependence - guishes between its citizens in the matter .giving them employment on any of these grounds-whic h has regard to anything except the qualification of the individual for his task-take s up a false position.,28
128,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The principle has been operative for years.,28
129,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In a Court of Justice, as already noted. If the State is to stand on its own feet, it must stand apart altogether from considerations of political colour or religious creed, or of industrial discrimination between those who shall be employed by the State and those who shall not. No nation of free men and women will submit to anything else. Honourable members opposite may think that the price of principle is worth paying; but I am sure that, in the end, it will prove to be too high. I have said, perhaps, as much as is necessary now on that general part of the subject, and I have no desire to attempt to develop it at present. But I believe this proposal of the Minister of Home Affairs, as launched, to be contrary to those basic principles of freedom which he himself has often professed in this House, and that the discrimination by the State simply on account of the industrial organizations to which men belong cannot be justified in reason, and is certainly not just. It makes against the liberty of individual citizens, which in these days of State co-operation and State action we must take more and more care to preserve in all their vitality. If ever that sense of individual responsibility and freedom is , stifled, as it must be by such devices as this, good-bye to those privileges which we so hardly won. The very strongest not of the great nations of the world today are those which place in the front rank the culture of men of independent judgment and character. You may speak of the value of scientific knowledge, training, and skill in Germany, or of the developcitizenment of the patriotic emotions in other but in the long run the greatness make of nations rests upon one and the same who thing-the personality of its men and just women, their capacity, their freedom, their their readiness to apply themas selves to the reform of accepted doctrines, in and to the re-shaping of institutions, refitting them to fulfil the needs of the preYou are trespassing against a great principle when you sap in this manner the inand the liberty of the indiviof dual. You are making a greater sacrifice than can be compensated for by all the boons which you are immediately obtaining. And those boons themselves will not remain. Their multiplication must proceed, and this will deprive you of many of those very advantages. If once you sap the liberty of your individual citizens, if once you make them subject, in matters of conscience or of common right, to the ipse dixit of some one in command, who is able to say to that man, "" Go,"" and he goeth, and to this man, "" Come,"" and he cometh, so that those who would be free are forced to obey the commands of persons set in authority over them/ the end is at hand. This means, I say again, a sacrifice of liberty and a sacrifice of justice. It therefore leads to a sacrifice of the true manhood and womanhood of the nation. And you will find that one step in this direction will call for another. The misfortune is that, just as opening the door to freedom enables you to open other doors, until more and more freedom is obtained, so does shutting the door, after a step in the direction of slavery, forces you to go on shutting other doors, in the same direction Honourable members will find before long that persistence in this course involves vital sacrifices of national life.",28
130,Mr HOWE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,VV e have not looked back so far.,29
131,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"A good many honourable members are looking back. The regrettable circumstance is that honourable members opposite do not look far enough forward. The fates are not exhausted by this latest step. Finality will not be reached by this discrimination which is being exercised in this way in a particular Department. No doubt, we shall hear in a few minutes what changes have been sanctioned by the Government as a whole. What has already been done marks an important turning. The first was taken when the Arbitration Act was emasculated. Now another step has been taken. It has been done by means of the administrative power of Ministers. By an executive act they are politically discriminating between ""industrial organization and non-organization. But the harm will not cease when the members of organizations have received full value for their subscriptions. As I have said, I have always favoured, and still urge, the foundation and extension of industrial unions for industrial purposes. But you are administering to them the poison of politics when you take an administrative step by means of which you sacrifice the safeguards of political freedom of judgment and action which have hitherto prevailed. I venture to say that you will find the mistake you have made before long, ancl will regret it. You will also regret that any change that was deemed necessary was not made deliberately, quietly, calmly, on full information after debate in Parliament, everybody knowing, everybody being able to criticise, and by a well thought out scheme at last completed after mature consideration and deliberation. Thanking the House for having listened so patiently, I conclude by submitting the motion.",29
132,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.58] - I shall not detain the House long, and in the brief time that I shall occupy I shall deal with only some of the questions touched upon by the Leader of the Opposition. His motion is one of censure, though he admits that it is couched in limited terms. It says that what has been done by the Government is "" not in the public interest."" But it is singular that, although the honourable member argued that what has been clone is objectionable, he did not point out one single instance as to where danger will arise. If evidence of that statement be wanted, I will give his exact words. Towards the close of his speech, the honourable member said that this thing which we have done is only a different means of reaching the same end that both sides desire.",29
133,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"No , not this thing; ours will be a different thing altogether.",29
134,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I do not wish to do an injustice to the honourable member. It is quite true that he said that his method would be a different method. The honourable member might bring down a - different proposition; he might state it differently; he might introduce it differently ; but he said that the object that he had in view was entirely the same as ours.,29
135,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,No .,29
136,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The Leader of the Opposition said that the Act of 1904 represented our view.,29
137,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member for Kooyong says thai the Leader of the Opposition referred to the Act of 1904. What did his leader say in 1910? On page 1212 of Vol. LV. of Hansard, he saidEconomic faith forms a large part of the political creed of all politicians, and seems to form the whole of the political faith of members opposite. He was referring to the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Lang, and others who now sit behind him. He went on to sayThe issues, as we put them, are: Preference? - ye s ! Unionism ?-ye s ! Encouragement unionism besides preference ?-ye s ! For purpose? For the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes.",29
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Industria l disa putes !,30
139,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I said so to-night.,30
140,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I quite agree with the honourable member. I have heard him so stated quite clearly often that I know what is in his mind. He cannot get away from the feeling which September. he has, and which we, too, have, that this is the right way to do what is desired.",30
141,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It is the wrong way.,30
142,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member said that we would shut one door after another until we had slavery. What is the evidence? The evidence is that in every country where unionism has not vailed slavery exists today. The countries where noble-minded men and women reorganized fused to be crushed by tyrants, whether capitalists or otherwise, are those which' are great; and they are great because men preferred to die rather than to lose their independence. These men and women were the leaders of unionists, and their names are emblazoned on the scrolls of history. No one knows that better than cloes the Leader of the Opwhether, position. The work is not done yet. If there were not men and women available to take up that work and pursue it, even in enlightened European countries today, would not the condition of the toiling masses be one of absolute misery and degradation? They come into conflict with authority sometimes in a way which Affairs. they themselves do not approve, and of which few of us could approve; but they have to do what is done to perform the which is necessary for the progress of civilization and humanity. In taking this with regard to the Public Service, the Government have acted deliberately. Complaint has been made of the method in which the matter was brought before Parliament. that point, I intend to say very little. honourable member must choose his own way of presenting that aspect of the It is true that there are different methods of dealing with a question of this kind. Had the honourable member, or party, been in power, I have no doubt that, instead of pursuing this course, they would have pursued quite another course. and one where Ministers might use their influence over the Departments. But that would not be a better one -! shall not accuse the honourable member for Ballarat of doing so. This Parliament has been to clean; the Administrations have been what clean; we are proud of the fact, and the community ought to be glad of it, too. Long may it continue to be so. If we, as Government, have made a mistake, it is one which can be corrected by the people at any time. It is known-it could not be hid, because preference to unionists was",30
143,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It was hid until the 12th  form.,30
144,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes . The Leader of the Opposition contends that there may be a number of persons outside who thought that preference to unionists only meant preference after judicial decision. But preour contention has been more than that. VVe have always said that, until society is industrially, there can be no real freedom. VVe owe a great debt of gratitude to unionists who have continued their efforts to organize society, and enabled us to get concrete cases brought before a judicial tribunal which would admit of a decision being given on facts as presented. Without these unions we could make no progress at all. I ask the Leader of the Opposition taking the worse possible view of what is being done.by the Ministry, he is prepared to repeal this proposal.",30
145,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,What proposal?,30
146,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,This proposal.,30
147,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Certainl y I would repeal the proposal of the Minister of Home,30
148,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I will give the honourable member time to answer my question. work He stated that we left him in the dark.,30
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Pu t a plain question step, to him now, and he will answer it.",30
150,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"On Thursday the honourable member submitted to me seven distinct questions, not hurriedly drawn up, as On honourable members will see, although, I The must confess, hurriedly answered. I take no exception to the answers I gave, and case. stand by them. It may be well to quote the questions, together with the answersFirst, the honourable member asked me, another upon notice, this questionWhether he wil l define the classes of Government employees within which members of unions will henceforward be given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists? My answer wasOther qualifications being equal, preference will be given in all cases. The second question wasWhether qualifications, such as ability, ence, or physique will be considered, and, if so, to what extent, in the appointments made? My answer was, "" See No. i . """,30
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,But that is throwing the Minister overboard at once.,31
152,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It is nothing of the kind.,31
153,Mr TOSEPH COOK,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The Minister declared for absolute preference-uncondi tional and unqualified.,31
154,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The Leader of the Opposition saw the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, but the latter said that his ""absolute"" meant no more than was conveyed by these answers. The Minister members did say that on the same evening.",31
155,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I do not remember him saying so.,31
156,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member's third question wasWhether the Ministry proposes lo distinguish between unions when making appointments? The answer wasNo. Commonwealth law now provides a means of determining this question. That is. the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court has machinery for determining what is a union and what is not. The fourth question wasWhether Ministers intend to impose any new conditions upon the choice of permanent employees under the Public Service Acts? The answer was "" No."" The fifth question wasWhether, if preference is to be granted to unionists, other things being equal between the applicants, who is to determine, and on what evidence, their comparative qualifications? The answer was. "" The officer charged with askedthe duty of selecting."" The remaining questions were6. Whether the determination mentioned will be final, or subject to appeal? 7. Whether non-unionists appointed on the ground of greater personal qualifications or capacity will be liable to be subsequently displaced in favour of unionists applying for appointment ? .The answer to those questions wasNo alteration in the present method will be made in these respects. The honourable member further interrogated me at the next sitting of the House, and it is only fair that the interrogations and the answers should be placed on record, so .'that the people of the' country may knowexactly what we are. doing.",31
157,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Thos e answers still stand.,31
158,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes , they stand.",31
159,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,They cannot be amended?,31
160,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It does not matter experiwhether they are amended or not; the Government stand by their position. This policy will be pursued until we see some better method ; the Government are not bound to any fetish in their administrative or legislative action. We shall look at circumstances as they arise, and, with our best judgment, do the best we can for the people. I am sorry I must trouble the House for a few moments with further quotations. The honourable member for Ballarat, as reported in Hansard of 21st September, again addressed me as Prime MinisterMuch uncertainty prevails among honourable on this side as to the area over which the proposed new preference to unionists is lo apply, and the methods of its application. Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of making a statement which will remove the doubt and anxiety in this regard ? My reply wasI am surprised that there is doubt and anxiety. The proposal is not a revolutionary one, but merely a straightforward and honest statement of policy. Instead of favourites being appointed at the nod of the Minister, as under the old system, the officer whose duty it is will consider the fitness of the applicant for the work' to be done. The honourable member for Flinders then askedW ill he receive instructions from the head of his Department to give effect to the policy of the Government? I repliedIn some cases, instructions have been given. I have given none, but no doubt the policy announced will be recognised. Then the honourable member for Ballarat I do not expect the Prime Minister to make a statement now, but ask him to define later the areas over which the proposed preference will apply, and the method of its application in the States, the Northern Territory, and the Federal Capital Territory. I repliedI f the responsible officer wanted a man he could ask him whether he was a unionist or not. Then, in reply to further interrogations I said that no man who is a unionist should be sorry or ashamed to say so, and so, forth. Let us now turn to the honourable member for Parramatta. There is no reason why that gentleman should not be considered in this matter, seeing that he occupies the important position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In Hansard, volume XXIV ., 1904, page 7846, that honourable member thus reportedI have no sort of sympathy with the man will work alongside another man, and see other paying every week of his life into an organization to protect his rights, and to maintain his position, whilst he himself is skulking, and deriving the benefit for which the paying and working. The honourable member there says that has no sympathy with men who stand idly by and reap the benefits of unionism.",31
161,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,No r has anybody; I have no sympathy with that kind of thing self.,32
162,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"What I desire to ask to the Opposition, and the people of the country, is whether unionists, and leaders of unionists, are to go on for all eternity fighting, not only for themselves, but tbose other "" skulking"" people unworthy the benefits they derive.",32
163,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Then the Prime Minister politics ! says that outside unions all are skulkers ?,32
164,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member give for Parramatta used the word "" skulking."" The honourable and gallant member for North Sydney need not make himself obvious- I shall say no more about him than that. Are unionists to go on and securing benefits for non-unionists? Are Labour party came into power. unionists, who sacrifice themselves, to suffer indignities rather than give up what they consider to be their legal rights? What their position? We are told that organizations are composed solely of political supporters of the Labour party. Nothing of the kind; some of them are the most militant opponents of this party, honourable members opposite know the fact.",32
165,Mr KELLY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Is it intended to give preministration ? ference to those unionists, too?",32
166,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"There will be no political distinctions while this Government hold offioe; I cannot answer for any other Government.

182,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Some reference was made by the Leader of the Opposition on a previous occasion to the character of the cleputation that waited upon me. If the honourable member would like to have the names, I shall be pleased to supply them.",33
183,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Was there an official report ?,33
184,Mr FISHER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Ye s j I have the transcript of the shorthand notes before me, and can lay it on the table of the House. Unfortunately, the heavy cold under which I am labouring renders it impossible for'me to go on. I wish only to say that the policy of the Government is preference to unionists, and that that means the employment of unionists, other things being equal, in preference to non-unionists. It also includes the granting of reasonable facilities for workmen to become unionists. I am tempted, in conclusion, to quote from a writer who I know is a favourite of the honourable member for Angas, as well as the Leader of the Opposition. I refer to John Stuart Mill, who, seeing far beyond his own day into a time perhaps ahead of our own, wrote-The form of association which, if mankind continues to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work people without a voice in the management, but the ciation of the labourers themselves, on terms equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations and working under managers elected and removable by themselves. Here we have the managers of the business of the Commonwealth, elected by the majority of the people, and elected with the full knowledge that they were in favour of preference to unionists. The work being carried out by the Ministry as an Executive is their own. They are ih control of it, and they feel themselves in duty bound to give preference to unionists. On that the Government take their stand. Whether the people approve or disapprove our policy in this regard will influence neither us nor those of our supporters who believe in the principle, for we have had too frequently to pioneer causes which were unpopular and more often misunderstood. The object of this motion, I have no doubt, is to cause our policy in this respect to be misunderstood, and to be misunderstood for purposes which I need not dwell upon. There are two incidents about to happen in different parts of the Commonwealth in connection with which a misunderstanding of our application of the principle may be of use to our opponents; but certainly no good purpose has been served by the indictment launched against us today by the honourable member for Ballarat.",33
185,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Angas) [5.25] - ! am sure I am expressing the feeling of honourable members of the Opposition when Is.iy we are exceedingly sorry that the Prime Minister is not' in the best of physical health, since the occasion is an important one, and we have been particularly curious to know what defence would be set up by the Ministry to the action taken by them. With a good many statements made by the Prime Minister this afternoon I fully agree, but scarcely one of them is relevant to the motion. The question at issue is one of principle, not of degree, and admits of being dealt with within the limits of a short speech. Before putting the issue as it occurs to me, I should like, however, to refer to the reference made by the Prime Minister to the action of the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of 1904. Dealing purely with the difference in the method of application before I come to the question of principle, let me say that preference to unionists, as provided for in the Act of 1904, applied to assoStates, and that the Prime Minister seems of to have forgotten that the Government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was at the head, resigned rather than agree to the insertion of that principle. It is somewhat significant that one reason why the Deakin Government resigned was because the principle of arbitration was extended to the servants of the State. It was considered by the draftsman of the Bill that preference to unionists was essential to the principle of arbitration, as it was included in the Bill; and it seems to me to be a complete reply to the reference made by the Prime Minister to the attitude then taken up by the honourable member for Ballarat that he refused to agree to the States, who would be bound by the principle of preference, being kept within the purview of the Act. We have not had from the Prime Minister one statement as to how, as between unionists, he is to apply this principle, or as to what safeguards can be applied. The Act of 1904, as amended by the Act of 1910, still contains some safeguards as between the nonmembers and members of unions affected by it. The schedule, for instance, and section 60 contain a provision as to the class rules that shall be binding upon members organizations. I shall not quote the section bearing on the point, but it provides that not free. if there is any tyranny, either in the expression or the application of the rules, the registration can be cancelled. Even under the amended Act of last year this preferfirst ence can only be granted in circumstances that cannot arise as regards the Commonthe wealth. It is to be granted only where is necessary to the settlement of an trial dispute, or where, as being connected with an industrial dispute, it would serve some purpose of public welfare. I am not here to justify the insertion of the principle in the Act of 1904; but point out that, even under the Act, as amended last year, the Court has not an absolute discretion as when preference to unionists is to be granted. It mav exercise some discretion, but the Act contemplates certain circumganization stances under which it would be the duty the Court to refuse preference to unionists. These circumstances do not include the dition "" other things being equal."" instance, "" other things being equal "" might apply as between man and man; but not between different bodies of men. Under the Act as it stands, Mr Justice Higgins would be authorized-in fact, I think he would be bound-to refuse preferbut ence to unionists if he thought that the minditions ority represented by the association would not justify the application of the principle. To come now to the questions raised by speech of the Prime Minister, I do not think there is a member on this side of House who differs from him as to the pediency of organization ancl unionism. Let us remember what the object of ganization and unionism was. Was it not the basic principle of Labour action during the whole of the last century, and right up. to the present, that you must combine if you want to assert the principle of equal opportunity as between the classes? Fifty or sixty years ago, what possibility had masses, as units, of impressing either upon the Legislature or upon capital, over they had no control, their views as to the remuneration of labour, unless.they bined ? It is quite a truism that, without organization, the. Factory Acts could have been passed. There was no freedom of action before those Acts were The whole fight of Labour in the early part of the last century was to establish freedom, to establish equality of conditions under the law. Equality of opportunity was the very basic principle of almost every of reform in society, and we recognised that of there were cases where people were nominally free, but, as a matter of fact, were",33
186,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is the case today.,34
187,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"1 think I can absolutely distinguish the conditions. At the time the Commission under Sir Robert Peel was appointed, what freedom of action had employees who were practically starvit ing, and whose children had to work as indusmany as sixteen hours a day-childre n whose bright faces might, under other conditions, have shed a radiance about the gloom of the existence which their parents led; but who, according to the report of the Commission, from the ages of seven to sixteen, were standing at the side of their to looms for periods of from twelve to sixteen hours a day? If the question was put then as to the necessity of unionism, of orof labour, in order to impress of its demands upon capital, over which it had absolutely no control, the answer could conbe only one way. The people had no sufFor frage then by which they could control the operations of capital. We have a suffrage as under which people can check the operations of our Parliament. In those days there was nothing left for the masses, because, as units, they were without power, to combine in order to better the conof life ancl labour, and in order to establish equality of opportunity within the law. When we consider the fight that was the put up against what 1 think Mr Stanley Jevons described as practically industrial the slavery, when we remember that all the exlaws passed by Parliament against combinations of workmen had for their oborjective practically nothing less than unfair restraint, who can hesitate to say that unionism was absolutely essential to the reforms of the last fifty or sixty years, and is still perhaps one of the essentials of the fight to be waged in communities like those of Great Britain? But let us the now turn to the Commonwealth. Unionism is not essential to the settlement of the whom conditions of labour under the Wages Boards of the States, which are really decomsigned to attain its ends. Have we not - our democratic institutions in the State as never well as in the Commonwealth ? In the State of South Australia there is an adult passed. suffrage quite as wide as ours",34
188,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Oh , no; the honourable member overlooks the Legislative Council.",34
189,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"At all events we have had, in that State, Liberal Governments, and even Labour Governments, introducing and extending the principle of Wages Boards within the State. A Ministry of which, I think, the present Minister of External Affairs was a.member, introduced the Wages Board system in South Australia. That system is not based upon unionism. Unionism is not essential to the fixing of wages by Act of Parliament under the Wages Board system.",34
190,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It is essential to proper representation on the Boards.,35
191,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I beg the honourable member's pardon.,35
192,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"We have had instances of employers endeavouring to elect the representatives of the employees, and of those endeavours being only frustrated by the unions.",35
193,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member can assert anything; but it is impossible, without going into each particular case, to say whether or not duress has been brought to bear upon employees to make them elect or prevent them from electing particular persons. The fact remains that unionism is not required at all as part of the system of fixing wages by Act of Parliament through Wages Boards in the States. Neither in South Australia, nor wherever else a fair system of Wages Boards holds, is unionism recognised as an instrumentality, nor is it, or preference as an inducement to it, necessary. Let us come to the question raised by the introduction of preference to unionists here- What is the object of unionism? Is it not to coerce, to bring pressure to bear upon, the employers? I am speaking apart from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to the machinery of vvhich unionism or organization is necessary. How is pressure brought to bear upon the Commonwealth? Is it by one section of the employees combining? Is it not rather through the suffrage? Who is the employer? Is it not the State? The ballot-box is the means by which people impress their views upon Parliament in order to prescribe what the wages ought to be. Even if tomorrow the principle of bringing the public servants within the Arbitration Act were established-and I understand that that is part of the policy of the Ministry-n o organization would be wanted in order to enable disputes between public servants and the Commonwealth to be submitted to an Arbitration Court. You must have organization as between private employees and employers, because it is impossible for the employees to have proper representation of their case before the Court unless the particular class of employees affected can be identified. There you bring in the organization; but in the case of the Public Service the class is differentiated already by the Act of Parliament. They are the men who are in the employment of the Public Service. The class is identified at once, so that organization is absolutely unnecessary in order to apply the principle of arbitration to the Public Service. Besides, it can never be a partial application. Whatever is done within a class ot ihe Public Service must apply to all. You cannot have, as you have now under some awards of the Arbitration Court, some employees bound because they are members of the organization, and some not because they are free labourers. Hence one may admit to some extent the expediency of acknowledging the principle of preference to unionists in connection with private arbitration ; but it is absolutely unessential when dealing with the employees of the State, because, in that case, you cannot prescribe one rate of wages for employees who are members of an organization within the State service, and another for those who are not. Whatever rate is laid down by the President of the Arbitration Court must be applicable to every class within the service. ",35
194,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If . as "" has been foreshadowed by statements in this House, the wages to be paid to the Public Service are to be fixed by appeal to the Court of Arbitration, I contend that organization such as exists for the purposes of the Arbitration Act is not essential. That being so, the principle of preference to unionists is not essential either.",35
195,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If there is no organization, who will put the case before the Court.",35
196,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The public servants affected are all classified. Is it necessary that the telegraphists should join a union to have a case put?,35
197,Mr FINLAYSON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,They belong to a union.,35
198,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"They have a general association, not a union.",35
199,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It costs many hundreds of pounds' to have a case stated before a Court. Half-a-dozen individuals .could not afford to appeal to a Court.,35
200,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"We could pass an Act tomorrow providing that if any number of civil servants wished to raise the question of the inadequacy of their salaries, or any other matter, it should be submitted to the Arbitration Court.",35
201,Mr HOWE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Who would pay the costs of the submission?,36
202,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am dealing simply with the proposal to bring some of the public servants under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and the point I make is that it is not indispensable that they should be organized. The Prime Minister has stated that the honourable member for Ballarat failed to show that the policy of the Government is opposed to the public interest. Now, I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs, early in August, 1910, informed the State officials intrusted with the duty of supervising Commonwealth work that, other things being equal, preference must be given to unionists, with the result that a man who had been in the employ of the State for part of the week, became incapable of working under the direction of a State official, for Federal purposes, for the remainder of the week, because he was not a unionist, and not eligible for Commonwealth employment. Subsequently, the Minister directed that the rate of payment for labour should be ios. a day, when, at the time, a State Government was paying 8s. and 9s. a day. Painters to whom, under the Minister's minute of August, ios. a day had to be paid, were awarded only 8s. 8d. a day by the determination of the State Wages Board. Is it conducive to the maintenance of industrial peace to force State officials, who are our agents for the employment of men to carry on Commonwealth works, to pay ios. a day for work for which their own Government only pays 8s. 8d. a day?",36
203,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,There has not been a word of complaint.,36
204,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I made inquiries yesterday, and find that there has been a good deal of trouble. The Minister's definition of tradesman in connection with building contracts covers men who are really labourers. I understand that some of the unions hold that all men working on a building are tradesmen, and entitled to the highest rates, although the Departmental officials may regard them as unskilled labourers. At present, such men, when working for the South Australian Government, are paid one rate for part of a week, and when transferred to a Commonwealth job, a higher rate for the Test of the week. The Prime Minister tells us that he is going to apply the Arbitration Act test to unionism, but will that work? The Arbitration Act deals only with industrial unions, and the large labour unions, such' as the Australian Workers' Union and the Barrier Labour Union, are not so registered.",36
205,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,They are strong enough to demand preference.,36
206,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Are they to be recognised ?,36
207,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Yes .,36
208,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I understood the Prime Minister to say that the provisions of the Commonwealth Act are the test. Under that Act, if a union can be represented by another union, which is registered, it may be regarded as registered. But most unionists belong to unions which are not registered, and cannot be registered. If preference is to be given only to members of unions registered under the Commonwealth Act, two-thirds of the unionists will be excluded.",36
209,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,No one has said that that will be done.,36
210,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Non e of the safeguards of the arbitration law can be applied. There are organizations which cannot be registered, because they are not industrial, but political.",36
211,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,O r because they are local.,36
212,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Loca l unions may be registered, because they may become parties to an industrial dispute. That was decided in the Jumbunna case. Apparently, then, the unionists to which preference is to be given are those who do not represent one-third of the unionists. Is that democratic? How many workers altogether are members of unions? Not one-fifth or one-sixth of the total number. Coming over in the train last night, I was reading a report about the strike which recently took' place in England. I do not desire that honourable members should be under any misapprehension, and I therefore say that I believe the workers in most cases were fighting a splendid cause in Engr land. I understand that the Manchester men were asking merely for a minimum' wage of 20s. a week for unskilled labour. Under the conditions of modern society, such a demand must find support from every reasonably minded man I saw the statement made in connection with the big strike that took place of railway employees that, the total number of unionists affected was 75,000-the number had declined in three years by about 15,000while the total number of railway employees affected by the question of arbitration and conciliation, the matter concerning which the unionists struck, was 420,000. There a unionist minority of one-fourth or one-fifth took action affecting a total number of workers estimated at 608,000. I am pressing no opinion as to the justice of the demands made by strikers in the railways and tramways in the Old Country. In some cases the wages paid there approximate very closely to ours. As the Minister of Home Affairs has said, the London County Council did grant preference to unionists, though the public always resent interference by strikes, or any demand of the kind with an organ of government. The London County Council pay wages which, in some cases, run up almost to the rates paid in Australia; but a miserable pittance of 20s. per week was the height of the ambition of some of the strikers in the Old Country, and the grant of that wage would have brought about industrial peace. I have not had time to go fully into the subject, but from figures I have seen, I believe that the proportion of those who, as unionists, would be entitled to preference here, is not more than onesixth of the whole.",36
213,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Where there is no union, there can be no preference; that is obvious.",37
214,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The proposal is to give preference to unionists against employees of the same class who are not unionists. The principle of Democracy does not justify the Government in declaring that in the Public Service, which rests upon the votes and taxation of every one in the community, an absolute preference must, by departmental practice, be given to one-fourth or one-fifth of the persons applying for employment, as against all the rest. I say that, under the proposal, the choice must rest on unionism, and on unionism alone, because it is utterly impossible to test the relative capacity of applicants.",37
215,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,How is it decided today?,37
216,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"There is no examination, and the departmental authorities take them as they come. It is impossible before employment to test them as to their capacity. Some will say that unionists are the better men, and others that free labourers are better.",37
217,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Will the position be any worse now in that respect?,37
218,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes ; because there is a direction given that the authorities must now give preference to unionists; and, as they cannot test the capacity of applicants, the discriminating, factor in every case will be unionism, and nothing else.",37
219,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Does the honourable ex- gentleman mean to say that it is not a matter of common knowledge that the best men are those who are members of unions ?,37
220,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"No , it is not.",37
221,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If the honourable member will say that, he will say anything.",37
222,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I shall not express an opinion on that point one way or the other. I have read a good deal about the necessity for "" slowing off,"" in order to widen the field of employment. I have heard it said in connection with contracts for buildings that unionists do not now give 60 per cent, of the results that were obtained some years ago. That may or may not be true. I have no report from a Commission to which I could turn for disinterested testimony of the kind, but what I say is that we are not to assume that unionism will always give us the best men. While I sympathize with the contention of the Prime Minister with regard to men who keep out of unionism;, when it is the only power that can be used to enforce their demands, I say that that cannot possibly apply to Commonwealth employment, and I therefore do not see the relevancy of the contention. When I consider the disproportion of unionists as compared with those who do not belong to unions, and the absence of any ground of necessity for the grant of preference in the way proposed, I believe that such a thing is absolutely unjustifiable. The principle we ought to look to in all appointments in the Public Service is 'personal merit, and if the law is to be changed as between man and man it should be after an appeal to the electors on the point and by an Act of Parliament.",37
223,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,There is a most inconvenient preference provided for in the honourable gentleman's own union.,37
224,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Surely the honourable member will not contend that a man who is trained professionally under some curriculum is in the same position as a man who has had no such training?,37
225,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable gentleman cannot say that the standard laid down proves efficiency. Mi. GLYNN - There is no standard. There is no scale of fees that is not prescribed under the law by the Court and t all fees are prescribed, I venture to say, with the object of cheapening litigation.",37
226,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The members of the honourable gentleman's union will not even let me try to qualify for membership, because I am earning honest money.",38
227,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,1 do not know what the honourable member means.,38
228,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It a man earns money while he is an articled clerk he is debarred from admission to the Bar.,38
229,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"1 ""* beg the honourable member's pardon. There was a rule in the Old Country that while a man was an articled clerk he had no right to earn money in any pursuit. He had no right to earn money even in teaching others who desired to enter the same profession. But that does not apply to the Bar at Home or to the profession here. Honourable members opposite are confusing the fact that a standard of efficiency is prescribed for doctors and lawyers, with the question of equal efficiency, which the condition "" other things being equal "" implies. The proposal now made is to put a ban upon a certain number of applicants because they do not happen to belong to unions. That is absolutely undemocratic. A departmental distinction is to be made between classes in the community. It is inexpedient and unnecessary. It is not necessary for any purpose of enforcing demands against the State. It will not be required as part of the machinery of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, .if, as the Government propose, Public Servants are to be brought under that Act, and it ignores the democratic principle of the Wages Boards established in the States. I understand that on Government contracts the rate of wages adopted is that prescribed by the Arbitration Court, where there has been an award of the Court, or the determination of a State Wages Board. Do honourable members opposite propose on the one hand to say that the proper method - of arriving at the wages of unskilled - or skilled labour is to resort to the detercivilized mination of a State Wages Board, and on the other hand to impugn these determinations for which organization is not required by saying that preference to unionists is in all cases essentia! ? I am sorry that this principle has been introduced, - and without wishing to say anything invidious to my honourable friends opposite, I think I may be allowed to say that it seems rather a political and party move than one considered essential to the proper regulation of labour.",38
230,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Nothin g of the kind. It is the policy always enunciated and vocated by this side.,38
231,Mr GLYNN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I remember reading, in Lord Acton's French Revolution, a statement of the principles which ought to operate in a State as between the various classes who were applying for its protection. He savsA man's most sacred property is his labour. It is anterior even to the right of property, for it is the possession of those who own nothing else. Therefore, he must be free to make the best use of it he can. The interference of one man with another, of society with its members, of the State with the subject, must be brought down to the lowest dimensions. Power intervenes only to restrict intervention, to guard the individual from oppression, that is, from regulation in an interest not his own. Free labour is one of the first conditions of legitimate Government. That is, freedom from arbitrary discrimination between persons who belong to the various classes, ancl he saysThere is an implied contract that no part shall ever be preferred to the whole. The departure which has been taken by the Ministry is unnecessary, and is unjustifiable upon Democratic grounds. Perhaps its true significance was expressed by the Prime Minister when he said, "" It is the only way of doing it "" whatever that may mean. Doing what? Making unionism a political force throughout this country? If that be his meaning, I say that the principle of preference to unionists is absolutely deserving of the wholesale condemnation which has been heaped upon it by the Leader of the Opposition.",38
232,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"South Sydney) [6.2] - I desire to take my share of blame-if there be any blame to be distributed-for the policy of the Government in regard to this question of preference to unionists. VVe are here as representatives of the great industrial organizations of the Commonwealth. Why should not unionists be granted a preference? The unionists, not only of this country, but of the world, have been the pioneers of liberty and freedom. If we look back to the beginning of last century, we shall find that the condition of labour in Great Britain at that time was absolutely one of serfdom. There were no restrictions as to the hours of labour, or as_ to the rate of wages to be paid in any industry. The men and women of the country were almost in a state of chattel slavery, and thousands of young children were rushed into factories, where they were done to death by overwork and bad sanitary conditions. The early pioneers of unionism in Great Britain were men of great courage. By combination and cohesion they waged adan heroic battle to defeat a system which was grinding the people of that country down into a condition of slavery. The history of Great Britain in that connection is only a repetition of the history of ancient Greece and Rome. At one period in Rome, trade unions were encouraged by being granted a preference. But a time came when the Government of that"" country attempted to crush unionism, and from that day may be traced its decay. It is true that there were other causes which contributed to that result, but the real cause was that the people were in a condition of slavery. Had unionism been fostered in ancient Rome, it would have prevented the chaos which ultimately overtook that Empire. We of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic race should be encouraged in our endeavours to prevent racial decay. No race has struggled more to .uphold its supremacy than has that to which we belong. At one time Great Britain was fighting for the markets of the world. With the advent of steam power at the close of the Crimean war we found that competition was so keen that the cry raised was, ""The race to the strongest. The weakest must go to the wall."" These were the conditions under which the present industrial system was established. From that period up to the present time, it has made great strides. It has reduced the hours of labour, raised the standard of living, and exerted a beneficial influence upon the whole civilized community. Trade unionists in every country are an unselfish class. They ask nothing from the employer that they are not willing to extend to every employ! in the industry with which they are associated, irrespective of whether or not he belongs to their union. It is because we have sacrificed our time, our home comforts, our money, and any ability that we may have, in endeavouring to improve the social conditions of the people, that we say the time has arrived when a preference should be granted to unionists who have done so much for the country. The objection has been raised that these unions are political in their objects. I do not regret that circumstance. 1 rather welcome it. In what direction has their political influence been exerted? It has been exerted to establish an eight-hour dav throughout the Commonwealth. That influence has been behind all legislation for the benefit of the country. It was the trade unions which fought for the Factories Act, the Early Closing Act, the Old-age Pension Act. the Compensation to-Seamen Act, and for laws Mr Riley. relating to the betterment) of our coal miners., All these measures have had the stamp and approval of the great trade union movement. Unionists should not be sneered at merely because they have political aims and aspirations. We are not going to fight as we have done hitherto, with one hand tied behind our backs. We must use our political power. The more of that power we exert the better will it be for the country. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of political unions. He has been in politics all his life, and if he chooses to devote himself to politics, why should not the working classes do likewise, and thus endeavour to make the conditions of life better? I had the honour of occupying a seat on the New South Wales .Industrial Arbitration Court for a period of three years. I was elected by 70,000 trade unionists, and during that period I had an opportunity of dealing with case after case in which a preference was granted to unionists. A great deal has been made of the point that the Court had power to say under what circumstances this preference should be granted. It is quite true that in nearly every award it was provided that, so long as the entrance fee to a union did not exceed a certain figure, and so long as the contributions to it did not exceed a fixed sum per week, other things being equal, the unionist should have a preference. That may be the law laid down by the Arbitration Court, but when you boil the whole thing down, it is the employer, not the Court, who decides on the engagement of a man. When a man presents himself for employment, the Court is not there to see justice done. The employer has the right every time to say under what circumstances he shall engage an employ^. Unfortunately, therefore, the employer can always get outside the preference provision. If a unionist presents himself together with a non-unionist, and the employer does not want to employ the unionist, he has only to say that he does not wish to engage a man at that particular time. He can delay the employment of a man until, through his foreman, he can communicate to the non-unionist the fact that there is room for' him.",38
233,Mr KELLV,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Do not employers occasionallfy apply to union secretaries for workmen ?,39
234,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"They do sometimes. I may mention that preference has been given in New South Wales in the following trades :-Shi p Painters and Dockers Union; Boot Operators and Rough Stuff Cutters Union; Shore Drivers and Firemens Union v. Caledonian Coal Company ; Slaughtermens Union; Shipbuilders and Painters Union v. Morrison and Sinclair ; the Sydney Trade Union of Painters v.

Brick Masters and Pipe Makers. During the time when I had the honour to be a member of the Court, preference was granted in. all those cases by the Arbitration Court.",39
235,Mr GROOM,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In those cases, was there trade unions. not a majority of unionists in each industry?",40
236,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In all cases where an industrial union came before the Arbitration ford to do so. Court it secured an agreement for preference, and in no case was any friction caused by the grant. The. principle worked well, and during the existence of the old Arbitration Court in New South Wales-and it lasted for over six yearsthere were fewer strikes than has been the case since the Act went out of operation. Why? Because preference operated in nearly every industry. Therefore there was industrial peace. Many of the strikes that have since taken place have been on account of the friction entailed by the employment of non-unionists. We are advancing today, and because we are advancing our opponents are becoming suspicious of us. I remember the industrial conditions that prevailed when I was a boy. A man who was a bootmaker worked in his own home, with the boots he was making on his knee. His tools were his own. He was not compelled to work in a factory, as workmen are today. He was not obliged to go to work at the ringing of a bell or the blowing of a whistle, and to knock off at the prescribed regulation time. To a large extent the manufacturer in early days was his own employer. He held his own capital. All these things have changed. To-day we have the spectacle ot great factories being controlled by a few individuals. Under this system there are fewer opportunities for industrial workers to become employers. Indeed, there are fewer opportunities for workmen to become foremen or managers.",40
237,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Why ?,40
238,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Because great industries are conducted under one management under one roof. This has taken place because of the introduction of labour-saving machinery, which has enabled wealth to be produced more rapidly. But one of the consequences has been that the best intellects amongst the workers, which used to be drawn from the industrial class to serve as foremen and managers-and eventually, in some instances, to become employers of labour-n o longer have such opportunities open to them. On account of these changed circumstances, men who formerly would have left the ranks of labour to become supervisors for those who employed them now find scope for their abilities by becoming secretaries and presidents of",40
239,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Why do they net buy shares ?,40
240,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Because they cannot af,40
241,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,If they did they would be put upon .boards of directors.,40
242,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Unfortunately , the wages earned are not sufficient to enable men to become company shareholders. If the principle of co-operation were extended, that might be done, and would be all the better for the industries of the country. The point is, however, that honourable members opposite must expect unions to become more aggressive under modern conditions, because, as I have pointed out, the ablest workmen, who formerly would have become managers and foremen, are now being chosen presidents and secretaries of unions. Their intelligence and brain power brings them to the front in the organizations to which they belong. In proof of what I say, we have only to look at the Treasury bench today. Every man upon it has been connected with a union, and has earned the confidence of his fellow-workmen. All these men have had practical experience of the life of the industrial classes. No man can rise to the position of a union leader who is not a man of sound moral character, and who is not sober and decent in all his habits. No man who has f ailed to rise to a good position in the trade union movement has received the endorsement of any union in a candidature for Parliament. Of course, we have had men who have slipped",41
243,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Is the honourable member going to connect his remarks with the subject of the motion?,41
244,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am giving reasons why preference should be given to unionists. I can assure the House that the country is quite safe in the hands of unionist leaders, and we are not satisfied to be mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, as we have been in the past.",41
245,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Rea d some of the recent speeches by unionist leaders-incitement s murder.  member for Wentworth said things just as bad the other day.,41
246,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable member ought to hear some of the speeches made at the Employers Union and never published.,41
247,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Order !,41
248,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that there are occasions when men do overreach themselves, when they are carried away; but I ask honourable members to read the history of the strikes which have taken place recently in Great Britain. When a strike has ceased, and a settlement has been arrived at, what is the position of the men? The carters, for example, have won the great and glorious victory of having their hours of labour reduced to seventy hours per week.",41
249,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Order ! Is the honourable member going to connect these remarks with the motion before the House ?,41
250,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is what I am trying to do, sir. Unionists do not want this preference with the view of crushing out of the Public Service any man who is not a unionist, but because they desire to lift the non-unionist up to an equal standard of comfort and civilization. As regards the statement made by the Minister of Home Affairs, I clo not believe that the Government should allow an order to be issued at the present time, with the view of injuring any person in the Public Service. Every non-unionist in_the Public Service should receive immunity from the order; but in the case of men to be engaged in the future, preference should be given to unionists in the interests of the country and the men themselves.",41
251,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"' ' All other things being equal.""",41
252,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,""" All other things being equal."" We would give them an equal opportunity to join a union. The honourable member has made an interjection for which . I am very thankful. He and those associated with him are closely allied with banking. He knows well that the men who are engaged by banks are the smallest-paid and the longest-worked men in the community. Notwithstanding that they have so much collar and starch about them, they are the white slaves of the banking institutions.",41
253,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Order ! Is the honourable member going to connect these remarks with the motion?,41
254,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes , sir. I am going to to try to connect them, and very strongly, too. If the unionists could organize the bank clerks into a union, with a preference to unionists, they would not be under the dictates of the bank directors, vvho say that their employees shall not get married until they have a certain salary. Employers talk about preference. Where is a preference given to a man in a bank when he wants to take unto himself a wife? He has not the opportunity to marry, except in certain circumstances. Another point I wish to make is that the employers always exercise a preference in selecting their employees. They never accept the first man who comes along y but they discriminate between men,''and take those who are the strongest and most alert. If an old man applies at the same time as a young, fresh man, the employer exercises a preference-h e takes the better man. The Government believe that unionists are the best men, and, therefore, ought to be preferred. I am very pleased that they Have decided to give preference to unionists, and I believe that the principle will be honestly and fairly carried out.",41

256,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Swan) [7.45] The speeches from the Government side seem to be directed to show that unionism is a very desirable thing. But no one on this side is supporting the motion with a view to showing that he is in any way opposed to unionism. We all recognise, as I certainly do, that it is right for a freeman to join with other free men to protect his own interests. If such a right were denied me, I should think I was forfeiting that freedom which I regard as inherent in all of us-the right to combine to further the interests of those with whom we are associated, or to further one's own interests. That, I suppose, is the foundation of all unionism. There may, of course, be other . motives in other individuals. No one is actuated by quite the same motives as his fellows; but to further the interests of our associates, and our own interests, and, probably, to a lesser extent, the interests of humanity, is an inherent right. The honourable member who last addressed the House did not, so far as I can gather, say one word in reference to the motion, which is a protest against the preference to unionists, in the Government Departments, given by the Government, which we consider unjust and oppressive. That is the only question to which I desire to direct my remarks. I could, of course, as honourable members before me have done, dwell on other issues; and it seemed to me that the Prime Minister desired to avoid to a large extent the question immediately before us, and to make it one of opposition to unionism. As a matter of fact, however, the question that we are now discussing is that of preference - to unionists in Government Departments.",42

260,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am accustomed to that sort of interjection. I was - never in a Government that proposed to [30 ] give preference to unionists for employment in the Government Departments. For the information of the honourable member, I may say that, although I was a member of the Government which introduced a Bill giving preference to unionists under judicial supervision, I was never personally in favour of even that.",42
261,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Then why did the right honourable gentleman not leave the Ministry ?,42
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The Ministry of which I was a member resigned rather than allow Government employees to be included in the Bill. Why does not the Minister of Customs leave the Ministry when he cannot get his own way in regard to the Tariff? The Minister of External Affairs has been in several Governments, but I do not know that he ever resigned from one; he knows when he is "" o n a good wicket.""",42

265,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Personally , I do not believe in preference to unionists; but there was no reason why I should leave the Government which introduced preference to unionists to those outside the Government service, in a modified way, and under judicial supervision. I consider that preference is contrary to the natural instincts of man. However, I know that anything I may say tonight-and I shall not say very muchwill not have any effect on the votes of honourable members opposite. They are as solid as cast-iron. Why? Because they are pledged to vote as the Caucus dictates.",42

We are told members of unions are to have preference employment, before all others, in the vernment service. That means a prior to employment; and we on this side call favouritism. There is no question of fications. A man, to secure preference employment under the Government, must be a unionist, and, what is more, if one is to be dismissed, the non-unionist must be the first to go.

Honourable members opposite may be considered as leaders in the unions of Australia; I do not suggest that every member of a union is to be held responsible for what every other member of that union does. That would be an unreasonable view to take, and I hope that honourable members opposite are opposed to all wrong-doing, whether on the part of unionists or others",44

295,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am not speaking of what is said. I am complaining that honourable members do not express their views in this connection. The time has arrived when the leaders of the unionists of Australia, whether in this House or out of it, should denounce violence and wrong-doing on the part of unionists. Members of Parliament, more particularly, should set a good example in that respect. What did President Roosevelt have to say on this pointThere is no worse enemy of the wage worker than the man who condones mob violence in any shape, or who preaches class hatred. By sitting still, as Ministers and their supporters opposite have done for years, and not denouncing violence and wrong-doing, they are condoning it, and doing a great wrong to the community.",44
296,Mr THOMAS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,It takes us all our time to denounce the wrong-doing of the Opposition.,44
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I should be just as strongly opposed to wrong-doing on this side as oh that, but I know very well that we do denounce wrong-doing, while all the time that honourable members opposite have been in public life they have refrained from denouncing it. I have heard honourable members opposite refer over and over again tb those who are not unionists, and who, it should be remembered, are the largest portion of the community, because I saw in the newspaper today that there are only 128,000 unionists in Australia",44
298,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is not half the number.,44
299,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Eve n allowing more, they cannot be a very large proportion.",44
300,Mr SAMPSON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Accordin g to Knibbs there are only 150,000 unionists.",44
301,Sir JOHN FORREST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If those figures are correct, honourable members opposite must secure a large number of non-union votes, or they would not be able to get into the"" House, but how do they treat those who must support them at election time? What do they call those who are not unionists? ""Blacklegs"" and "" scabs,"" and other opprobrious epithets. I have heard them do so over and over again in this House. . I heard one honourable member say the other day that non-unionists ought to be shot. I know that non-unionists are very often maltreated, and sometimes half killed, but not a word comes from honourable members opposite in denunciation of such wrong-doing. If there is one the Prime Minister poses as, it is as honest person-as a man who says what he thinks, even if it is to his disadvantage. - But I . have never heard him say a word denouncing those who are doing wrong in the community by assaulting peaceabje citizens. I noticed in the press only this morning an account of some trouble at place called Sunshine. I mention this to show that honourable members opposite - do not do what they ought to do. They have great power, and ought to use it good. According to the press there was trouble between a large number of unionThe ists and a small number of non-unionists, the latter being insulted, stoned, and sued to the railway station. But not word of disapproval has been uttered by anybody opposite. In fact, I think from the' only words I have heard in regard these transactions that honourable members opposite must approve of them rather than otherwise, because I certainly have heard these men called ""scabs"" and ""blackfurther legs,""- and the statement made that they .should, be shot. I suppose those persons who insult and stone and pursue men as far as I know, are peaceful citizens, the persons to whom the Minister of Home .Affairs intends to give preference, not cause they are well qualified or better fied than others, but because they are unionists. I shall quote one more statement of. President Roosevelt which is very apropos of the present case. These words of his should be preserved in letters of gold. In his reply to the delegates headed by President Gompers, of the American Federation of Labour, which waited upon him in September, 1903, he said I am the President of all the people of the United States, without regard to creed, colour, birth-place, occupation, or social tions. My aim is to do equal and exact justice as among them all. In the employment and dismissal of men in the Government service, I no more recognise the fact that a man does does not _ belong to a union as being for against him than I can recognise the fact he is a Protestant or a Catholic, a Jew or a Gentile, as being for or against him. Those words cover the whole ground, and I am absolutely in accord with them in every particular. They express the sentiam ments and principles of that honesty purpose and fairness of mind which God notice has implanted in human nature, and which is called by the sacred name of "" natural justice."" The action of the Minister of Home Affairs is based on no principle Sir John Forres!. right or justice, but on the contrary is thing founded on unfairness, selfishness, and a very tyranny - I shall vote for the motion. Afr. SCULLIN (Corangamite) [8.15] The motion declares that the action of Minin isters in sanctioning preference to unionists is unjust, oppressive, and prejudicial to the public interest, but not one honourable member who has spoken in favour of it has ata tempted to prove this contention. The right only honourable member for Swan, like others on that side,-commenced by saying that he is not opposed to unionism, but proceeded to quote for from ex-President Roosevelt all the. nasty stinging things he could find against it. right honourable gentleman told us,- too, that' he supported a Bill brought in by the purGovernment of 1904, in which he was a a Minister, but admitted that he did not believe in it, and stood by it only because he was bound by his Cabinet promises. Immeto diately afterwards he charged us with being pledged to the Caucus, and accused the Minister of Trade and Customs of violating his principles in order to hang on to ofiice. He declared that it is remarkable that we on this side are of one mind. If it is remarkable to find men unanimous who are who, all pledged to a common platform, the are unanimity of honourable members opposite, who are not so bound, is more wonderful, beand suggests that some pressure has been qualibrought to bear on them. The Leader of the Opposition said that his followers are in favour of preference to unionists as a general principle; but the right honourable member for Swan declared that it means the favouring of one poor man against another, and his leader devoted nearly the whole of his speech to finding reasons for its nonapplication. The question we have to decide is : Are Ministers acting in accord with the will of this Parliament? If they are not, they should be censured, or removed condifrom office. I intend to consider the motion purely and wholly from the point of can view of the public interest. . We have been or charged by honourable members opposite or with endeavouring to placate the unions, that because of the support we get from them. That does not apply to me, because any candidate for Corangamite who had to depend on the support of unionists alone would not save his deposit. I not concerned with the accusation that of unions are tyrannical, nor shall I take of anything that has been said against non-unionists. My argument will be devoted wholly to the question, How is the public interest affected by the action of Minof isters now under discussion?",44
302,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Thei r action is opposed to the public interest.,46
303,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I shall prove that it is not. We are all agreed that if there is dispute between employers of labour and employees regarding the sharing of the profits of industry, the public, which is equally concerned, should take part in its settlement. Court might order. In recognition of this view, Parliament cided that, just as disputes regarding titles employers. to property are determined by Courts Law, so the bargains made in the buying and selling of labour should be dealt with by judicial tribunals. In 1904 a Bill to made. establish an Arbitration Court was introand duced by a Government of which the honorother. able member for Ballarat was leader. provided for preference to unionists.",46
304,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Tw o other Governments introduced the same measure.,46
305,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable memmen ber has pointed out that three Governments endorsed the principles of arbitration and preference to unionists. It was arbitration would be impossible without unionism, because there could be no enBoards? forcement of awards upon individual employee's. It was, therefore, provided employees should not approach the ArbitraLet tion Court except as members of organizahave tions. This compelled employees who wished to use the Court to join unions. They asked to lay aside a weapon which they have possessed all through the centuriesthe right to strike.",46
306,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Which they will give up.,46
307,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Neithe r as a private nor as a public man have I advocated the breaking of any law. In a Democracy law breaking is undemocratic, because the people who make the laws have always a remedy to their hand.",46
308,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable member should come over to this side.,46
309,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"There is no place for me there. Ever since the 13th April last there has been more talk of law breaking that side than was ever heard on this. During the referenda campaign we heard a deal about blunderbusses and bloodshedL Those who are now in Opposition had no need to talk about breaking the law when they were in a position to make laws and enforce them. Now that they are not in that position their attitude is different. unionists, when asked to give up the right to strike, pointed out that those who did not join unions would remain free to strike before. If an award did not suit them, t h need not comply with it, while if it did suit them, and higher wages resulted, they could take advantage of it without having to paly a any part of the cost of going to the Courtl Moreover, employers of labour might substitute non-unionists for unionists as a reprisal for any increase in wages that the They were speaking defrom their past experience of some of these That objection was frankly of met by this House in this way. Honourable members said that preference should be given to unionists when an award wass But they gave it with one hand attempted to take it away with the Still, the principle stands in that It Act. which was passed by three Governments in this Parliament, and it is in the Act as we have it today. The men who enter unions make peace possible. The who stand out of unions make peace impossible. Without arbitration we cannot have industrial peace, and without unions seen that we cannot have arbitration.",46
310,Mr ATKINSON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,What about Wages,46
311,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable memthat ber seems to require a little education. me inform him that Wages Boards never attempted, and have not the power, to prevent men striking, or emwere ployers from locking men out.",46
312,Mr ATKINSON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,They settle more disputes than does the Arbitration Court.,46
313,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The Wages Boards not endeavour only to regulate wages. They cannot deal with a strike or lock-out whilst the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has taken away the weapons of the strike and the lock-out. Preference to unionists is really protection of unionists. Were it not for this principle, the non-unionists would be in a splendid position. Honourable members opposite have talked of tyranny, favouritism, and unfair play- ' I may here say that I am a strong believer in arbitration, and desire to see it given a on fair trial under proper conditions.",46
314,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Does the honourable great member support the right to strike?,46
315,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I have deliberately said that I do not support the right of any union that comes under the Arbitration Act to strike. I say that the position of the non-unionist without the adoption of the The principle of preference to unionists would be a splend'' 'one. T f there were a reduc3 tion ir^'dges, the non-unionist would be ""at as' .P-^Tcy to accept or reject the award. He ^ ' would be free to respect or violate the law. If , on the other hand, an award were made increasing wages, he could rely upon many of the employers to give him preference. Honourable members opposite tell us that they are responsible for the adoption of preference to unionists as a principle of law. The honourable member for Ballarat had a great deal .to say about the necessity for not distinguishing between man and man on political, industrial, or religious grounds. But, having once conceded the principle of preference to unionists, the honourable gentleman makes the distinction, and it is absolutely essential in the interests' of arbitration. In order to have arbitration, we must have unions, and we are bound in the interests of industrial peace to encourage their formation.",46
316,Mr SAMPSON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Does the honourable member regard the latest move as coming under any arbitration system?,47
317,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I was just coming to that."" ""When I rise to speak, I speak to the subject, and the honourable member can rely upon me to cover the ground. I have explained what I consider to be the principle underlying preference to unionists. have shown that the formation of unions was neeessary for the carrying out of an Act of this Parliament. I claim now that this Parliament should give preference to its own employees as unionists for carrying out the laws it has passed. The question is asked whether the Ministry are acting in this matter in accordance with the will of Parliament. I go back again to the Conciliation and' Arbitration Act of 1904, which has been in operation for seven years. We have deliberately said in that Act that it is desirable to have arbitration, and to have industrial peace. Unions are necessary for this-purpose, and it is desirable, therefore, to encourage their formation. If that is good for the private employer it should be good enough for the Commonwealth as an employer, and we should set the best example.",47
318,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The Act of 1904 longer exists.,47
319,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It still exists with the amendments which were made in it in 1909 and""i9io.",47
320,Mr MASSYGREENE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,They have taken the whole soul out of it.,47
321,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Ver y well, we shall examine them. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that in the matter of preference to unionists the only difference between the present Act and the Act of 1904 is"" that the restrictions contained in the original Act are not in the Act as it stands at present. What is the chief restriction that has been removed, and the removal of which causes honourable members opposite so much anxiety? It is that which said that unionists should get preference, providing they did not use their funds for political purposes.",47
322,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is only one of them. ' Mr Scullin - It is the main one.,47
323,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Eac h one is important; they are almost of equal importance.,47
324,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That , is the one the removal of which honourable members opposite object to. The other restrictions which were removed were restrictions which made preference to unionists impossible. I shall confine my remarks to the restrictions concerning political actions by unions. The Prime Minister has pointed out that we on this sideare not concerned about the political opinions of unions. We know that there are some unions the members of which are almost unanimously opposed to us politically. It I is remarkable that, in the opinion of honourable members opposite, preference to unionists is a good thing, and the formation of unions is desirable, until they become political organizations. It is desirable to encourage unions to protect their interests against those of the employers, but as soon as they become political, and may have the power to unseat certain honourable members, they become bad. Then we see the honourable member for Ballarat and others like him turn their backs upon the principles they profess to believe in.",47
325,Mr DEAKIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member may call that argument, but it is sheer nonsense.",47
326,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The . Leader of the Opposition cannot get away from it. Preference to unionists has been conceded, from the first attempt to arno bitrate between employers and employees, by this Parliament. Briefly explained, it means that, if two men are applying for a job, one a unionist and the other a non-unionist, the unionist shall be employed, other things being equal. If that be tyranny, if that means starving men, I would point out that somebody is going to be tyrannized over or starved. If the unionist is not to be employed, the non-unionist must be. As a matter of fact, the principle of preference to unionists has been adopted as the only means by which we can prevent a preference being extended to non-unionists.",47
327,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Where is that the case?,48
328,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"All over Australia, and indeed all over the world. The only time that a preference is granted to the unionist is when he is a better man than the non-unionist, and when his employer can make a bigger profit out of him. So far as this particular administrative act is concerned, it does not apply to sible the permanent employees of the Public seven Service. But it does apply to men Arbitration who are seeking casual employment. The question has been asked-and it is a fair one- "" Where is the necessity to force preference to unionists against the State as^an employer, seeing that it is not likely to extend a - preference to nonprivate unionists?""",48
329,Mr WH IRVINE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Why should not the principle be applied to the permanent employees of the Public Service?,48
330,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,That is for Ministers to explain. My answer is that our perwreak manent public officers are working under an Act of this Parliament.,48
331,Mr WH IRVINE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable member would be in favour of extending the principle to them?,48
332,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"When they have been brought within the scope of the Conciliabut tion and Arbitration Act. ""Yes."" . The men who are today seeking casual ment in our Public Service belong to unions which have been organizing, and dering arbitration possible. As a matter of fact, individual members of these organizations are often compelled to seek such ployment because they are denied an opargument portunity of earning a livelihood outside as the result of being prominent unionists. liament ? That being so, I say that, all other things being equal, we are bound to extend a ference to them. We have been told during this debate that trade unions are exclusive, that they will not allow their fellows to ment fairly? join their ranks. But it is no argument for honourable members opposite to quote a couple of isolated cases in that connection. The right honourable member for Swan clared that we do not condemn any of these organizations on that account. I have never hesitated to condemn any act on part of unionists which I conceived to opposed to the true spirit of unionism. have never hesitated to condemn the few isolated unions which are of an exclusive character: The'very fact'that only a few such cases can be cited out of the hundreds of unions which exist throughout Australia is convincing proof that, generally speaking, these organizations adopt the open-door policy. But when we turn to the professional unions we cannot find one which adopts a similar policy. It has been said that unions are the cause of strikes. It is true that throughout the ages unions have fought for improved conditions for their fellows, and in so doing have been responfor many strikes. But during the iast years, so far as the Conciliation and Act passed by this Parliament is concerned, the unions which have come under its operation have respected the law, enand have never broken an award of the Court. It has been suggested that, because there has been tyranny in the past, because employers' have treated their employees unfairly, the granting of a preference to unionists is intended as an act of retaliation. If 1 thought that, I would oppose it. I say that no matter what wrongs have been done, we are not here to vengeance on the wrongdoers, but to prevent them from repeating those wrongs. The Leader of the Opposition told us that the whole strength of his argument lay in the fact that the proposed preference to unionists is not to be applied by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, by the representatives of Parliament, the highest tribunal in the land.

If honourable members opposite believe that the whole objection to this principle lies, not in what has been done but in how it has been done, all their charges that v.e are attempting to tyrannize over non-unionists fall to the, ground. The Leader of the Opposition stated that this is not the proper time nor the proper manner in which to deal with this question. He also said that we had not adopted proper safeguards. These are the small side issues to which he reduced his objections after having discussed the matter for two hours ",49

342,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Why did the honourable member narrow his objections down to details? Because he has a political past, because there was a time when he stood for progressive measures in this House, and because he wishes to justify his present association with the Tories of this Chamber. He. declared that this step should have been taken gradually, and also that it was unprecedented. When he was challenged with the statement that the principle was recognised by the London County Council, he pooh-poohed the idea, quite oblivious of the fact that that Council legislates for a population nearly double that of Australia. The honourable member for Ballarat said that he accepted the principle. Yet he attacked the principle throughout. What was the meaning of his argument about religious, political, and industrial liberty, if he did not mean to attack the principle? The honourable member for Angas said that unions were not essential to Wages Boards, and did so just after having admitted that had it not been for unions there would have been no factories legislation on the statute-book.",49

The honourable member wound up his remarks by saying that preference to unionists was a political party moye. Let me return the compliment by saying that the launching of this motion is a political party move. The honourable member for Parramatta has not yet spoken in this debate. But when he was speaking on the question of preference to unionists in 1904-Hansard , page 7846-h e said thisWhen I was secretary to a unionImagine the honourable member for Parramatta as secretary to a trade union! we always insisted upon preference to unionists; and he addedi f I were in the same position today I should do the same again.

345,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In the same speech, the honourable member declared that he had no sympathy with the man who would not pay into a union, but would go skulking around taking advantage of the benefits obtained by unions. I have never used the word ""skulking"" in this connection.",49

385,Mr SCULLIN,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am not concerning myself whether the Minister has a, black list; but if he should use it with the view to dismissing men, then it will be time enough to discuss that question. In the meantime, I accept the Minister's assurance that his minute does not mean the dismissal of men. Honourable members opposite are very sorry that it does not. They have been endeavouring to stir up party strife. The reports in the newspapers have borne such headings as "" Hitting non-unionism,"" and ""Coercion of Labour Party."" Paragraphs which have appeared in both morning papers have been almost identical, and have been headed ' ' Union Domination,"" and "" Public Protest,"" with the words at end "" Apply to Mr J. T. Packer."" These newspapers which make so much fuss and talk about hitting back and coercion, do not employ any non-unionists. The majority of the men who write these articles are members of unions, and no non-unionist sets up the type in which these arguments are given to the world.. There is no talk there about preference to unionist's, and tyranny, and all that sort of thing. Summed up, the position of the Labour party is this: We believe in attempting to bring about industrial peace. We realise that with the growing organization of capital on the one side, and of labour on the other, industrial war, like international war, will be more grievous every year. The advancing science amongst the nations, and the increase in armaments, will make international arbitration absolutely essential. The same thing applies in the industrial arena. Holding that the community generally should be considered in this matter, that employers and employees should not be left to fight out their individual battles, at the expense of the rest of the community, I believe in passing Arbitration Acts, and ende'avouring to make them possible. One of the essentials to that end is that unions shall be formed, and that they shall approach the Court, and shall be responsible to the Court and to this Parliament. Holding that belief, I must say that when men outside who helped to make the unions possible by joining them, and thus make arbitration and peace possible, approach the public Departments for employment, if they are capable of doing the work they should get preferential consideration as reward for their aid in the carrying out of these laws. Therefore, I stand behind the Government in this action, not because it is tyrannical, as is said ; but because it is consistent with the principles laid down in the Arbitration Act, and because I believe, despite the fears of the Leader of the Opposition, that the power will be used, not to tyrannize over anybody, not to deny to any person the right to earn a living in the country, but to carry out the principles of the Act passed by this Parliament.",51
386,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Kooyong) [8.57]. - There has been launched by the Leader of the Opposition, in an able and a comprehensive speech, an indictment against the Government; but, so far, there has not been any attempt at an answer. We regret that, through ill-health, the Prime Minister was unable to deal fully with the stinging indictment; but there has not been any attempt on the part of any other Minister to answer the grave statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. Particularly did we expect from the Minister who is chiefly concerned, and who is mentioned in the motion of censure, some explanation as to what he meant when he issued this all-important minute, marking, as it does, a very serious departure. The Prime Minister complained that the Leader of the Opposition was rather severe on the Minister of Home Affairs; but the right honourable gentleman himself was infinitely more severe on his colleague when, on the evening of Thursday last his circular was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, When the Prime Minister was asked whether he confirmed or repudiated the minute of his colleague, he asked for time for further consideration. In these circumstances, it was obviously an individual act on - the part of the Minister of Home 'Affairs, and one which the Prinie Minister was not prepared, on behalf of the Cabinet, to adopt. - Mr Webster - That is pretty strong",51
387,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am only stating what took place here. First of all, it was obvious to everybody - that the Prime Minister was shocked by the circular; and when he was asked if he adopted it, he said at once that he would have to consider it. There could be no more severe condemnation of the act of the Minister of Home Affairs than the statement of the Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition has said that, as regards the general principle of preference to unionists, under certain conditions and safeguards, there is no objection on this side of the House. We can appeal to our career as evidencing the sympathy which we have at all times had with legitimate trade unionism. But the position now is that the old-time trades union, which rendered yeoman service to the community when engaged in the pursuit of the legitimate object for which they were formed, have been supplanted by political organizations.",52
388,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Throug h all the ages our opponents have said the same thing.,52
389,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"When I make that statement, I say what has been affirmed in the strongest possible language by your own supporters, and particularly by the honourable member for South Sydney, and by the honourable member for Corangamite. Those gentlemen have avowed with satisfaction that what were previously trade unions are how political unions. It would be doing themselves and their intelligence a gross injustice to dispute so vious a fact. I shall, therefore, take it as admitted by honourable members opposite that trade unions are political unions.",52
390,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,What is the matter with that?,52
391,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Bein g political unions, the design and object of this new departure of preference is to show favouritism to a class who are supporting Labour members and the Labour Government. It is a departure which means ""spoils to the victor,"" and ultimate corruption, innocent as it may appear at the present moment. It is a departure which means that this Government are going to assist their own political supporters at the expense of others by this administrative act. What is the argument by which this position is supported? First, honourable members opposite say that unionism is essential to the maintenance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; and, to a limited extent, that is so. I . remind honourable members, however, that that Act is a Federal measure, and applicable only to Inter-State disputes, but with that, aspect of the question I shall deal a little later. The object of that Act was to provide a peaceful industrial tribunal; it did not mean fhat everybody was to become a trade unionist. There are scores and hundreds of industries which would never have to resort to this tribunal, simply because the relations between employers and employed are satisfactory. I emphasize the fact that, under the scheme of the Constitution, industrial affairs are a matter for settlement by the States; and that principle was reaffirmed by overwhelming numbers on the 26th April last. We have, therefore, to go to the State industrial tribunals, for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful settlement of local differences; and I may say for Victoria that unionism is not essential to the existence of Wages Boards, and is not"" recognised so far as those Boards are concerned. This system of Wages Boards was instituted, not only with the object of securing industrial peace, but with the further object of providing for the workers a share in the benefits of the fiscal policy of Victoria. Wages Boards were instituted in 1896, and for the next ten years industrial strife and strikes were practically unknown in this State, because employers and employed were able to meet together, discuss their differences, and arrive at a reasonable agreement as to wages and conditions. Could there be any obgreater success for an industrial tribunal? It is clear, I repeat, that unionism is not essential to arbitration or the settlement of industrial dispufes.",52

It has frightened off industrial investments which otherwise would have taken place, and this has meant loss to the Commondents wealth and to the workers. I earnestly hope that we are fast coming to that time when both sides will deem it their duty to pull together. It is impossible for the Arbitration or any other Act having for its object the peaceful settlement of industrial affairs, to succeed when we have leaders of the Labour party inciting antagonism to the Arbitration Acts and Wages Boards, and, indeed, violence-de liberately inciting the workers to refuse to obey the law, and declaring that ""no. matter what the law is, we will not give up our right to strike.""

This is a sample of the language expressed by leaders of that party, and one has but to recall the inciof the more important strikes during the last year or two to realise that it is by no means an isolated sample.

416,Mr ANSTEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If a man commits murder, is the honourable member responsible for that act?",54
417,Sir ROBERT BEST,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If I incite to murder, I am. The honourable member for Corangamite, in an acrid speech, sought very hard to justify the policy set forth in the departmental memorandum by the Minister of Home Affairs. I invite honourable members to examine his logic. already given my views as to unionism not - being essential to arbitration, but this logic whereon the honourable member bases his justification for the policy in the memorandum by the Minister of Home Affairs : He says that because in our Arbitration Act the principle of preference to unionists knowledged for the purposes of arbitration, that principle can therefore be introduced, as has been done by the Minister of Home Affairs, by acts of administration. Let us consider for a moment the absurdity of the proposition. The Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out the particular class of preference to unionists, 'hedged with certain safeguards, which originally was provided for. He has shown how, by the amending Act of last session, that principle was watered down to its lowest extent. In that Act provision is made for a judicial preference to unionists. In other words, if , in the opinion of the Court, it is necessary for the prevention or - settlement of the industrial dispute, for the maintenance of industrial peace, or for the welfare of society, the learned President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, after closely investigating the character of the dispute before him, and especially the whole of the circumstances of the industry, may, on those grounds, grant preference to unionists. But what provision is made for a judicial investigation in the proposal which we now condemn? It is too absurd to contemplate. The Prime Minister has said that, "" all things being equal,"" preference is to be given to unionists, but what a hollow farce such a suggestion is! The officers of the Department will in practice take the political colour of the Minister for their guidance in carrying out this principle and the only real qualification will be unionism. The Director of Public Works most truly and properly interpreted the meaning of the Minister of Home Affairs, whose instruction was : First, "" Absolute preference to unionists;"" second, "" A list of non-unionists in employment to be prepared and submitted to me.'' That is subject to only one interpretation-that in dismissals non-unionists should go first. There is no qualification of the phrase "" absolute preference,"" and so a system of patronage, a system of favouritism, is being re-introduced in this insidious fashion into the adminstration of our affairs- a system totally opposed to the whole principle upon which our Public Service Act was founded. While it may have I have this innocent beginning, I venture to predict that if it is permitted to go on, it will have is the a disastrous ending. Suppose that, as one of the leading acts of the last Administration, we had issued an edict that absolute preference was to be given to non-unionists, and that a list of unionists was to be subis acmitted to the Minister, what would have been the result? We should have been branded as the most corrupt and debased of Ministries. We should have been accused of doing it with the design and object of showing favour to those who, it might have been alleged, were supporting us. If a ukase of the kind had been issued by the late Government, there would have been a whirlwind of indignation throughout the length and breadth of the place, and my honourable friends opposite would not have been able to restrain the violence of their feelings. Is that not an exact parallel to the present case? Are we not justified in viewing with much concern an act by which the great principle of equal opportunity, and employmenf according to merit, is being departed from ? I , therefore, join in the strong protest which we are now making against such a departure, feeling that it is founded on the worse of precedents; that it has as its design and object the rewarding of Government supporters; and that it will have as its result the granting of the spoils to the victors, and corruption as its ultimate end.",54
418,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"North Sydney) [9.29] - I am sorry to see that no one rises from the Ministerial benches. Probably when honourable members opposite see me get up to speak on the question they say to themselves, "" Here .is another man who is opposed to the poor worker, ' and to unionism,"" but let me disabuse their minds at once of that idea. I do not think there is any honourable member on either side of the House who has more sympathy with the bond fide working man than I have.",55
419,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Why not show it in a practical way by coming over here?,55
420,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I show it in a practical way, both here and outside. There is no reason why I should have an atom of antagonism towards the working man. I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and have never had time to get one there since. I have done, perhaps, just as much hard work as those honourable members who sit upon the Ministerial benches, and I know what hard work is. I see one honourable member smiling, but I can assure him that I have done my share of hard work-rea l solid "" yacker,"" and not playing at workin my time. I have worked for jQ$o per year, which was probably below the union rate, and I did not work any eight hours a day. If anything, it was eight hours before dinner, and eight hours afterwards; and for this I got ,Â£30 and the run of my knife. .1 did not belong to a union; but I have always been an upholder of the principle of unionism. Union is strength, and I believe it is right that men should combine in unions to protect themselves; but I do not believe in unionism run mad. I have supported unionism nearly all my life. I suppose I was one of the first to put up a union agreement in a shearing shed. That was in Micalago shed. Although not compelled to do so, I always supported unionism; but there came a time when unionism expected too much, and in the pastoral industry we had the spectacle of a general call-out of the shearers. That gave us a bit of a sickener of unionism. The unionists did not give us a fair deal, but, of course, they expected us to deal fairly by them. I have absolutely no opposition to the principle of unionism; but we aire discussing now the question of preference to unionists to obtain work, and to make a living, over those who do not think fit to combine in unions. I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition on one point. Of course, we, - on this side, are free to dissent from the opinions of our leader, and are not bound to accept what he says as the only doctrine. I disagree with him, in so far as he approves of preference to unionists under the Act of 1904, which provides for the application of the principle, subject to judicial inquiry. I do not approve of that at all. I object to preference to unionists in any shape or form. It is class legislation of the very worse description. I do not see why one set of individuals should be given preference over another, or why a. small minority of the workmen of Australia should have preference over the great bulk, because the unionists are only a minority. I should not grant preference to any class, section, or creed. Men should be absolutely free. We are supposed to live in a free country. The dictum of honourable members opposite is supposed to be that the government shall be carried out "" By the people for the people."" That is the doctrine that they are always preaching; but their creed really is, "" Government by the Trades Hall for the unionists."" No one but a unionist is supposed to have a right to get a living in this country. Honourable members opposite would really like to see those who do not think fit to band themselves together in unions, and take the union ticket, starving and dying in this country, no matter whether they are honourable citizens or not. What constitutes good citizenship according; to my honourable friends opposite? Is it the possession of ability and uprightness? No. The seal of a good citizen with them is the holding of a union ticket, the being branded with a union label.",55
421,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Does the honourable member favour strikes?,55
422,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If it can be shown that a strike is in the best interests of the people I am in favour of strikes, but it would be hard to prove that. There is no need for strikes under our laws. New South Wales has excellent legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes. Although the Labour party"" said that it would wipe out the Industrial Disputes Act as soon as it got into office, it has not dared to do so. The Act provides for the creation of Wages: Boards, whereby some hundreds'of industrial disputes have been settled. Under the present Labour Government there have been more strikes than ever before, because Labour members have incited the people to disregard the law. Under the preceding Liberal Government, strikes were fewer than they had been for many years. unionists now.  Labour party responsible for the strike Great Britain?",55
423,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"All troubles of this kind are to be laid at the door of the Labour support. party. No wonder that the intelligent electors hurled the referenda proposals back in the teeth of honourable members opposite. They saw that it was the intenthem? tion of the Labour party to give preference to unionists, and objected to hand the trol of all Australian industries to the Comunionists monwealth. This Government, however, has acted very timidly in the matter. NoOccasionally, thing was done until the Minister of Home may Affairs, taking the bit in his teeth, and 90 bolting, issued the following ukase to the party, Director-General of WorksI am informed that in the building trade we are paying men only 8s. 3d. per day for 44 hours a week. I desire that we should than gs. per day, irrespective of the number of hours worked per week; absolute preference unionists. Please furnish a list of non-unionists employed. We have been told by the Prime Minister that that vvas done with the sanction of the party. Government. Nothing is said about ""other things being equal."" was given by the Minister with the proval of the Cabinet, that unionist should be employed by the partment. What other construction is be put on the memorandum?",56
424,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Does preference mean exclusion ?,56
425,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"What else can it mean is, when the preference is to be absolute? Furthermore, the Minister called for black list. Not satisfied with ordering unionists should be employed in preference Service ? to non-unionists, he asked for alist of non-unionists, so that when hands had be dismissed the non-unionists might sacked first.",56
426,Mr FINLAYSON,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Perhaps he wanted to convert them.,56

431,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If the honourable member's figures were correct, the Liberals pay not less would be in power.",56
432,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I hope that they will be to after the next general election. The Prime Minister said that it was not intended to pay heed to a man's political beliefs, but preference to unionists means giving preference to those who support the Labour The order Mr BATCHELOR - Does the honourable apmember employ men because of their no one except a political views? De Mr RYRIE - I never ask whether a to man belongs to a union or not. It is a wrong thing for the Minister at the head of a public department to ask an applicant for employment whether he is a unionist. He might as well ask him what his creed or what his religion is. Why do not Ministers go the whole hog and say that men a shall belong to a certain religion before that they can secure employment in the Public",56
433,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,The honourable member to knows that squatters have sacked men time be and again because they knew they had voted for Labour.,56
434,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Some little while ago I heard an honourable member on the opposide deprecating a suggestion from this side that, because one union official had inmen to murder, responsibility for that it rested upon the whole of the Labour party. to I ask the honourable member for Gwydir, of now why he suggests that, because one may have sacked a man for supporting the Labour party, the whole of the squatting fraternity should be saddled with' responsibility for that? When the Prime Minister said that responsible officers were not to take any cognisance of whether men belonged to a political organization, he was burking the real question, because he must know that, in giving preference to unionists, the Government propose to give preference to those who support them in politics. The honourable member far South Sydney told us that these organizations are now political. I say, therefore, that it is wrong for a responsible Minister to give preference to the members of them. We know which political party they support, and the Government are proposing to give preference to the men to whom they owe their political position. It is an attempt to as many as possible into these unions, with the knowledge that when they have joined them, pressure will be brought to bear upon them to vote for the Labour party.",56
435,Mr RILEY,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,What I said was that the members of trade unions use their influence as unionists to get certain legislation on the statute-book.,57
436,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"The honourable member told us that they are now political bodies. The Prime Minister, in answer to an interjection, made a statement to which I take great exception. He said in effect, that all men outside unions are "" skulkers.""",57
437,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"That is a shocking misrepresentation. The Prime Minister was quoting what the honourable member's Deputy Leader had said. Mr RYRIE"" - That may be so, but he went on and used the same words himself. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman intended to be abusive to me or not, but he told me that I was "" obvious."" I object to be called any of these names. I should like to direct attention to what might happen in the near future when some big national works are undertaken by the Labour Government. Let ""us suppose, for instance, that in a short time the Government will undertake the construction of the transcontinental railway. We know that members of the Labour parly are in favour of the construction of public works by day labour. We may take it that this railway will therefore be constructed chiefly by day labour. This will mean the spending of some millions of money and the employment of tens of thousands of workmen. I should like to know whether this principle of preference to unionists is going to be enforced throughout in the construction of this great work.",57
438,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It would not make the slightest difference, since there is hardly a railway man who is not a member of a union.",57
439,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I hope that honourable members opposite will realise what it would mean when they come before the intelligent and enlightened electors of the Commonwealth at the next election. I do not think that the taxpayers will approve of their money being used in this way, for the employment of members of a small section of the community. It is the taxpayers' money that will be used in the construction of the transcontinental railway, and all the great national works proposed. As one who does not belong to any union, I object to force my money being used for the employment of one particular class of men, and there are hundreds of thousands of men who are in the same position as I am.",57

442,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am not ""scabbing"" on any one. I pay 20s. in the Â£ 1 , and always try to do a fair thing. I understand that there are something like 19,000 temporary hands employed in the Federal Public Service. They will immediately come under this order of the Minister of Home Affairs. I think, in the circumstances, that the black list we have heard of will assume rather alarming proportions by the time it reaches the hands of the Minister.",57
443,Mr OZANNE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,What black list?,57
444,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Does not the honourable member know that the Minister of Home Affairs has called for a list of non-unionists employed in his Department? That is only a first instalment. Other Ministers, no doubt, will call for similar lists, as they will also desire to know the non-unionists who are employed in their Departments. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What do they want to know that for?",57
445,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"In order that when they wish to reduce the number of hands employed they may sack the non-unionist first - giv e them what is called the "" bullet."" I am not referring to a suggestion that the object may be to murder people when I say they will give them the "" bullet."" I merely use a slang phrase which those who have been accustomed to shearing-sheds will understand perfectly. I have no doubt that this list is to Be in the hands of isters in order that if it be necessary to dismiss any employees may fire out the non-unionists first, and then put on unionists in their places. I take it that - it is public money with which our public servants are paid-th money of those who do not believe in tending a preference to unionists as well as the money of those who favour that principle. It is not fair that money should be taken from the pockets of men who do not agree with this principle for the of paying unionists. Why should a ference be given to this small minority the workers ? There is no reason why they should be singled out for special treatment. It has been urged that they have brought the standard of wages up to what it day. I am not prepared to discuss that question. But I say that if free and independent men are averse to joining polisturdy tical organizations, they should liberty to please themselves. The compoaway sition of trade unions is very different day from what it was some time ago. Now, they are only tyrannous rings and combines.",57
446,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Then the honourable member ought to protect them.,58
447,Mr RYUIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am not in favour of rings or combines. Honourable members opposite know very well that a man cannot now join a union when he desires to do so. I can give specific instances in port of mv statement. Two of my endeavoured for a month to secure sion to the Wharf Labourers Union, in Sydney, and failed to do so. They realized attacks ? that if they attempted to work without having joined that organization, they against would be called scabs and blacklegs, and might, perhaps, be kicked to death. The ""able old unionists are desirous of making their unions monopolies. Consequently, I say that these organizations are merely comunder bines and rings, which are used principally for political purposes. The tyranny of unionism is worse than the tyranny of capital has ever been. If we are not caremen ful, this unionism will get its foot on necks of the people.",58
448,Mr WEBSTER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Who are the people?,58
449,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am speaking of all classes of the community, and not merely of one section which consists entirely union workers. I take it that, according the rear. [3i] to honourable members opposite, the test of good citizenship is not ability, nor uprightness, nor clean living, but the possesMinsion of a union ticket. Without such a ticket a man is to be denied the right ro they earn a livelihood for himself and his wife . and family. I am very pleased, indeed, that the Minister of Home Affairs has precipitated this matter, though I do not think e that his colleagues share my feelings. exM i. ROBERTS - Wai t until the vote is taken, and the honourable member will see.",58
450,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I do not worry about the vote. I recognise that I may.talk here till I am black in the face, and it will not alter purpose the vote of a single honourable mempreber opposite, because they dare not of vote against extending a preference to unionists. Their political lives depend upon their action. If they dared to vote against that principle, the Trades is toHall would soon have the halter around their necks and over the beam. Hanging to that halter would be good members of the Australian Workers be at Union, and the moment they broke from their party, up they would go. toTheir very political existence is at stake. The proposal to extend a preference to unionists means government by the Trades Hall. It does not mean responsible government by the representatives of the people, but government in accordance with the dictum of the Trades Hall. I suppose that the Australian Workers Union is the most powerful union in Australia today, so that, in a great measure, it controls the supTrades Hall. Consequently, this great men Commonwealth is being governed by admisshearers and rouseabouts.",58
451,Mr BATCHELOR,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,Why make personal,58
452,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I have not a word to say shearers and rouseabouts personally. I know that a lot of them are most estim# fellows. All I say is that they, are not the persons to govern Australia. A man should be free to work .when he likes, and what conditions he chooses. If he does not care to join a trade union, that circumstance ought not to operate as a bat to his employment. It is scandalous that should have to produce a union ticket the before they can obtain employment in our Commonwealth Public Service.",58
453,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"If unionists are not good enough to govern Australia, they are good enough to stand in the firing line to deof fend the country when the colonels are in . Mr RYRIE - The non-unionist is just as good a man as the unionist any day in the week.",58
454,Mr ROBERTS,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"It will not be the ""scabs "" who will defend this country if ever it is attacked.",59
455,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I am sorry indeed that the honourable member should have introduced such remarks into this debate, and I believe that, in his calmer moments, he will regret having used such terms in regard to our Defence Forces. I take it that the free labourers of this country are just as good men as-are the unionists.",59

457,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"Yes . This motion specifically deals with the granting of a preference to unionists, and I oppose that principle in every shape and form. Had I been present in this House when the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904 was passed, it would have encountered my bitterest opposition. I do not believe in one ciass of the community securing a preference over another class.",59

459,Mr RYRIE,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,I do not know anything about Mr Wetherspoon; but we will give honourable members opposite Mr Henry Willis.,59
460,Mr SPEAKER,DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH,"I must appeal to honourable members on the Ministerial side to cease these continuous interjections. . Mr RYRIE - I have only another word to say. The action of the Minister of Home Affairs only goes to prove what I have stated over and over again from many public platforms, that the party who are, unfortunately, in power in this country represent but one class, namely, the class of organized labour. They do not wish to give any other class a chance in any shape or. form. They profess to legislate only for union labour. But that is not true Democracy. I call myself a true Democrat, because I support legislation giving privileges to every class, and would not make any difference between class, creed, or sect. I venture to predict that the con. duct of honourable members opposite in supporting the action of the Minister of Home Affairs will recoil upon themselves when the intelligent"" electors of this great Commonwealth have again a chance of recording their votes at the .ballot-box.
