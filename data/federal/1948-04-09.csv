2,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer whether any appropriation of money has been made or is proposed by the Government from Consolidated llevenue for propaganda in connection with the forthcoming referendum campaign ? If so, will lie state what sum of money has been or . is proposed to be appropriated? ""Will he indicate whether parliamentary approval is to be first sought for the expenditure of that money? To what departmental vote is it to he charged?",12
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The answer to all the questions is """"No"". PLYWOOD. Mr LANG*- I desire to ask a question, but I do not know whether I should direct it to the Minister for Works and Housing or to the Minister for the Interior. I previously asked a question on the same subject on notice of the Minister for Works and Housing, but the printed answer was supplied by the Minister for the Interior. In reply to my recent question on notice, I was informed by the Minister for the Interior that the Australian Plywood Board was not a government board hut an organization within the industry for the control of the marketing and distribution of plywood in Australia and that there was no government representative on it. I now ask(a) Is there a body called the Plywood Industry Advisory Panel? (6) Is it a Commonwealth Government body? (c) Who are the members of the panel, and who is the Government representative? (d) Has the panel conducted certain investigations for the Government, and will such reports be tabled? (e) Was a member of the panel permitted to import timber into Australia from New Britain without a licence? (/) If so, have any other persons been permitted to import without iicences ?",13
4,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"As mentioned hy the honourable member for Beid, certain information was supplied to him-in answer to a question placed on the notice paper. His question this morning contains matter in respect of which I have not at the moment information at my command. So I suggest that he also place this question on the notice-paper. MEAT.",13
5,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,"Are negotiations taking place with the British Government for a review of meat contract prices and the term of the contract? Is there any truth in newspaper reports of the likelihood of an increase of 3d. per lb. in the price paid hy Great Britain for the meat purchased from Australia?  taking place with the TJnited Kingdom Government regarding meat prices, and it is most likely that Australian meat producers will receive an increase of price. To date, the exact amount of the increase, or whether the United Kingdom Government will agree to meet the extra cost, is not explicitly known. CLOTHES EATIONING.",13
6,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether it is & fact that the retail clothing trade organizations have made representations for the abolition of clothes rationing? If so, can the right honourable gentleman inform the House as to the prospects of the abolition of clothes rationing?",13
7,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"No direct representations have been made to me or, I think, to the Minister for Trade and Customs by organizations representing the wholesale and retail sections of the clothing trade. However, these organizations, in discussions with the chairman of the Rationing Commission, expressed the view that clothes rationing should be abolished at an early date. The Rationing Commission endorsed that view. When the Minister for Trade and Customs received the report from the commission on this matter, he discussed the position with me, and, in turn, we had .conversations ' on the subiect with the chairman of the Eationing Commission and the Director-General of Eationing, Mr Cuming. In deciding that the time was not opportune to abolish clothes rationing, the Government was guided by information which would not be known either to representatives of the wholesale and retail clothing trade, which is responsible for the sale of cotton goods, or to the Eationing Commission itself. Because of the difficult dollar position, the availability of various textiles, particularly woven cotton goods, is uncertain. In view of all the circumstances, the Government considered that it would not be wise to abolish clothes rationing simply because, at the moment, supplies of materials were adequate. I shall not attempt to describe all the economic conditions which necessitate the continuance of clothes rationing, but I merely indicate that difficult economic circumstances are prevailing in relation to the dollar situation which could affect the availability of materials in future. Therefore, the Government decided not to accept, at this stage, the recommendation for the abolition of clothes rationing. Whilst the Government is most anxious to abolish clothes rationing, it does not desire to take precipitate action lest circumstances Utter compel it to re-introduce rationing. Honourable members will recall that some time ago the Government of New Zealand abolished petrol rationing, hut a few months later was obliged to reintroduce it. The Australian Government had a similar experience in regard to ing of tinplate. The advices available indicated that it was possible to abolish the rationing of end use of tinplate. Three months later, the shortage of supplies had hecome acute. During that period big canners had bought up all the surplus supplies and the smaller canners had none. In the meantime, the price of end use of tinplate had risen b.y approximately £4 a ton. The Government was obliged to re-impose the rationing of end use of tinplate, and subsidize the smaller canners who had to purchase supplies at the higher price. I cite that instance merely to indicate that the Government considers that it would be unwise, until the position is perfectly clear, to abolish the clothes rationing. IMMIGRATION . LARGE-SCALE BRITISH MOVEMENTSMACDONALD FAMILY.",13
8,Dame ENID LYONS,Unknown,"Has any considered reply been received from the British Government concerning the suggestion recently made hy the Minister for Immigration that large-scale migration of British people and industries to Australia should he considered? If so, will the Minister tell the House what stage the negotiations have reached?",14
9,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"As I said before the House rose for the Easter recess, I made a personal and unofficial approach to Mr Noel Baker, the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, regarding the question of mass migration and asked him to advise me of the prospects of the matter being favourably considered by the British Government at an early date. I refused then, and I do so again, to publish, without his permission, the letter that was addressed to the right honourable gentleman. I am unable to say when the British Government is likely to consider the matter. Mr Noel Baker was at Lake Success at the time when the letter was written, and, although he recently returned to England, he is now abroad again. As soon as a public statement can be made, it will be made. I am glad to note the continuing interest of all sections of the Australian people in this matter, whioh is vital both to them and the ration- to the British people. Later:",14
10,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I have been informed that prospective Scottish migrants have been trying for two and a half years to come to Australia under the sponsorship of their friends and relatives in this country. I shall cite one specific instance, and I am able tb give others, if necessary. Mr Angus MACDonald, of Airdrie, Scotland, his wife, and two children, aged nineteen years and'fifteen years, are anxious to come to Australia and work on a farm on the north coast of New South Wales. All the members of this family are necessary to the people who have nominated them. Their fares were sent to the Government two and a half years ago, hut, to date, they have failed to get even a promise of a passage to Australia. The people who nominated the MACDonald family asked me why Scottish and British migrants are unable to get passages to Australia when shipping can be provided for so many people .from other countries. Will the Minister for Immigration inform me what are the prospects of people such as the MACDonald family obtaining passages as migrants to Australia? Mr CAIWFJ. T, - Mr Speaker, I ask for leave to treat the questioner as a hostile witness. The honourable member oould have seen me in my office in connection with this matter.",14
11,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I have written a dozen letters to the Minister on the subject.,15
12,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,On the MACDonald case?,15
13,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I have received re-, plies, and nothing has been done.",15
14,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I guarantee that the honourable member has not written to me a dozen letters on this matter. If the MACDonald famil y has not been able to get passages to Australia in two and a half years, all I can say is that there is something wrong with them, and nothing wrong with Australia House.",15
15,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"The letter is on Minister's file, and the necessary money was sent to his office more than two years ago.",15
16,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"No money is ever sent to my department in connection with migration matters. Immigrants come to Australia either under the free passages scheme or under the assisted passages scheme. If they come under the assisted passages scheme, the migrant pays the money that he is bound to payit is not very much-to the shipping company for his passage. So this cock-andbull story which the honourable member has told is like a lot of other stories that he tells in this House.",15
17,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I shall produce the correspondence next week.,15
18,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"If the honourable member will tell a straight story on the matter, I shall give to him a straight answer, but he has not done so.",15
19,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I shall produce the letter which the Minister wrote.,15
20,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I shall produce the file, if necessary - Order ! The honourable gentleman may",15
21,Mr HOLT,Unknown,Somebody should produce facts.,15
22,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The file will contain the facts. It will not contain any propaganda. I do not propose to occupy very much time in trying to drive into the mind of the honourable member for Richmond the fact that British people who come to Australia in British ships have an absolute priority to travel on those vessels. No foreigner ever travels on a ship flying the British flag. If people from other countries come here on. other ships, they are able to travel because of arrangements which are made by international'organizations, of which Australia is a member party. Those shipsare not available to bring British m i grants. If they were not carrying the people whom they do bring here, nearly all of the vessels would be returned to the War Department of the TJnited States of America. All the ships which areused to bring displaced persons to Australia are army transport belonging to the American Government and leased to thePreparatory Commission International Refugee Organization. Other foreign ships which bring Italia n women and children, the Greeks and other people here belong to owners who are registered with foreign agencies, and in most instances, their standards are such that British people would not travel on them, for they need something better than the standard which these foreign ships provide. The honourable member for Richmond has attempted in a mean way to engage in propaganda to stir up some feeling in the community by alleging discrimination against prospective migrants from the TJnited K in g dom. The fact is that last year 20,000 British people and approximately 10,000 persons from other countries came to Australia. We are trying to maintain at least a. three-to-one majorit y in favour of the British people coming to Australia, and that proportion will he even greater this year. Attempts to create trouble such as that of the honourable member this morning are to be condemned and deplored.",15
23,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I desire to make a persona] explanation.,15
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J . S. Eosevear;. make a personal explanation if he feels that he has been misrepresented, but he may not go beyond that.",15
25,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"In his reply, the Minister for Immigratio n insinuated that I had not made any representations in relation to the migration of certain Scottish families.",15
26,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I did not say that.,15
27,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I shall produce the whole of the correspondence next week.

TOBACCO.",15
28,Mr BERNARD CORSER,Unknown,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether it is the intention of the Governmissioner ment to review the system governsolution will he found. ing the supply of quotas of tobacco to retailers? If that is the intention, will the Government consider the interests of returned soldiers who, under the present system, have been refused supplies? The present control is administered hy private concerns.  Government set up an authority to ensure, as far as practicable, that available plies of tobacco and cigarettes were tributed justly to retailers throughout Australia. At the conclusion of the war, it was considered that the control by the Government could be abandoned. repatriation scheme. Honourable members opposite are advocates of decontrol, hut since abandonment by 'the Government of control constant complaints have received from retailers and returned diers who are not able to obtain the plies of tobacco and cigarettes to which they consider they are justly entitled. It is doubtful whether the Government prepared again to undertake responsibility in this field. - JSEWQASTL E; DQCKYAJJD ) .. INDUSTRIE'.!* JOTSTBTB.

The dispute concerns' several hundred boilermakers employed in the State Government dockyard, at Newcastle. They are covered by a federal award,, so that the matter comes under federal jurisdiction.

31,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"It is true that the value of a bursary may be deducted from the educational benefit payable under the This is because the a limit has been placed upon the the amount of income which may be its derived from educational sources.

NA TASMANIA. Mr DUTHIE:-Has the Minister for Immigration any further information to supply regarding the sending of Bait workers to orchardists in Tasmania, 'and - whether orchardists in the ""West Tamar 'Valley are to receive any of this labonr ?",16
32,Mr CALWELL,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"Tw o days ago, the '.honourable member asked me a question regarding the transfer of Baits to 'Tasmania. At the time he asked his ques-tion, .68 workers had heen sent to Tasmania, and twelve, more left yestei-clay. Six have been a'lloted to the West Tamar Valley in the electorate of the honourable member, and the rest I have been sent to the Huon district, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Franklin. FENCING MATERIAL .",17
33,Mr TURNBCTLL,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"Wit h regard to the .shortage of fencing materials, which constitutes a growing menace to primary producers, I address this question to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, or any other Minister who may he able to give a satisfactory answer. I receive many letters from constituents asking me to make representations to the authorities on this subject and I have made many such representations with little result. When I refer the matter to a Commonwealth Minister, I am told that the State authorities are in charge of the distribution of fencing wire; when I apply to the States they say that they cannot get enough material to distribute in adequate quantities. A deadlock has now been reached and production will fall as a result.",17
34,Mr SPEAKER,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - And the question is?,17
35,Mr TURNBULL,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"The real question is, just what is the position? Is there any prospect that primary producers will be able to obtain wire? What is the true reason for the present shortage?",17
36,Mr DEDMAN,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"The honourable member for Wimmera is well aware,_ I think, that the distribution of supplies within the States is the prerogative of the. State ""governments. What the ConaHi'Onwealth does in respect to these matters is merely to allocate .the .prodBctiwa in Australia as between the - respective States. This was decided wpon .as 'the resuilt of au agreement - reached at a conference of Commonwealth - aaid State Ministers. As to reason why there is such an acute shortage, the honourable member, of all people in this House, should be well aware that we have just come through a war during which the production of this - country was diverted from peacetime uses to defence purposes, and it is because of the back log of demand, that w.as built up during the war period, when practically all our. production of iron and steel went into the manufacture, of munitions, that there is now such a shortage. The shortage is further accentuated because we now have full employment. Indeed, it is impossible for many industries to obtain the labour necessary to increase production. The honourable member will also recollect that when the Government asked the people to give it power over industry, so that it could ensure that articles most necessary for the community could be produced, he and his colleagues opposed the granting of such power. Although the Government is unable constitutionally to take any steps to increase production, it is doing everything possible to assist private industry to increase the output of goods in short supply, particularly of those which are most necessary for primary producers, and it will continue to do so. There will be a continuing shortage of these materials for some time to come. SALES TAX.",17
37,Mrs BLACKBURN,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"I have received a. letter from a progress association in my constituency stating that, at the beginning of this year, it decided to issue, for free distribution, a calendar carrying a call for a better public spirit throughout the district and greater service to the community. The calendar carried advertisements to help defray the cost. Printing costs amounted to £14, and the a.ssociation was called upon to pay £1 8s. sales tax. As a number of sales tax exemptions have been allowed in respect of printed matter, and as: some encouragement seems to be needed to foster a public spirit in the community, can it be assumed that when the exemptions were being considered progress associations were not thought of? Has the Treasurer power to remit such a payment? Can arrangements now be made to include progress associations on the exemption list?",17
38,Mr CHIFLEY,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"The honourable member did not mention the name of the progress association and I assume that Bhe is dealing with the matter on general principles. In conformity with the practice followed by other Treasurers, all applications for exemptions from sales tax are listed and examined periodically. The most I can promise the honourable member is that during the next month or two, when outstanding applications for exemptions are being examined, I shall consider her request. LAND SALES CONTROL.",18
39,Mr BEALE,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"I have received some disturbing information about a person the Land Sales Control. I have checked this information as far as I can and I subject:believe it to be correct. I ask whether one of the Treasurer's delegates in the Land building Sales Control, whose name I have just handed privately to the Prime Minister, Territory. was committed to gaol in. 1940 on eleven charges of forgery, uttering and false pretences. Was he employed in the Land Sales Control shortly after the New South Wales Public Service Board refused employ him because of his criminal record? If this is the man, how did he come to be appointed to, of all places, Land Sales Control as one of the Treathis surer's personal delegates? What fluences, if any, were used to secure appointment? When temporary appointcompletion ments are made to the Public Service under National Security Regulations, what safeguards are used to maintain the good name of the public service generally and to protect the public against persons of this character?",18
40,Mr CHIFLEY,BALTIC WOBKEBS FOB,"I do not know anyHours thing about the circumstances mentioned hy the honourable .member for Parramatta. In the employment of people in the Publio Service, the practice has been for Public Service Board to examine the credentials and standing of applicants for positions. It is true, of course, that, during the war and later, it was always difficult to obtain the services of highly efficient people and the best of those available had to be taken, with thequalification, of course, that dishonest person or persons believed to be dishonest, were always refused employment. The honourable member has supplied me with the name of the person referred to in his question. The circumstances of his appointment and employment will be investigated in order to ascertain what substance there is in the report made to the honourable memher. I will furnish the honourable member with the information that I receive. NA NA NA RESEARCH. RETORT OF PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE.",18

SHIPPING. to "" MARINE PHOENIX ""-QUEENSLAN D AND WESTERN AUSTRALIAN SERVICES.",18
42,Mr CLARK,SCIENTIFIC A ND INDUSTRIAL,Has the Minister for the Immigration seen the report in the press morning that Marine Phoenix will incease operations between the United his States of America and Australia on the of its present trip? Will the Government take action to maintain a shipping service between Australia and the United States of America?,18
43,Mr CALWELL,SCIENTIFIC A ND INDUSTRIAL,"I know all ahout Marine Phoenix. When I think of this vessel I am reminded of the song "" The I Spend with Thee Dear Heart"". I had discussions in the United States of America with the president and the vicepresidents of the Matson line. I have also the had discussions in Australia with a number of officials about the maintenance of Marine Phoenix on the AmericaAustralia run. ""We have reached the stage at which only one ship is bringing passengers from America to Australia and taking passengers back to America. Monterey and Mariposa have boon lying in the ship repairers' yards for a considerable time awaiting conversion. About, 4,000,000 dollars has been spent on each, but it will cost from 15,000,000 to 16,000,000 dollars to effect the conversions, prices being so high in America. Marine Phoenix is a C.4 army transport and is on loan to the Matson line. The dollar crisis has so curtailed travel that the line is now being run uneconomically, and, unless a subsidy is given to it by the Congress of the United States of America, or some .arrangement is made between Australia and the Government of the United States of America to keep Marine Phoenix on the run, possibly there will be no shipping at all between Australia and American Pacific ports at a very early date. In any event, Marine Phoenix is allowed to run only by An act of Congress which must be renewed annually, the vessel not being up to the standards laid down by the United States maritime regulations. The Government i9 doing all it can to have the vessel kept ou the run, because it is the only one hy which we can bring back to to this country, Australian brides and their American husbands for permanent settlement here.",18
44,Mr FRANCIS,SCIENTIFIC A ND INDUSTRIAL,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel inform me whether any special action has heen taken to step-up shipping services to Queensland? How many ships, if any, have been re-routed to that State, and what are their names? The honourable gentleman was able to inform the honourable member for Boothby that four colliers had been directed to South Australia. Can he indicate clearly what ships have heen rerouted to Queensland' to take supplies to that State ? Will the honourable gentleman do everything in his power to ensure that supplies of food, which are urgently required, shall he sent to that State in order to build up stocks which were depleted as the result of the recent railway strike ? Will he also ensure that supplies of iron and steel are despatched to manufacturers in Queensland who urgently require them? If they are not received immediately, many industries will have to completely close down. Will the right honourable gentleman ensure that the many persons who are waiting for 1 their houses will be able to obtain supplies of galvanized iron? Will he ask the Minister responsible to indicate what is being done? Will he say whether supplies of barbed wire, plain wire and wire netting will be made available to primary producers who have been waiting for them for a long time because supplies have been held up by strikes which this Government has done very little to avoid?",19
45,Mr CHIFLEY,SCIENTIFIC A ND INDUSTRIAL,"The questions asked by the honourable member relate to a number of matters in which I have taken a personal interest. As to the transport to Queensland of quantities of goods that have accumulated in New South Wales due to the recent industrial trouble, on Wednesday last Mr Hanlon, the Premier of Queensland, discussed the matter at considerable length in Sydney with the Director of Shipping. In Canberra yesterday, in company with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and myself, he discussed what ships would he made available, the dates on which they would sail, and the ports to which they would go. I supplied to Mr Hanlon a lengthy list of the ships affected. I shall not weary the House by reading it, but I shall supply a copy to the honourable member for Moreton for his information. Mr Hanlon expressed his pleasure at the arrangements in regard to shipping. The transport of sugar from Queensland was also discussed. With regard to the transport of goods to Queensland hy roaid, Mr Hanlon informed me that he had discussed the matter with the Premier of New South Wales and that he was very grateful for the splendid help that Mr MCGirr was prepared to give. Mr Hanlon's concluding words were that, as a result of the information supplied to him, he was satisfied that everything possible was being done to deal with the backlog of goods awaiting transportation from other states to Queensland and from Queensland to the Southern States. With regard to barbed wire and galvanized iron, it is true that production at present is not adequate to meet the demands, and will not be for some time, although it is expected that it will be considerably increased. In the meantime, everything will be done to ensure the equitable distribution of available supplies.",19
46,Mr HAMILTON,SCIENTIFIC A ND INDUSTRIAL,"Can the Prime Minister say whether, as a result of the recent arrangements that have been made with regard to shipping services to Queensland, any ships have been diverted to that State which were originwhose ally scheduled to travel to Western Australia ?",20
47,Mr CHIFLEY,SCIENTIFIC A ND INDUSTRIAL,"I have no recollection of any ship having been so diverted. However, I shall cause inquiries to be made so that the honourable member may be supplied with the information for which he asks. PRICES CONTROL. NA - NEW HOUSEWIVES ASSOCIATION.",20
48,Mr HARRISON,PROPOSED DEMONSTRATION AT CANBERRA,"I have been informed that the New Housewives Association, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Eureka Youth League and the Sydney University Labour Club, are arranging a demonstration against rising prices to take place at Canberra next Wednesday and that the demonstrators will travel to Canberra by a special bus, being joined en route by Communists and "" fellowtravellers "". I ask the Prime Minister whether any request has been made to the Government to receive representatives of the demonstrators and whether the Government will receive them. In view of the decision of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Labour party that the New Housewives Association i« Communist-controlled and its instruction that members of the Australian Labour party should resign from the association, does the Government intend to implement the Australian Labour party's decision by declaring it an illegal organization 1",20
49,Mr CHIFLEY,PROPOSED DEMONSTRATION AT CANBERRA,"The last part of the question was probably intended to bp humorous. Some one telephoned me last week asking me to receive a deputation from the New Housewives Association on the matter of prices control. I was also told that it was proposed to hold some sort of demonstration. I made it ciear that demonstrations are not permitted in Canberra, although it is true that on one or two occasions something of the character of a demonstration has been made in the precincts of Parliament House by people interested in certain legislation that the Government has introduced. I propose to arrange with the Minister for Trade and Customs, under administration prices control comes, to receive a deputation on that subject. It is probably correct that the Australian Labour party has decided that the New Housewives Association is under the control of Communists, hut I do not propose to attend a demonstration by them or receive a deputation from them or any one else on subjects that are properly dealt with by other Ministers as a part of their administration. Any organization in the community, regardless of its politics, is entitled to present its views to Ministers if they have the time to spare to receive deputations. I have not yet conferred with the Minister for Trade and Customs on this subject, but I propose to ask him to receive the deputation if it desires to place before the Government the views of the association. But demonstrations, no! GALVANIZED IRON.",20
50,Mr LANGTRY,PROPOSED DEMONSTRATION AT CANBERRA,Supplie s of galvanized iron or sheet iron are urgently required to fence stacks of hay in New South Wales against the mouse plague. I understand that the Australian Wheat Board possesses a considerable quantity of this iron which is not required for bulkheads because the wet season affected the harvest. Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ascertain whether the Australian Wheat Board will make a quantity of this iron available in the wheat-growing areas of New South Wales?  ascertain whether the Australian Wheat Board has any galvanized iron surplus to its requirements which can be made available for mouse-proofing fodder stacks. COAL. SUPPLIES POK SOUTH AUSTRALIA.,20

Can the Minister representing the ter for Shipping and Fuel supply any information on this matter?,21
52,Mr DEDMAN,PROPOSED DEMONSTRATION AT CANBERRA,"As the result of requests by the honourable member for Boothby to the Minister for Shipping Fuel, I have been provided with the - information that he requires. River Loddon left its coal berth yesterday 7,600 tons of coal for Adelaide. Aroona with 4,200 tons, Bellerby with .8,500 tons, and the Inchcrag with 5,000 tons are due to leave tomorrow.

The first protocol continued the the agreement unchanged until the 31st August, 1944, but in the thr.ee 'subsequent protocols which extended the agreement until the 31st August, 1947, it was provided that certain portions, particularly the quota provisions, should remain inoperative. The present protocol also declares such portions inoperative during - the period of one year ending the Slst The main purposes of the renewal of the agi'eement are to maintain the central - machinery for establishing an orderly relationship between the supply and demand for sugar and to gain time for the conclusion of a new scheme. It will be noted that Article 3 (2) of the protocol - provides that in revising the agreement due account shall be taken of any general principles of commodity policy embodied under liie auspices of the United Nations.

55,Mr BLAIN,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"I desire to ask the Minwhatever over land? ister for the Interior a question with regard to the development of goldmining in the Northern Territory, and another with regard to the powers of the Northern Territory Legislative Council to deal with developmental policy. By way of preface, I remind the honourable gentleman that during the last period sitting the Treasurer brought down legislation for the abolition of the' gold tax. In reply to questions asked by me, the Minister for the Interior stated that he intended to recommend to Cabinet certain legislation designed to assist the development of gold-mining in the Northern Territory. In view of the recent statement of the Premier of Western Australia deploring the condition of the gold-mining industry in Western Australia and the acute position of that industry in the remote areas of the Northern Territory, can the Minister for the Interior say whether it is intended to bring down in the near future the legislation that he has promised to introduce ? At the inaugural meeting of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory, the elected member for Tennant Creek, Dr Webster, raised the question of an inquiry into works and housing in the Northern Territory. The nominated member, Brigadier-General Lucas, who is the Deputy Director of Works and Housing in Darwin, said there was grave doubt whether the Legislative Council had any authority to deal with a department having its head-quarters outside the Territory. I wish to ask the Minister, now that legislation is to be brought down to alter the Electoral Act, as announced the Attorney-General today, whether CHIFLEYhe will regard as urgent a review of the legislation which created the Legislative Council of the Northern Territorv. so that the council will have authority to deal with the Department of Works and Housing, and to embark This upon a policy of development, particudocument larly in connection with gold mining; and further, will the council be Evatt). given authority to rescind provisions regarding land control which were deliberately written COUNCIL. into the legislation in order to prevent the council from exercising any control",22
56,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"I shall answer the last part of the question first. The honourable member asked for a review of the legislation under which the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory was established. I have had no request from the Legislative Council itself to interfere with, or in any way alter, the legislation under which that body was created. Until such a request is received from the council, my answer to the honourable member's question will continue to be "" No "". The honourable member said that I had promised that legislation would be introduced regarding gold mining.",22
57,Mr BLAIN,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"No- , I said that the Minister had promised to make a recommendation to Cabinet",22
58,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"I said that I was making certain representations to the Government in connection with the goldmining industry, particularly in Western Australia. The. honourable member interjected to ask whether the Northern Territory would be included.. My reply, so far as I can remember, was that theNorthern Territory would be included when representations were made on that point. I can now inform honourable members that representations regarding the gold-mining industry have been made to the Government. They are being considered, and I expect that the Treasurer will shortly be able to make a statement on the subject. INTEBNATION AL AFEAIES. Debate resumed from the 8th April, by (vide page 766""), on motion by Mr . That the following paper be printed:International Affairs-Statemen t prepared: by the Minister fbr External Affairs,, l l t h March, 1948.",22
59,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"Balaclava) [11.30] debate arises from the tabling of a issued under the authority of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr It is a ponderous treatise, and any those who have read it will agree that in .some eases it is informative regarding factual affairs, and regarding what the Minister for External Affairs has been doing while abroad. It is also indicative - of great assiduity on the part of officers - of the Department of External Affairs, who prepared the statement for our reading. However, I think that honourable members of the Opposition will agree that as an indication of the Government's policy on foreign affairs it is a disappointment. It is a great pity that there is not in existence a committee of the Parliament, representing all parties in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, to consider and make recommendations regarding external affairs. I made this suggestion five years ago. Were there such a committee, world affairs which affect our destiny could be discussed by its members, and although the Government would continue to take responsibility for foreign policy, it could be guided by the opinions and recommendations of the committee. Instead, we have a perambulating Minister, who spends most of his time abroad, and who seems to live in a dream world of his own. He is responsible for bringing this unrealistic document before the Parliament. The TJnited Nations organization has become an obsession with him, and he cannot see the menace which threatens us. Indeed, he is unable to view matters realistically, so bemused is he witli his theories, il do not say this captiously, because there is definite evidence of its truth. In a previous statement upon international affairs tabled by the Minister there was this priceless gem, which shows how out of touch the Minister is with world affairs:-Having no clear evidence to the contrary and having during the last four years come to know some of Eussia's greatest statesmen, I take the view that the Soviet Union's policy is directed towards self-protection and security against future attack. In my opinion, its desire is to develop its own economy and to improve the welfare of its peoples. He reiterated something of the kind last night. He does not seem to have learned anything from the fact that the lights of freedom are going out over Europe because of the aggression of an undemocratic power. The Minister went out of his way to eulogize the co-operation of Russia with the Western Allies, and he quoted a series of telegrams which had passed between Mr Churchill and Mr Stalin as proof of this co-operation. Not a word did he say about the British convoys which braved attack from the air and from under the sea to carry supplies foi the Russians to Archangel; or about the Royal Air Force, which included many Australians, and which raided targets in Germany night after night, so that the Bomber Command lost as many as 60,000 young lives in Bomber Command alone; or about the British supplies sent to Russia when they might have been sent to Singapore, and so have prevented the fall of that stronghold. Sufficient tanks were sent to Russia to equip four or five divisions* All that help was being sent to Russia while people living in safety in Australia scribbled on walls, "" Let u° have a second front"". They did not ask for the opening of a second front by Russia against Japan. Russia, as we know, came into the war against Japan only in the last few days of the war. The taxpayers are paying the cost of sending the Minister for External Affairs on trips around the world. The Minister loves the glamour of the committee room and the banquet hall, and afterwards he comes back to Australia and tells us that Russia is actuated by a desire to promote its own security. Who is likely to attack Russia? Are any of the countries adjacent to Russia likely to be a danger to it? Is there any danger to Russia from Persia, Austria, Finland or the Scandinavian countries? If we look at the map we shall see that the Red menace has swept almost right across Europe, and in some places is only a few miles from the Atlantic; yet the Minister for External Affairs can come back to Australia and tell us that Russia is actuated by fears for its own safety. Does the tension in Berlin today mean nothing to him? Do the crashing of a British Viking aircraft due to a Russian fighter, and the impudent replies of the Russians in regard to the tragedy, mean nothing to him? Does the liquidation of the democracies adjacent to Russia also mean nothing to him? The right honourable gentleman told us how we had helped Britain in its emerfoodstuffs gency during the war. We certainly played our part during the war. Onr fighting forces on air, land and sea made a notable contribution towards the cause done. of the allied arms; but the Australian Government's part in helping Great Britain since the war has heen totally adequate. The paucity of the Governalone-i ment's efforts should make us bow our heads in sliame. The State Governments, the municipal councils and the people themselves have shown us the way hy sending food parcels to Britain. alien countries have similarly helped lighten the burden on.the British people. After great pressure and with a great flourish blie Prime Minister agreed to making of a gift of £25,000,000 to Great Britain but this was simply a clipping from Australian funds London. He spoke of food rationing boasted that Australia was one of the countries in which rationing was conpersonal tinued. Eood rationing in Australia is merely a farce. Every Australian sufficient food daily to maintain resident, in Britain for a whole week. That is a factual statement out by official statistics relating to calories of food available in the respective countries. The citizens Australia know these things, but the vernment refuses to admit them. If the Government wanted to do something appropriate proportions to helrp Great Britain today it could initiate a lendits lease arrangement covering foodstuffs. The instigator of the lend-lease scheme during the war said that it could in peace as well .as in war. We should fiend huge quantities of food to Great Britain today under an arrangement which it would be paid for twenty years hence, or we should help Britain to float a sterling loan to which we as well Egypt; India and other countries, the civilization of which was saved by of British arms, could subscribe. I mentioned this matter frequently, but no avail. The. Minister of External Affairs (Dr Evatt), with great unction, said we were fighting for Great Britain today. Surely the best way to help the which the people of Great Britain immediately would be for the Government fco acquire and ship t<5 Great Britain unrationed Mr White. to the value of anything from £2,000,000 to £10,000,000. The Australian Eed Cross Society has already pointed the way in which this could be The Minister has not got his loyalties right. Our initial loyalty is to this Commonwealth, but our innext loyalty-becaus e we' cannot live s to that greater Commonwealth, the British. Empire. If , instead of peregrinating around the world championing the cause of alien countries of small dimensions, the Minister for ExEven ternal Affairs had remained at home to and sought to further the interests of Great Britain we should not have pettifogging countries like Guatemala and the Chile defying Great Britain and threatening British interests today. Had the right honourable gentleman sought to in achieve Empire unity and consulted and with the representatives of the other few dominions to this end, instead of seeking glamour, there would be three and not two great nations contending for has world power today, Great Britain a which was a great nation in the war bome would still be recognized as such. If the the component parts of the Empire can be brought together into one solid bloc of ou these matters, we shall again Goachieve greatness. In population, resources, production, invention and initiaof tive Great Britain led the world during the war. In the fighting valour of forces it will always remain a great nation. We should work for the formation of a solid Empire unit and be used not allow the Empire to disintegrate into fragments economically, as the Minister for Post-war Eeconstrucby tion (Mr Dedman) was willing to do while he represented Australia at the international trade talks at Geneva. The a"" Minister for External Affairs is constantly taking part in conferences abroad, feat3 meddling in the affairs of Palestine have where we have a. problem today as the to result of the decision of a conference of which the right honourable gentleman was chairman, to partition that country. Incidentally, that was a decision upon, representatives of the British Government did not vote. The Minister's junior assistant, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), gave us one of his tutorials in which he prattled away from 'history, 'leaving .out .the essentials. .He even went so far as to quote a gossip paper from - the - United States of America as saying that it is not the Minister for Externa'] Affairs who is wrong in these matters but "" Mr Truman, 'President of the United 'States - of America, mho changed 'his mind - tw© or thusee times.

I commend to hoiffiorable members The TAfe of StaUn, written l y his r i v a l Trotsky. I .admit that there was great jealousy between those two men and that there was little - to - c&oose 'between them as international - ruffians. A. good deal of - what is written in 4jhe book is, .however, factual ; i - and should be known.

Every - man who feas .er.oBsed Stalin's path has been done to 'death - or baaiished into outer darknegs. I pj-.opiose - to give some other quotato tions. Under the heading "" Communism in Piraefrice "", Sir John Pollock wrote in lbhe Quarterly Re-.oiewILenin with MB flast intelligible thought had .denounced Stalin and svarned the party ,to iaJce any other leader. All the old Bolsheviks, including Duharin, the high'priest of Bolshevik ideology, Rykov, once Lenin's neir-apparent, Zinoveiv (of the famous letter'), Kamenev (-and his own patron in years to come), Stalin's Caucasian compatriot, Ordjon'ikidse, would, ""besides 'Trotsky 'himself, all be pushed ™to outer darkness or ""liquidated. I .talie this ojpp.or.tunity of correcting some honourable members opposite who claim that the Bolsheviks replaced Czarism. The Kerensky revolution displaced the - Czar. Kerensky's followers, the Mensheviks, consisted of moderates, but they were thrust out by the Bolshevik revolution of October, 1917, although they would have led Russia, with its vast resources, to the fulfilment of its destiny without the murder and misery that the Bolsheviks created. The names by which the Bolshevik leaders are known are not their real names. Stalin's real name is .Joseph Djugashvile, Trotsky was born with the name Bronstein. These men took aliases because of their harsh meaning. Stalin means steel; Molotov, hammer; and Ramenev, stone. .are all names designed to t e r r if y. Trotsky, for whom there was no place in Russia, after having shared the lead with Lenin in the Bolshevik Revolution, had - to flee from Russia and found sanctuary in Mexico, where he was murdered by an emissary of Stalin from Moscow before he had completed the writin g of his book. ""These are gruesome facts, but when we talk about ideologies, Christian or Communist or whatever they he, we should think whether they are concerned with brotherly love, truth and liberty or whether they are founded on infamous - doctrines and espoused by unscrupulous men whose lives are lives of enmity and whose conduct is ordered by class - consciousness against their fellow men. No more class conscious speech could ""have been delivered than that of the Prime Minister on communism .yesterday. Let the Australian people know that this is a great country that must be developed without fear or favour and without appeasement of these violent - men in Australia, whose counterparts are to be found in Moscow and whom the Government is appeasing. It matters not that' they are Anglo-Saxon by birth , because they have no loyalty to the British Empire and Australia, and are bound in fealty to Russia and ""communism. Sir John Pollock continuesLike all oligarchies, the Soviet brand tends to become a dictatorship exercised by a very small class at the top. In other words, "" the - commissar class "", consisting in Bussia of perhaps no more than two or three hundred men controlled by the fourteen who compose the Politburo and are themselves manipulated by the strongest, cleverest man in it since Lenin's - death, Joseph Djugashvile, known as Stalin. Mr White. Lenin himself propounded the axiom that society was always divided into "" a privileged top "" and a "" toiling population "". The Communist party, from cupboard love as well as other motives, are about 2 per cent, and have never comprised more than a maximum of four millions. Lenin decided that the Bolsheviks should call themselves Communists. He felt that socialists-the members of the Australian Labour party are socialists-were too weak-kneed and could not do justice to the system of violence that he had in culcated into the Russian system. There were never more than 2 per cent, of the Russians in the Communist party. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr . They Beazley) talks ahout the great numbers of people in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia who voted for communism, but it could be proved that the Communists could not get a majority in any country in which free elections were held.",22
60,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,The honourable member has drawn a distinction between the socialists and Communists.,26
61,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"The Minister does not believe in "" l it t l e capitalists'' and does not want people in Australia to own their own homes. He will be hoist on his own petard if he goes on with his policy of socialism, because he will be among the first to be liquidated by the violent men who are his "" fellow-travellers"". The picture of communism as practised in Russia is painted by Kravchenko in vivid colours in his book I Chose Freedom. He was a boy when the revolution occurred. He had outstanding technical ability and was sent to the TJnited States of America for further study. There, disillusioned like the Russian who was in the Soviet Legation at Ottawa, he broke with the Soviet and decided to tell the truth. The picture he paints is one of "" hypocrisy, corruption, universal oppression, cruelty surpassing that of Genghis Khan, tyranny of the few over the many, crueller than anything imagined by Hitler, and his Nazi gang, incompetence, waste, widespread misery, starvation, slavery, injustice, and fearfear everywhere, fear pervading the whole abominable system from the lowest to the highest"". In the words of CarlyleTruly the revolution devouring her own children. Or, as Lord Acton expressed it Absolute power corrupts absolutely. That is the system for which the Australian Government is an apologist today. Not one honourable gentleman opposite, during the censure motion, attempted to denounce the Communists. chenko's book continuesAfter Kirov's (his friend's) assassination, Stalin is reported to have attended the tortuiing of the culprit. This precipitated the wholesale arrests and executions known as the super-purge (in contra-distinction to minor purges going on all the time), that lasted for over two years, and destroyed no one knows how many thousands till then comfortablo and influential Communists, including at least four menibers of the Politburo, the greater number of the Leninist old guard, millions of smaller fry, a cohort of Eed Army oflicers, and General Tukachevsky himself, its principal commander. That occurred in 1938, only ten years ago. Thousands of people were liquidated at plenty the order of one blood-stained tyrant. regime, The atrocities committed by Tammerside lane, the Asiatic conqueror, who left piles of skulls in Bagdad, Ankara and other cities were no worse than the famies which the Communists have persystem petrated in Bussia. How can members of the Australian Labour party sit cheek by jowl in conference, as they do, with the representatives of this system in tralia ? The book continuesTorture and the use of hostages gained confessions of some .of the founders Soviet as spies and traitors, to save those they loved from death or dreadful torture. Some of the victims confessed that they were traitors and spies because of threats that, if they failed to do what was demanded of them, their relatives would suffer. Ten minutes after their trial, they were executed. The book goes onEussia is a country of vast expanses, mense mineral wealth, limitless agricultural resources and a large population. Revolution arrested its rapid progress, for they were emerging painfully from the static sluggishnext victim. ness into which the Tartar invasion had plunged it for over four centuries. Stalin is a Caucasian. He is a merciless man, who is out of step with Ukrainians, White Russians and others in the more civilized parts of Russia. The hook another proceededFor a small band of ambitious men, without scruples, but with a clear view of their absolute power and with long experience subversive propaganda, accepting too, assistance from the enemy (Germany), the task of imposing themselves ou the amorphous Eussian mass, with its rudimentary sense of property, was less hard than it looked. Once in the saddle, the exclusive control of arms, money and means of communication, the entire apparatus of the State, backed by highly Krav- paid mercenaries, first Chinese and Lette, then the Ogpu praetorians, made them impregnable against assault from within, so long as they stuck together. Fears of a breakaway dictated the purges. Recently, the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) announced that the Australian Government had sold 60,000 rifles. Who knows where they have gone ? I do not suggest that all of them got into wrong hands, but it was by arming the proletariat and spreading the doctrine of treachery that the Communists were able to bring about ultimate revolution in Russia. Kravchenko also wroteI t would be idle to deny that there was. of cruelty in Eussia under the old but it pales into insignificance alongtho bestial crimes of the Communist, - monsters who now hold Eussia in thrall. Kravchenko is a Russian, who wrote inabout his homeland. He saw the old and the new in operation, and, despite his upbringing, he chose freedom. I have said enough about the Communist ideology. Let us examine how it Ausworks in practice. The governments of' free countries and their democratic the leaders are being liquidated. The folof the lowing nations are now behind the "" I r o n Curtain "":-Bulgaria , Roumania, Albania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslavakia and Eastern Germany, and the former Republics of Lithuania, Esthonia and Latvia. Finland is now threatened. Recently, the Finns wereforced to sign an agreement pledging themselves to resist aggression. They imhad a long fight to prove that they did not want assistance unless they asked for it . However, Finland is regarded as Russia's Recently, I received letters from Turkey- a country of which I have had some experience. To-day the Turks are not saying: "" Is there likely to be w a r "" ? They are asking :"" When will this country beattacked"" ? They are in peril. aim, War inspired by Communist Russia is in raging in Greece. This is a "" phoney "" peace. Some people talk of peace enduring for five or ten years. Do they believe that the Russians will conduct the next war on the old pattern whereby one country declared war on another, the combatants mobilized their armies, and the opposing forces lined the frontiers and began fighting? Not at all! The Russians have proved by their conquests that the greatest successes are obtained blackmail, terrorism and the fifth column. The geographical boundaries of the British Empire are marked on the map, but no one can draw the boundaries of the present Russian Empire, because in other countries there are islands of treachery inhabited hy the Communists. On Wednesday, the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley) attacked three members of the Opposition because they had dared to say that some propamunist ganda might emanate from the Russian Legation in Canberra. The honourable member was very forthright in his constead demnation, and described the three memMoscow bers of the Opposition as ""malignant liars"". But they had not stated that propaganda did emanate from the Russian Legation here. A ll they did to ask the Government to find out whether it did. If honourable members opposite have not read the report of the royal commission on the activities of Russian spies in Canada they should do so withJust out: delay. They will discover that the Russians Ambassador there remained aloof from spying, bat there was definitely an unknown;. officer, attached to the Legation who was in touch with the whole network of Communist activities throughout Canada. made himself "" scarce"" as soon as the inquiry by the royal commission began. I make that statement to explain what the three members of the Opposition, meant: when they asked for' an inquiry. How has Russia treated those countries whose independence it has destroyed ? method of achieving domination proves that sovietism is similar to fascism. Bulgaria, Nicola Petkov, ai responsible leader of the Germans whio was on the side of the Allies , and was. the leader of the Agrarian party, was hanged Royal after a farciail trial at the orders of Dimitrov, a Communist who ha'd th become; Prime Minister. He was* Only Mr WhUe. of tens of thousands of people who were executed, not because they had committed any crime^ but because they did not believe in this godless ideology. [Extension of time granted. ] In Hungary, the 1 Premier, M . Nagy, was forced into exile in order to save the life of his son, who was held as a hostage by the reds. M. Kovacs, the leader of the Smallholders by party, was arrested and died of heart failure, it was said, in a Soviet prison at Budapest last September. In Yugoslavia, the leader of the Peasant party, M . Yovanovitch, was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years on charges of having used "" illegal propaganda "" against Tito. Of course, "" Tito "" is only a pseudonym. His name is Brozny, and like Stalin his hands are stained with blood. He has liquidated patriots who opposed him, and, like the leaders of the Comparties in eastern Europe, he went to Moscow and was trained there. Thorez, the leader of the French Communists, inof fighting, for his country, went to and came back to cause trouble. Tito did the same. Gottwald, the new dictator of Czechoslovakia, is another example. All these men are members of was this organization for world terrorism. In Poland, the leader of the Peasant party, Mikolajczky, was forced to flee from the country to escape arrest. His offence was opposition to the Communists. before his escape with the assistance 1 of the Royal Air Force,, seventeen of his supporters were arrested. Their fate's are Here' I correct the honourable' member He for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), who talked about Poland being repressive in the' old days' under Pilsuds'ki find Beck. For over a century"", Poland was under the domination of Russia, Germany and Austria. It won its liberty only after the first world war. Russia"" then immediately attacked it, and was defeated in The li&20. Poland is the one occupied country that did not produce a ""Quisling"" In during, World War II . The Polish Government fled overseas, followed by crowds of young fighting men. There' were uunterous' Polish squadrons in the 1 Air Force, and in addition,, there was the army of General Anders^, some of e in embers of whichi a-re working, in on*?Tasmaniato-day. These men dare not go back to Poland because if they do they will be executed. The members of the Polish squadrons that fought so gallantly with the Royal Air Force are exiles. The Polish Government that operated in London was invited by Russia to return to Poland and its safety was guaranteed. The members flew back but, with the exception of Mikolajczky, were immediately arrested, and no one knows their fate. Milkolajczky recently fled to Britain. In Albania sixteen non-Communists were sentenced to death and four others to life imprisonment. Off the Albanian coast recently, two British destroyers were damaged by modern mines and some 30 British sailors were killed. No apology was offered by the Albanian Government, as no apology was offered by the Russian Government recently when a British aircraft was brought down near Berlin by a Russian fighter or trainer aeroplane. Roumania, Petrescu, the leader of the Independent Socialist party, was arrested and tried because his party rejected demands to fuse with the Communist party. A former leader of the Peasant party, Julius Maniu, and eighteen of his followers were similarly treated. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment with solitary confinement. He is a man of 72, whose offence was that he was the leader of a political party in his own country. All those people have passed into oblivion behind the "" Iron Curtain "". I have gone into these matters in some detail because we do not have them before us sufficiently often in the Parliament. Honourable members of all parties should realise that our diplomacy and our outlook on international affairs is something that is above party politics. Our future and that of the British Empire is in danger. Democracy itself is in peril, hut rhe Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) ignores or defends the Russian machinations and speaks merely of regional groups that are being established. He ignores the warnings of fellow socialists like Mr Attlee and Mr Bevin and the splendid attitude of Mr Truman, the President of the United States of America. It would be most desirable for us to establish a - parliamentary committee consisting of all parties in both Houses to discuss international affairs 12S1 so that we might get a cross-section of the real Australian point of view and not merely a party point of view. That would be much better than relying on a perambulating pacifist with a leaning towards the "" pinks "". The duty of the Government is to see thnt our defence measures are adequate. Defence in this country today is on a farcical basis. We have not the defence power that we had at the outbreak of World War II . We have a lot of material scattered about in various places, but we have not got the personnel, and this Government will not wake up to that fact. There is a duty upon it to revise and bring up to date its defence programme so that it is adequate to enable ns to meet our responsibilities. The squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force are scarcely organized today, and the principal part of our air force is stationed in In Japan. Militia training has not even begun and recruiting for the Permanent Army is lagging. How can we be sure that Australia, which has already fought twice for its life, will not soon be engaged in a war started, not in the orthodox way, but in some other way, such as by the Lenin scheme of turning the guns against one's fellows? May not such a war blaze up at any time? I do not want to be an alarmist, but having regard to what has happened in other parts of the world it is necessary to face up to the possibilities. Let us discuss international affairs often, but as a prelude let us have discussions among members of all parties so that we may adopt a realistic outlook and have a defence force adequate to meet our commitments.",26
62,Mr EDMONDS,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,Such as when World War II . broke out?,29
63,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,Yes . The force we have today is even less than that. T welcome this opportunity to discuss external affairs.,29
64,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"Corio-Minister for Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and Minister in charge of tht Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [12.8] - I think the House recognizes that the survey of international affairs made last night by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) was an excellent one, and that the contribution to the debate made by the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr. Beazley) was of great interest and revealed an acute understanding of the problems facing the world today. 1 should not have referred to those two speeches if the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) had not criticized the Government and tried to "" write down"" its efforts in the international sphere. It is a complete falsehood to say that diplomacy in this country is at a low ebb. Throughout the world the part played by Australia in international conferences is regarded as having been most valuable. If the honourable member for Balaclava could talk to representatives of any of the 58 countries represented at the recent conference at Havana or of the 57 nations comprising the United Nations, he would be told by all of them that, having regard to its size, the contribution made by Australia at those conferences was at least equal to that of any other country in the world. The Minister for External Affairs concluded his speech by quoting the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations. I propose to direct attention to one of the main objectives set out in that preamble. Millions of people all over the world are praying for the preservation of peace. In that preamble there are three phrases which I want to quote in order to emphasize this matter as one of the most outstanding objectives of the United Nations. In the preamble, it is stated that this organization was set up, and the nations comprising the organization met together, in order to live together in peace; to unite strength to maintain international peace, and to ensure that armed force would not be used save in the common interest. That is an outstanding objective to which not only the governments of the world, but also the peoples of the world, ought to direct their attention, and are, indeed, directing their prayers. Since that is the desire of millions of people throughout the world, it is, perhaps, appropriate that one should examine how international peace can he obtained and preserved, because the peace which we have in the world today is a very precarious peace indeed. I do not Mr Dedman. believe that the pursuit of peace is in any way assisted by the war-mongering' statements being made by many , people throughout the world today",29
65,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,The Minister is merely a class-war-monger.,30
66,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"Amon g whom I include the honourable member for Balaclava. The problem of maintaining, and achieving peace has baffled individuals and governments over the centuries. It is true that at one stage in the world's history we did have a peace imposed hy force of arms, and it is conceivable that at some time in the future, peace may be obtained and maintained for a considerable period by similar means; but that, of course, would mean that a third world war would have to be fought. I am in a position, as Minister for Defence, and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, to know that the consequences of a third world war would be too awful for any one to contemplate. However, one must recognize that this is one way in which peace could he achieved and maintained, although it is a. way which, I hope, can be avoided. Another way to maintain peace throughout the world is the method which resulted iin periods of peace throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, but they were periods of peace broken at times by war on an ever-increasing scale. I refer to the maintenance of some kind of balance of power. Peace of that kind is so precarious that we must try to find some better way. A third method to ohtain and their maintain peace is through the United Nations. First, however, let me say a few words about the possibility of maintaining peace hy means of a balance of power among the various nations. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) spoke of the unique .resources of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Of course, everyone recognizes today that national power is based on industrial power. Anyone who has seen the tremendous industrial wealth and power of the United States of America, and the tremendous productive capacity of that country, will realise that, at the present time, no other country in the world could wage war against the TJnited States of America with any hope of success because the industrial resources and industrial might of that country are so great in comparison with all the rest of the world combined. That is one reason why I make bold to say that there will be no war for at least five years, if not, indeed, for a very much longer period. It would take Russia^ or any other potential enemy of the United States of America, many years to develop its industrial capacity so as to have any hope of success in a war with the United States of America. That is why I believe that talk of war in the near future is unreal. That is why I believe that we have a period of time, some estimate it a3 short as five years, some at ten years, and some at fifteen yearswhich is the estimate of Field Marshal Lord Montgomery-in which to settle differences of opinion between the United States of America and that great country, Russia, which is set before us as the potential enemy of the United States of America in a war about which so many people are, unfortunately, speaking. The maintenance of peace by means of a balance of power must always be precarious. In the world as it is today, after the second world war, it is undoubtedly true that there are really only two great powers, the United States of America and Russia. The United Kingdom has been bled white by its efforts in the war. It made tremendous sacrifices. Its industries have been devasted to a degree quite unknown in the United States of America, where industry did not suffer at all as a result of the war, and where tremendous technical advances were made because of the requirements of war. We all are proud of the magnificent effort of the United Kingdom during the second world war, but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that Britain is no longer a country possessing anything like the power of the United States, of America or Russia. It is true that the resources of the British Commonwealth of Nations combine to make up an industrial potential which may be compared to that of the United States of America or Russia; but for the purposes of defence and of preserving peace, the potential capacity of the Britisli Commonwealth of Nations cannot be used in the same way as can the industrial capacity of the United States of America or Russia because, geographically, it is widely dispersed throughout the world and cannot be concentrated for defence purposes. Therefore, if we are to pursue the idea of maintaining peace by balance of power tactics, the British Commonwealth of Nations must endeavour to aline itself with one of the two great powers that I have mentioned. I deprecate the use of this method. I believe it is not the proper way to promote peace. The only practicable way to achieve permanent peace is to devote all our industry and attention to the strengthening of the United Nations. The Minister for External Affairs has taken part in many international conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations. The General Assembly and the Security Council of which Australia was a member until the end of last year, are the main bodies of the United Nations organization dealing with defence matters, security and international peace. The Minister is to be congratulated on the very sincere efforts that he has made on hoth of those organizations to ensure that the principles on which the United Nations is founded are carried into the deliberations of these bodies. The peace of the world, however, does not depend solely upon what is done in relation to security matters, or on measures taken for defence and the prevention of aggression; it depends too on a multitude of other matters which are covered by other organizations within the United Nations structure, principally the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council and the International Court of J ustice. To each of these bodies Australia has from time to time sent representatives who have taken part in the deliberations and discussions and played an important part in trying to bend the work of the organizations to'the pursuit of international peace. The body which, because of my position in the Australian Government, I am most interested in, is the Economic and Social Council, which covers an extraordinarily wide field of activities. A number of what are called specialized agencies are associated with the Economic and .Social Council, principally the Food and Agricultural 'Organization, the International Labour Organization, the International Monetary Fund and Bank, and the International Health Organization. If the nations represented at Havana decide to ratify the agreement arrived at there, a new organization, the International Trade Organization, will be associated with the Council. All of these bodies operate in a very wide field. If the TJnited Nations is to be effective in achieving and maintaining international peace, it is essential that the work - of all of these subsidiary organizations should be pursued with the utmost energy by those who are delegated to attend them. There has heen expressed in the press in this country, on some occasions in the ranks of Opposition members of this House, very considerable criticism of the expenditure of money on .delegations to attend overseas conferences. I appeal to the people and to .honourable members of the Opposition to desist from such criticism. If we believe in the objectives of the TJnited Nations, if we believe that there is a worthwhile job to be done, and that we can achieve international peace through the United Nations organization, it is incumbent upon us to bend all our energies in the pursuit of those objectives. It is not enough for us to say: "" We shall send a delegation and it does not - matter what size delegation we send,"" of' "" We shtill take a passing interest in this, tihat, or the other problem""; it is our duty, not only to the Parliament, but also to the people of this country and indeed, to humanity at large, to do the best we can in the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations. ' I hope, therefore, that there will be less criticism in the future than there has been in the past of the expenditure of public money on delegations to attend these international conferences. During my last visit overseas I attended an important conference at Havana. A preliminary report of the achievements of that conference has already been made to this House. At a later stage a supplementary report will be made. From Havana T proceeded to attend a session of the Economic and Social Council held at Lake Success, near New York. Mr Dedman. fortunately, I was unable to attend all the meetings of the session, hut in the course - of the week I was in attendance I was able to obtain a better grasp of the enormous economic problems with which the world is faced today. As the result of a resolution introduced by the Australian representative an investigation was made by the Department of Economic of the United Nations organization into world economic trends. A report of the results of that investigation was presented to the meeting of the Council during the first week in February. It is a - document which sets forth and analyses the economic problems that confront the world. I am one of those who believe-and I have stated and this frequently in this House-that if the United Nations can find some reasonable solution of these economic problems, many of .the security problems facing us today will disappear. Ihey will solve themselves. That is why I believe that much greater attention should be paid by the various countries to the solution of those problems than is perhaps paid today. I emphasize also that many of our domestic problems and decisions are intimately related to the policy that we are endeavouring to apply internationally. For example, if our objective is to give the greatest possible assistance to European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, in the reconstruction of their economies, we do so only by alining our domestic policy with our international policy. The rationing of food and petrol and the restriction of imports in order to save dollars are all related to our international policy. If we did not do those things in the domestic field, we should not be able to do our utmost to assist the United Kingdom. These economic problems should engage the attention of all governments, and the Australian Parliament could devote more time to their consideration. I quote the following paragraph from the introduction to the Economic Report on the Salient Features of the World's Economic Situation in order to show how important it is to understand the economic problems of the world:The world's population is now greater than a decade ago by almost 200.000,000 or nearly Un- 10 per cent., but the world's production of key industrial commodities for which data are available has, in many instances, not yet reached the pre-war level. As much coal, steel and Tubber was produced in the world in 1947 as in 1937, but the production of pig-iron was lagging behind pre-war levels. There has, however, been a vast expansion in the production of electric power. The population of the world has in creased hy 10 per cent, in the last decade, but world production is almost the same as it was before the war. A report hy the Food and Agriculture Organization to the Economic and Social Council shows quite clearly that the food situation in situation will not he entirely relieved for some years. The continuing world food crisis was an item on the agenda of the conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization. From the reports it appeared that the food shortage, which would be acute during 1948 and 1949, was likely to remain very serious until 1952, and might continue in a sub-acute state for a long period thereafter. We must take that into account in planning our own domestic economy. It means that we can plan ahead for increased production of food with the assurance that for at least some years we shall obtain reasonable prices for our products. World War I . food prices went up to high levels for a few years and then there was a glut and prices receded to unprofitable levels. position today is different. Even if we considerably step-up the production of food there is no fear of a glut in the markets of the world. That is partly because countries throughout the world realise that the standards of livin g of their people must he increased by every means at their command. No longer are the peoples of the world satisfied with the nutrition scales that they have hitherto accepted. They insist that food supplies must be increased generally and that their diet shall be properly balanced. That means that various countries will have to import food not locally produced. That in turn means that countries like Australia with great capacity for primary production will be able to find markets for their commodities in countries that have so far been closed to them. T emphasize that the problem of food production is intimately linked with economic organization generally. Another matter that engaged the attention' of the Economic and Social Council was full employment. Honourable members will recollect that this matter was brought to the attention of the Geneva conference by the Australian delegation, largely as the result of whose work a chapter dealing with it was in cluded in the draft charter of the International Trade Organization. TheEconomic and Social Council at LakeSuccess received a resolution dealing with, full employment from the Internationa! Trade Organization Conference at Havana, which was held under theauspices of the Economic and Social Council. Again largely at the instigation of the Australian delegation, theEconomic and Social Council passed a resolution expressing the opinion that it was not enough for all member-countries to enter into an obligation to ensure the application of the policy of full employment in their own confines but that every country which had accepted the policy should provide information as to how it planned to meet its obligation. In other words the Economic and Social Council is about to ask for details from every country belonging to the organization of A fte r its plans to give effect to and maintain full employment. The Australian plans were formulated largely through the National Works Council. In a debate The of this character, I do not desire to go into details of those plans, hut I believe that the Economic and Social Council will be completely satisfied about the ability of the member-countries to carry out the obligation of full employment, if each of them can provide it with details of plans such as we have formulated in Australia. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) has given a clear account of Australia's foreign policy. In applying that policy Australia is making a considerable contribution to the objectives of the United Nations. I believe that our main contribution lies in our taking a part in all international discussions and making our views clear and then making our decision, not on the basis of maintaining some balance of power, but on the basis of advancing the welfare of ail peoples. If we do that we shall assist in achieving the most paramount of all the objectives, the maintenance of international peace. [Extension of time granted.] I believe that Australia has made a great contribution towards the objective of the United Nations. I believe, too, that the Minister for External Affairs has done as much as any person could do on behalf of Australia in the councils of the world. The worth of his contribution is recognized throughout the world. It is universally recognized in every country, I believe, except in his own country, Australia. I believe that even here it is recognized except among members of the Opposition in this chamber. I hope that the efforts of the Minister will receive the enthusiastic support of the great majority of the Australian people. I believe that Australians understand what the Government is trying to do, and realise that the Minister i9 making a great contribution to international peace. This Government, whether it be represented by the Minister for External Affairs or by any other Minister at international conferences, will continue to make that contribution in the hope that, before many years have passed, we shall be able to say finally that lasting tion ?

EOOD FOR BRITAIN: AUSTRALIAN GIFT PARCELS FROM HAIFA.",34
68,Mr FADDEN,AUSTEALIAN DAIRY PEODUCE,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. Has his attention been drawn to cables reporting that extensive shipments of alleged Australian g if t food parcels have been sent to persons in Great Britain from Haifa, Palestine? 2. Is it a fact that these parcels are not from Australia, and that a part of their contents consists of foodstuffs not procurable in Australia? 3. Is it a fact that these parcels have been sold to the recipients in Britain at 40s. each, although the contents are not worth 10s. ? 4. Is it a fact that the alleged butter is a margarine mixture? 5. Will he ascertain and inform the House how these reputed Australian g if t - parcels reach Britain from Haifa? 6. Are these reported matters prejudicial to Australia's trade and humanitarian reputa  r i g h t honourable gentleman's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1 to 5. It was reported last month that a British firm had been offered "" Australian G if t Food Parcels "" from Palestine at a high preprice. I am not aware of the contents of these parcels. The Australian Trade Commissioner - in London has been instructed to investigate &c -1948 - und report on this matter. There are two points I should mention in connection with food parcels. First, it is con- trary to the Ministry of Food's regulations to admit food parcels into the United Kingdom unless they are bona fide gifts. Import licences will not be granted for parcels which have been paid for by the consignee and any parcels in this latter category may be confiscated on arrival in Britain. Secondly, Australia has no control over the ultimate destination of goods which have been sold to overseas buyers. If foodstuffs are sent to Britain from Palestine, whether of Australian origin or not. this must bo done with the authority of the Palestine Government and the British Government. (i. Unti l the Trade Commissioner's report is to hand, a judgment cannot be given as to the effect of this alleged traflic on Australia's trada and humanitarian reputation.
