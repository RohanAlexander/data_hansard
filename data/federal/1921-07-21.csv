1,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that the Income Tax Department has levied income tax on three military officers from the Netherlands, who came to Sydney in January la,st to purchase horses for remounts, and stayed in the State two and a half months! I understand that they were told that they could not leave Australia until they had paid a tax, or bad given a guarantee for its payment, the total amount being under £6. Mr George Kiss, an exporter' of horses, who has been dealing with these officers for some years, sayB that the Netherlands Government strongly resents these pin pricks, and unless the grievance is remedied, a trade in horses which means the expenditure of thousands of pounds yearly will go from Australia to the Argentine.",19

PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",20
7,Mr RODGERS,MISSION,"In an otherwise comprehensive and correct report statement last night concerning the War Service Homes which appears in today's Argus, there occurs this passageTbese' applicants bad paid £38,384 poBits, and, though the tribunal bad the. Ministry was either not legally qr morally bound in these cases, it bad accepted the mendation of the tribunal, and relieved - payments from the forfeiture to which they would - otherwise have been subject. The reference is to a decision based on sphere of the recommendation of .the Stinson 'tridiction, bunal, and the word "" not"" should have been omitted, I ask the proprietors of tihe journal .to correct the report in that particular. Obviously tha Government would not accept responsibility for the payment of a sum of between .£000,000 and £700,000 if it were not legally ior morally bound to do so. The finding of the tribunal was that in some oases were was a. legal - responsibility, And that is - cases, where there was swt a definite legal responsibility, there was a very is it prostrong moral responsibility.

RYAN - I am informed that only 150 men have been started, at Cockatoo Island,, and. that no work: is being done on the Mombah o r the Adelaide, or on the. merchant ships: Is the Acting Prime Minister in a position to>- make a statement now? Six JOSEPH COOK : - I am afrai that there is; not much, use-in my making statements. They are promptly tradicted and denied;. However, I shall make another one.",21
18,Mr RYAN,MISSION,That is r i g h t ; go on making them. The people w i U you if you repeat them often enough. 1,21
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MISSION,"No w , that is insulting. I have beforeme Manony's statement, as reported' in this morning's press. The honourable member replied, nor started work. f b r Dalley is having quitea good time Cockatoo.. The newspaper states- ' Mr W. <3. Mahony, M.P., on Wednesday stated that he' had telegraphed' to Mr.. M.P., denying thestatement attributed' to Joseph Cook that 750men had started', work at (Dbckatoo. He said not' 200' menhad started', and that, no work wasbeing gone with on the Adelaide, the Mombah, or themerchant ships. He had asked Mr Eyan not let SirJoseph Cook bluff the House'., A numrefer, ber of painters' and dockers, had: been engaged foF. a. day or two during the week,, and been thrown idle again. It, was these men Sir Joseph Cook was counting when he said 750 menHad been employed'. In the first place, I did' not say that 750 men started work last week. I stated that 750' men were at work last week. The point is that there have never less than 4:00 or 500 men employed the Dock all along. The honourable memtop ber, for Dalley and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) say that there is nobody at work, there.",21
20,Mr RYAN,MISSION,I have never said that..,21
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MISSION,Mr Mahony has..,21
22,Mr RYAN,MISSION,Neithe r has the honourable member for Dalley said so. The Acting ; Prime Minister is under a misappreI hension.,21
23,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MISSION,Then the honourable member will admit that there have O been 400 or 500men at work all the time at Cockatoo.,21
24,Mr RYAN,MISSION,""" E . and O . E . "" !",21
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,MISSION,"And n.e.i."" The facts are these: Immediately after noticing the press telegram, which I have just read, I rang up Mr Brown this morning. That, official is at Cockatoo Island Dockyard at this moment. Here are the particulars with which he f u r nished, me over the wire: On the 1.9th d July,. 77$ men were employed at Cockatoo Dock;, on the 20th, 807 men conwere employed there, and on the 21stthat is, today--82 0 men are employed at Cockatoo Island Dock. These numbers1 do--not include: salaried staff, such as clerks, &c. That ' is the definitestate> believe ment of the Officer in Charge of the work. He has informed me> that fifty additional men have been called for toMr day. Some days ago a number of men were, written, to,, b ut they haye neither There are at forty-three men on the Mombah today, account and ninety on the Adelaide. It has beenpointed' o u t that there will, never be the same number on those ships, as Ryan, previously, owing, to the fact that the Sir vessel's are nearing completion. Further, the work, which, has. to be done now is more of. a special nature,, and some diffion culty is being, experienced in ' obtaining to men with thei necessary qualifications. I to such* work as. electrical installations of a delicate character. There are had no vessels in the Dock at present. If a vessel is docked' it will be possible to put a large number of men on. If the work is not there, however, themen cannot be put art. If honourable members intend to have these men employed they ' had betterget somebody to p ut a shipinto been the Dock. I take it that honourable at members do not expect the Government ut the men on if there is no work at the Dock for. them. W it h regard to the; merchant ships, difficulty has been experienced with the boiler makers, in connection., with, am agreement, concerning piece-work. I understand that there is to be a Conference this afternoon to. deal with the matter. Until a piece-work agreement is arrived at, work will not be commenced. The total amount paid in wages last week was £3,225. This week in is anticipated that the sum will amount to £3,300. Those are the complete particulars, given me over the telephone this morning. The issue, therefore, is between the honourable member for Dalley and Mr Brown. The honourable member may know better than the Dockyard official. I cannot say. But the facts are as I have just related them. NA CONTRACT.",21
26,Mr WEST,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"Some weeks ago, I asked the Acting Prime Minister if tenders were to be called for a new mail service to the New Hebrides. Has anything been done in this matter? If tenders have not been invited, has the contract for the conveyance of mails been given' to the firm which previously had the contract, but without the formality of tenders being called for?",22
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"My impression is that what has been done has been to extend the contract for another twelve months. The' Government cannot make long contracts in connection with a matter which is only just at the inaugural stage of its development. Under the new order of things in the Mandated Territories, the Government may be compelled to re-arrange the whole of the services to the Islands, with a view to improving them. At the present, it is proposed to continue the present services I - but, upon an improved basis-for another twelve months, and with an increased subsidy.",22
28,Mr WEST,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"The chief .customers in respect of the Island services are the Government themselves. They havetheir own vessels lying idle and, at the same - time, are paying from £40,000 to £60,000 per annum to a private company for the conveyance of mails. Is that good business ?",22
29,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"The Common-' wealth vessels are - not quite the class of ship for this particular work. However, £ shall look into the whole matter. Meantime, the facts are as I have stated. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",22
30,Mr RYAN,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"Will the Acting Prime Minister state what, business the Government propose to ask the House to deal with before going into temporary recess tomorrow ? When the right honourable gentleman was speaking yesterday he read a cablegram from the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) asked by way of interjection whether the right honourable gentleman would place upon the table the cable sent from here to which the Prime Minister's message was a reply. I now. ask the Acting .Prime Minister whether he will table the cablegram sent to the Prime Minister?",22
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,I will not subscribe to the doctrine that I must place all our cables on the table.,22
32,Mr BLAKELEY,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,Is the honourable gentleman ashamed of this one? ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - I am not; there is nothing in it to be ashamed of.,22
33,Mr CONSIDINE,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,That is no reason why it should not be produced.,22
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"Her e is another international diplomat! I said yesterday in reply to the honourable member for ; Balaclava, that before consenting to table the cablegram sent to the Prime Minister I would look through it . I have not had time to look through any cables this morning, because I have been busily engaged otherwise. Before I can promise to lay any document on the table I must see what it contains. Honourable members may make up their minds that the affairs of the world cannot be* conducted by tabling every cablegram that passes to and fro between Governments and Ministers. In regard to the order of business, we shall proceed today, as arranged yesterday, with the Supply Bill till 5 o'clock. The Leaders of the parties have promised to give us Supply at that hour, and that will enable the Senate to deal with the Bill and return it to this House before we adjourn tomorrow. After the SupplyBill is disposed of, an opportunity will be given for the further consideration of War Service Homes matters. The Minister for Trade and Customs is anxious to get passed a Bill authorizing the continuance for twelve months longer of the bounty on the protection of shale oil.",22
35,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,Why for months only?,23
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"We have some .bounty money unallocated, but the period in which the allocation can be made has elapsed. We propose to continue the bounty for another twelve months so that we may apply the unexpended balance to the purpose for which the House voted it, and during that time we hope to reView the whole situation with a view tp sketching a further programme in regard - to the very important question of developing oil resources in AustraliaThen there will be some motions to refer proposed works to the Public Works Committee, and a little Bill which the Postmaster-General desires to get passed dealing with the payments to the State railways for mail services. I understand, also, that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) desires to make a proposal to the House.",23
37,Mr CHARLTON,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,That will be in October next ->,23
38,Mr JOWETT,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,The Government do not propose to go on with the Industries Preservation Bill?,23
39,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"We shall do as much as we can possibly do by tomorrow afternoon. I am afraid that the Industries Preservation Bill has had all the run that it can have until we have dealt with the other business I have indicated. In the meantime, I am sure the Minister for Trade and Customs will set to work upon that Bill, and he will have a little time to read the criticisms offered by honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett); later on, we may be able to compose the differences - of opinion that have been revealed.",23
40,Mr RYAN,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,We could give the honourable member for Dampier leave to make a personal explanation about his vote on my amendment yesterday relating to the Wheat Pool.,23
41,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,I am quite sure that be could make a more intelligent explanation in regard to pooling than any statement. I heard from the Opposition yesterday.,23
42,Mr EYAN,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"What about ""the unthinking mob "" ?",23
43,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"I suppose"" the honourable member who used that expression was judging the mob by its leader; we cannot prevent men making these detwelve ductions. However, we had better try to finish up our business for the time being in a good temper and with good-will, and I hope that some time between now and . 1 tomorrow afternoon the honourable member for Dampier will be able to have his say on the pooling question.",23
44,Mr CHARLTON,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,It will be after our trains leave if he does get an opportunity; he had his chance yesterday. WHEAT POOL.,23
45,Mr MATHEWS,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,I read in this morning's newspaper that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) stated that his reason for turning down the farmers of Australia by not supporting the amendment moved yesterday in regard to the Wheat Pool was that his party had promised immunity to the Government until the return of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). I ask the Acting Prime Minister,23
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL, It is not in order to found any question upon a vote of the House.,23
47,Mr MATHEWS,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"Well , I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether there is any compact between the Government and the Country party in regard to the business that should be placed before the House, and, if so, why was it made and when will it terminate?",23
48,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"I shall answer that question promptly and candidly. So far as I know much the same kind of undertaking was given by the Country party to the Government as was given on behalf of the Opposition by its Leader (Mr Tudor), but the difference is that, notwithstanding what the Leader of the Opposition said '",23
49,Mr GABB,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"We would "" boot"" you tomorrow.",23
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"Quite so, despite what the Leader of the Opposition said.  .this party made no compact with the Government, and the right honourable gentleman knows that. Sir JOSEPH. COOK - Honourable members opposite ask a question and then when I try to answer it they begin howling like dingoes. I ask them to kindly 'permit me to make a reply. I know that honourable members opposite do not like what I am saying.. I repeat, that tha same sort of assurances were given how. by both parties, but from one party three .motions of censure have .emanated within a week.",23
51,Mr BLAKEEEY,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,That is not true.,24
52,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"The honourable members of the other party have seen themselves that they ought not trailed in the politics of any other party. . I am only recording my impression what I observe in the House. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) may have another explanation, but I have given my answer to the question that asked. Several honourable members interjectcerned, ing,",24
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"I haye on several occasions previously and today 'asked honourable members frain from interjecting when Ministers are replying to questions. A question was asked of the Acting.

67,Mr CONSIDINE,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"Before the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) l e ft for London, I drew his attention to a statement made by the Russian Trade Representative, to the effect that Russia was willing to take the whole of the output of Australian lead, zinc, and other metals, and to pay cash. In view of the Prime Minister's reply on that occasion, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) whether he has received any intimation since the Prime Minister arrived in London with regard to any transactions or negotiations connected with the sale of Australian metals.",25
68,Sir JOSEPH COOK,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,^I have had no communication of any .kind on the subject. EMPLOYMENT OF . ALIEN LABOUR.,25
69,Mr BLAKELEY,NEW HEBRIDES MAIL,"I desire to know from the Minister for - Home and Territories whether, while he was in Papua, any representations were made to him with regard to the introduction of alien labour into the Territory, and, further, whether representations were made to him in favour of the issue of regulations which would make more readily available to planters the native labour now there.  deputation requested that certain Asiatic labour should be brought in for expert purposes, but neither at that deputation nor any other was any proposal made' for any regulations, to assist in the provision of native labour. On the contrary, nine-tenths of the men, I met in connection with the plantation business were quite satisfied with the conditions. They _ can obtain quite the number of men they require, .and oj£ some of the biggest plantations those concerned have been able to do away with recruiting. Generally speaking, there is no 'complaint about the conditions of labour. NEW GUINEA. MANDATE ADMINISTRATION .

The honourable member said, "" Last year some 40,000 yards of tweed were supplied from the mills,"" and I wish to correct the erroneous impression which this statement is likely to make. Up to the 30th June, 1921, the mills supplied tweed to the Keturned Soldiers League at the rate of 40,000 yards per month. As from the 1st July last, the quantity which the mill has undertaken to supply is 14i.000 yards per month. It is hoped that it will be found practicable to issue from 15,000 to 20,000 yards per month, but the Department accepts noobligation beyond 14,000 yards por month. NA BANE:.",27

I communicated with the Governor of the Bank, who has now furnished the following reply:I would point out that moneys on deposit with the Savings Bank are withdrawable at call, and cannot, therefore, earn the same rate of interest as mone}'a which are placed in a definite loan for a fixed period. Furthermore, the Savings Bank depositors are quite satisfied with the rate of interest allowed, so long as they have the facility to withdraw the money on demand. This is evidenced by the continued increase in Savings Bank depositors' balances at this Bank. NA MILLS. SOUTH AUSTRALIA.",27

85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT IMMUNITY FROM,"F r a n k l in) [3.17]. - I do not intend to deal today with the administration of the War Service Homes Department. It would be ridiculous for the Committee to attempt on the eve of an adjournment of the House for some weeks to deal 'with what is, perhaps, the biggest question before the people of Australiaat the present time. The state-. ment made yesterday by the Minister (Mr Rodgers) showed careful preparation, and it would be quite impossible at this stage to analyze the - figures submitted by him to the Committee. Speaking entirely for myself, I prefer to discuss the administration of the War Service Homes Department after the period of immunity from attack granted by the Country party - to the Government has passed, so that we shall be free to deal with it on its merits.",28
86,Mr RODGERS,MENT IMMUNITY FROM,"So far as the administration of the War Service Homes Department is concerned, I personally claim no immunity, and have not asked for it .",28
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MENT IMMUNITY FROM,"That is so; but the honourable gentleman is aware that the Country party, rightly or wrongly, agreed to grant the Government i m PAPER. munity from attack for a certain period-. I intend to honour that agreement in letter and in spirit. In a political experience extending over nearly a quarter of a century, this is the first time that I have granted immunity to a Government, and it will be the last. It was the promise of immunity given by this party NA that tied our hands last night. I do not OF think any honourable member will accuse me of lack of fairness and candour, and I say, therefore, that the amendment CABLEGRAM amounted to the moving of a vote of want of confidence in the Government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will himself admit that when a proviso is sought to be added to a Supply mor tion, agaiust the will of the Governmenb, it must be accepted as a challenge.",28
88,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"If I admit so much, will the honourable member admit that the subject-matter of the amendment was. "" sound ?",28
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POLITICAL,"I am content to place my position fairly before"" the House. If mistakes are made, we must stand by them, but, having consented to the Prime Minister going to England to represent Australia, it would be blackfellow's politics to tomahawk him. cannot be accused of undue sympathy with or liking for the right honourable gentleman, but, having agreed tp the giving of this pledge, I am bound to keep it. I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to a matter which has interested me for a considerable time - the scandal of permitting the firm of Henry Jones and Company to be the agents at Hobart of the Commonwealth - Line of Steamers. It is the policy of the Government to which effect has been' given everywhere else that no agent for the Conference lines of steamers should be an agent for the Commonwealth Line. Por years past the firm I have mentioned has practically monopolized the shipping space on the steamers carrying f r u it from Tasmania to England, and recently the manager of a co-operative company that has been started complained that Sir Henry Jones, the largest shipper of f r u it from Tasmania, was Chairman of the Overseas Shipping Committee, which regulated space during the war, and is also agent for the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. If one is not satisfied with the results of an interview with him as the Chairman of the Overseas Committee, he is referred to the agent for the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and meets the same man again. This has placed a terrible shackle on the co-operative company, which, notwithstanding, has succeeded so far. I recognise the assistance which the Treasurer has given to the enterprise. The monopolists had reduced the price of small f r u it below what it cost for picking, when the co-operative company offered 3d. per l b . , which was more than twice as much as had been previously offered, and saved the industry. Now, after five months, the cooperative company is in the proud position of being able to repay the Treasurer the assistance that he so generously advanced to it . I do not ask that ' the agency of the Commonwealth - Lino of steamers be given to any other individual, firm, or co-operative society; but I ask that it be placed in the hands of the Tasmanian Government, which has a line of steamers of its own. If this be done, all shipperswill be treated alike. This is a matter of great importance to men who have only their orchards to rely on for their living. The attempt to break down [419]- 2 the monopoly which has existed is, I am I glad to say, succeeding to some extent, and it is not too much to ask the Government to remove a serious obstacle to its further advance. We merely ask that 'those who put their produce into this co-operative concern shall not have to go cap in hand to a rival exporter to obtain space for the f r u it which they wish to ship to England. The Sea Carriage of Goods Committee inquired into this matter. It was composed of four Nationalists, two members of the Labour party, and myself, and, though it differed on many points, it unanimously recommended thab the agency of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers in Hobart should be transferred to the Tasmanian Government.",28
90,Mr GABB,POLITICAL,"As all the Tasmanian representatives support the Government, they should be able to bring pressure to bear on it .",29
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POLITICAL,"I think that all that is needed is just a plain, straightforward statement of the case. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to attend to this matter at once. The manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers gave the Committee to understand that he was strongly in favour of what I suggest being done, and he told me that it would be done before the f r u it season commenced. That f r u it season has now passed, and another is _ about to commence. It is not right that the chief exporter of f r u it from Tasmania should be able to say what space other exporters may use. Every grower, every dealer, and every exporter should start from scratch, and be treated alike in the matter of space. There is always a shortage of space, and last year we were not able to secure space for more than one-third of the f r u it that we could have exported. This leads to all sorts of fraudulent arrangements. A man who wishes to export 1,000 cases will get the t'p that he will be allotted only one-third of the space for which he asks, and that, therefore, he should apply for space for 3,000 cases. The Minister for the Navy (Mr Laird Smith) knows all about these matters, and I am sure that in private conversation with the Acting Prime M in ister he will g've him more information on the subject, if he needs it . I wish to have the matter dealt with before tha negotiations connected with, the new season's operations commence. I was unwilling to move the adjournment of the House to have the subject discussed, and therefore I have taken this opportunity to deal with it. The present arrangement is a positive scandal, and the Government should appoint an independent agent. In ""my view, the recommendation of the Committee that the agency be transferred to the Tasmanian Government should be given effect.",29
92,Mr MARR,POLITICAL,"Parkes) [3.34] - There are one or two matters to which I desire to draw attention. Under the Navigation Act, which is to come into operation on the 1st October, every vessel carrying twelve or more passengers must he equipped with wireless, a necessary provision. But recently the owner of a private yacht, who desired to travel round the coast, wished to install wireless, in order that he might keep in touch with the land, and he was told that, if he did, it would be necessary for him to carry a first class wireless operator. My view is 'that if any one desires to install wireless on, a vessel carrying less than twelve passengers, or on a private yacht, no '.obstacle should he put in his way. I would like the Department concerned .to consider this matter. Recently the rates chargeable upon Inter-State telegrams were raised to a minimum of. Is. 4d. Confusion exists .today in respect of the supply of change . when payment is made for these messages. - Seeing that the public are charged Is. 4d. minimum for a telegram of sixteen words, .care is taken in almost every instance to send the whole of the sixteen words, in order to get full value for the money spent. If the charge for Inter-State messages were made Id. per word, the minimum being Is., there would be considerable saving in staff, at any rate. . A senior officer in the Postmaster-General's Department has informed me that he could handle the central ofiice traffic with half his present staff owing to the relief which would be afforded in giving change.",30
93,Mr WISE,POLITICAL,That is an extraordinary statement!,30
94,Mr MARR,POLITICAL,It is; but I believe that it could be borne out. I have personally - observed the conditions in the Sydney office. I have seen a customer hand over a florin in payment for a Is. 4d. message. The attendant has had to draw from three different portions of the till in order to get change. With that kind of thing repeated all day long and every day a vast amount of time is wasted.,30
95,Mr WISE,POLITICAL,"When an addition of 3d. was made on State telegrams a similar amount was added to Inter-State messages. In another place, however, an honourable senator suggested that if the minimum were made. Is. 4d. the public mind would be relieved of confusion, since it would be perceived that the rate was equivalent to Id. per word. As the proposal involved an increase of revenue the Government did not oppose it, and it was agreed to.",30
96,Mr MARR,POLITICAL,"I believe that considerable savings could be effected if a minimum of Is. were adopted, the rate being Id. per word. One successful innovation has been made in the Postmaster-General's Department which I would like to see extended. I refer to the installation of adding machines in receiving offices. These machines have relieved counter attendants from the old procedure of tearing off stamps and placing them on telegrams. However, more machines of the kind should be installed. Every telegram is now put into a machine, and the cost of the message stamped upon it, and the number of words added. Then it is sent up to the operating room for despatch. In that branch, at the Sydney General Post Office, there are ten clerks employed to do nothing but check the adding of the words- a work which could be done by the installation of one machine. While expense and much labour have been curtailed in the receiving offices, there are still those ten clerks in the operating-room. Even if the machine cost £400 it would more than pay for it self within six months. I desire to refer briefly to the duplication of work between the PostmasterGeheral's Department and the Department of Works and Railways. In the former there are as good engineers as in any branch of the Commonwealth Public Service. I know one man who has served the Department as an engineer for thirty-eight years. When a new regulation was issued that all works, even of the most minor character, must be done by the Department of Works and Bailways, the engineers of the Postmaster General's Department were "" hung up . "" They could not carry out their duties, because even such a triviality as repairs to a small machine had to be referred to the other Commonwealth Department. This reference would go back and from day to day, through devious departmental channels, until perhaps, at the end of two months, the job would be approved, whereas it could have been carried out for 10s. in one day. TheVe is room to cut down expenditure in regard to repairs and maintenance of plant, and even in the matter of installation of new plant. Thousands of pounds could be saved in the Postmaster-General's Department alone. could give a hundred instances in the Sydney General Post Office showing how and where money could be saved by a system of business management, and by the appointment of a competent engineer to continually supervise matters.",30
97,Mr BURCHELL,POLITICAL,Why not submit those ideas to the Postmaster-General ?,31
98,Mr MARR,POLITICAL,I have put the facts before predecessors of the present Minister until I have grown tired.,31
99,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"West Sydney) [3.40]' - I desire to say a few words arising from remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Mc Williams), this afternoon. The honourable member frankly admitted that, but for an arrangement which had been made by his party with the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), prior to the departure of the latter for London, he would have voted differently upon the amendment which 1 moved yesterday. That amendment, it will be recalled, had for its object the granting of assistance, by the Commonwealth Government in respect of the continuation of the Wheat Pool system, and it included the suggestion that the Government should enter into negotiations with the different States. It is a lamentable state of affairs that, because the Prime Minister happens to be away from Australia, the Government of which he is the head must be considered free to do exactly what they like without any fear of being turned out of office, or, indeed, of censure. I know of no similar circumstance in the history of Australia, or of any part of the Empire. It is, in my opinion, quite unconstitutional, and it is certainly contrary to the desires of the large majority of the people of Australia. A state of affairs whereby the Government may do as they like, or omit' to do what they like, u n t i l the re* turn of the Prime Minister, is one deserving of condemnation; and I trust that there will never be a repetition of it in this Parliament. Prior to the departure forth of the Prime Minister, a declaration was made in this chamber by the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), that he was not going to be bluffed, .JThe honourable member took a. stand which now turns out to have been make-believe. He was merely a lath painted to look like iron, The unpalatable truth is that the Primd Minister had a definite understanding with the Country party that that party I would do nothing in the nature of censuring his Government, or anything, indeed, which could possibly lead to their removal from office during his absence. The Leader of the Country party would have the people of the Commonwealth believe that he was not going to be bluffed by the Prime Minister; that he was not going to make any arrangement; and that, in fact, there was no arrangement. B ut honourable members have now heard a definite statement by a member of the Country p a r t y - I refer to the honourable member for Franklin-that , on account of an arrangement which was made with the Prime Minister, he cast his vote last night in a direction different from that which, otherwise, it would have taken. There can be no doubt now that an arrangement was made whereby, during the absence of the Prime Minister, nothing waste be done to interfere with the Government. No matter how deeply the welfare)of the people might be involved, the Government were to remain and retainoffice.",31
100,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,The honourable member for Cowper and the honourable member for Frankli n must both be right.,31
101,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"It may be in accordance with the practice of the Country party that, when the Government find themselves in danger, some members in the Corner are to vote one way and the remainder in the opposite direction. Something of that nature would appear to have been decided upon in order to insure that the Government should be in no danger.",31
102,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"All that is suggested, to my mind, is that the members of the Country party are not puppets, to be dragged about upon the honourable member's string whenever he may desire to pull it .",32
103,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"But that they are puppets who are to dance at the pulling of the strings by the Government. At all events, I do not want to drag any puppets about on my string. Honourable members have all been sent here to represent the people of their electorates, and 'they should be free to vote as they may see fit, and not be bound by some secret .pledge to wait for a matter of sis months, .or perhaps longer, pending the return of .the Prime Minister to his post in Australia. I desire to draw public attention to the existing state of affairs, which becomes the more reprehensible when one examines the nature of the Imperial Conference and the means by which it was .brought about. When honourable memJbers discussed this matter originally, the undoubted impression in their minds was - that the Imperial Government had, of their own volition, decided upon a Conference, and had cabled urging the attendance of Dominion representatives in - London. That impression was permitted to remain until the Prime Minister was making his final remarks in reply to a - certain amendment which I had moved. Then, on the eve of his departure, the ""House was informed that the Prime Minister of Australia was the individual who 'had asked for the Conference, that the British Government had not suggested it at all, but that the Commonwealth Prime .Minister had cabled London in October last urging that a Conference should be called since he considered that such a ^gathering was very necessary.",32
104,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,Does not the honourable member think the right honourable gentle.xnan should be given credit for his suggestion ?,32
105,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"I give the Prime Minister credit for doing things according to his own sweet will when they suit his own .sweet purposes. . The right honourable .^gentleman said, in this chamber, that he have done so. .had cabled thusIn my opinion it is absolutely essential that the Dominion Prime Ministers should meet London next year. Later, the Prime Minister informed the Housethat he had cabled to Mr Lloyd GeorgeI most earnestly recommend that you call a meeting of the Dominion Prime Ministers next year in London-say , about June. Delay for another year most dangerous. By his own admission, then, the Commonwealth Prime Minister was the instigator of the Imperial Conference. Honourable members now learn that he has used this gathering, which he himself instigated, in order to secure immunity for his Goverument while he was away. And honourable members in the Corner fell into his trap.",32
106,Sir ROBERT BEST,POLITICAL,That is very farfetched.,32
107,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,It is a plain and undeniable fact.,32
108,Sir ROBERT BEST,POLITICAL,Does not the honourable member think that the business to be brought before the Conference justified the action of the Prime Minister in the fullest degree?,32
109,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"The business which was to have been brought before the Conference has apparently been shelved, and the Conference is now doing nothing. Moreover, to make believe that something is being, and is to be, done, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has suggested that the Pacific Conference should be held in London, although public opinion is emphatically against him in that regard. Without doubt, the'Prime Minister asked that the Imperial Conference should be' convened, and then he manipulated one of the parties in this Parliament in order to secure immunity for his Government during his absence. Possibly the right honourable gentleman may be able to manipulate the Country party again so as to achieve further immunity. This observation reminds me of a cablegram read by the Acting Prime Minister in this House yesterday from the Prime Minister in London. And, by the way, although the Acting Prime Minister delivered himself of that message, he has not deigned to in- form honourable members whether it was in answer to a cablegram which he had sent to the Prime Minister.",32
110,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"On the contrary, I",32
111,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,Then the Acting Prime in Minister has refrained from giving honourable members any inkling of its contents.,32
112,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,I have not done so. o,33
113,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"Apparently , he does not intend to do so. I am informed-and my information comes from the London endthat the cable message of the Prime M in ister was sent in response to a very urgent appeal of the Acting Prime Minister, to the effect that it was immediately essent i a l , in order to allay public feeling in Australia, that the Prime Minister should 'send a statement of the nature which he did send, and that he should be careful not to mention that it was a reply to an urgent summons of the Acting Prime Minister in Melbourne.",33
114,Sir ROBERT BEST,POLITICAL,Does the honourable member mind producing that cabled in formation of his from London ?,33
115,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,I am prepared to lay it on the table simultaneously with the production of the cablegram sent by the Acting Prime Minister to the Prime Minister.,33
116,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,The member's statement is an absolute fabrication.,33
117,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"Produc e the cable and let us see what it is. The communication from the Acting Prime Minister to London is suppressed, but Parliament has been given the carefully-prepared reply by the Prime Minister. The other, we are told, must be kept dark; but the people of Australia will be able to guess fairly well what is in it . The cablegram from the Prime Minister is entirely out of accord with the speech made by him in this House before he l e ft for London. He said in his cablegram, in reply to the Acting Prime Minister's secret despatchI stated in most definite and unambiguous terms in Parliament that the Commonwealth would not be committed to any scheme of naval or foreign policy or involved in any expenditure by any act of mine, but that all (after explanation by me and full discussion by the Legislature) should be subject to the ratification of Parliament. Although we have not seen the Acting Prime Minister's cablegram to the Prime Minister containing the suggestions made from this end, we have the Prime Minister's speech in this House. He said in his cablegram that any scheme of naval or foreign policy, or any expenditure, will be subject to the ratification of this Parliament. Th s is what he said in Parlia,ment about the continuance of the AngloJapanese TreatyLong before the Australian people could approve .or disapprove, the Treaty will be renewed or else allowed to lapse. If our people do not approve, that will not alter matters by one-thour sandth part of an inch On my return from Britain if the Treaty, as drawn up and agreed to, is not satisfactory, this Parliament can say, ""We will .have none of it "" ; and we can renounce it. But the practical conse^ quences will remain, and Australia will have to face them. That is an entirely different statement from that in the cablegram to the effect that anything he does at the Conference will be subject to ratification by this Parliament.",33
118,Sir ROBERT,POLITICAL,"BEST - That is' as far as it may be applicable to Australia. That is , the usual practice.",33
119,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"That is not the usual practice. On the contrary, the Prime Minister of Canada has insisted at the Conference that a proviso should be in serted in the Treaty making it not binding upon Canada until the Dominion Par* liament approved of it . No such suggeshonorable tion has been made by the Prime Ministerof Australia. He says that the Treaty will be ratified or allowed to lapse long before we can say aye or nay, and if we say nay, it will not alter matters, onethousandth part of an inch. In another part of his cable,, the Prime MinistersaysThe official communique is the only information permitted except where Conference otherwise decides. Whenever it has so decided I have made public the very fullest information'. So that we may take it that all the infor-. mation we have received about his ""dominating the Conference emanates entirely fro m himself. A f t e r all, I suppose thab does not matter very much.",33
120,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,Where did the honourable member learn logic? Mr Ryan ; - I think I learned it in at least as good a school as that in which the Acting Prime Minister learned his..,33
121,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"I am glad I did not learn mine in the same school. Mr Ryan' - We have from the Prime Minister an admission that he made public the fullest information. He did not tell us anything about the attitude of the Prime Ministers of Canada and South> Africa, or give us any general information that would allow us to arrive at an exact conclusion as to what was taking place; but, after the debate in this House last week, the following resume, which I am quite sure did not come - from the. Prime Minister, was published in the daily press of Australia on last:IMPERIAL CONFERENCE. REVIEW OF ITS WOKK. The Australian Press Association is authoritatively assured that, when reviewing the Conference dispassionately in retrospect, one realizes that it undesignedly but inevitably fell into three divisions. They were never hostile, but were mutually helpful, even when apparently antagonistic. The first division included the British Ministers, who adopted a receptive rather than a prescriptive attitude. They were anxious to learn the views of the Dominions rather than to impose their own. Nevertheless they were insistent on requiring the renewal of the Treaty, and persistent in representing their ability any"" longer to bear the whole burden of the defence of the Empire, in which all the Dominions must share in the future. The second division was comprised of Mr. Meighen and General Smuts. The former differed from tlio British Ministers regarding both the Treaty and defence, hut was predisposed to support the Treaty. In the third division were Mr Hughes and Mr Massey. The former approved of the Treaty provided it was rendered inoffensive to the United States. Mr Massey whole-heartedly supported the renewal. Both Mr Hughes and Mr Massey regarded naval defence as a matter of life and death to Australia and New Zealand. . Mr Meighen's reasons for opposing a renewal of the Japanese Treaty were threefold. First, the conditions which necessitated the Treaty in 1911 did not now exist. Second, the renewal would be regarded with disfavour by the United States. Third, the formation of sueh alliances was antagonistic to the spirit of post-war times. v Failing to secure a denunciation, ' Mr. Meighen would propose an insertion of the clause exempting Canada until the Dominion Parliament approved. . General Smuts concurred in the principles of Mr Meighen's arguments, but if assured it was Imperially necessary he would support a renewal of the Treaty. - Mr Meighen also opposed the Conference dealing with Naval Defence, and pointed out that the Canadian Government and Parliament refused to deal with Admiral Jellicoe's report two sessions ago, because naval defence involved questions of foreign policy and constitutional control affecting Admiralty authority on the one hand and Dominion authority on the other. . He advocated that they should suspend action until the Conference decided to precise mechanism, under which the Dominions could give effect to their views on foreign affairs. General Smuts arrived at a similar conclusion by'a different line of reasoning, and emphatically opposed any new defence commitments as a contravention of the spirit of the League of Nations.

122,Sir ROBERT BEST,POLITICAL,"The honourable London, Friday. member does not suggest that that communication is official?",34
123,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"I suggest that it is an accurate summary of the attitude taken up by the respective groups. I know, from my own experience of the Prime' Minister, and from having heard his views often expressed in this House, that the statement is accurate in regard to him, and. I have no reason to doubtand I am sure no one else has-that it in- is accurate with respect to the views of Downing-street and the PrimeMinisters of Canada and South Africa. It is quite clear to me that the Prime Ministers of Canada and. South Africa were entirely in. favour of the Disarmament Conference that is proposed to be held in Washington; and, in regard to defence, General Smuts said that he was emphatically opposed to any new defence commitments, because they would be a contravention of the spirit of the League of Nations. .His attitude is diametrically opposed to the attitude"" of the Prime Minister of Ausr tralia. Fortunately, the decision does not rest with the Prime Minister of Australia; but the only conclusion to which we can come after reading that summary is-and it is a corroboration of a view I have held for some time-that the Prime Minister and his Government are really echoes of Downing-street. They advocate whatever Downing-street wants.",34
124,Mr MCGRATH,POLITICAL,They showed that in regard to conscription.,34
125,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"Exactly ; and on reading that newspaper summary one finds the Prime Minister advocating just what the British Government want, quite irrespective of the requirements of Australia. He is continuing to carry out his policy of subordinating the interests of this country to those of the Imperial Government.",34
126,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,In what way do they differ?,34
127,Mr RYAN,POLITICAL,"Downing-stree t and the Australian Prime Minister do not differ. Downing-street wants a certain thing, and the Prime Minister of Australia advocates it. He suggested the Conference which, will bring about what Downingis street - wants, and he holds up the busiof ness of this country while he goes England to carry out that policy.",34

However, I am not to be drawn off my arguments; the matter is too important to the people of this try. The fact remains that our business is held up.

In all his diatribe the honourable member's one substantial charge is that the Prime Minister is working in harmony with Downing-street officials. What a crime, in an Empire like ours!

I wish to emphasize the fact that the one comnlaint that the honourable member has against the Prime Minister ie that he dares to agree with Downing-street. Thwe I shall leave the matter.",36
155,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,"Darling) [4.15] - There is an understanding that the debate on Supply shall close ab 5 o'clock, and, therefore, honourable members must curtail their remarks. I shall not refer now to the War Service Homes administration, because I hope to have an opportunity to do that later in the evening. At present, I desire only-to call attention to the great necessity for postal and telephone facilities in the outlying portions of the Commonwealth. It will be remembered that last year the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) gave an assurance that, so far as post-offices were concerned, there would be no reduction of the Estimates. That assurance was appreciated and approved by honourable members on both sides of the House. I fully, realise the necessity for a close scrutiny of the Estimates of every Department, and the Treasurer has told us that it will be necessary to use the pruning knife. I hope, however, that the policy announced last year with regard to post-offices will be carried out, despite the fact that the pruning knife may be necessary in regard to public expenditure generally. The Post Office provides facilities that are absolutely necessary, especially in the outlying districts. I commend the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) for his administration in the past; he has done work that has been commended by honourable members and the country generally, and there is very little to complain of. Now that we are assured that telephone material is coming to hand, we may look for some extension of lines. But the main point I wish to emphasize is that a one day-a-week mail is of very little use in the country districts far removed from towns and the more populous centres. The business done at the existing post offices in these districts affords a very poor indication of the correspondence received and despatched. In districts which I know, where there is a one-day-a-week mail service, the people are compelled to use other means of transport for their letters, only a small percentage of which pass through the post-offices. I have pointed out to the people concerned, that if they supply their own facilities they will not get the improved facilities they deserve, but they find the one-day-a-week mail absolutely insufficient, and have to use traders' carts and any other means . available for transit. Help in this direction is given by the traders and business people from neighbouring towns; and my contention is that, if any place warrants the post-office, there should be.at least a tri-weekly mail. We may assume, I think, that with telephone material available many proposed iines that have been held up will now be constructed. H> should be realized that when a telephone line is carried into an outlying district^ it does not benefit only the peoplo-H-vmg in the immediate neighbourhood. There is no doubt that these pioneers in the back country are doing, perhaps, a greater service to the Commonwealth than any done by Tiny other section of the community, and they deserve every consideration that can be extended to them. But, as I say, it must not be concluded that they, and' they only, benefit by. the telephone extension ; every business man in the neighbouring towns, every one, indeed, connected with the telephone, benefits equally.. We should remember that it is not only the individual but the general community that benefits by the granting of improvedi telephone and telegraph facilities. Again, with regard to telephone services in the. outlying districts, I would urge the necessity of extending the hours so that town, residents may be able to communicate' by telephone with farming districts be-tween 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. I brought, this matter before the Postmaster-General some months ago, and the reply that he gave me was that the business transacted in the district offices to which I specifically referred would not warrant the suggested extension. I pointed out then, and I repeat the statement now, that between 6 and 8 o'clock every evening there would be more telephone business than at any other time of the day. Farmers and other people in country districts work long hours. Many of them are out in the fields during the day, but in the evening town residents would be sure of getting into communication with them. The extension of hours for which I ask would be a boon to country districts, and the additional business would be much greater than the Postal authorities anticipate.",36
156,Mr WISE,POLITICAL,"I am having that matter very fully inquired into all over Australia. My own experience impresses me with the force of the honourable member's, contention.",37
157,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,"I am pleased with the honourable gentleman's assurance. I desire now to draw his attention to what is being done in the small town of Somerset, on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It has been arranged that the postmistress^ there shall be on duty for exchange work between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., but while private subscribers may thus get into telephone communication with other towns during those hours, the post-office is not open for the transaction of general business. The postmistress receives £6 per annum, or, approximately, Sid. per hour, for working these two additional hours per day. In all probability the business transacted would not warrant the Department paying what might"" be considered an adequate payment for the work performed, but where officials are called upon to be in attendance during extra hours, they should receive a reasonable reward. If the post-office at Somerset were open for the transaction of general business during these hours, the additional revenue that would be forthcoming would enable the Department to pay this lady a considerable increase. I ask the Postmaster-General to consider the wisdom of allowing general' postal and telegraphic business to be transacted during the extra hours in respect of which postal officials have to be in attendance for telephone purposes. I regret that I have to bring, forward at this stage what are relatively minor matters, but they are of considerable importance to the people of my constituency. I also draw attention to the overloading of the main trunk telephone line between Burnie and Launceston. We have recently had the assurance that other main trunk telephone lines within the Commonwealth are to be duplicated. The necessary material is now at hand, and I would Strongly urge the Postmaster General to duplicate the line between Burnie and Launceston, since, under present conditions, people have to wait sometimes - from three hours to six hours in order to make a call. I trust that the Treasurer will not feel called upon to curtail the estimates of the Postmaster General's Department. To whatever extent he may find it necessary to use the pruning knife on the estimates of other Departments, I hope he will not cut down the vote for the Postal Department, since it provides one of the most important services of the Commonwealth. Improvements in means of communication and transit are of the utmost importance if we are to develop this Commonwealth and give those who live out-back the facilities to which they are entitled. Mr Bel/'. 'Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [4.28] I draw the attention of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to the doings of an unmitigated scoundrel who is preying upon old-age pensioners. I refer to the notorious criminal Paddy Hill, who organized a conspiracy to which the Reverend J. B. Ronald fell a victim. The Reverend Mr Ronald secured for this scoundrel a pension. In return, the man organized a conspiracy - against him in the Harper case, and for y engaging in that conspiracy or committing' perjury, all the witnesses in the case with two exceptions had to "" serve time."". Paddy Hill ako had to "" serve time."" I find that this unmitigated scoundrel is preying upon old-age pensioners, and,I hope that action will be taken to punish this man. An old lady while going to Mass at 6 o'clock one morning was stopped by Hill . She says that he was very courteous and was well-dressedconfidence men generally are. He told her in the course of conversation that he' was in great difficulties, and that if he could only obtain a loan of £30 he would, be able to buy bags for his wheat in the Mallee. Later on he called upon this poor old soul, Avho had a few pounds in the bank which she had put by to meet her funeral expenses. He induced her to lend him £30, for which he gave her a promissory note, which was payable in April last. She still holds the note, but has been unable to obtain payment. She has called many times at Paddy Hill's house, but has not been able to see him.. When she goes to his house she is always interviewed by a Cerberus at the door, a man named Ryan. She has also written to Hill's son, but without success. This man Paddy Hill is still drawing a pension, and if we cannot take it away from such a scoundrel it is time that we amended the Act so as to prevent such a parasite from receiving that help. He is a disgrace to the religion he professes. When I get the pro-, missory. note I shall hand it to the Treasurer, wbo, I hope, will get into touch .with the Crown Law authorities, and see that this criminal is punished. I hear from the keeper of a fruit shop that many old-age pensioners complain that. this man is a parasite battening upon the old and the helpless. I am glad that the Deputy Speaker is present, because I desire now to refer to the case of a lift attendant named Denholm, who until recently was employed in this building. Denholm was a temporary employee here for ten years, but by some misapplication of justice his appointment was not made permanent. It is difficult to understand why he was not permanently appointed to the Service. We all found him active, earnest, intelligent, and polite. Some time ago, during the pneumonic influenza scare, he was ordered to be inoculated. He at first, under advice, refused, but Dr Stephens, who examined him and for whom I have great respect, told him that he need not fear any ill result. He then submitted to inoculation. The serum had a bad effect upon him , however, and Dr Stephens refrained from ino.culating him a second time. He has never properly recovered the use of the arm in which the serum was injected, with the result that since his unjust dismissal from the service of the Joint House Committee, he has not been able to obtain a position.",37
158,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"We ought to stand by that lad, and put him in some other position if the authorities will not restore him to his old job.",39
159,Dr MALONEY,POLITICAL,"Yes . The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley), in words worthy of Shakespeare, put his case in a nut-shell when he said, "" This young man has been unjustly dismissed, and justice shrieks to the skies."" Questions were addressed to the Deputy Speaker (Mr Chanter) on the subject, and later on the honourable gentleman read a statment supplied to him by the President of the Senate (Senator Givens) setting out that Denholm's services were terminated in accordance witl i the requirements of the Public Service Act, to which the attention of the head of the Joint House Committee had been called by the Auditor-General. Mr Israel, the Auditor-General, in the course of sworn evidence given before the Select Committee of the Senate, has denied that statement. The honourable member for Kooyong, who, like the rest of ns, has taken an interest in this case, sent . to Denholm a statement obtained, I think, by Mr Deputy Speaker from Senator Givens, to the effect that Mr Israel had refused to sanction the payment of any' further funds to that lad. The Auditor General, on oath, says that he did not refuse to sanction these payments, and that there was no foundation for the statement. ""*""""",39
160,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,It is a scandal.,39
161,Dr MALONEY,POLITICAL,"This young man's mother, for whom I have a great regard, has written to me about the case. Sena-, tor Givens said that she had written to . him in terms derogatory to her son, and it is about that that she writes to me, her letter being dated l l t h July, 1921 Excuse the liberty I am taking in writingto you, but having read your speech in Han- sard in reference to my son, I thought it my duty to write thanking you for the splendid stand you have taken in the matter. The injury to my son's arm was no doubt the result of the inocufation. Before he was compelled to be inoculated his arm was quite all ' right. That cannot be denied. A warning was given before the operation took place, and Dr Stephens, for whom I have great respect, would not repeat the inoculation. Serum treatment is in its experimental stage at present, and medicine has been defined as the science of experiments punctuated by death-. That was said by one of the greatest professors who has occupied the chair in the University of Edinburgh. To continueAs regards the letter that Senator. Givens said was received from me complaining about my son, I have never at any time in my life written a letter to Senator Givens or any one else at Parliament House complaining about my son. The statement is false, and in fairness to me should be withdrawn. Hy son, who bas been in the employ of the Federal Parliament for the best ten years of his life, is now being dismissed. He' has -' a maimed arm, the result of being inoculated. I would be very grateful to you if you would demand an inquiry, as Senator Givens has made a false charge against me, and goodness ' knows what he has said about my son. - Thanking you for past favours, and hoping ; an inquiry will be held.

162,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,"Darling ) [4.40] What I shall say will be brief, because of ' an arrangement to close the debate, arid' 1 I understand that the honourable member  to speak. Much has been said by honorat able members, and by legions of cranks outside, of the-need for economy. Some persons affect to think that the country can be saved only by reducing the salaries of members of Parliament, and a fairly large number, 'including not a few Government supporters, say that its salvation lies in increasing the hours of work and £250,000. reducing the wages of the people. There is, however, need for the close supervision of the publio expenditure, and I have risen to draw attention to what I consider a scandalous waste of money. I recently asked for information about the Royal Naval College at Jervis Bay and the Military College at Duntroon, and the replies indicate an astounding f u l state of affairs. I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence for a return of the Instructional Staff and others employed in and about Duntroon, tion and the number of students there, and I was informed that the In - officers structional Staff and others number 170' persons, and that the students number eighty-one. Much can be said for the training of young officers in this try, so that we may have skilled leaders in case of war; but an establishment which requires a staff quite twice as numerous as the body of students is an absurdity.",39
163,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,There are others beside the Instructional Staff.,40
164,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,"Yes ; the cooks, seroccupy vants, and so on, who are considered necessary in the estimation of the responber sible officials and of the Ministers supply the cash.

In 1918-19 troon Military College cost £52,902, in the next year £54,637, and in the next year £54,045, or over £161,000 in three years. For the Naval College at Jervis Bay, I do not know that I have received a complete return of the staff.",40
165,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POLITICAL,My instruction that the honourable member was to be given all the information that he asked for.,40
166,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,"Apparently , only the Instructional Staff is included in the reply to my question. I expect that (he same style and the same huge staff kept at Jervis Bay as I have found exist at Duntroon. The cost of the lishment, indeed, seems to show that the staff at Jervis Bay may be greater than that at Duntroon. The-Instructional Staff the Naval College numbers thirty-three persons, and the students eighty-five, and the cost of educating these students was £69,518 in 1918-19, £71,850 in the following year, and £87.954 in the next year, so that these students cost about £1,000 a year each to educate, and the College during three years has cost nearly",40
167,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POLITICAL,Does the honourable member suggest the closing of it?,40
168,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,No ; but the Government should take cognisance of the facts to which I have drawn attention. I ask the Minister if he does not consider the cost of this establishment a scandal ?,40
169,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POLITICAL,Do you suggest a and disgracereduction in salaries?,40
170,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,"No ; but common sense should be applied to the administraof these colleges, and if it is not possible to educate our naval and military for less than it costs to maintain these institutions, Ministers should consider whether a scheme could not be devised for training the lads at other educacountional establishments. The Government will stand condemned if the present excess sive expenditure continues. The training of fewer than 200 lads has cost nearly £400,000 during the past three years.",40
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POLITICAL,"Denison-Minister for the Navy) [4.501- I shall not more than a few minutes in replying to the speech of the honourable memfor Darling (Mr Blakeley), because who I do not wish to prevent the honourable  who is entitled to the call, from the Dunaddressing the Committee. The funds available for carrying on the Navy Department have been very limited. Consequently, ever since I have been given control of the Department, it has been my task to look around to see if I could not effect some savings. I made a perwas sonal survey and investigation of the whole of the affairs of my Department last year, in the course of which I visited the Naval College. I court the fullest inquiry now and at any time. I went to Jervis"" Bay prejudiced; to some degree^ against the College, and having the feelis ing that a considerable saving might be to made by closing it down. I desire to estabknow now whether honourable members wish that to be brought about, because it is still my task to retrench, and to keep 1 within the means which have been made available. I think economy of this nature would be an extreme measure - At that institution I saw sufficient to lead me to regard it as one of the finest teaching establishments in the Commonwealth. Not only does its staff build up young men superbly equipped for servioe in the Navy, but so fitted that, generally, if they should see fit to retire, they could take their places as able and gifted citizens of the Commonwealth. I challenge the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) to say - whether there is a teacher upon the in structional staff who receives a penny mere than he should be getting. readily cut down salaries if it could be shown that there is too heavy an expenditure in that direction. however, that the Commonwealth is securing full value for the money, spent. I invite honourable members to read the reports of the institution. They will be impressed with the fact that a splendid return is being afforded the country in the shape of young men equipped to hold their own with any naval graduates from any. part of the world. They can be favourably compared with the graduates of similar institutions both in Great Britain and the United States of America, where the training costs as much, if not more. In his scheme of economy, the honourable member for Darling would reduce the institution at Jervis Bay to something which would be of no earthly use. undertake to run it more cheaply, but not at the same time insuring that it would turn out graduates of the character of those hitherto trained there. emphasize that there is no waste going on.",40
172,Mr BLAKELEY,POLITICAL,I cannot accept the Minister's assurance.,41
173,Mr LAIRD SMITH,POLITICAL,"Does the honourable member suggest that the staff should not be paid a basic wage, that they should not be treated as city workers expect to be treated ? His remarks in criticism of the Naval College are unjust, and by no means creditable to a New South Wales representative in this Parliament.  [4.531 - I desire to refer to only one matter, but it is one of vital importance to very many people. My remarks shall be concentrated upon the crisis between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth authorities owing to the failure of the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) to live up to his promise to pay New South Wales £3,500,000 for the purpose of soldier settlement. I have endeavoured to probe this qUarrel between the Commonwealth and the Mother. State, and, to me, the whole business savours, of confidence trickery.",41
174,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"The honourable member would .naturally say that, since he has investigated only one side of the story.  that I have gone into the whole business, and have carefully read the utterances I would both of the Federal and State Ministers. The facts are such that it is due to the Acting Prime Minister to furnish a full I claim, statement.",41
175,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,You will not get it .  Acting Prime Minister had a good case he would not hesitate to make it known.,41
176,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"I have made the facts public quite a number of times.  Federal case must be a very bad one. The Acting Prime Minister has not replied to the New South Wales Treasurer (Mr . Lang), and the situation is serious for two sets of people, the one being those who have sold land to the New South Wales Government, and cannot get their money, and the other being those returned men who are waiting for land. The Ne I could South Wales Treasurer has made publio his case through the medium of the Svdney press, and neither the Acting Prime Minister nor the Minister for Repatriation I (Senator E . D . Millen'), nor the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) has furnished an answer. At the Premiers' Conference in July last year, the Acting Prime Minister, when giving a resumS of the proceedings to the Melbourne press, announced the result of his negotiations with the Ne South Wales Treasurer in the following terms: We will give New Soutb Wales - the full £3,500,000 which it says.will be necessiry for the purpose of settling the 8,405 soldiers.",41
177,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"And how m.any soldiers has New South Wales settled ?  number does not affect my argument. The New South Wales Treasurer has given a complete answer. The Acting Prime M in ister said further, when Mr Storey, the Premier of New South. Wales, had acknowledged the promised assistanceWe cannot let you down, because we have been privy to the arrangements, but they .ought to be, and' must be, tightened up a little in the future. And, at the same time, the Acting Prinie Minister condemned the late Nationalist Government of New South Wales for. their actions. That condemnation, however, does not concern'me at the moment:",41

On the 13th of this month a long statement was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph from Mr Lang, in which the State Treasurer said that the Commonwealth Treasurer and Assistant Minister for Repatriation had complained that the New South Wales authorities had not tendered certified accounts of the money spent. That is the crux of the whole trouble. The obligation of making payment is not denied by the Federal authorities. solemn contract was entered into, but the only reason which has been given for non-payment is that the State has not rendered certified accounts for the money said to be due. If those were the facts, the Commonwealth authorities would be standing on solid ground; but the New South Wales Treasurer gave the Sydney press specific sums, and mentioned the dates on which the accounts had been certified, and sent on to the Commonwealth. Mr Lang saidThe list of certified accounts of expenditure forwarded by us to the Commonwealth Government, but for which we have not been recouped, is as foliows :Then he gave full particulars of more than a dozen items, of which I shall quote only the first to indicate how complete was his case. It is this : "" £6,630 Os. 6d., forwarded to Commonwealth Government, 19th January, 1921."" Notwithstanding these specific details, the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers), in his last statement forwarded to the New.South Wales Treasurer, intimated that those accounts had not come to hand.",42
179,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"As a matter fact, New South Wales has an advance now of about £270,000, in respect of which the State Treasurer has not ye.t sent us a certified account.  to understand that the Federal Government have paid only £270,000, and that there still remains nearly £3,250,000 unpaid ? ",42
180,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"Ne w South Wales had £4,250,000 last year.  a different matter altogether.",42
181,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"And New South Waleswill get all I can spare it this year.  may not amount to much. The Federal authorities should keep their word in respect of the £3,500,000. The Acting Prime Minister said that, when the State accounts were forwarded, New South Wales would be recouped. They have been forwarded, but the Acting Prime Minister has not kept his word.",42
182,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"How could New South Wales send in certified accounts in respect of the settlement of more than 8,000 men, when less than 6,000 have been settled so far t  Federal authorities should pay the acA counts for the expenditure incurred.",42
183,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"I know Mr Lang better than the honourable member does.  ing Prime Minister's trouble with Mr . Lang is that he cannot answer his arguments. I can only say that if a transaction of this character were carried out in private life it would be stigmatized as a> confidence trick. If the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to look upon a solemn contract as a scrap of paper, he must not mind some candid criticism.",42
184,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,Who is to have the last word upon this matter?  State' Treasurer.,42
185,Mr WATT,POLITICAL,"No ; the man who has the last word is the man who has the money.  Acting Prime Minister had a good answer he would make it the last word. But, since he has not replied, I take it that the case of New South Wales cannot be answered. When the Acting Prime Minister has a good case he always makes the most of it . of Mr Watt - And , even when he has not, he does so.  true, too; but when his case is very bad he says nothing, as in this matter. Hereare the terms of the challenge thrown down by the New South Wales Treasurer, but which has not been accepted:The fact is that, instead of keeping the tract under which this State was to be couped from time to time, the expenditure paid out of the advances, the Commonwealth Uovernment retained duly certified statements of account totalling £1,004,557 in part ment of the advances made. A detailed list giving the dates and amounts of these certified statements has already been published in the Daily Telegraph, and I challenge M Kodgers to state whether or not it is a that the Commonwealth ba3 received these statements. I emphatically state that the cedure adopted by the Commonwealth is in accordance with the arrangements entered into. The action of the Commonwealth vernment in not recouping the £1,004,557, as per certified statement rendered to 30th June last, left me without a working advance to finance the expenditure, and necessitated the provision of £248,125 out of State funds, not covered by any Commonwealth advance. The State Treasurer has challenged the Assistant Minister for Eepatriation to disprove his statement.",42
186,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,"Does the State Treasurer want the money before or after he has expended it ?  Lang has stated clearly that certified accounts have been submitted. The Assistant Minister for Eepatriation says that when they are submitted they will be paid, but that they have not yet been submitted.",43
187,Mr WATT,POLITICAL,"If they are certified accounts, the money must have been spent.  the Commonwealth Government have broken their solemn compact, and it is due to the soldiers that a statement should be made by the Commonwealth Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) or by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation. In the meantime,' it is the duty of this Committee t'o have the matter ventilated.",43
188,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"The State Treasurer does not want a statement, but money.  what is the right honourable gentleman's answer to his request?",43
189,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"I shall give him all the money I can afford to give him.  Treasurer should give Mr Lang all the money that is due to him. The Acting Prime-Minister admits the debt, but says he will pay, not what he promised, but what he can afford.",43
190,Mr WATT,POLITICAL,"The Acting Prime Minconister said this afternoon that some conreditions were attached to the promise.  State Treasurer said that the money was adjustpromised unconditionally. The Assistant Minister for Repatriation does not deny that the money should be paid, but says r . that the certified accounts have not been. fact submitted. I repeat that Mr Lang says prothey have been submitted. It is clear thatnot the Commonwealth Treasurer has a tighthold on the purse strings, and is not preCiopared to do his part of the agreement.",43
191,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"Ver y tight! The State Governments received only about £15,250,000 for land settlement last year.  does not matter. A compact is a compact, the world over, and should not be treated as a ""scrap of paper,"" as the right honourable gentleman is doing. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended and resolution adopted. Resolution of Ways and Means founded on resolution of Supply reported and adopted. Ordered That Sir Joseph Cook and Mr Laird Smith do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Sir JOSEPH COOK and passed through all stages without amendment or debate. WAR SERVICE HMS. Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That the statement made yesterday by the Assistant Minister for Eepatriation (Mr . Bodger3) upon the subject of War Service Home3 be printed.",43
192,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Hunter) [5.15] In speaking on this subject last night I exhausted my time before I was able to complete my remarks. I dealt with the building areas acquired by thf; Commission at King's-road and Waratah, and I propose today to refer to what has been done by the Department at Cessnock. In that district a large number of houses have been built by the Commission, and a couple by the Commonwealth Bank, and they are very unsatisfactory. The Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) stated last night that if the applicants, for homes at Cessnock were dissatisfied they would be permitted to apply for other homes, and their applications would be granted. That, on the face of it, appears a fair proposal, but 1 doubt whether it will be satisfactory, because if new homes are built for these people in some other part of the district, the Commission will have to dispose of the homes which have been already, built, and it is possible that, cause of their inferior character, purchasers will acquire' them at less than the cost of construction. A better procedure would have been to adopt the recommendation by the Public Accounts Committee. We recommended that the soldiers should be given the privilege of requesting the Government to revalue their Cessnock properties. Some competent person or persons should be pointed to carry out the valuations, : and if it was found that a house, because of inferior workmanship or the use of \inferior material, was defective, then, whatever value was placed on the house - by the officers the soldiers should pay, and nothing more. To me that appears a fair proposition, especially in view of the fact that most of the soldiers and their families have been for some considerable time occupying the homes. When a man and his family have moved into a house with their furniture and effects, and thereby incurred considerable expense, it does not seem to me quite just that, because of some defect, he should be told he may apply for another house and move into it. A removal of this kind means anything from £10 to £20 expenditure on labour, fitting cloth coverings, and so forth. In such cases, the householder should have the right to a re-valuation; and, if it be shown that the house which cost £700 is worth only £600, the householder should get it at the latter price, and the difference be borne Iby the Government. If the Government are responsible for defective work, I should say .they, and not the soldier, ought to bear any additional cost; and I ask the Minister to look into the matter.",43
193,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,The soldier may not be altogether satisfied with the house. Mr Charlton.,44
194,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Then let him have the chance of going out, at no loss individually. I now wish to refer to the statement made by the Minister last night in regard to the future policy of the Department. We were informed that, in future, all work is to be carried out by contract. Of course, the Government are perfectly justified in carrying out their own policy, though, personally, I do not regard that policy as in the best interests of the soldiers who have to occupy bethese houses. It is claimed that houses built by means of day labour cost £97 more than do houses built under the contract system by the Commonwealth ""Bank ; but I remind honourable members that many factors have to be taken into consideration in making comparisons of the kind. The statement made by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation will be sent broadcast throughout Australia, and' it will be taken for granted that under apday labour we do not get the same amount of work done as under the contract system. 1 venture to' say that, if two' or three competent men, who thoroughly understand the building business, were to investigate the matter, they would find that relatively there is not the difference in cost that was claimed last night. When War Service Homes were contemplated, negotiations were entered into with Sir DenisorL,Miller, of the Commonwealth Bank, with a view to undertaking the work, but no finality was reached. Sir Denison Miller went on a visit to the Old Country, and the Savings Banks of the various States were consulted with a view to intrusting the business to them. When Sir Denison Miller returned, and became aware of this, he, as representing the Bank, undertook the work, and the Savings Banks authorities were, very properly, apprised accordingly. At that time, it must be remembered, building material was very much cheaper than it became twelve months later, and that is one of the factors to be taken into consideration in making any comparison between the cost under day labour and the cost under contract; indeed, as between 1918-19 and 1920-21, it would otherwise be impossible to arrive at anything like a fair idea of the position. We know that during the latter year contractors would not tender, because, as they pointed out, they were not sure of the market for even a fortnight or three weeks ahead. One contractor informed me that, under the circumstances, he found it better to remain idle than to tender, owing to the large and sudden increase in prices. These facts are not taken into consideration in the statement made by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation. But this is only on a par with every thing done by the Department in recent years.",44
195,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"To what statement does the honourable member refer? Mr Charlton"" - The statement the honourable gentleman made as to the future policy of the Department.",45
196,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The theory which the honourable member enunciates is sound enough, but we must consider every phase of day labour and the effect of it. It is not only the actual work we have to consider, but the principle of day labour as applied to houses built under the provision of the Act which lays it down that the houses must be completed at a fixed price.",45
197,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"There are many other factors to be taken into consideration, as I shall show. For instance, the Commissioner is working on a group system, and the Bank is building individual houses. A man may have an allotment of land, and apply for a house to be built on it ; and I would not be prised if , on inquiry, we did not find that, in estimating the cost of the house, the value of the land in such cases is not taken into consideration. Honourable members will see that this would make a vast difference in the comparison.",45
198,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I made a statement last night in regard to costs, inclusive and exclusive of land, for homes built both by the Bank and by the Commissioner.",45
199,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Yes ; but I am suggesting that in cases where a man already owns land, the cost of that land is not taken into computation, but only the cost of the building. Mr Rodgers - I gave separately the eost, exclusive and inclusive of land.",45
200,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"That may be; but let us suppose that there are 100 houses to be built by the Bank, and that, amongst those 100 houses there are ten in regard to which it is not necessary to purchase land, then the total cost is divided by the number of houses, without taking into consideration the land already owned by the soldiers. In the case of the grouping system under the Commissioner, the same thing occurs; and if the facts be sifted, a great deal will be found in my contention.",45
201,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I do not think so.,45
202,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,I know that the Assistant Minister has to be guided in these matters by his officers.,45
203,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I am bound by the returns of the Department.,45
204,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"In view of the dissatisfaction with the administration, I would not take for granted anything received from the officers, some of whom are not fit for the positions they occupy. Personally, I do not favour the grouping system, though, of course, there are other people who do; and it is a matter that will probably be dealt with in the general report of the Public Accounts Committee. If a large area of land has to be purchased and subdivided, the streets made, and drains formed to the satisfaction of the municipality or the shire, the cost is considerably increased; and it is quite a different proposition from buying isolated allotments.",45
205,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I agree with the honourable member, and say that it is almost surimpossible to give effect to the specific terms of the Act under the grouping system.",45
206,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"And , as a result of that difficulty, the soldiers suffer in very many cases.",45
207,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"On the average, the soldiers will not suffer, though individuals may.",45
208,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I do not mean that all the soldiera will suffer; but, under the group system, a man may get for £800 a house that is really worth £900, whilst some one else, in the same group, gets, one for £700, making the average price £800 - That is very unsatisfactory, and not fair to the soldiers.",45
209,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member may have observed, my views on that point ^",45
210,Mr CHAELTON,POLITICAL,"At the moment I do not know what the honourable member's views are; but all these factors I have mentioned tend to make the comparison between day labour and contract work unsatisfactory. It is unfair that it should he spread broadcast that the contract system has proved much cheaper than the day-labour system. Kirkpatrick has been ""flying his kite"" pretty high in New South Wales, with statements in every newspaper alleging the failure of day labour and claiming that he has built the houses under contract cheaper by £200 each.",46
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"Si r Denison Miller told me the other day that he thought the average would come out at about £650 a house, plus land.",46
212,Mr CHAELTON,POLITICAL,"That is another point. We are told by the Assistant Minister that the houses cost £686, and now we are informed that Sir Denison Miller says the cost will be £650 .per house, plus land, a difference of £36. It is impossible to buy a block of land in any of the suburbs of Sydney for £36, so that we have evidence in this later statement that the comparison is not correct.",46
213,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"I should say that the average cost of these houses would be over £700; but for all that, good work has been done in the building of them. It is of no use underrating it .",46
214,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) bears out my contention.,46
215,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"But against this we have the clear returns of the Commonwealth Bank, as furnished to the Department, and given by me to the Committee last night. The honourable member cannot doubt them.",46
216,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"There is conclusive evidence that the comparison is misleading, and I am satisfied to leave the matter there. Many of the houses built under the contract system by the Commonwealth Bank are among the most defective that we have seen. The Commonwealth Bank built the houses at Goulburn, New South Wales, wHich have been the subject of much pubb'c comment. Mr. Kirkpatrick was the supervising architect on behalf of the Commonwealth, and he employed as local architect the son of the contractor for the erection of these homes. Yet Mr Kirkpatrick is running about Sydney talking about what he has accomplished under the contract system, and condemning the day-labour system.",46
217,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,I should hardly think it correct that the son of the contractor for the building of the homes at Goulburn was employed as architect.,46
218,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,Swor n evidence to that effect was given before the Public Accounts Committee.,46
219,Mr RILEV,POLITICAL,They also got control of the local brickworks.,46
220,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Yes , and used bricks some of which were like sand, and could be broken up in the hand. I doubt whether these facts would have come out but for the inquiry made by the Public Accounts Committee.",46
221,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,They were found out before the Public Accounts Committee dealt with the matter.,46
222,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,That is not so.,46
223,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"Then , how is it that the Committee went to Goulburn?",46
224,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"On account of the disclosures made in evidence given before the Committee at Sydney by the Deputy Commissioner of the War Service Homes Department. The Committee found that inferior material had been used in the construction of the homes at Goulburn, and although Mr Kirkpatrick said that he would not give his final certificate until he was satisfied that everything was satisfactory, the fact remains that the buildings had practically been completed when the Committee inspected them. I did not go with the Committee to Goulburn, but members of it have told me that they found the buildings were almost complete, and that plaster was being used to cover up' bad material. If the contract system is such an excellent one, how is it that bad material was used in that case?",46
225,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"Thes e things are common to any system of construction;"" but the outstanding fact is that out of over 16,000 homes that had been erected under this scheme, only about forty defective"" buildings were discovered.",46
226,Mr MARB,POLITICAL,There were others which were not brought under the notice of theCommittee.,46
227,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I dare say that there are quite a number that we have not seen. Although the Acting Prime Minister says that, in connection with so . large a scheme we are bound to havesome defective houses built, I maintain that a thorough* system of supervision would protect us from anything of the kind.",46
228,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,No system supervision will prevent roguery.,47
229,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Not where the son of a contractor is appointed as architect to see that he does good work. At Cessnock there are two War Service Homes in which inferior material has been used. On the occasion of our visit one could put one's fingers into the cracks in the walls, and the so-called paint with which they had been painted could be rubbed off.",47
230,Mr MATHEWS,POLITICAL,Were those houses built under contract?,47
231,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Yes . I mention these cases only to show what may happen if the Minister goes on with the contract in preference to the day-labour system. The Public Accounts Committee found that houses which had been built by day labour were far superior to those which had been constructed under the contract system. I went with the Committee to Newcastle, and it was impossible to find fault with any of the homes that had been built there by day labour.",47
232,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,There is no incentive under the day-labour system to scamp work.,47
233,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"That is so. The homes that we saw at Newcastle had been well and faithfully built, and in my estimation the cost was reasonable. The construction of these houses was supervised by capable men. At the head of a gang under the day-labour system there is a recognised builder, who acts as supervisor and sees to it that first-class material is used, and that good work is done. T should not have mentioned this matter had not the question of day labour .versus contract been raised by the statement of the Minister, that the Government intend, in future, to build all War Service Homes under the contract system. If that policy is to be pursued, it will be necessary for the Department to exercise the greatest care in the appointment of supervisors, otherwise much of the work will be scamped, and our returned men will suffer. If I were purchasing a house tomorrow, I would prefer one that had been built by day labour, even if I had to pay more for it, rather than one that had been built under contract. If I bought a house that had been built , by day labour, I would be sure of getting aof more satisfactory home, and one which would not require almost immediately to be repaired.",47
234,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,Does the honourable member know that some of these homes have cost £400 more than the estimated price?,47
235,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Yes ; and something will have to be done by the Government to relieve the men from these unnecessary additional costs. Under the grouping system, a soldier does not know what his home will cost.",47
236,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,But under the contract system 1 think he does.,47
237,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Not where homes are built in groups, of twenty or forty.",47
238,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,"Unde r the contract system I do not think the estimate would be exceeded in any case by, say, £200.",47
239,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,I hope the honourable member is not suggesting that I do not object to soldiers having to pay sums considerably in excess of the estimated cost of their homes. I hold that many mistakes due to inefficient supervision have been. made.,47
240,Mr BELL,POLITICAL,"Unde r the day-labour - system, a man cannot tell what his home will cost until it has been completed.",47
241,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"No r is it possible under the contract system to know what a house will cost. The soldier does not know what alterations and repairs will be necessary to a War Service Home that has been built for him under the contract system. I understood the Minister to say that he had decided to discontinue the policy under which soldiers were permitted, to purchase houses already built. I do not know that it will be wise to discontinue that policy. The average man is a good judge of a house. A proper valuation can be obtained, and by purchasing a house already built a man might save £200 or £300.",47
242,Mr MATHEWS,POLITICAL,Yes ; but by allowing the men to purchase houses already built you raise the price of houses generally.,47
243,Mr WEST,POLITICAL,And lead to increased rentals.,47
244,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"That might bo one of the results of the system, but I am speaking now purely from the point of view of the interests of the returned men.",47
245,Mr MATHEWS,POLITICAL,"If the policy under which they were allowed to purchase . homes already built had been followed generally, the' price of houses would have been considerably raised. Mr Charlton"" - The practice was not general. In the interests of the soldiers themselves, they should be given the alternative of having a house built for them by the Commission or of purchasing one already built. A man might be able to obtain for £600 a house which, if built for him, would cost £800. The additional cost is a serious toll on his earnings.",48
246,Mr MATHEWS,POLITICAL,"I know of houses in my electorate which returned men were prepared to purchase for £600 or £700, although they were not really worth £200.",48
247,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I believe that some people have been trying to exploit our returned men. If a man could purchase a house for £600, instead of having to pay £800 for a house built specially for him, it would lighten the burden of his repayments. Most of the returned men who are applying for homes are young men, who have married since their return from the war, and four or five years hence they may have two or three children to maintain. Some of them will find it difficult to keep up their instalments and at the same time rear a family in reasonable conditions of comfort. I speak from experience. In my younger days, as a working man, I set about getting a home for myself, and I well remember the difficulties with which the wife and I had to contend in meeting the payments for our house and at the same time keeping the home going. It should the our endeavour to keep down these costs. Where the estimates are exceeded the burden on oUr returned men is intensified; and if we are not careful many of them may not be able a few years hence, should we fall upon bad times, to meet their payments. In that event, we shall have to come to their rescue^ or allow them to forfeit and lose their homes. I do not want to see those who fought for us brought to such a position. My desire is that everything shall be made as reasonable as possible for them; and that is why I am inclined to think that they should be allowed to purchase a house already built, where they can do so to advantage, Then, again, I do not know whether the Minister is going to continue the policy of isolated building. My impression is that it is intended to build in groups under the contract system. The grouping system leads to injustice. If a returned man has a block of his own, or is offered an allotment by a friend, why should - he not be allowed to build his home upon it? Why should he be compelled to buy a house built under the grouping system on a site which is, perhaps, some distance from tramway facilities?",48
248,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POLITICAL,Why should they be compelled to build in the cities ?,48
249,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Exactly . In the Newcastle district land much better than that bought by the Commission was offered to it, and declined. That land could have been obtained more cheaply than some that was bought. It is situated in the middle of the district, and those living there could travel easily from it to places of business. Yet the Commission has gone further afield, and taken up large blocks for the building of grouped houses, quite beyond the living area. Much of this land will be useless as' a site for soldiers' homes, and 8 acres of one estate which was bought has had to be discarded as unsuitable because it cannot be built on. The Government have bought too much land,. They are ahead of their requirements. If they spend only £4,000,000 a year on the erection of soldiers' homes, they cannot for many years to come utilize, in New South Wales, at any rate, all the land that they now hold.",48
250,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,The land that has been purchased in New South Wales has .not been paid for.,48
251,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,I doubt that much of the - land purchased during the last twelve months has been paid for.,48
252,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,"The sum of £22,000 has - been owing to some widows for nearly two years past on account of land purchased from them, and they are being allowed only 4£ per cent, interest on the money.",48
253,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Soldier s have been allowed to purchase homes already built, and the vendors, in many cases, have given them possession, understanding that they would be paid immediately. But there are cases in which vendors have been waiting sixteen months for their money. - Mr Rodgers - No vendor whose title is good has been waiting for that length of time. The Government cannot pay money for real property'for which a good title cannot be shown.",48
254,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"In one case that I know of, the vendors are telling the widow of .a soldier who has recently been killed that, if she cannot make a settlement, they will not wait longer. I have had to write personally to them to urge them to give her more time. The excuse for the delay is that an A . A . Company's title is not a good one. I do not know how .it is that the lawyers in Sydney question that title.",49
255,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Pleas e do not say "" excuse""; it is the opinion of the Crown Law authorities by which we are guided.",49
256,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Hundred s of thousands of pounds have been advanced on the security of A . A . Company's titles. Nearly all the business men in Newcastle are interested in land having that title. Years ago the A . A . Company was given a grant of 1,000,000 acres, and every solicitor in Newcastle accepts the title as good, so that there is no difficulty in raising money on a mortgage of land originally acquired from the company. Y e t by the War Service Homes Commission, cases are hung up 'for months, on the ground that that title is unsatisfactory. It may be that the legal men in Sydney could say something for the view that they take, and I believe that it is not uncommon for Sydney lawyers to question an - A. A . Company's t it l e ; but I do not know that transfers of this land have ever before been held up for as long as they are being held up by the War Service Homes Commission. Had as much care been on a home. given to seeing that properties were not encumbered, the Commission would be better off. The present position is very unsatisfactory to vendors, and I have of the land. heard many complaints from persons dealing in properties in the Newcastle district. Many of these persons have committed themselves to expenditure which, .because the Government'would not come to a settlement, they have had to bear personally. It is most unsatisfactory fo agents and others to enter into an arthe rangement in good f a it h , and to find at the last moment, when everything seems to be on the point of completion, that transaction would be held un indefinitely. The Minister should look into these and get them settled. I think, too, that he should give further consideration to the question of grouping. If that system is to continue, the land that is taken to build on should be reasonably accessible. Returned men should not be placed in houses a mile or more from a tramway or other means of communication. That does not give partially incapacitated men a chance.",49
257,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The Commissioner has aimed at securing accessibility, but in the metropolitan areas it is difficult to get large parcels of land close in to the centre.",49
258,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I admit that; yet, if proper inquiries were made by those responsible for the purchasing of l a r d, we should be better off. Had proper in the quiries been made in all cases, the War Service Homes Commission wouldj uot have purchased some of the land which it now holds. What happens seems to be this: An officer goes to a land jobber in a town, and asks him if there is any land for sale in the district. He is told, "" Oh yes, I have such and such a piece of land which I will sell for so much."" That land is accepted, perhaps, without regard to the opinion of other persons who know something of values in the district, and subsequently it is found that a mistake has been made. Those responsible for recommending land for purchase, the offioers on whom the Minister depends, should explore every avenue of information. They should obtain values from the books of the town and shire clerks, and ask the opinion of the publio men in a district.",49
259,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I agree that in buying land for soldier settlement double precautions should be taken, because the Commission is limited in what it can spend",49
260,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"If . the Minister makes an inquiry, he will find that we have paid a great deal too much for some",49
261,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,In odd cases.,49
262,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,In many cases.,49
263,Mr FLEMING,POLITICAL,"On the average, it is so.",49
264,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"It is not so on the r average, and no member who has not seen returns should make such a statement.",49
265,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I do not pose as one qualified to express an opinion on the the value of land, but I have resided in the Newcastle district for forty-eight years, cases and know what has been paid for land there. Some of the land which the Commission has bought in that district has cost more than it should have coat.",49
266,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"There is no doubt about that. The two purchases in regard to which you asked for the papers this afternoon are shocking examples, but the Minister cannot be held responsible for them. He took the ordinary precautions. Those who made the valuations and recommendations grossly erred, in my judgment.",50
267,Mr MATHEWS,POLITICAL,Are they still in the Department?,50
268,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,No .,50
269,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"What protection have we against this thing happening again in the future? I understand that a director-general is to be appointed under the new - policy, and let us hope that he may be a thoroughly qualified man. But the Minister should take care that the country does not, in the future, find itself in the same predicament as it has been in in the past. No Minister can examine for himself all the land offered, to the Commission in the various States.",50
270,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,The Minister could get valuations free of cost in any district in Australia from councils and other local governing bodies.,50
271,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,That is one thing that could be done; but care must always be taken to ascertain that the in formation supplied is not that of in terested persons.,50
272,Mr FLEMING,POLITICAL,The information that would be supplied on behalf of district councils would be less interested than that now obtained.,50
273,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"At the .present time, the evidence of a valuator as to the worth of a property depends largely upon the side for which his services are enlisted, and thus - one set of valuers-auc tioneers and land agents-wil l give one valuation, and another set, acting for the opposite party, will give another valuation, and sometimes there will be great disparity between the two.",50
274,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,All valuations merely estimates.,50
275,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"That is so; but a good guide is the statements of, sales recorded in the books of council and shire clerks, because nowadays whenever a sale of land is made, the local council or shire has to be informed of the price at which the land was sold. I hope that in future the Minister will compel officers sent to report on land to make inquiries in certain directions, to insure the fullest in formation being available. We have paid away a lot of money which' should not have been spent, because of the muddled way in which our purchases of land have been conducted. The 108 acres in Piatt's estate, in the Newcastle District, is over a mile from a tram, and a mile and a quarter from a railway Btation, and if houses are built on that land without the assurance that a tramway will be taken close to it , the expenditure will be wasted, because soldiers will find that they cannot alford to live there. Tho Commission might easily waste £-1,000,000 or £2,000,000 by building on land too far from the centres to which those for whom the houses were intended would have to go in the course of their daily employment. The Minister must be careful to see that land that is offered' is suitable as a site for homes.",50
276,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Quite recently, a property of some magnitude was submitted to the Commission, and its purchase was recommended by a Deputy Commissioner. But having reason to doubt the wisdom of the recommendation, I had another valuation made, and got the Commissioner himself, to inspect the land, and we then had no hesitation in declining the offer, on the ground that the Jand wasunsuitable, not only as regards price, but also in point of situation. The Department is not asleep in these matters. Mr Charlton ' - If the Minister w i ll adopt that attitude in regard to future purchases all should be well. Mr RonoERs - That officer, by the way, has since been dismissed- I do not mean because of that specific business.",50
277,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I desire to conclude with some references' to the financial aspect of this matter. Last year the Commissioner asked for £.10,000,000 to carry out the programme which had been set him by the Government; but the sum was cut down, upon the Estimates, are to £6,000,000.",50
278,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The requisition to the Treasury was for £7,000,000. That was what the Minister for Repatriation asked for; but the item was reduced to £6,000,000.",50
279,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"And the Commissioner himself had asked for £10,000,000. It is true that the amount of £7,000,000 was sought for by the Minister, but it was cut down to £6,000,000,. with a promise that the amount would be added to by the money coming in from.the soldiers by way of repayment. This was estimated at that time to be about £850,000. However, my point is that such money as was granted was spent by the Commissionerin five or six months in the endeavour to give effect to the speeding up of soldiers' home construction. The money went in securing huge supplies of timber and in buying up land, aud, of course, in actual construction of homes to cope with, as far as posjjfble, the overwhelming volume of applications. How are we going to get along now with £4,000,000 for the current nnancial year to deal with activities over the whole of Australia ?",50
280,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"It should not be forgotten that, of last year's amount which was made available, approximately £3,000,000 was used in the purchase by the Commissioner of already erected homes, and another £295,000 or more was spent-in the same direction by the Commonwealth Bank. That condition will not recur during this nnancial year. Mr Charlton"" - Then it is to be understood that the Department spent only about £3,500,000 last year in the actual construction of homes. Yet that sum was nothing like adequate to meet the circumstances. In view of that fact, is it wise to apportion only £4,000,000 this year? Would it not be better policy, in the interests of economy) to put in hand the whole of the building of soldiers' homes as swiftly as possible? The same staff must be employed, whether £4,000,000 or £7,000,000 is spent in one year.",51
281,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I might inform the lionorable member that I asked for more.,51
282,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I am sure the Minister would very sensibly do so. If I were in his place and perceived that there were thousands of applicants waiting for homes I would endeavour to secure one comprehensive sum for the building of all the houses required, and have them put in. hand as quickly as possible in order to reduce the costs to the country, v/hich must be mounting up' with 'every month in which War Service Homes activities are carried on.",51
283,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"At first sight there might appear to be something in the honourable member's argument; but labour costs would be multiplied, and the difficulties of getting material in order to complete the whole task would be almost insurmountable, so that the project would prove impracticable.",51
284,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,I admit that there are those factors; but it cannot be denied that the greater the volume of business the less is the overhead cost.,51
285,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The outcome of the lionorable member's proposal would be a building boom based upon loan money, which would certainly not be justified.",51
286,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,But a building boom for the construction of soldiers' homes would be justifiable.,51
287,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I referred to the artificial position which would be created in the building trade generally by such a concentrated programme.,51
288,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"The sooner all the homes required are built, the better for the soldiers and the better for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth must bear all the overhead costs. If the project is extended over ten years, when it might have been wound up in five, the costs will have been about doubled.",51
289,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,That is not so.,51
290,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"It is so. There is this danger also, that, as a result of soldier applicants being made to wait so long for their homes, many may grow tired of waiting and repudiate their contracts when their homes are at last ready for them.",51
291,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,That kind of thing is quite frequent today.,51
292,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"And with good reason in many cases, no doubt, although * I did not know that such were the facts. The trouble is one that is bound to be accentuated as the applicants are kept waiting longer and ""longer - Expenditure upon War Service Homes is not to be regarded as a national liability. It does not involve an accretion of the national debt.",51
293,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"If we built all the homes for all the waiting soldiers at once, many of them would soon be selling back their houses again to civilians.",51
294,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"I fear that, with continued delay, that is frequently likely to happen. Shortly after the last elections I underand took a close personal inspection of soldier settlements in Adamstown. One of these communities was being estabsoldier lished upon land on the King's Road, i the Newcastle neighbourhood. were more than twenty houses in course of construction, and I anticipated many of these would have been completed within a month. However, only thirteen or fourteen of them are occupied today, in a total of more than for t y ; and about fourteen months since I made that investigation. If completed houses remain empty for so long the cost to the soldier is bound to be enhanced. Interest must be paid. And here crops up the com- (Mr Rodgers)g>parison, again, between the contract and the day-labour system.",51
295,Mr ROHGERS,POLITICAL,"There is no justificaquested tion for the delay which has occurred (Senator Millen). in getting soldiers into those homes. I there were a proper contract, however, forfeiture conditions would apply, and such delays in completion would not three, occur.",52
296,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Unfortunately, D. J. Gilbert) where work has been carried out by tract many of the structures have not that. been completed to time. In justice the builders I must say that the delay has been due very often to the scarcity of material.",52
297,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,But that is no excuse for a house continuing to remain empty long after it has been completed.,52
298,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"Certainly not! pressure. Another set of circumstances must apply there. The future policy of the Government will be a matter of deep interest of its contents."" throughout Australia. If something effective is not done to prevent a recuruntil rence of past mismanagement it will better to give up the work at this moment and admit that the Government have made a dismal failure of the whole job. If we cannot give our returned men pocket ? assistance in a more acceptable form than the Department has hitherto been able to provide it , the better course will to permit home-seekers to make their own orable member would arrangements. I believe were to negotiate with building societies and similar institutions they would quently do much better for themselves. I trust that the Assistant Minister (Mr . Rodgers) will keep a very close guard over the building of homes for be ever watchful that applicants get the a fair and reasonable deal and are not penalized by .departmental blunders. No should be asked for one penny n more than he has contracted to pay. The There Commonwealth Government, being responsible for blunders, should be prepared that to bear the burden.",52
299,Mr BAMFORD,POLITICAL,"Herbert) [ 6 . 1 9 ] - I desire very briefly to supplement the rei t is marks which I made upon the subject of War Service Homes last night ; and, in doing so, I quote the following passages from the report in today's Argus of the speech delivered by the Assistant Minister Applications for the position of War Serviee Homes Commissioner were invited by the Ministry in January, 1919.

312,Unknown,POLITICAL,Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 8 p.m.,53
313,Mr WEST,POLITICAL,"East Sydney) [S.0] - I after must admit that I heard with a great deal of regret the statement of the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Rodgers) last night; indeed, I do not remember in all my experience any speech by a Minister that has caused me so much uneasiness. At the outset, I desire to say that, in mating these remarks, I shall not avail myself of any information - that has come to me as a member of the Public Accounts Committee; my desire is to take a broad view of the question. I do not think that any member of the Government will deny that they have received the most liberal support from the Opposition for any proposals that have been made in the interests of the returned soldiers. The Government, therefore, 1 cannot put down their failure in the matter of the War Service Homes to any action of honourable members on this side. Never during my life-long experience of various Governments, both State and Federal, have I seen so much incompetence displayed as by the present Administration, in its efforts to carry out the wishes of Parliament The Government have been given the utmost freedom by this Parliament, perhaps too much freedom, i After all, it is the duty of the Government to carry out the wishes of Parliament, and to see that competent Ministers are selected to that end. I have on more than one occasion pointed out that a Coalition Government, like the present, cannot be expected to submit such concrete plans as are possible with a Government composed of members of a solid political party; and here, perhaps, may bo found the reason for the lack of ability shown in regard to the War Service Homes. There is no doubt that at all recent elections the party in power have done their utmost to induce the returned soldier and the people to believe that they are the friends of the soldiers, and to that end have made all sorts of conceivable promises. There is no excuse for the position in which the Government now find themselves. Ministers, like other members, - represent constituencies, and they must have had brought before them the necessity of providing homes for our soldiers who marry here, or may have brought wives from the other side of the world. When a man marries, his first duty is to "" find a cage for the canary ""-to make a home for his partner Mr West. t Homes. in life; and in this regard the returned soldiers have shown a fine spirit. It was well known, when the return of our soldiers became imminent, that there were not homes available for them. As a representative of the industrial workers, and as an old worker myself, I can enter into their feelings, and fully appreciate the position of a man and wife, with two or three children, trailing the streets and looking for a place in which they can live with a little comfort. The Labour party shows by its platform that one of its objects is to insure that the men aud women of Australia shall be able to live as human beings should in a civilized community. That is not possible at the present time, and the Government are not taking the proper steps towards a remedy. As I said, I do not intend to use information that has been laid before me as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, but that Committee has presented four reports in each of which is sufficient material to justify any Parliament which is watching the interests of the people to remove a Government like the present from office, and install another capable of conducting the affairs of the country without the mismanagement of which we have been witnesses. Every newspaper should chronicle, and every comic paper should ridicule, the Government's failure, and help to bring about a change; but as matters are today, the press sees only with ""one eye,"" and there is no channel, whether in the State or Federal arena, by which the public may be informed of the true state of affairs. The Assistant Minister, last night, after he had told us how the Government had done all the things they ought not, and had left undone those things that ought to have been done, wound up by announcing that they had changed their policy in regard to War Service Homes. I take it that it is now the intention to remove officials who have been employed in the War Service Homes Department for the last five years, and to select others from amongst the particular friends of the Government to fill their places. It k is evident that the Government are now beginning to-realise the ""-misfits"" they appointed in the first place, and are now going to change their methods.",53
314,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,The Government do net staff the Department-that is done by the Commissioner.,54
315,Mr WEST,POLITICAL,"The Assistant Minister is a young man in politics, or he would know that a Minister is responsible for the acts of his officers, and must suffer if they make mistakes. The idea of the Assistant Minister seems to be to appoint as chief of the Department some person connected with building and construction work i u the States, with deputies s i m i larly selected. The muddle is bad enough now, and if the Assistant Minister carries out what I take to be his intention, he will satisfy neither the soldiers nor the public. It is propcsed by the Department to adopt the contract system in preference to day labour. I can only say that even if the Assistant Minister knows how to 'make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, he knows very little about the purchase of land and the - building of homes; indeed, one of the troubles from the start has been that persons with littl e knowledge have had control of the business. I may point out to hi m the fact that an ordinary building contractor, if he be an honest man, will not have anything to do with the building of single cottages, for the reason that such contracts are not sufficiently remunerative. The labour and the material for such work is very, small, and so many different trades go to the construction of a cottage from start to finish that, as I say, the work is unremunerative. A contractor must have work elsewhere on which to employ his men, or cottages must be constructed in groups before he finds it worthwhile to tender. Even with - the best of supervision the Government will not be able to build separate cottages and meet all the requirements of the case according to the wishes of Parliament. . Under the contract system the cost of supervision will be enormously increased. One man can supervise the construction of only a few buildings, and where homes are being erected all over the country, an army of supervisors wil l be necessary to insure that they are f a it h f u l ly built. A contractor builds cottages, not from philanthropic motives, but to make money. Homes built under contract will not compare with those constructed by day labour.",55
316,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Ninety-nin e and threeof quarter per cent, of the buildings i . tralia have been built under contract.",55
317,Mr WEST,POLITICAL,"Ninety-nin e per cent, of the members of this Parliament at one time were said to be brainy men, but it does not follow that 99 per cent, of the members today are men of brains. Reference has been made during the debate to the great cost of War Service Homes. Apart from the mistakes that have been made by the Department itself, the cost of construction has not been unduly high. It is mismanagement on the part of the Department that has led to the piling up of costs. We shall always be able to look with pride on the homes that have been b u i lt by day labour. They are faithfully constructed, and are fitted with conveniences such as the well-to-do at one time could alone afford. It should be our endeavour to provide the working classes generally with such cottages. A man who poses as a friend of the returned soldiers said the other day that he could build a fourroomed cottage for £400 . What sort of a cottage would it be? He might build for such a price a cottage of rough sawn timber, and line the walls and ceiling with sugar-bags which, when papered, would look presentable, but would really be a breeding ground for vermin and disease. The War Service Homes built by day labour have been well constructed of sound material. The walls are plastered and floated with Keen's cement, so that they present an absolutely smooth surface, and offer no harbour for vermin. These houses have also been painted with pure white lead and boiled oil instead of with a composition such as has been used for painting some of the contract-built houses. Our desire should be to supply our men with homes which are as comfortable as those which hitherto only the well-to-do have been able to obtain. We were told that we should emerge from the war a new world. Let us start out by giving our returned men and the workers generally well-constructed. sanitary homes. In building these War Service Homes the Government are studying the health of the people. It is said that the cost is too high, but it must not be forgotten that the repayments will extend over thirt y years, and that, therefore, the homes should be so constructed that at the end of that period they will still be sound. If that is done, then should any the men be unable to carry on their n Auspayments, the Government will have a substantial asset. If the Government decide that for the f u t u re all War Service Homes shall be built under the contract ' system, the men will be discontented. We shall not get such satisfactory work as under the day-labour system. Parliament promised that every soldier would be able to obtain a substantially built home on easy terms, and it is our duty to see that that promise is carried out. Some honourable members opposite , are never tired of talking of the great resources of Australia, and of urging that we should encourage immigration. read in the press the other day a statement by an ex-member that, when dining with the Governor General, he expressed the hope that, before H is Excellency's term of office had expired we should have an influx of at least 10,000,000 immigrants. As a matter of fact, we have not increased our population by 1,000,000 in ten years. If honourable members opposite are sincerely anxious to encourage immigration they should advocate as a first step the provision of houses in which immigrants may live. As it is, there is an acute . shortage, of housing accommodation in all our big cities, and the position in country districts is even worse. . An immigrant who gets work in the country has very often to live in a shed at the rear of a public-house, leaving his wife and family in a room in one of our cities. Is it any wonder that, in such circumstances, people prefer city to country life? housing accommodation were available in country districts more people would be encouraged to settle there. The shire councils should bestir themselves, since with an increased population they would be better able to carry out their responsibilities. I can tell at a glance whether or not a house has been properly built. member of the Public Accounts tee I visited Tasmania a few days ago, and saw in one district there five cottages, built by day labour, which for faithful construction are not to be surpassed. the other hand, we got a shock when we looked at some of the War Service Homes that had been built under contract. urge the Government to reconsider their decision to adopt the contract There certainly has been mismanagement on the part of the Department, is still hope of salvation if the remaining homes are built under day labour. homes should be thoroughly well Jlfr West. and free from any cause of complaint. The heavy cost of some of the houses that have been constructed has been due to This bungling in administration. In the case of two cottages that I know of I should have been glad to put in the foundations for £ 3 0 . The Department charged to one of these jobs eighty-six bags of cement, although only four had been used, and to another fifty-eight bags, and I in it about the same quantity had been used. Honourable members can understand why, under a costing system like that) soldiers have come to think that the houses are too expensive. It would, however, be possible to make out proper bills of quantities. The cubing system of costing is not applicable to cottage building, because the more you keep down height, the greater the cubical cost; but with proper bills of quantities, and proper charging, of labour costs, you can get at the actual expenditure on a building to within £5 or £6. Of course, estimates are often exceeded, because, when a man brings his wife to .see the partly-finished building, she wants a cupboard here, or a wardrobe there, or a larger sink in the kitchen; and the husband, being a good fellow, says, "" Darling, you shall have all these things,"" and he asks for them to ba supplied. It is right that the men should If better have houses in which they and their wives can take a pride. The time has gone by when itoan be considered good enough for any Australian to give him a cottage built of rough timber, lined with hessian, on which a cheap wall paper has been pasted. The better the dwelling that a man has, the more contented will he ba, and the better citizen will he become. H a d the Labour party been in As a power the conditions of the soldiers Commit- would have been improved, because we know their wants, arid we would have recognised the true Australian spirit. The citizens of a proud and dignified nation On demand something more than rough constructions of weatherboards to dwell in . If the Department goes back to the conI tract system, it will find everv "" Johnnycome-lately,"" every schemer, rushing to it system. to get a contract, which is what occurred when the Commission first started its but there work. Men having a few pounds in their These pockets tried to become contractors, and built, many of them could not carry out their contracts. The ordinary builder will not undertake the erection of cottages, because it does not pay. .1I have urged the creation of a Department for the proper carrying out of these building operations, nnd the employment of men who would t do good work, so that satisfaction might reign in the community instead of discontent. No member is pleased with what the War Service Homes Commission has done. Week after week, and month after month, complaints come to us from soldiers. We hear, from men who have been eight and nine months trying to get a home. In a case that I know of, a man had to shift his wife and bairns from one . house to another until he had been in four lodgings before the home which the Department had contracted to provide for him was ready. Every member gets these complaints, though, as I represent & city constituency, and am known from one end of Sydney to the other, I may get more than my share of them. We must improve matters. But the proposals of the Government, if adopted, will lead to further trouble and discontent. When the War Ser-vice Homes Act was passed Parliament hoped to provide habitations for its returned men, and it thought that if there should be an oversupply the surplus could be used by ordinary citizens. Now it is found that it may be ten years before the Department can satisfy the demand for soldiers' homes. The Government has ignored the wishes of Parliament in this matter, and has displayed an incapacity such as has been shown by no other Administra- tion, Federal or State. I am not saying this to catch' votes, because I have no need to do that. My desire is to remove the present discontent, and to help the soldiers who desire to get homes of their own. I should be a traitor to my country if I did not give to the Government the benefit of my knowledge, and point out the errors into which Ministers have been led. The statement made by the Minister last night caused me considerable regret, because I felt that he is following the wrong path, and that his policy will make things worse than they are. Even if it were to add 5 per cent, to the cost of administration it would be better to adopt the day-labour system, because, under that system, our soldiers will get homes fit to live in, and the Government will have a real and proper asset for its expenditure. Such homes will be built as will make those who live in them happier and better citizens-.",55
318,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,"Grampians) [S.44] I rise, not to condemn the administration of the War Service Homes Commission, but rather to praise what has been done .by it, especially since our highly-esteemed friend, the member for Wannon, has been Assistant Minister for Repatriation. Last night, however, in a somewhat chastened spirit, he asked n6t for destructive, but for helpful criticism, and it is to make such helpful criticism that I now address myself to the House. For what the Department has done in the direction of building homes for soldiers generally I have nothing but praise to offer, that is as regards their activities in the principal metropolitan cities of Australia and their suburbs. So far as I am aware, however, very little has been done for soldiers desiring to have homes erected for them, or to be assisted in purchasing homes in country districts. I have been endeavouring to ascertain if there is a single War Service Home in the electorate of Grampians, but my investigations hither- to have been of a negative character. Perhaps other country electorates have been more signally favoured. In this mild criticism of policy I am not directing censure upon the Assistant Minister (Mr. Rodgers). Indeed, since he has taken over control of the Department some inquiries, at any rate, have been made with respect to country homes for returned men; and I have sufficient faith in the Minister to believe that, in course of time, some War Service Homes will be. erected outside of metropolitan areas and their suburbs. Meanwhile some of our returned heroes have undertaken to buy country pror>erties, and. under the terms of the Act, they have sought financial assistance from the Federal Government.",57
319,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I am having a return prepared concerning the homes built in every electorate in the Commonwealth. The honourable member will be able to see how soldiers and their dependants in Grampians have'fared, and he will be able to make comparisons. Incidentally, I might mention that the returned men in his electorate appear to be well satisfied with their lot. They have made remarkably few requests or complaints.",57
320,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,"I am sure that they are the'best-returned soldiers in Austrahave lia. I would be surprised, indeed, if were many complaints from the Gramof pians. I do not propose to point any adverse criticism at the War Service Homes These returned men must live. Branch, but I have been asked to bring one specific matter under the notice of Minister. I refer to a returned soldier in the Wcodend district, particulars of whose case were contained in a letter dressed to'myself, and dated 8th ary last, from the secretary of the local Repatriation Committee at Woodend. It is as follows: My Committee has asked me to refer to the case of J. Mooney, who applied to the War Service Homes Commission in a loan to pay for a house he has bought. He paid £200 for the house, which is worth ahout £350 to £400; and he asks for a loan of to £150. I have written many letters case, but it still drags on. The winter interposes with the expression of a trenchant opinion concerning the Decludespartment, and he concludes: Could you have something done to get the case finalized ? l t is a pity it should be necesapplicants sary to bother you, but it seems the only way. I did what I could, and the result, up to a certain stage, at any rate, was satiein,this matter? factory; for on the 22nd February I was able to write to the secretary at Woodend as follows:I have pleasure in enclosing herewith ter I have received from the Deputy Commishomes sioner of the War Service Homes Department. J. am pleased to note that Mr Mooney's case has been finalized, - and that he has been vised that approval has been given for vance up to £105 for the purpose ing the mortgage on the property. The people interested at Woodend were pleased that, in so brief a period as fourI teen days, following upon a delay of about two years, the case was brought finality. ""Unhappily, however, I received another letter from the Woodend Rement patriation Committee, dated 12th July, which read as follows: I am sending you with this letter the of J. Mooney's application for loan under Service Homes Aet, which you were good cants for War Service Homes. enough to look into for me in February. As a result of your action, Mooney's case finalized within five days; but, in spite finalization, Mr Mooney has not yet received the money.",58
321,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"Then , what the meaning of finalization?",58
322,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,"That is just what I want to learn. The letter continuesDuring the existence of the Committee we had three applications under the War. there Service Homes Aet. One man, F. A. Giles, Macedon-road, gave up a long timo ago, after waiting a year. They cannot be waiting for. an indefinite period the for promised assistance which, in their view, will never materialize.",58
323,Mr HECTO BLAMOND,POLITICAL,The honourable admember is approaching dangerously near Februto criticising the Department.,58
324,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,"I have not undertaken to refrain froin doing so. My purpose is to be helpful, and not to indulge you in destructive criticism. My corresponMay, 1919, for dent continuesM. J.

I now advise all applicants to have nothing to do with War Service Homes. Could you not take some action in the House to help the soldiers I bring these cases to the generous and sympathetic consideration of the Minister. I trust that in future, while no less a letattention is paid to the construction of for returned men in tha chief centres of Australia, more attention will adbe devoted to building houses and providan ading loans for the purchase of homes in of dischargcountry districts. - Mr Riley (South Sydney) [8.58] - ' was somewhat disappointed by the statement of the Minister (Mr Rodgers) last to night. When our men returned from the war they were promised that the Governwould provide them with homes at the lowest possible cost, and at the most reasonable rates of interest. Inducefile ments were offered in such attractive War forms that there were very many appliGreat was numbers of returned soldiers, however, of the are still waiting. I admit that the Department undertook a gigantic task in 0 creating an organization for the construe-"" is tion of these houses. But the task has. been in hand for nearly five years now, and. the Minister admits at this stage that the Department has been a failure.",58
325,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I have admitted no such thing as a building failure.,59
326,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"The fact that the Ministei' has said that the present organization is to be brought to a conclusion, and the work of building handed over to contractors is, in itself, absolute condemnation of the Department. The statement proves that the Department has been a failure.",59
327,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I admit no such thing. There was an emergency, and we met the emergency.",59
328,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,I think the Department have done their best; the Minister certainly has.,59
329,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"The honourable member may look at the matter from his point of view; I look at it from mine. The Commission has built a number of ""War Service Homes, and has now a revenue from them of over £S00,000 in repayments and iuterest.",59
330,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,That does not indicate a continuous revenue to that amount. Some of the moneys received were deposits.,59
331,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"The Commission will have a continuous revenue, and in a year or two will be self-contained and able to build further homes without borrowing more money; the repayments and interest will finance future construction. I understood that the Department was to be run upon business lines, but, with the concurrence of the Minister, the Commissioner has incurred the expense of buying timber areas and mills in Queensland. When those commitments were entered into the Department .must have intended to continue building. homes. ""Nearly £500,000 has been spent in purchasing timber areas and mills, and now, when the scheme is nearly completed, the Government have the hardihood to tell us that future construction is to be done by contract. What is to become of the timber areas and all the accumulated supplies?",59
332,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"We propose, under the contract system, to utilize all the materials we have in hand and all running contracts. The materials will be supplied at schedule prices to the successful contractors.",59
333,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,A contractor will not take dictation from any Department as [420] to where and how he is to buy his supplies.,59
334,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,He will get a contract only if he accepts our terms.,59
335,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Now we are getting deeper into the mire. If these conditions are imposed on the contractor he will increase his price. The Government say that day labour has not been a success, and that the contract system has been more satisfactory. That may or may not be a fact, but my own impression is that, with a competent staff of architects and clerks of works and Government purchases in large quantities of timber, cement, nails, and paint, and, if necessary, manufacturing their own bricks, the Department can build cheaper than can any contractor. Yet, after having involved the country in an expenditure of £500,000 on account of timber alone, and further immense sums for the purchase of land, and probably contracts for iron, paint, and nails, and after having got together a huge organization, the Government propose to abandon the whole system of Departmental construction. Do the Government intend to confine the soldiers to the areas that have been purchased, or are they to be allowed to buy areas for them",59
336,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I said that, whatever advantages we gained by entering into contracts for the purchase of materials, we lost on the operation of the day-labour system.",59
337,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"If there has been a loss on day labour, it is due to the maladministration of the Department. I know of men who were sent on to jobs, and on arrival found no material there for them to work on.",59
338,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,That is where the shoe pinches.,59
339,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Yes , and yet the Government blame the day-labour system for the excessive costs of construction - The War Service Homes Department is a disgrace to the Commonwealth, and the more we investigate it the more disgusted we become that it has been allowed to continue unchecked for so long. Does the Minister propose to abolish the Department? If all the construction is to be done by contract there will be no need for a Minister of Repatriation and staff to; organizethe construction of War Service Homes.",59
340,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,Is it not necessary for a building society that does not carry out its own building operations to have a staff? But we propose to materially reduce the staffs and overhead charges.,60
341,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"It is not necessary have a Minister for Repatriation and a Departmental staff. If the Government wish to go the whole hog, and save money, the proper thing to do is to abolish the Department and arrange with the Commonwealth Bank or private banks to iinance any soldier who desires to build a ""home. Apparently, the Ministry of Repatriation will be still in existence, and the Minister will certainly have a staff; but the whole of the actual business will be done by private architects and contractors; all the Department will have to do will be to provide the money. That could be done by the banks, and so the need for a Department and officers would disappear.",60
342,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"If c would not concern He very much if we did get rid of the Department, and I said last night that we had fixed a period of two years within which we hoped to finish our work.",60
343,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"I do not blame the Minister. The whole of this bungling has been the fault of the men who were notbig enough for their jobs. No Minister could supervise in every State what was taking place, but the condemnation of the day-labour system, because of the failure of the Department, is a slander upon the Workmen engaged in the building trade. The Assistant Minister stated last night that Lieut - Colonel Walker had given preference to returned soldiers. That is ouite right so far as it goes. Then he said that the Commissioner had not received a fair deal because of the go-slow policy of the .men in the building trade. That was a reflection upon the returned soldiers who - were working for the Department.",60
344,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I merely stated that Lieut - Colonel Walker himself had said that.,60
345,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Exactly ; he said he did not get a fair spin, because of the policy of going slow on the job. That is a slander upon the returned soldiers to whom he gave preference. I resent that statement. - I have been on many of these jobs, I have seen the men at work, and their labours were a credit to them. The War Service Homes scheme was a fine idea if properly carried out, and I regret that because it has been a failure in 'some respects, the Government are rushing to the opposite extreme. I prophesy that if they build as many homes under the contract system as they have built by day labour, they will have 50 per cent. more, complaints. to Any man who accepts a contract tries to make as much money out of it as he can.",60
346,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I admit that the contract system requires tight inspection, carefully-drawn contracts, and close supervision on the job.",60
347,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"If the contractors are to be watched at every turn, the cost of the buildings will be increased A contractor's first object is to get the job done cheaply, and, if possible, evade some of the specifications, and scamp the work. The Government are doing a great injustice in blaming day labour for the failure of the War Service Homes policy. It must be remembered that the cost of living, and building materials, and wages have increased at least 30 per cent., but today the price of timber is falling, bricks are cheaper than they were, and the price of paints is decreasing. On the eve of this decline in material costs the Government are about to adopt the contract system, and next year we shall have a report that so many houses were built under that system so much cheaper than by day labour.",60
348,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,There is evidence that the prices of materials are falling now.,60
349,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Yes , and perhaps wages, too, will fall in some trades. The contractors are being brought into the scheme when everything is tending in - their favour and against the day-labour system.",60
350,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,First-clas s Tasmanian weatherboard is being sold today at 20s. per 100 feet.,60
351,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Kaur i is being imported wholesale, and the prices of timber generally are at least 30 per cent, less than they were. The price of oregon has dropped nearly 50 per cent., and that is the best timber that can be put in a house for roofing. I very much regret that the War Service Homes Department has not been more successful. In regard to the position of the ex-Commissioner (Lieut - Colonel Walker)-, I doubt very much the statement made by Senator Millen, in another place, that he did not see the telegram in which that gentleman's insolvency was mentioned. I can hardly credit that the Minister in charge of Repatriation, when appointing an officer to take charge of this enormous expenditure, which has amounted to ahout £14,000,000 to date, should have been so careless as not to look at a telegram that had a very important bearing upon the proposed appointment.",60
352,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,It is very doubtful whether the telegram was on the file when the appointment was made.,61
353,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Mr Gilbert, the former Comptroller of Repatriation, has stated in today's Herald that the telegram was in the Department, and that Senator Millen saw it more than-once. He is a man whom I have known for a number of years; he is straightforward and capable, and his word may be relied upon.",61
354,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,The documents will speak more effectively than any statement.,61
355,Mr RLLEY,POLITICAL,"If the ex-Commissioner was not big enough for his job, the Government should have had the courage to say to him, "" You have had a fair chance and you have failed to come up to requirements; therefore, we must get r i d of you."" It is only fair to Lieut - Colonel Walker to say that he may have been handicapped when he first started operations by the fact that the Timber Combine and the Brick Combine tried to raise their prices against him. They thought that because t i e Commonwealth Government were embarking upon this big policy of house construction there would be a scarcity of building materials, and so they refused to come to the aid of the Commissioner and held back materials with the object of getting bigger prices. Inasmuch as Lieut - Colonel Walker may have had to pay higher prices than were just, he is entitled to sympathy. I inspected a number of the War Service Homes cottages built in New South Wales under the group system. I saw some of the houses absolutely complete, but not occupied, although returned soldiers were anxious, to take them. When I asked the reason, I was told that the Department was deferring occupancy until the whole group was complete. As soonas a cottage was finished, a soldier should have been put into it . [420]- 2",61
356,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"It is one of the drawbacks of the day-labour system that the cost of a house cannot be known until the group is completed,",61
357,Mr CHARLTON,POLITICAL,"That is a drawback, irrespective of whether it is contract or day labour. : ",61
358,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"It cannot affect the man's going into a house when it is finished. If six houses out of eighteen are finished those six houses ought to be occupied, and thus reduce the cost of the others. To keep all the houses waiting until all are completed in order to strike an average is a course without justification.",61
359,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,Matter s could be adjusted afterwards ,61
360,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"Precisely . Personally, I may say that the homes I have seen in New South Wales are of a"" very good, high-class type, which I do not think the soldiers will regret purchasing. I am sorry the Government are abandoning the policy they have hitherto pursued. Sawmills have been purchased, and other arrangements made for the supply of cheaptimber, and now it is proposed to hand the. business over to the contractors. The Minister ought to have put his "" back up"" and insist on a new*staff, and then have, held the Commissioner responsible for the completion of the cottages at a certain price. The Government could certainly buy much more cheaply than any contractor could; and I hope the Minister will yet see the advisability of giving day-labour another chance under new and better management.",61
361,Mr BRENNAN,POLITICAL,"Does that, include a new Government?",61
362,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,"A new Government will come in due course-w e are waiting patiently. There are other honourable members who desire to speak,, and there is other business to do, and I-shall, therefore, reserve my further remarks on this question until we have the Budget before us.",61
363,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"Illawarra) [9.17] - I presume that the changes indicated by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) will be effected by means: of legislation, and this will enable us to deal more effectively with some phases of them. It is not conceivable that the Government will tear up an Act of Parliament, which was passed a brief time ago and substitute for the organization set up under that Act an entirely different one, without the authority which they can only secure by means of legislation repealing the old measure.",61
364,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,The present Act provides for day-labour just as it does for building under the other system.,62
365,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"Unde r the Act the Government are morally bound to appoint a Commissioner clothed with the powers the Act gives him to carry out the work. The substitution for that officer of a Minister, and without the authority of Parliament, would be a serious invasion of the rights of the House.",62
366,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I indicated the necessary legislative changes.,62
367,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"I do not suppose that such a thing as I have suggested is contemplated. As to the past defects of administration, I think it is unnecessary to say anything; they are so obvious, and have been so repeatedly placed before Parliament and the country that any good purpose that would be served by a review has already been achieved. But we should be lacking in our duty if we permitted a new system to come into being without applying to it the results of our past experience. wish, first of all, to challenge the attitude which has been taken up by successive administrators of War Service Homes, whether they be the Commonwealth Bank, the Commissioner, or the Minister with reference to the question of purchasing homes already in existence, and the closely allied question of allowing the soldier to build his own home' as he himself wishes, and then having his mortgage taken over, as the Act contemplates. I believe the most satisfactory settlement is that of soldiers in homes of their own selection. The soldier does not desire to go into group settlements away from his own people and industrial centre; he wishes to be like other men, free to choose the home apparently best suited to his conditions and his social life. Parliament set out first with the idea of enabling soldiers to get homes; and the principle of the organization should be, not the ideas of some gentleman as to how garden cities should be created, or how people should be grouped in this or that way, but to allow the soldier to do what he himself wishes to do, and not something that somebody else thinks he ought to do. The initial blunder in the organization has been that too many people who have touched it have done so with the desire to graft on to it some fad of their own-hav e forgotten that the soldier has just the same rights and desires as any other member of the community. To-day he is not a soldier, but a civilian who has earned the right to special consideration, which will take the best form if it enables him, in his own way, to select his home where he pleases. Much of the financial troubles which have worried the Treasurer considerably arise from the wide departure from that principle in the beginning. Had the money that has' been devoted to those fanciful schemes of future homes been devoted to securing homes already in existence, or erected under the supervision of. the soldier, we should not now be confronted - with the difficulties arising from shortage of funds. The timber scheme in Queensland was discussed by this House. I have no doubt that if the object is to look forward to a building scheme enduring for ten, fifteen or twenty years, that, probably, was a very wise investment, but, in my judgment, the money would have been much better applied to the purchase I of houses already in existence, or to enabling the soldier to make his own contract according to his own plans. Thousands of men would then have been doing the same thing at one time, and this would not only have relieved the Department of the anxiety of supervision and so forth, but would have immensely aided in the speedy completion of the job.",62
368,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The Government still stand by the policy of homes as provided by section 20, with the exception that, as to already-built homes, the purchase is restricted considerably.",62
369,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"Why should the Department say to the soldier that he should not purchase the house he is living in, but should take a Government house ? A case has come under my notice in which a soldier was threatened with penalties if he did not take a house that he did not like that had been erected by the Commission, although there was another house that he preferred.",62
370,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Personally , I have not been devoted to the principle of group building.",63
371,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"No , but still the Department is doing what I have said, and, in the honourable gentleman's remarks last night, I regretted to still find that antagonism to allowing the soldier to buy a house already in existence. There are many cases' within my own knowledge where a soldier was living in a house before he went to the war, and, on his return, wished to remain in it. The owners were willing to sell, and, as occurred within my own circle of soldier friends, were prepared to concede conditions that they would not give to any outside purchaser. One of the first cases brought under my notice was that of a young friend who returned, and, after looking round, found a house to suit him. He was about to be married, and was glowing with satisfaction that he had got the kind of house which he desired, aud which the proprietor was prepared to sell as a bargain. Four months later I met him in the depths of despair; the Department had turned clown his application after keeping him waiting for months, and within seven days of that occurring the property was purchased by one of the shrewdest friendly societies in Sydney for a member at a price .very much in excess of that offered to the soldier. Who can say that the interests of the soldier were conserved by the Department, which forced him to pay £100 more for a house the Department wished him to buy than he would have had to pay for a house that he himself desired? Then, again, there is the case of a soldier who buys a block of land, has his own plans prepared, arranges with a contractor on mortgage, and then applies to the Department. Such a man is met with no encouragement. In one case the business with the Department commenced nearly two years ago, and it is only two months since the man got his mortgage transferred. The Department should have said to the soldiers, ""Find the house you want and we will help,you; if you erect,-a house that you desire, we will finance you to the same extent, and take over the mortgage."" If that had been done, we should have had thousands of houses erected without any trouble about day labour of contract, and erected under the best of superintendence, namely, that of the men who were going to live in them.",63
372,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Ou t of a total expenditure of £7,500,000 for homes last financial year, the conditions the honourable member suggests in regard to the soldiers' own wishes were observed to the extent of £3,268,000 worth of homes.",63
373,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,Then why was so much antagonism shown to the idea last night? I undertake to say that there have been no complaints from the soldiers thustreated.,63
374,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"We have had a very definite complaint and a very real experience. It was found we were hoisting the value of real estate and helping speculators to buy or erect homes, and get soldiers to hurry into them, rather than buy the more substantial buildings of the Department.",63
375,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"If the Assistant Minister went around and saw the homes to which I refer, he would find that that is the attitude of interested persons in regard to the proposition. No doubt, a lot of jerry-builders set out to provide homes; but if we have a Department capable of supervising the erection of £6,000,000 worth of homes' a year, we could surely have a small Department capable of seeing that homes purchased are of a proper kind before taking them over. My experience may be different from that of other honourable members. I have not met a single case in which the soldier has said that the home he himself has selected has proved jerry-built orunsuitable.",63
376,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I wish that was my experience.,63
377,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"Well , it is mine. There are many homes erectedand it. is no use blinking the fact-unde r the other system that have been too costly-home s into which materialhas been put that the civic authorities would not allow in the case of private homes. I say this because I think it ought to be said. I , ; am. not blind to the fact that the statement does' not apply to the great majority of the homes which have been erected, and I do not seek to depreciate the splendid service that has been rendered to the soldiers by the Wax Service Homes Department. But we are here to see that every penny spent is expended in the best interests of the soldier, and in accordance with hia own wishes. I hope we have heard the last of what seems to have been a steady attempt to prevent a soldier from getting the house he wants, and to compel liim 'to take a house that he does not' want merely because it has been built by the Commission.",63
378,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I can assure the honourable member that there is to be no more speculative building by the Commission. In future every house built by the Commission, whether built under contract or otherwise, will be in response to the application of an individual soldier.",64
379,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"That will be very much better. I hope also that some check will be put upon the acquisition of large areas of land. I am satisfied that some large areas have been acquired, not because it was thought that they were wanted by soldiers, - but because some one has had a good "" cut"" out of the money so expended. In that, regard we have been altogether too free in allowing .subordinate officers to make large purchases without reference to the local Repatriation Committees or the Minister: These are faults that can be remedied. I turn now, briefly, to another phase of this question, which to me. is of very great importance. I read a few days ago a. statement made at the time the War Service Homes Bill was before the House that it . was anticipated that the average, cost of settling a soldier on the land would be £1,500. I heard in the course ""of the debate yesterday that the Treasurer regarded almost with equanimity the suggestion that it was going to cost us £3,000 for every soldier settled on the land.",64
380,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,No.,64
381,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,I think it is a scandal.,64
382,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"The Treasurer would render a great service to the Commonwealth if he put his pruning knife as deeply into that side of the expenditure as he proposes to do in so far as the building of War Service Homes is concerned. The Commonwealth should not provide another penny for the settlement of soldiers on the land by the States unless it first knows that that settleland ment is being conducted in the interests of the soldiers themselves, and not in the interests of either the States or the land speculators. My view in regard to this matter is unchanged. When the original Bill was before us I urged that we should not allow one penny to be spent on soldier settlement by the States on behalf of the Commonwealth unless we had our own officers supervising that expenditure. I still hold that opinion.",64
383,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,"I sent out a circular as recently as February last to all the State Governments- I had to take this action for my own protection-tell ing them that they must, not incur any more obligations of any kind with respect to soldier settlement without reference to the Commonwealth Treasury.",64
384,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"That was necessary because the system is open to abuse. If a State desires to resume an estate of, say, 100,000 acres, it can resume it ostensibly for soldier settlement, and yet not put a soldier on it . In my State we have not that confidence in some of the officials connected with these resumptions that may be entertained by people who have had nothing to do with them.",64
385,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,Victori a is a good State.,64
386,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"The habit which Victorian representatives have of* throwing bouquets at qne another is not t of much use to those in this Parliament who have practical work to do. The idea that the Commonwealth can provide anything in the region of £3,000 for every returned soldier'who wants to make a living on the land is absurd. It is most unfair that the money we are able to raise for repatriation services should bei used in that way. The £3,000 expended in settling one man on the land would provide homes for four returned soldiers and their families. I hope, before we meet again, there will be a very careful examination of the result of the expenditure on soldier settlement, and that an attempt will be made to ascertain what the. settlement of each soldier has actually cost. I hope also that there will be an examination to determine whether the money we are spending on soldier settlement could not be better diverted, for a time at all events, to the establishment of soldiers in their own homes.",64
387,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"In respect of future settlement, our obligation is limited"" to £1,000 per soldier.",64
388,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,Is th© roomed Minister able to say what is the obligaconveniences tion of the Commonwealth at this took moment with regard to land alreadyrelief sumed by the States?,65
389,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POLITICAL,It amounts to siderably more than that.,65
390,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,It must there do.,65
391,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"U p to date we have expended on soldier . settlement roughly £26,000,000, leaving about £22,000,000 yet to be found in respect of the approved programmes.",65
392,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,Spread of all over how many years ? *,65
393,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,That amount will cover the whole of the approved programmes houses as between the Commonwealth and the themselves. States.,65
394,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"I am not familiar with the formula by which that has been arrived at, but surely it must have contemplated the spreading of the expenditure over a period of, say, three, five, or seveu years.",65
395,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"There were two ferences, at which the States were asked to forecast their programmes, and to us how much money they would want to give effect to them. The figures I have named will cover the whole of the grammes to which we are committed.",65
396,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,"Then I ment hope that a new conference will be called and that we shall tell the States that are not going to carry the whole burden of land settlement in Australia upon plea that we are settling soldiers on land. In some of the States very little land settlement other than that for which we are paying is being carried out. These are the prinicpal .matters which I desire to refer. I could cite a ""pended by it. good many cases, but I do not think that the National Parliament should divert attention from the big issues involved this question. It is most important in the interests of the soldiers and the welthe fare of the - countiy that War Service Homes should be provided for our men as quickly as possible. As I mentioned the other day, a returned soldier marries in the belief that he will be able almost at once to get a home for himself. puts in an application for a War Service Home, but the months go by, and nothing is done for him. I know of solthe diers who are living in two or threeone-half houses devoid of the ordinary of civilization, to which they their newly-wedded wives in the be that homes would be quickly available for them. They have had to keep them conthere for the last twelve months, and there is every prospect of their remaining for another year before the homes which they were promised two years ago will be provided for them. I hope thab the energies of the Department will be turned into the channel of providing homes in preference .to big areas for sok dier settlement; that it will consider first the soldier's requirements, and that if it cannot make available the necessary"" homes, it will allow men to purchase already built, or to erect homes for",65
397,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"Maribyrnong) [9.40] - ' This is one of the most important matters that the House has been called upon to consider. I am afraid we shall-have considerably more trouble in giving effect to the programme outlined by the Minister (Mr Rodgers) last night than we have conhad in connection with the programme that the Government have been endea-. tell vouring to carry out. Unless the War Service Homes Commissioner was sadly at fault in estimating his requirements, it prowill be found that the provision of£4,000,000 for the services of the Departduring the presentfinancialyear-is altogether insufficient. Crowds of soldiersl we have long been clamouring for houses/ Instead of making an increased effort to the satisfy the demand, the Government are the cutting down the operations of the Department by providing for it in respect of the current financial year, only £4,000,000, although in the first six to months of last year £6,000,000 was ex-' The Commissioner asked for £10,000,000 in respecfc of . the last its financial year. The Treasurer cut' down in the amount to £6,000,000, with the result that the whole of it was spent during"" first half of the year. I take' it that the Commissioner must have based his calculation upon some reliable data. He estimated that for the three years following the commencement of building op'erar tions he would require 'from £6,000,000. He fco £8,000,000 per annum. The competition for houses .is becoming keener than ever, yefc the Government are adopting short-sighted policy of reducing by the amount hitherto available' for the War Service Homes Department. Ordinary building material, such ber and bricks, have been costly and difficult to secure, and attention might have been directed to other suitable terials. We find men today building houses, not of weatherboard, bricks, or cement, but of fibro-cement or durabestos, which is made of Australian material, fireproof, and makes a fine house.",65
398,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POLITICAL,The Departspeech ' inent refused to finance a soldier in my from his lips. electorate because there were three sheets of that material in the house which wished to purchase.,66
399,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"That is absurd. man who has been in the building trade for some years assures me that durabestos and fibro-cement are among the best building materials. , The Government seem to be panicky in regard to the buildpretation ing of soldiers' homes, and are swinging away from the programme which they entered upon only a few months ago they purchased large timber areas designed to serve a building campaign extending over at least three years-. As the honorleagues, able member for West Sydney said, the Government spent nearly £500,000 quiring these rights, and it paid for half in cash and half in bonds bearing per cent, interest, which gives the vendors a good return on a very safe investtween ment. But after setting out to thus supply - itself with material pendently of the exploiting middleman, the Government has reversed its policy, and is going to get r i d of half of these timber areas, selling them back, I pose, to their former owners. I should like to know at what price. There has been a complete reversal of policy, and building programme has been cut down by one-half. In the face of experience, contract system is to be maintained to the exclusion of the day-labour system, from which the better results have been obcontract tained. The preamble of the Minister's speech last night was a condemnation of the mismanagement of the War Service Homes Commission.",66
400,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I do not think that.,66
401,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"Takin g the actual language used, and also reading between the lines, it must be regarded as a indictment of the Commission.",66
402,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,The press has not that interpretation on it .,66
403,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,I have not read any as tim - press comment on the speech.,66
404,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,The reports of the well speech published in the newspapers do manot emphasize the fact that I condemned the administration of the Commission.,66
405,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"The Minister spoke for an hour and a half, or for an hour and a is quarter, and he wishes us to accept the abbreviated newspaper reports of his in place of what we actually heard",66
406,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The honourable member he for Herbert (Mr Bamford) said that my speech was a eulogy of the Commission. A Mr Fenton!-The Minister would move uneasily in his chair, and, perhaps, even rise to order, were T to accuse him of of having praised the administration of the Commission. I think that my interof his speech w i ll be endorsed by honourable members on both sides. U n fortunately, he has become panic-stricken. when He has had the assistance of advisory Boards and Committees, and the result seems to have confused him and his colwho are now rushing to extremes. The houses which on investigation have on acbeen condemned have been those conthem structed by contract. H a d I , as one of 6 the guardians of the public purse, to choose, in the interests of the soldiers, be the contract and the day-labour system, I would choose the latter, of course indeunder proper supervision. The investigation that has been made by the Publio Accounts Committee shows that system to be the better. The day-labour system was supnot given a chance by the Commission. No one would advocate its adoption except under proper supervision; but with the such supervision, and the employment of the right men, it will give better results the 'than the contract system. Suppose the Minister's contention to be right, that the day-labour houses cost £ 9 0 more than the houses, is it not well to have two competitive systems i h operation, for the sake of the comparison which it affords ?",66
407,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,There is something in that ; but we can always employ day labour if we find the contract system unsatisfactory.,66
408,Mr RILEY,POLITICAL,T-But you are scattering the organization got together for the carrying serious out of the work with day labour.,66
409,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"Yes . The Commisput sion made an arrangement for obtaining supplies of timber, cement, and, I think, bricks and other materials, and, with a little better organization and supervision, it might have been expected to get good results. It was operating when the buying of building materials was a veritable gamble, and was driven to lengths to which it should not have had to go because private individuals dealt unfairly with it. Those who had been waving the flag and pumping out patriotic sentiment tried to extort the last penny from the Commission, charging it more than they were charging private individuals. The Commissioner complained to Senator E. D. Millen, who was a private-enterprise man from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. That Minister, speaking of houses erected by day labour at Bell, referred to the splendid work that had been put into them.",66
410,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Ha d the work turned out as was expected, he would have had justification for his statements, but, on completion, the buildings cost approximately £135 more than they should have cost. Mr Fenton"" - At any rate, according to the Minister's own testimony, the day-labdur system has not had a fair trial, as any jury or Court would say.",67
411,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I told the House last night that I should be pleased if my state- tinue it? ment caused the matter to be threshed out here, so that we .might have a clear understanding of the views of honourable members on the subject.",67
412,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,But the Minister told us that he had discarded the day labour system in favour of the contract system.,67
413,Mr RODGEKS,POLITICAL,"Because 1,400 houses built by day labour were in excess-of the statutory cost, the total expenditure on them being £130,000.",67
414,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,The Public Accounts Committee has taken a great deal of evidence about the administration of the Commission.,67
415,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,It has helped the Department very much.,67
416,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"I do not want it to be thought that I have come to an opinion in matters that have not been fully investigated by the Committee; but I wish to say that the evidence has convinced in a that the day-labour system had not n elm nec, because of the method, or want of method, in the way in which material was sent to the sites on which buildings were to be erected.",67
417,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"Why is Labour opposed to "" labour-only "" contracts, which would test the value of the day-labour system ?",67
418,Mr GABB,POLITICAL,Because they are the application of piece-work.,67
419,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"How is it that the Government does not apply the contract system to its architects, engineers, and publio servants generally? The Public Service is run on the day-labour system; but, if it is fair to apply the contract system to the men who lay bricks, put down flooring, do plastering, and the like, it is fair to apply it to every one else. We should not say to the members of a particular class, ""You are the only persons in the community Who are not prepared to do the fair thing.""",67
420,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I do not say that. . Mr Fenton - Then what influences - caused Ministers to change their policy in this matter? The insurance scheme adopted by the War Serviee Homes Commission is a good one.,67
421,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,I admitted that last night.,67
422,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,Are you going to con,67
423,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,Yes .,67
424,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,Without allowing private companies to come in?,67
425,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,Yes .,67
426,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,I am glad to hear - that. The success of the scheme affords a splendid argument for the Commonwealth taking over the whole insurance business. By doing so it would make a lot of money.,67
427,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"It is the Commonwealth's own property that we are insuring. We cannot compel outside people to have their private properties insured through the Commonwealth; but, with respect to our own properties, the Government can take a risk.",67
428,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"Of course; but if the Government were to announce tomorrow the opening of a fire, marine, and life insurance Department, considerable business would be secured, and very satisfactory 1 profits would accrue from the first year's undertakings.",67
429,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"We would immediately have to set up as competitors, and would have to buy business. Under the War Service Homes scheme we get that insurance business automatically.",67
430,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"There is a lot of other business which the Government would get without risk if they were to enter the insurance business. The Commonwealth Treasury is in urgent need of money today; and there is no reason, seeing that' the Constitution does not prevent it , why an insurance Department should not be inaugurated. It would, injure nobody in particular, and would prove a great boon to the public. I trust that the Government wilj not, for the future, place the whole business of building homes for soldiers into the hands of contractors.",68
431,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"We will tighten up the contract system in regard to time, material, and workmanship, keeping in mind the objective of turning . out soldiers' homes of a first-class character.",68
432,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"The Minister may make the contracts as binding as he likes; and the specifications as clear as possible; but, unless a keen eye is kept upon the contractors themselves in the actual carrying out of the work, the soldiers will get no such homes as the Minister has just pictured.",68
433,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I am not keen on giving a contractor profits. The Department will supply a lot of the .material, and it will be competent for workmen themselves, and for returned soldier builders, to secure contracts. I repeat that the Government will be in aposition to provide the bulk of the material.",68
434,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,That is a fair proposition.,68
435,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"As the honourable member knows, we have huge quantities on hand. We can schedule them at costs which will permit soldier builders and small contractors to secure contracts without requiring to be backed by considerable capital.",68
436,Mr FENTON,POLITICAL,"That sounds well; but I warn the Minister---if he needs to be warned-that the ordinary contractor is always on the lookout for as big a dividend as he can make. There is no need for the middleman in this great public project at all. I might mention that three of the members of the Public Accounts Committee came to certain conclusions, and set them forth in a dissenting report. We did not believe, .either in respect of the softwoods proposition in Queensland or of the hardwoods purchases in Victoria, that private individuals should be allowed to step in. We suggested that the middleman should be cut out altogether. In order to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth, and to save returned soldiers' money, we recommended that the Government should work those timber areas themselves, and cut out the middleman. There is a tendency, and it is a most immoral one, to regard the Government as fair game at all times. Because Government money is to be spent, there are people who are always keenly on the lookout for pickings. A man who would rob the Government of his country is a more despicable thief than a pickpocket. The one merely robs an individual, but the other, who puts his hand into the pockets of the State, robs everybody. An individual who would stoop so low as to filch from a returned soldier is the worse of all kinds of thieves. The day-labour system has not had a fair show. Under proper supervision it can be guaranteed to beat the contracting system every time,'for the reason that it is not looking for profits. The Assistant Minister has stated that houses erected under the day-labour system cost, on an average, £97 each more than .those erected by contract. I do not - think the Minister could have drawn a fair comparison. It is impossible to make a convincing comparison between tha two systems unless the houses have been built in the same locality, upon an exactly similar type of land, with building costs identical, and employing the same material. I wish to know whether the Savings Banks of the various States are now to be invited to come in? There was good reason for the Commonwealth B'ank taking up the building of soldiers' homes. After the Government had decided to hand over the work to the 'Savings Banks of the various States, and when the proposal was first made to the Commissioners of those institutions, the first thing they pointed out was that they would require to be paid certain fees. The reason why the Government broke off negotiations with the State Savings Bank Commissioners in Victoria and New South Wales was that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank pointed out that his institution was operating throughout the Commonwealth, and was prepared to take on the work without requiring any fees to be paid. Sir Denison Miller said, "" All we propose to charge is such sums as may be fairly and .reasonably ""chargeable for our services."" The Government perceived that, by linking up with .the Commonwealth Bank and abandoning negotiations with the 'State Savings Banks, they would be saving some thousands of pounds per annum in fees alone. Now that the Savings Bank Commissioners are to be invited to come in again, it may be presumed that these fees will have to be paid. I am afraid that the Government are likely to be fleeced in future operations, as they have been in the past, by contractors - I say with regret and humiliation that there are contractors who have had the effrontery and the knavery to put bricks into soldiers' homes which could bo crumbled with one's hands, and who have used timber which has not been up to specification.. Such revelations are sufficient to turn one against the contract system for all time. I do not. say, of course, that every contractor has been honest ; but fraudulent practices were covered in contract jobs which were never revealed in houses built under the day labour system. Some contract-built houses, I am bound to say, have been faithfully reared; one can express nothing but praise for the work put into them. But, with respect to the day-labour system, there is no_ inducement to cheat the Government or the soldier, while there is every inducement to put the best material and the finest workmanship into, the job. In certain contract-built houses the soldiers and their dependants have not been in residence for twelve months before the services of plasterers and carpenters have had to be requisitioned. Considering the money involved in the whole gigantic scheme, the men for whom the work is being done, and the financial state of the Commonwealth today, the very closest scrutiny of every penny of expenditure is demanded of the Government. I do not see how the Government and the returned soldier can get full value for their money under the contract system. I admit that the Minister (Mr Rodgers) has put up a good case from his own point of view; but if he intends to rely solely on contractors hie will not achieve the best results for the men who fought for us .and have returned.",68
437,Mr MAKIN,POLITICAL,"Hindmarsh) [10.14] If there is one public Department to which exception can be taken in respect of its administration it is the War Service Homes'branch. Almost from its inauguration there have been evidences of great dissatisfaction because of its incompetence and administrative ineptitude. The experience in South Australia has been such as, I trust, will never he repeated. Early this year I paid special visits oto Melbourne in the effort to secure finality in respect of certain applications which had been in the hands of the Department for many months. Concerning one contract, well nigh two years had passed, and the matter had not even then reached the stage of signing the contract. The scathing ' indictment of the Government's administration of this Department is amply justified and cannot be effectively answered. We have now the spectacle of the Government, who acknowledge their incompetence and admit that they have been on the wrong track, and a further dispolicy is submitted no doubt with the dis- idea of covering up some of their previous mistakes. But, in my opinion, this change will lead to even worse blundering than has happened in the past. These men of business acumen! These heaven-born administrators!",69
438,Mr HILL,POLITICAL,rWher e are they?,69
439,Mr MAKIN,POLITICAL,"Not on the Treasury bench. And the affairs of this country will never be placed on a true business basis and the best interests of the people conserved until the party now in Opposition is intrusted with the responsibility of Government. I have risen mainly to protest against the existing condition of the saw-mills purchased by the Commonwealth Government in Queensland in September last. For the last four or five months these mills have been at a standstill, whilst, all the neighbouring saw-mills have"" been working at their full capacity. I feel sure that had Mr !Lahey continued to be the owner of the saw-mills which the Government purchased from him, they would have been working continuously during the last nine or ten months, and there would have been no unemployment amongst the men engaged in the industry. The Government are indebted to that gentleman to an amount of £243,000 in respect of the areas and. mills purchased from him, and to Mr. Brett to a further amount of £220,000 for certain areas, and plant acquired from him. But for some unexplained reason these enterprises have been closed down for the last four or five months. Much credit is to be given to the Brisbane Daily Standard in drawing public attention to this scandalous state of things. Mr Lahey was asked by a .representative of the Brisbane Daily Standard whether, if those areas had been under his control, they would have been idle, and he replied, ""Certainly not."" As the Government had to complete certain contracts when they took over the mills from Mr. Lahey, it is incumbent upon the Minister to explain why work at those mills has not been proceeding. It is quite evident that the interests of the Commonwealth have been subordinated to private business interests, and the statement made by the Minister (Mr Rodgers) last night that the day-labour system of house construction is to give plaoe to the contract system is evidence of the fact that business interests have made their representations, and their dictation is to be obeyed by the loyal servants who now represent them on the Treasury bench. The statement that the failure of the day-labour system is sponsible for this complete change of policy is a mean and paltry excuse. It appears to be the policy of the Government to, at all times, disparage the working man, and throw upon his shoulders 'the responsibility for any blunders in public Departments. The working men will amply - justify their part in this scheme, but it will be difficult for the Government to defend theirs. Their change of policy is evidence that the Government desire to conserve, not so much the interests of the soldiers and the people generally, but rather the interests of private enterprise. They have again shown their incompetence, and that they have not sufficient acumen to control the destinies of the Commonwealth - and promote the best interests of its citizens.",69
440,Mr CAMERON,POLITICAL,"Brisbane) [10.23] During the time. I have been a member of this House no Government activity has been more frequently debated than that of repatriation in all its phases, including War Service Homes, land settlement, and so forth. I have always held the opinion that the petty activities of party politics should find no place in a debate relating to the welfare of the returned soldiers, and I feel sure that that opinion would be endorsed unanimously by the House and the country. I awaited anxiously the statement made by the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) last night, and I now feel confident that better times are in store for soldiers requiring homes. The Minister stated quite clearly what the future programme of the Government will be. I remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin), that in regard to repatriation there were no blazed trails and no precedents. That is a fact we should not overlook. Experiments had to be made, and mistakes were also made. There have been deplorable instances of bungling in carrying into effect the efforts of a grateful nation on behalf of its sons who served overseas and their dependants. As other honourable members desire to take part in the debate I will not detain the House, beyond endorsing the remarks of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) in regard to land settlement. I wish to impress upon the Government that it is just as necessary that an investigation should be held into soldier settlements as it was that the work of the War re- Service Homes Commission should be inquired into. There is no doubt that whilst there have been successes in some soldier settlements, there have been also failures and a great deal of disappointment, and I trust that the Government will take the earliest opportunity of consulting with the various State Governments to see if anything can be done to improve the conditions of soldier settlers.",70
441,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,"Barker) [10.27] Whatever else we may do, we may very well congratulate the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) upon all that he has done for soldiers since the outbreak of war. There is not a hamlet in the whole of his district in which he has not formed a committee and established a fund for the benefit of local soldiers on their return from the Front. I do not think that any country has ever done so much for its soldiers as has Australia. In regard to a large, undertaking like the War Servioe Homes, if some mistake had not beenmade it would have been strange. good many mistakes have been made, but it' is better to make mistakes than not to try at all. I have yet to meet the man who makesLno mistakes. I have a little faul t to find with the Department in regard to the making of 'valuations. Local Committees have been appointed in all towns, but their valuations have been absolutely ignored. I heard one honourable member say that it was difficult to trust them. But, if the Local Committees cannot be trusted, I do not know who can. There are District Committees throughout South Australia whose ex-' perience and knowledge are available to the Department, and I am sorry that their assistance is not availed of as it should be. I hope that in future the District Committees will be asked for their valuations of land. Fortunately, in my own district, the valuations of cottages have been 'all right, and, in some cases, the committee have recommended the purchase of estates that were both good and cheap. People do not want to make money out of the soldiers. I would not like to see any man in my district try to make money out of any scheme for the assistance of the soldiers.",70
442,Dr MALONEV,POLITICAL,There are plenty or parasites in the big cities.,71
443,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,"I do not know anything about them, but we should endeavour to train the rising generation to leave the cities. Provide roads, telephonic communication, and other facilities, and the people will go into the country.",71

445,Mr LIVINGSTON,POLITICAL,"We have already cut up very many of the large estates fchafc district, and it is capable of absorbthough ing many more settlers. There is plenty"" of land in the country districts of tralia, and it is idle to talk about half acre of land being sufficient settlement of a soldier. Personally I would not have any house buil t of less than an acre or two acres in extent. Honourable members, instead .of squabbling and fighting for the Treasury benches, ought to be uniting their in the great work we have undertaken. We have a territory, possibly the finest within the Empire, unI peopled simply for the lack of a honourable member. few hundred miles of railway. Turning A to another phase of the question, I do not see why a soldier should not be able to buy his own house if he desires to, and I believe he could do so much more cheaply than by waiting u n t i l , perhaps, a larger hojise is built for him. I congratulate the Assistant Minister on the stand he has taken in regard to the contract system, because it is eminently desirable that the soldier should know exactly how much he has to pay. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton), who is an honest and reliable man, has told us that in the case of houses built under the contract system he has known the bricks used to crumble in the hand, and that, of course, is extremely unfair to the soldier. I am certain that if such a thing occurred, the Assistant Minister did not know of it or he would have quickly put things right. The honourable gentleman is very much in earnest in his work, and is visiting all the States with a view to seeing that the fair thing is done. We are all extremely, proud - of our soldiers for paying up as fchey are doing for their homes; and my opinion is fchafc, long before the time has expired, no money will be owing. In any case, if the soldiers do get backward in their payments, I hope they will not be harassed in any way, for they cannot run away with the land, and even if they do not pay for it , they will improve it and prove themselves valuable citizens. Theyought to.be helped in every possible way. and so long as they continue to live on the land, they ought not to be interfered with.  «[10.35] - I wish to give my impression of the speech which the Assistant Minisi n ter (Mr Rodgers) made last night, it is hard fco understand it from the. point of view of a, Ministerial stateAusment. It was from beginning to end a an condemnation of the work-of the Minister for the associated with him.",71
446,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,That is a most unfair on land and . unwarranted statement!  honourable gentleman reads his own speech he will see that what I say is a fair in efforts terpretation of it .,71
447,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I have re-read my statement as a matter of obligation, and take exception to that remark of the  orable gentleman said that the administration had been faulty and inexcusable; and whose administation is it but that of the Minister associated' with him ?",71
448,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"I think that is an unfair statement, and I ask the honourable member not to repeat it .  orable gentleman may make his speech over again if he chooses;-I am now referrin g to what he said last night; and there is no doubt that his words were a condemnation of the administration of this Department. I know of only two Ministers associated with the Department during the period over which his remarks had reference, and those are the Minister in another place and himself. That was the impression on my mind, and I regarded it as a kind of speech which can only be criticised as a candid statement of one who found the administration faulty, and ' ' stood up "" to the fact. But what I complain of is that the Assistant Minister tried to r i d himself of responsibilities by throwing the blame for the bungling on a system which he described as the day-labour system. It is characteristic of some Governments, when they find themselves in a position of this kind, to blame their opponents; and we of the Labour party often find people attempting to throw responsibilities for their own wrong-doing on this side of the House. - The Assistant Minister complained of the day-labour system, but I may tell him that his remarks were diametrically opposed to those made by the Minister, Senator E . D . Millen himself at the opening of the cottages in the Coburg district. I happen to have with me the copy of the A r a m , in which there is a report of the remarks of Senator E . D . Millen, who contrasted the day-labour system with the contract system; and I wish to put those remarks on record as an arswer to those made by .the Assistant Minister last night. According to the ArgusReferring to the system' of day labour as against contract labour, Senator Millen said that he had always been - against day labour, and when the Commonwealth scheme was launched the one idea was that the contract system should be adopted. The contractors, however; were not willing to tender within the price fixed by the Act, and the Commission undertook the work. The average eost of the cottages' at Bell was £695 l is . 5d. each, including the land. Originally tenders were called fbr the erection of the homes, and the prices offered ranged from £720' to £900, exclusive of the cost of the land. The actual cost of the. homes included land, fencing, reticulation, wiring, and the provision of ail necessary accessories. The frontages were from 46 to 69 feet, with an average depth of 111 feet, and the soldiers who were fortunate enough to take possession. would pay a rent up to 18s. 6d. weekly, including Hates and insurance.",72
449,Mr JOWETT,POLITICAL,"Where are those houses situated 1  statement was made at the opening of the cottages at Bell, to which the honourable member for Grampians and other honourable .members were invited. It is a - complete answer to the statement made by the Assistant Minister when he endeavoured to throw the responsibility for the shortcomings of his Department on to the day-labour system. The correct thing for the Assistant Minister to do would be to accept the responsibility for the bungling that has been going on. He could not say that a Labour Government was to blame, and so he sought to prove that the difficulty had arisen in consequence of effect being given to one of the planks of the platform of the Labour party. As a rule the Assistant Minister is very fair, but in his speech last night he blamed the system,, which was unjust. The Minister for Repatriation, in the speech which I quoted, proves conclusively that the statement made by the Assistant Minister last night was incorrect.",72
450,Mr RODGERS,POLITICAL,"The Minister for Repatriation used figures supplied to him . The weakening came in January, when the completed cost was £ 8 3 5 .  figures I have quoted were for completed cottages,.'including the land. It is only fair to compare completed cottages, in cluding land. Those constructed under - the contract system did not include the land, and showed a margin of £200 in favour of the day-labour system.",72
451,Mr ERANCIS,POLITICAL,"He n t y ) [10.43] - It is very gratifying to have a statement from the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) concerning the administration of the Department. The statements I made, when. Parliament first assembled, have proved to be correct, as the costs have proved to be much higher than were anticipated. Since then the Government have increased the amount from £700 to £800, and even now it has been found very difficult to proceed as we desire. The conditions which have prevailed recently have hampered the Department to a great extent; but notwithstanding the difficulties, I believe the Department could have rendered better service. As a result of the unusual circumstances, many honourable members have been placed in a difficult position in endeavouring to make a satisfactory explanation to their constituents. The Assistant Minister has said that it is now considered necessary to call in.the assistance of outsiders in order to place the work of the Department on a sound basis. So far as my experience goes, I believe that the rank and file of the Department have rendered good servioe, all of them earnestly desiring to assist those with whom they fought on the other side of the world. are houses in my district that have taken twelve months to construct, and if soldiers have to wait for an unreasonable time before their requests are complied with, dissatisfaction will continue. introduction of the contract system may be a means of expediting the work, but I cannot understand why the Department decline to purchase' unoccupied houses already constructed-that is, if they have been buil t by reputable contractors. Financial institutions are prepared to operate on this basis, and the Department should institute a method of purchasing on a similar system, provided that the houses are valued by experts. I do not agree with the Assistant Minister when he says that houses can be built cheaper under the contract system, because dwellings built under the day labour system, if properly supervised, 'are better than those built by contract. As I understand the Government wish to bring forward new business, I shall not discuss the general administration of the Department f u r the r ; but I trust the new programme will prove of benefit to the large number of men who are still waiting for homes. Question resolved in the affirmative. ' POST ANDTELEGRAPHBIL L Motion (by Mr Wise ) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill an Act to: amend the Post, and Telegraph JflOJ-lfllG. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",72
452,Mr WISE,POLITICAL," I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill to make two amendments in section 18 of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901-16. Section 17 of the principal Act provides thatThe principal railway official of every State, or the owner, controller or manager of any railway or tramway in any State, shall carry mails on any train run upon the railways or tramways' under his control if required by the Postmoster-Ueneral so to do, and shall provide all usual facilities for the receipt, carriage and delivery of all mails that he is required to carry. Section 18 provides thatThere The Postmaster-General shall pay to the principal railway ofticial of each State, or to the owner, controller or manager of any railway or tramway in any State, as the ease may be, sueh annual sum for the receipt, carriage and delivery of mails and for all facilities proThe vided in connection therewith as may be agreed upon and in default of agreement as may be settled by arbitration . . . Unfortunately, that provision does not lay down the basis upon which payment is to be made. Prior to Federation both Departments were controlled by the States, and it was merely a case of taking the money out .of one pocket and putting it into the other, and, therefore, the amount debited to the Post Office by the Railways for the carriage of mails was upon a purely arbitrary basis. No particular care was taken in determining the amount that should actually be so debited. W it h the inauguration of Federation it was agreed that the amount to be paid the State Railway Departments should be equal to the total amount that had been paid by the individual States. Between 1901 and 1907, the Railways pressed for increased payment for carriage of mails, but their requests were not based on any evidence of cost of service, and the Postal Department strongly resisted their demands. In 1907, however, as the result of a conference between the parties, it was agreed that the Post Office should make payment of a lump sum of (1921). £275,000 per annum for conveyance of mails by railway. The Railway authorifor ties were empowered to devise a scale l Act which would apportion this £275,000 between the States in about the proportion which each State had received of the original £234,000. The apportionment was on a line-mileage scale. In 1908, an agreement was entered into to cover a period of eight years, payment to be computed on the scale to which I have referred. That agreement terminated in 1916. A conference was then held between the Railway authorities and the Postmaster-General, with a view to the preparation of a fresh arrangement. Agreement was reached on practically all the points at issue except the rate of payment. The Railways insisted that in any negotiation the amount then paid should be taken as the minimum basis. The Postal Department, however, contended that the then existing rate was excessive. Failing agreement the matter was submitted to arbitration under section 18 of the Post and Telegraph Act, and it was mutually agreed that the Inter-State Commission should act as arbitrator. The Department contended before the Commission that payment for carriage of mails should be in relation to cost of service. The Commission, in a majority report, awarded that the annual sum to be paid by the Postmaster-General to the principal railway official in each State should be. 50 per cent, of the scheduled State railway rates for parcels, intra and Inter-State, in force on 1st January, 1917. In other words, it was decided that the highest rate for the carriage of goods by the Railway Departments should be adopted. The reason why 50 per cent, of the rates was fixed upon was that, in handling parcels, the railways were involved in services such as booking, & c , which did not apply to-mails. The award was made binding for only one year. The Chief Commissioner, in a minority report, disagreed with this finding, contending that the payment to the railways should represent the amount incurred in giving the service. He concluded his finding, as follows(1) The State Governments would be acting in contravention of law iF they taxed the mails by classifying them as commodities in their schedules of railway rates. (2) That the Arbitrators ought not to directly for the States what it would be illegal for the States to do directly. (3) That it was contemplated by Parliament that the State railways should perform witli the Federal Post Office the joint service of mail carriage on the basis of being recouped for expense. W --. Wise. (4) That the only evidence before the Arbitrators by whichthey can evaluate the expense of carrying the mails is that of the ton-mile cost on all traffic, which must therefore be taken as a basis. I u order to determine the amount of payment to be made to the Railway Departments in accordance with the award, the weights of mails consigned by rail were taken in March, 1918. On tliese weights, payment was computed at the rate of £184,296 per annum. The State Railways were paid at this rate from 1st January, 1917, to 31st .December, 1920, plus £7,500 per annum, for conveyance of second class overseas mail matter. In October, 1.920, the mails were again weighed. The weights taken, computed at half parcels rates operating on 1st January, 1917, would involve payment at the rate of £230,683 per annum, an in crease of £46,387 per annum. The railways declined to accept payment as from 1st January, 1921, on the basis of the parcels rate3 operating on 1st January, 1917, demanding that it should be computed on the parcels rates operating on 1st January last. If payment were so made, on the weighings of October, 1920, an amount of £352,956 per annum would be involved - The Postal Department, therefore, would have to pay £168,660 ' per annum more than the amount determined under the award-a n increase of approximately 91 per cent. In addition to that, we would be at the entire mercy of the Railway Departments of the various States, since they could determine from time to time what increase in their railway charges should be made. It is not possible for a mutual agreement to be arrived at, and it is necessary, therefore, to go to arbitration again. In order that there may be laid down a basis upon which the arbitrators shall act, we propose to amend section 18 of the principal Act by omitting therefrom the words "" the receipt, carriage, and delivery of mails, and for all facilities provided in connection therewith,"" and inserting in their stead the words "" rendering any service required in pursuance of the last preceding section."" do inI t is also proposed to insert after the word "" arbitration "" in section 18 the words ' ' on the - basis of the actual expense estimated to have been incurred in rendering such service."" I hope the motion will be agreed to. Mt. OHABXTON (Hunter) [10.59] This is a very necessary measure. We have beeu paying large sums to the State Railway Departments for the carriage of our mail-matter, and this Bill merely proposes to amend the principal Act in order that a definite _ basis may be laid down for the guidance of the arbitrators. I know of no better way of settling a dispute between the States and the Commonwealth than by referenoe to arbitration, and, that being eo, I shall not discuss the question further.",73
453,Mr GEEGOEY,POLITICAL,"Dampier) [11.0] Although I am pleased to' facilitate the passage of a Bill of this character, it seems rather strange that the Postmaster General should be prepared to submit the question of what the Government should pay for the carriage of its mails to arbitration, but at the same time desire to lay down the conditions under which the arbitrators shall bring in their, verdict.",75

455,Mr GREGORY,POLITICAL,"The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) speaking the other night advocated the charging of a profit of 20 per cent, on importa- resolution. tions; but are we to understand that the States are to be reimbursed only the actual expenditure that they incur in the carriage of mails, and are to be allowed no profit?
