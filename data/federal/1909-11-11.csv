The communication which I received was accompanied by the followForbidding money order and postal correspondence for H. Sinclair 6r> Co., Sydney. The Postmaster-General of the Dominion of Zealand having reasonable ground for supposing that the firm whose name and address are in the schedule hereunder is engaged in advertising the treatment of diseases of the sexual organs, it is hereby ordered, under sec28 of the "" Post and Telegraph Act 1908,"" no money order in favour of the said firm be issued, and. that no postal packet addressed to the said firm (either by its own or any fictitious or assumed name), or to such address without a name, shall be either registered, or delivered by the Post Office of New Zealand.

Has the Postmaster-General any knowreturn, ledge of the firm which is referred to, will he, in any case, cause inquiry to made as to whether its correspondence should be transmitted by his Department?",16
34,Sir JOHN QUICK,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"I have no ledge that the firm in question is engaged in a nefarious business, but I am aware that the New Zealand legislation the Postmaster-General of the Dominion to prohibit the transmission of postal matter connected with the treatment of certain diseases. No such legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth.",17
35,Dr LIDDELL,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,We ought to have it.,17
36,Sir JOHN QUICK,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"The New Zealand and, law was brought under my notice and I wrote a minute directing the attention of the Secretary of the Department it, and requesting him to prepare a draft measure which would enable this Parliament ment to consider similar legislation at the first available opportunity.",17
37,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"For some subscribers time past the Department of the Postfered master-General has been reducing the status of official post and telegraph country districts to that of semi-official offices, without giving the public any notice of the intended changes. Will the Postdeal master-General promise that in future public shall have such notice? Will he say what rule the Department follows the matter, and when an office is considered to be not sufficiently important to be called official ?",17
38,Sir JOHN QUICK,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"The Deputy sideration. Postmasters-General have power to deal with the grading of minor offices, and public are informed of alterations by vertisement in the Gazette. I myself frequently heard of contemplated changes only from honourable members. When a change is seriously objected to, and_ matter is brought under my notice, it is generally suspended.",17
39,Mr JOHN THOMSON,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"Following is up the question I put to the Postmasterthe General, and his reply that he was aware that certain offices had been graded and reduced until he saw the noticentres ? fication in the Commonwealth Gazette, _ 1 should like to ask him whether he will arrange to give honourable members an earlier opportunity of obtaining such formation. The regrading is based, understand, on the revenue which each tion. office produces. Will the honourable gentleman, in accordance with a promise that he made some time ago, have the annual the last issue of which was for and 1907, brought up to date, so that honorbe able members may know what offices are likely to be regraded, and will have an opportunity to take whatever steps they knowdesire in regard to the matter.",17

41,Mr ROBERTS,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"Has the Postmaster General yet obtained from his officers a report respecting a number of telephone subscribers to the Adelaide Exchange who have to pay a higher rate than do sub-' scribers to a similar system in other States, if so, has he yet decided that the into-day, justice shall be removed?",17

44,Sir JOHN QUICK,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"It would be most unfair and impolitic, on public grounds, to in a piecemeal manner with the telethe phone rates; and that is what I meant by the use of the word "" partial."""" I cannot in pick out one group of subscribers and say that I will redress their grievances in regard to rates, without also redressing the grievances of others who may require con",17
45,Mr ROBERTS,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"Apparentl y I did not the make my question clear. The position is adthat at present partial treatment is meted have out to subscribers in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne to such an extent that subscribers in Adelaide are subjected to very the great injustice. I am not asking for partial or piecemeal treatment, but, seeing that a comparatively small amount of money involved, merely desire to know whether Postmaster-General will place the Adenot laide subscribers on precisely the same refooting as the subscribers in other large",17
46,Sir JOHN QUICK,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"I cannot possibly undertake to deal with the telephone rates until I have received the report of the exinperts appointed to inquire and advise the I Postmaster-General on this important ques attention of the Postmaster-General to certain facts, and to ask him a question with reference to them. I understand that at a place called William Creek, in the Northern District of South Australia, the postal service is conducted in a raihvay building, and that for some time considerable friction has existed between the stationmaster and the postmaster. So intense has the feeling become that the State Railway Commissioner has, I understand, on several occasions asked the Commonwealth to provide a separate office for its own officer, hut up to the present that request has been refused.' I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will obtain the papers, and see whether something can be done to remove the unpleasantness ?",17
47,Sir JOHN QUICK,PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENCE,"I shall be pleased to accept the honourable member's suggestion, obtain the papers, inquire into the matter, and inform the House of the result of my investigation. NA ACCEPTANCE BILL.",18
48,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I notice that the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill is thirteenth on the list of Government business on the notice-paper, and I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will ask the House to proceed with that Bill immediately after the Constitution Alteration {Finance) Bill has been disposed of.",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have already in- formed the honourable member for Grey that if we can arrive at an understanding to deal in one sitting with the two or three important issues still outstanding, challenged by amendments of which notice has already been given, I shall be glad to fix a date for the further consideration of the , Bill. The order in which the Bill appears on the notice-paper will not prevent that being done.  Prime Minister whether it was not under-stood that we should proceed with the further consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill immediately after the Constitution Alteration (finance) Bill had been dealt with?",18
50,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The reply I have just given to the honourable member for Boothby is in no way a qualification of my previous statement that I was prepared to arrange a date on which the further consideration of the Bill should be proceeded with. It is necessary to make arrangements with those who have already given notice of amendments, and who might object if the Bill were taken without sufficient notice. Subject to their convenience, and to the further consideration of the Bill being disposed of in one sitting, I am prepared to fix a date.",18
51,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,After the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill has been disposed of?,18
52,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Unde r the conditions I have named.,18
53,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No such conditions were imposed when the matter was mentioned on a previous occasion.,18
54,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is in error. On two or tliree occasions, I have expressed the opinion that we can not afford time this session to bring on the Bill merely on the chance of being able to dispose of it. I asked that arrangements should be made to enable the crucial amendments to be dealt with at one sitting. We should then be able to send on the Bill to another place without delay.  Prime Minister to say whether it is not a fact that I reported to him that the Leader of the Opposition would offer no objection to the Bill being taken immediately after the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill had been dealt with; secondly, whether I did not advise him that the only amendments of which I had any knowledge were those of which notice had been given; ancl, thirdly, whether he expects me now to go round the House and to ascertain what honourable members intend to offer opposition to the Bill before he will consent to bring it on again?",18
55,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the first two questions put by the honourable member is ""Yes."" As to the third, I do not expect him to do anything of the kind. I thought I had made it perfectly clear that all I desired.was to abbreviate the discussion. I did not ask t h i honourable member to do what he suggests. He may or may not, as he thinks fit, take that action. We shall endeavour to obtain the information to which he refers. My undertaking was that as soon as we sa ,v a prospect of having the Bill dealt with promptly, we should bring it on again. POLICE : KING'S MEDAL FOR BRAVERY. Mr CROUCH' - Amongs t the cable messages published, in yesterday's newspapers was one to the effect that the King's medal for bravery on the part of the police was to be granted to certain selected applicants. I had some correspondence with the Prime Minister in regard to the question about three months ago, and I should like to know whether the names of those selected in Australia for this distinction are known to him or were recommended"" by him ?",18
56,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , but they may be known to the State Governments since the police. are under their control. After the honourable member called attention to the matter I communicated with the Colonial Office, but so far as I am aware have not yet received a reply. ELECTIVE MINISTRIES: REFERENDUM.",19
57,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In view of the widespread importance of the question of Elective Ministries, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government are prepared to give the electors an opportunity to express their opinion with regard to it?",19
58,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member suggests that a referendum should be taken on the question of Commonwealth Elective Ministries. That could be arranged only by a Bill providing for an alteration of the Constitution, which would have to be passed by both Houses, and tions are:would be debated at length.",19
59,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We are nearly unanimous on the point.,19
60,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I doubt it. NA WARSHIPS.,19
61,Mr THOMAS BROWN,NAMES FOR AUSTRALIAN,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence whether the torpedo boat destroyers that are now being built to the order of the Commonwealth have yet reached the christening stage, and if so whether he has discovered suitable names for them. I desire further to ask whether it is a fact that they are to be named after notable members of the Liberal Reform movement, and, if not, whether he will consider the advisableness of making a selection from euphonious aboriginal names?",19
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NAMES FOR AUSTRALIAN,"It is a fact that we shall require names shortly for these vessels. They are nearing the christening stage, but I have not yet been able to discover names for them. I shall be much obliged for any suggestion that may be offered, provided that the name proposed is pronounceable.",19
63,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NAMES FOR AUSTRALIAN,"Following up the reply just made by the Minister of Defence, I would direct his attention to the fact that there is a very euphonious native name-""Mudgee""-and I would ask him to consider the advisableness of applying it to one of the new vessels. PORTUGUESE COCOA: IMPORTS. '",19
64,Mr CROUCH,NAMES FOR AUSTRALIAN,"the Prime Minister, upon noticex. What quantity of cocoa was imported from, the United States of America and from Portuguese countries last year? 2. Is he aware that Cadbury and Co., and other reputable English manufacturers, now refuse to use Portuguese-grown cocoa because their investigations show it to be grown by labour working under slave conditions? 3. Has his attention been drawn to the fact [Times weekly edition, 17th September, 1909, page 599) that this slave-grown and rejectedcocoa is now taken almost entirely by cocoa manufacturers of the United States of America, whose consequentially cheaper production is largely affecting the British sale of manufactured cocoas? 4. Can these American cocoas be discriminatedagainst ? 5. Can they be regarded as prohibited imports under section 52 (d) Customs Act 1901 as ""goods produced wholly or in part by prison labour""?",19

66,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay) [3.35]-are in the unfortunate position that, although there has been considerable discussion on the main principles of the Bill, very little time, indeed, has been available for the discussion of the principles involved in the details of the measure; and, undoubtedly, much has been overlooked that might profitably have, been considered at greater length. I do not propose to enter into the difference of opinion amongst legal and constitutional authorities as to the drafting and meaning of the various clauses, but no doubt considerable difference of opinion prevails, which ought to have been cleared up before we arrived at the report stage. However, I have another object in rising. We ought to embrace every opportunity to discuss the important effects of this Bill, so that, not only Nil. Nil. Parliament, but the people outside, may acquire as much knowledge of what we propose as is possible under the circumstances. I cannot commend the Prime Minister and the Government for the way in which they have proceeded with this measure. The West Africa. Prime Minister and the Chairman of Committees know that there is an absolute maCountry of jority against the proposal of the GovernShipment Origin. ment; and as the welfare of Australia is involved, I propose, for the purpose of lbs.

Those four honourable members are the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who is ill and not paired; the honourable member for South Sydney, who, I admit, is away on private business; the Chairman of Committees, and you yourself, Mr Speaker, who, following the custom of your office, did not vote. I claim that at least two of the absentees, have absolutely declared, and would have voted, for the amendment of the honourable member for Mernda. I cannot speak for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, but it has been publicly announced that he would not have supported the Government proposal, though he declined to pair against the Government because of his personal relations with the Prime Minister. Of course, your own position, Mr Speaker, ought not to be canvassed ; and, therefore, I do not further refer to it. What I say is that, although this Bill has, by the barest of bare majorities, reached the report stage, the Government would not have a majority if the full number of representatives of the people in this House had voted.",20
67,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And four honourable members who voted for the Government ""went back"" on their expressed convictions.",21
68,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall not discuss that matter now; those honourable members have voted, ancl I presume they have done so in accordance with their later convictions.",21
69,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And after deliberation.,21
70,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A f t e r deliberation, a great deal of persuasion. Parliament for the first time, and I have no need to ask what has taken place ; any one could see with a blind eye the amount of attention that was paid to certain honourable members who wished to vote according to their previously expressed convictions, but who were swayed by the eloquence of their immediate political and other friends to act differently. It would be interesting to know the mind of the Government in a matter of such momentous importance, seeing that, with all the influence and weight they could bring to bear, and after tremendous exertion, they have been able to carry their proposal only by the barest of majorities. What do the Government really think of the position? opinion, they have gone as nearly as possible to a violation of the first principles of ' good government. Members should have voted, not reluctantly, but cheerfully and willingly, for the referendum, without any doubt as to the proposition to. be submitted to the people. How can we expect the people to understand the question and give an intelligent verdict, when honourable members in this House are almost equally divided ?",21
71,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is how the country will be-equall y divided.,21
72,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be; but the honourable member can see what I am aiming at. The people cannot possibly be so well informed on the subject as we are; and,' even here, where we have all the influence of the Government, all the eloquence of the Prime Minister, and all the ties of party allegiance, only a bare majority has enabled the Bill to reach the report stage. I therefore ask whether the Government feel justified in going on with the measure? Of course, if the Government go to the country on the question, without submitting a referendum to the people, they will have all the case they could desire for a return of Government supporters who believe 'in the principle whicK has been enunciated. In the meantime we should have a platform campaign on political lines, which w^ould educate the people, and at the second election they would undoubtedly be surer of their own views on the question, and able to give a more intelligent verdict than would be possible in present circumstances. By adopting that course the Government would be in the position of having endeavoured to carry out their agreement with the Premiers. No Premier and can complain of what the Prime Minister I am not in has done to try to carry the agreement through. Indeed, the honourable gentleman has done more than carry out his promise to advise Parliament to pass it. He has done everything that one man could do, and has used his persuasive powers as he alone can use them, to obtain the very small majority which he has succeeded in obtaining. I am dead against the principle of the Bill , which is wrong, and wiH be mischievous. If the appeal to the country is successful, and the principle is embodied in the Constitution, it will mean binding the intelligence of the people of Australia for years, if not for generations, by the dead hand of this year and next year. In my",21
73,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is .the first step in the direction of unification.,21
74,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That interjection is rather enigmatical, but I believe the honourable member has in his mind the idea that if the agreement is embodied in the Constitution there will arise in Australia .a young militant and determined party which will sweep away all such stumbling ""blocks in the way of true national progress. ""This determination to secure for the States rights which are not good for them, will not assist them in any way, but will ultimately react against their interests, and. as the honourable member for Robertson ""indicates, help largely to increase that .tion of the people who 'believe that we - should have, a National Parliament with much greater powers, and State Parliaments with greatly diminished powers. I said last night that I am not a unificationist. I believe in the Federal principle, but it is well to remember that experience is likely to tend all in one way. That is to say, every question that becomes of national importance, and has a national scope, is likely to be transferred to the National Parliament."" Let me illustrate. ""The present deplorable struggle between the employers and employees in the New-castle district of New South Wales shows that the State industrial machinery has absolutely broken down, and the effect will probably be, not only an industrial - disturbance in a local centre in one State, but a dislocation of the whole - of the industrial and commercial life - of the Commonwealth. In contradistinction to that, let me refer to the great struggle of the shearers and rouseabouts with the Australian pastoralists. That was settled only because we had a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act that enabled the whole of the industrial workers concerned to get a verdict under a Commonwealth law. In consequence, that industry has since then proceeded in peace and quietness for nearly five years. That is what I mean by larger powers which have a national effect, and are a national necessity. While the States - should continue to possess the powers necessary to carry on their own self-government, wherever larger powers can be given to this Parliament for the national advantage the people of the Commonwealth will not hesitate to invest this Parliament with them. I hold, however, another view regarding State Rights and functions and the scope of State effort*. I believe that the States, as at present delimited, will not continue for a great length of time, but that New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, instead of being managed as they are at present by one local Parliament from a capital in one corner, will be split up into smaller States each with its own local Parliament.",22
75,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the honourable member is a unificationist, because that is what the unificationists propose.",22
76,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not understand the interjection. It is just as difficult for the Queensland Parliament, sitting at the secsouthern end of the State, to manage the northern part of ""Queensland as it would be for the Federal Parliament to manage it from Melbourne.",22
77,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The State must be cut up.,22
78,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When one leaves Melbourne and reaches Brisbane, he is practically only half-way to Cairns, which is still considerably south of the most northern part of Queensland, and the means of communication as one goes further north from Brisbane are less, effective than between Brisbane, and Melbourne. So far from being a unificationist from that point of view, I think there should be a larger number of. local Governments capable, of transacting the immediate local business, which would be completely under their control, while all large national questions should be left to the Federal Parliament. That could be brought about cheaply and expeditiously. I differ from many of my, friends who want to reduce the Sta.te Parliaments' to the status of glorified municipal councils, exercising only limited local powers. T think the State Parliaments can possess legislative powers- I should prefer them to consist of one House each-and be capable of performing their duties expeditiously at a reasonable cost, within their own ambits.",22
79,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When we have more Federation we shall hear less of "" Socialism in our time.''",22
80,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,""" Socialism in our time "" means better methods of governing the people and enabling those who produce the wealth of a country to get a greater share of it. The creation of a number of smaller States out of the present' large ones, each with a local Parliament dealing effectively with local affairs, and the investment of this Parliament with larger national powers- a policy with which the honourable member for Robertson evidently agreeswould help to a greater distribution of wealth. I am not afraid of a National Parliament such as this becoming an aggressive institution that would protect monopolies and destroy the interests of the worker. I think the Federal Parliament, founded as it is on a broad franchise, is capable of doing justice to all. It is still hampered by many of its Constitutional limitations, and my objection to this Bill is that, if given effect to, it will hamper it more than ever. One would have expected from the Prime Minister and the Government a broadening rather than a narrowing of the national powers. From his speeches, and some of his actions, the Prime Minister might well have been expected to proclaim to the people that this Parliament could be trusted to do justice in every instance; but this Bill declares in effect that it cannot be trusted with financial affairs, and that its probity cannot be guaranteed to the States. He and his Government are prepared to lay down definitely in the Constitut on : what the Federal Parliament must do, and to cripple it in order to secure to the States rights which up to the present they have not possessed. In that way the honourable gentleman is doing a great injustice to the Parliament and people of the Commonwealth. Any one who takes the trouble to look into the matter must arrive at the conclusion that the people of Australia cannot benefit from the proposed financial arrangement, unless the Commonwealth takes control of the public indebtedness. The weakest feature of this measure is that it does not assist in bringing that about. Instead of helping the transfer of the debts from the States to the Commonwealth, it hinders it. It provides for an annual per capita payment of 25s. from the Commonwealth to the States, and leaves the transfer of the debts to be further investigated. The States, being sure of the payment from the Commonwealth, need not, and will not, be anxious to transfer their debts. It is true that there if. A Bill now at its third-reading stage for an amendment of the Constitution, to enable this Parliament to take control of the whole of the debts of the States when it - chooses to do so. But it is possible that the people may agree to the amendment relating to the payment from the Commonwealth to 'the States, and may refuse to agree to the amendment relating to the State debts. I think that the Prime Minister should have first referred the State debts question to the people. Had they approved of the proposed alteration, we could have proceeded with greater safety in regard to the allocation of the revenue. I am more convinced than ever that the last clause of the Bill will really make the Commonwealth merely the agent of the States in regard to transactions connected with the debts. Although the Commonwealth may pay the interest and the principal of the State debts, a Commonwealth stock which will' be to its advantage cannot be created. Those who drafted the Constitution, and those who approved of it , no doubt thought previous that during the first or second session of this Parliament the State debts would be transferred to the Commonwealth, and that a Commonwealth stock would be created, any accruing benefit due to a reduction of interest going to the Commonwealth. That was the view taken by many of us who advocated the acceptance of the draft Constitution in Queensland, where it was not popular, and it was the view of those who voted for it in that State. Had not the people thought that the Commonwealth would take over and manage the State indebtedness, and thereby make a profit, they would not have supported Federation as they did. Now it is proposed to put that out of the power of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, to do so will destroy the in.fluence of the Federation. Apparently, there are still to be six borrowing States. Even when a State borrows through the Commonwealth, its loans will be placed on the money market as specifically intended for their purposes, and credited and debited according to the terms on which they are floated, while if the Commonwealth requires money for its own purposes, it must borrow it in its own name. The Attorney General said 'this morning that a mare's nest had been discovered, and that the objections which were then raised do not entirely apply; but he did not completely set aside my position. The Prime Minister freely admits that the Commonwealth will have to continue to pay 25s. per capita to the States after it has paid off the whole .of the debts, principal and interest. But no provision is made for a sinking fund. The Government have not explained this omission. No doubt Ministers do not consider an explanation necessary. They are content to allow this matter to go through without placing their views on questions of detail before the House. That is not a creditable way to'act; but it is their method, and we must submit to it so long as they continue in office. I hold that the Commonwealth should be empowered to take over the whole of the public indebtedness of Australia, to constitute an Australian stock by the conversion and renewal of old loans and the issue of new, and that the States should have absolute freedom in respect to borrowing, subject to the control of an advisory Board established by the Commonwealth.",22
81,Mr CARE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No provision is made for that.,24
82,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would be easy to appoint Treasury Commissioners, and I am sure that the State Governments would readily avail themselves of the advice which could be obtained from them. Directly the Commonwealth credit becomes better than the best State credit, the electors will demand that the public borrowing shall be done by the Commonwealth. In my opinion this is most desirable, but the Bill makes no provision for it, and the Government have not shown that it is provided for. It is pitiful that we should ask for larger powers regarding the taking over of the debts, and yet be limited in the way I am speaking of. No doubt it is useless to debate the matter now, because honourable members, having discovered that the numbers are up, have ceased to take a serious interest in the Bill, which they regard as practically passed. If this were an ordinary measure, it could be amended by a subsequent one, but an amendment of the Constitution can be secured only by the vote of a majority of the people and of a majority of the States. While at a particular time it may be easy to get the electors to take a particular course, it may not be easy to subsequently get another amendment carried. As I have already said, if five out of six of the electors wished for an amendment of the Constitution, they could be foiled by the action of the minority. Even the mitted eloquence of the Prime Minister will not enable him to explain away that difficulty. He wishes us to ask the people to do something now which future generations may regret. It is conceit to think that we are wiser than those who will follow us fifteen or twenty years hence will be. The proposals of the Government and of the Premiers evidence their mistrust of the future electors df Australia, and, in my opinion, amount to a wilful, open, and base betrayal of the National interests. They give away powers which were fought for in the Convention by far more capable and far-seeing men. I cannot help repeating again the statement of Sir Henry Parkes that, although New South Wales had more to lose from Federation than any other State, he was ready to join the union, trusting the National Parliament with the absolute control offinanceand the Tariff. He was prepared to leave it to - the wisdom and justice of future representatives of the people to deal properly with the questions which came before them, and thought it unnecessary to bind their actions by the Constitution. Smaller-minded men have followed him. The great blemish upon the Constitution is its financial provisions, and the Government propose to make that worse. I hope that the people will not agree to the proposed amendment. The newspapers and the Premiers have threatened to oppose those who vote against the acceptance of the agreement, and the press, at any rate, has considerable power, especially in regard to the party which I have the honour to lead. But, after all, these threats are vain, and will not influence any manly person. They may influence and terrorize political jellyfish, who are always watching which way the windblows, and are ever ready and anxious to set their sail to catch every passing breeze that may tend to their political advantage. It may suit them to do that, but a country does not make progress by having in charge of its affairs men of that kind. There is no special virtue in standing by the principles in which one believes, but there are times in the political history of a nation when the men most useful are perhaps those who decline for the time being to be dragged with the' majority. This agreement, in my opinion, is wholly and solely a political one.",24
83,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If it is, it will break down.",24
84,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I agree with the honorad- able member that it will break down, but there is a danger that, while the present political arrangement between the State. Governments and the Government of the Commonwealth exists, it may find its way into the Constitution. The honourable member knows what that will mean. The Constitution cannot be altered by a majority of the people. If it could, I should say at once, '' Send this agreement to the people by way of referendum."" The Attorney-General early this morning cited the Swiss Constitution in reply to the arguments that we put forward. His argument, however, had no application. The procedure to amend the Swiss Constitution is practically the same as that necessary in the case of an amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution, but in Switzerland every question submitted to a re.ferendum of the people is not a constitutional one.",24
85,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am aware of that, but I was speaking of the double referendum on a constitutional question.",25
86,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it necessary that the question to be submitted to the people in this instance shall take the form of a proposed constitutional amendment? Why not ask the people to say "" y e a "" or ""nay"" to the principle involved? Why not submit it to them in .the ordinary way, and not as a constitutional amendment of a binding character requiring a majority of the States as well as a majority of the people to remove it from ' the Constitution? If the Attorney-General would take up that position I should be with him. I should cheerfully support the Government if they proposed a fair referendum to the people, by which a majority would be able to carry or reject this proposal.",25
87,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will not agree to that.,25
88,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney-General is essentially a fair man, but last night he seemed to endeavour to convey the impression that under the Swiss Constitution there must be a referendum",25
89,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . I was speaking only of an amendment of the Constitution. I pointed out that there were eleven in eighteen years that went to a dual referendum, a referendum of the people and of the States.",25
90,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"For all practical purposes, a referendum in regard to an alteration of the Swiss Constitution is practically the same as that for which our Constitution provides. But there are other questions that are sent to a simple referendum.",25
91,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No doubt.,25
92,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This proposition ought to be submitted to a simple referendum of the people.,25
93,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Provisio n is made in the Swiss Constitution for such a referendum,25
94,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If it were proposed that there should be a simple referendum, by which a majority of the people could accept or reject the agreement, I should accept the Government proposition; but, as it is put, it is fatal. Those who take the view that this is only the beginning of further pressure to be applied to Federal Governments by the States have some cause for that opinion. In the words of the honourable member for Flinders, it means, perhaps, the destruction of effective Commonwealth progress. I am not given to taking a very pessimistic view of matters; I prefer to be optimistic; but I do say that the proposition is one to abrogate certain rights possessed by the Federal Parliament. The Prime Minister, who is the leader of the movement, is the last whom I should have suspected, even twelve months ago, c\f taking this action. I cannot recall a single utterance of his which indicated that he was likely to favour any such action as he now proposes. No one was endeavouring to take the step that he has taken. No party sought an alliance with the State Governments, until he himself solicited their aid. Although the honourable gentleman assisted to frame the Constitution, he is the first to desert its principles, and to seek an alliance with the State Governments, the effect of which will be to take away powers that have been given to this Parliament. It is a deplorable exhibition of weakness; a singularly unfortunate action in the course of a rather long and distinguished Parliamentary career. I hope, however, that the matter will not end here. I trust that the people will reject the agreement, and that every qne who feels that the Bill may afford a temporary advantage and security to the States will yet recognise that unless the National Parliament can be trusted to deal fairly and equitably with the States, it wall be impossible to build up a national sentiment. If we are to begin to distribute our powers in the way now proposed, it is only a matter of time when the Government, to' be logical, will have to propose to distribute those which we now possess with regard to industrial legislation, and they might as well take the same course with respect to our power to deal with the question of defence. I shall take my stand against this proposal here and in the country, and regret that we were not able to brock the passing of the Bill. I repeat that those who voted for this agreement have had no mandate from the people to do so. The agreement has been sprung on the people without notice and without warrant, and honourable members who support it are prepared, without the authority of the electors, to endorse a policy which, I feel assured, will be disastrous, speaking generally, to the people of the Commonwealth.",25
95,Mr DEAKI N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ballarat-Prime Minister) [4.25] - It is due to the honourable member that a brief reply should be made to those portions of his remarks,25
96,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should not take it amiss if no reply were made.,26
97,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I still feel my obligation to recognise the honourable member's position, and also to endeavour to reply to his arguments. Brevity appears to be justified by the present state of the Chamber.",26
98,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This is very kind! When the show is over, no one desires to hear more.",26
99,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope the honourable member understands why, apologizing in advance, I proposed to deal only briefly with his arguments. I should have preferred to move the recommittal of the Bill for the purpose of inserting the definite article at the beginning of clause 3, but that would imply a loss of another sitting. In existing circumstances, the tension occasioned by the divisions that have been and have yet to be taken can be prolonged only at the cost of further sacrifices on the part of honourable members that are, uncier present circumstances, capable of being dispensed with. We are now faced with the report of the'Committee. I have not to undertake at this stage an exposition of what, from my point of view, is the consistency of the present proposal with those submitted by previous Governments with which I have been associated, or to previous Conferences of Premiers. I may claim to have been among the first to draw the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament to the grave importance ancl ultimate magnitude of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I have availed myself of every opportunity, when attending Conferences of State Premiers, or associated with them in any other way, to impress upon State Governments the wisdom of their facing the very contingency which has nowarisen. I urged them to prepare in advance some welldigested ancl complete scheme which should, as far as possible, dispose of the many causes of friction that will exist until we have established complete financial relations securing the utmost independence on both sides, or where there is mutual co-operathem tion, that this should be strictly defined. If we had been successful in the endeavour to induce them to grapple with this subject more thoroughly at an earlier stage, we could have dealt at the recent Conference with not only one or two of our central financial relationships, but probably with the whole of them. At present that still remains an ideal; but I submit with confidence that the present proposals depart in no way from the main principles laid down at the various Conferences. If they are not, as they are not, as complete as we desired, they, at all events, represent the utmost possible advance found practicable at this time. The Leader of the Opposition, at the outset of his speech, criticised the Government proposal; but, of course, he is well aware that an Administration is necessarily placed a.t a great disadvantage, when, against the one scheme to which it has given its adhesion is ranked every other scheme, and all their supporters. In the present instance it has not been a choice between two rival schemes. The honourable member himself confesses that he, and a majority of those voting in Opposition, have approved proposals emanating from the honourable member for Mernda, and others, only because they appeared preferable to the scheme which the Government has submitted-no t as embodying the proposals which they themselves would have carried if they had possessed fl:e requisite strength. There, apparently, aro some differences of opinion on the subject amongst the members of the honourable member's own party, and there are certainly considerable differences amongst independent members who have united with them. All these, collectively, approach very closely in strength tojhe number that have rallied round the scheme submitted by the Government. But this discussion has really shown that, as against any other scheme taken on its own individual merits, that embodied in the Bill commands a larger support than any rival scheme. That appears obvious. Consequently, although honourable members have voted the Government scheme by a bare majority, we have, as a fact, every reason to believe that it has a very much stronger support behind it than any other scheme yet laid before this Chamber. The honourable member repeated some criticisms upon the attitude of members on this side who exercised their undoubted liberty of taking exception to the Ministerial project; twitting because, nevertheless, on the divisions they have cast their votes with the Government. But, surely, under the circumstances, of all criticism that could be offered, this is one of the most futile. As the Leader of the Opposition and his party voted for a proposal submitted from this side by those who differ from the Government, not because they approved it in itself, but because it was less venturesome than ours, he surely cannot deny to individual members of the Ministerialparty the same right of choice. Practically, the question was-wha t scheme is attainable reconcilable with our principles which will meet the present circumstances ef the Commonwealth, and be likely to secure the support of the majority of the whole of the electors, as well as the majority of the same electors reckoned by their voting places in their several States. That is the scheme we require. It is not the only scheme possible, but it is just such a scheme as is essential at this critical period of our national history. This scheme is evoked, not as a consequence of any search by the Government for one electorally advantageous in filling up a meagre programme. We had to face the House and the country with some financial scheme of this character. Under the terms of the Constitution, on the cessation of the Braddon section in 1910, it became absolutely necessary, no matter how short the time at our disposal, or how great the pressure on us, to prepare and propose some arrangement which, after criticism in Parliament, cogkl be submitted at the general election as the best we could agree upon for the needs of the Commonwealth. The search was no choice of ours. Already overburdened with other important measures, the Conference had to meet in the midst of a strenuous session, and the measure is brought forward at this time simply because some scheme had to be proposed. This agreement is the result of our threshing out the question with the representatives of all the States concerned, proving to be the one practical and practicable measure which we were able to submit for the consideration of Parliament. Mr J. H. CATTS - Why propose a temporary arrangement if it had to be permanent ?",26
100,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That has been answered several times already. Under circumstances of pressure, and in the short time at our disposal, we had supposed it impossible to arrive at a permanent settlement. But when we found we could arrive at an agreement in regard to what moy be termed a complete scheme, so far as it went-no t the full, complete financial provisions of which I have been speakingwe believed we were acting in the interests of the Commonwealth, as well as in the in[ 5] 20 terests of the States, in undertaking the Ministerial responsibility of submitting this proposal to Parliament. It must be remembered-and I merely say this in pasting, in reply to criticism, that the Government will go to the country, if this scheme be sanctioned by both Houses of Parliament, deriving no direct electoral advantage from its submission. It will be dealt with, not as the honourable member suggested, as a party question, put to the electors as a main ground for returning us to the next Parliament. While offering many temptations, as well as many opportunities of a party character in this way, it is put aside so that it may be dealt with independently of the candidatures of persons or parties. The electors, no doubt, in a number of constituencies, will accept or reject this measure, quite apart from their acceptance or rejection of particular party candidates.",27
101,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is nothing practicable in that.,27
102,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think the rest of the House see the point, and recognise the irrelevance of the comments that are being made. My point is that, if we had followed the course favoured by the honourable member for Wide Bay, of taking this to the country as the first proposal in the Government platform, we should undoubtedly have had, on that ground, and, perhaps on that ground alone, a special backing throughout the Commonwealth. Of course, it would have opponents as well; but I believe the backing we should have gained by that course would have been far and away beyond the opposition which it would have evoked. Under the circumstances, we are parting with an electoral advantage-w e are not taking the course which would have given us the greatest voting value out of this question. On the contrary, we are following a course which enables the people to reject us and accept the scheme, or to accept us and reject the scheme.",27
103,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will do tha first.,27
104,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are perfectly free to do so. For my own. part, I confess that I look forward with a further interest to this appeal to the people. We have yet to learn how responsive the electors as a whole will prove to an appeal on a question of this kind. I trust and believe that this particular issue will not only evoke an enormous response from those who go to the poll to vote for candidates, but will result in bringing many thousands more who might not otherwise take any part in the election. I look forward with the greatest interest to the educational value of this direct appeal to the people, their attention being directed in the most pointed way possible to the financial situation of the Commonwealth - to the financial requests of the States and the financial relations which must exist between the two bodies. These are matters which we have done well to discuss here; which will be discussed at large throughout this country until polling dav. and will, I trust, result in the creation upon this subject of an educated public opinion of great advantage to the Commonwealth and its coming Parliaments. I trust that, in future, we shall find these appeals to the direct judgment of the people on great issues become more frequent. That will depend in part, as I sai3, upon the numerical response we obtain, and its character. The honourable member for Wide Bay commented upon the exercise of Ministerial influence upon members unnamed in recent divisions. If any such influence was exercised, it was but a fraction of that used every day by the honourable member himself and those associated with him, not only upon each other, but upon any others whom they can bring within its sphere. I make no objection to their doing so, but contend that anything of that kind which may exist on this side is but child's play to the steady, consistent, scientific manner in which it has been developed by my honourable friends opposite. The proof of this particular pudding is, as usual, in the ing. There is not absolute unanimity on this side, but a great deal of independent criticism. There is on the Opposition side absolute unanimity, and no independent criticism.",27
105,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Hav e the honourable member for Bass and the honourable member for Perth joined the Fusion party?,28
106,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Neithe r of them is a member of the Labour party. Although they have sat on the Opposition side, they have, from the first, frequently voted on - questions of importance with the Government. They have been independent members. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that we had still a great many State Rights to sweep away. I think the expression was unfortunate, because rights which deserve that name ought not to be swept away.",28
107,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think I used that phrase.,28
108,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I took it down at the time, but do not think the honourable member intended to employ the words in that sense. I took him to mean that there were a considerable number of State powers which ought to be transferred to the Commonwealth.",28
109,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is the honourable member sure I used the words ""sweep away""?",28
110,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think the honourable member will find them in his proof.,28
111,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should have thought it would be impossible for me to use them in that connection.,28
112,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I lay no stress upon the phrase. The honourable member gave us practically but one illustration of his meaning. He referred to the unsatisfactory condition of State industrial legislation and its incapacity to grapple with some of the serious disturbances at present visible in Australia. That may be so, but the honourable member's remedy for it followed the line of his argument. He implied a dominance by the Commonwealth which meant the sweeping away of the authority exercised at present by State tribunals, and the creation of a central control by the Commonwealth of all industrial matters and industrial disputes. I should prefer to take an exactly opposite point of view. I should say that the difficulties with which we are confronted are due, not to the existence of the State tribunals, nor to the limitations upon the eatexercise of State authority which are inseparable from State legislation in such matters, but to the fact that they lack that crown and completion which would make them harmonize with each other, and permit Federal action over the whole of Australia wherever Federal action is necessary. To obtain that would not destroy or cripple the State industrial systems. On the contrary, it is to encourage their development to the fullest extent that their Legislatures can sanction,, and then, by means of their work, in each part of the Commonwealth, assist to bring their conditions into line where Federal interests are involved or Federal action is necessary, by the exercise of powers which are or can be vested in the Federal Parliament. In fact, the industrial campaign which the honourable member proposed starts from exactly the opposite point to that from which the industrial movement in its national aspect should com> mence. The conclusion at which one would arrive, from hearing this and other speeches of the honourable member, is that the gain to the Commonwealth in the future, the gain to what he calls national interests, is to be obtained by the pruning of State powers and the reduction of their authority and activities. He seems inclined to take that view, branding as antinational those who do not see in this .reducciently tion of State operations the one means of developing the national power and authority. Here again I find myself in profound difference with my honourable friend. My colleagues and I claim to be thorough and sincere Nationalists who recognise that in a continent of these dimensions, and in particular at this period of our history, Nationalism can be built up and buttressed only by a complete development of State powers. It is not in taking advantage of the weakness of the States that the strength of the national movement will come. It will arise with a perfecting of State powers within their own limits, and their subsequent union and completion by national powers.",28
113,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does that mean that the Commonwealth is to have no further powers ?,29
114,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth will gain its full authority, not by depriving the States of power, but by a natural growth and increment, as it develops in accordance with the necessities of the country.",29
115,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then what about new Protection? How is that to be brought about?,29
116,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Without using the words "" new Protection,"" I answered that - question within the last few minutes. It must arrive first by perfecting State tribunals ancl laws on industrial questions, ancl then through their harmonization and completion by Federal laws.",29
117,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Large r national powers ?,29
118,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have already said that, but the honourable member seems to be always three or four minutes behind my argument.",29
119,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's argument is very specious. It is good electioneering material.,29
120,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not seeking for - compliments, but if the honourable member [205]- 2 will look at the whole position that I am putting he will find the question he has asked already answered.",29
121,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nobod y ever knows where the honourable gentleman is; he is so anxious to have two interpretations of his words.,29
122,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eve n that depends to some extent on the powers of scrutiny of the critic. The honourable member may be long or short-sighted. I am not vet suffiacquainted with his trouble to be able to supply him with the particular pince-nez which will best suit hiscomplaint. Nothing could be more pernicious at the present juncture than for those who are Nationalists, as I think most of us in the Federal Parliament are or may become, to manifest their Nationalism by hostile criticism of and antagonism to the State Parliaments and the States themselves. I should like to see the terms ""parochialism"" and ""provincialism"" fall into disuse in the National Legislature-no t merely that we should exhibit no qualities of that kind, but that, if ever they were exhibited by smaller bodies or from any quarter, we should pursue our way confident that the people will not be led aside into petty disputes between their several agencies, when they see before both such vast areas of unutilized territory awaiting their attention. There is not only room for both Federal and State authorities in Australia, but Australia badly needs them both in a fuller development than they have yet attained. The hnrmony to be established between them cannot be petrified upon a statute-book. It must arise out of a mutual recognition of each other's duties and difficulties, and a sympathy for each other in the common tasks which lie before them in this country of immense undeveloped potentialities. The honourable member for Wide Bay would probably feel that I had not done justice to his argument if I made no reference to his line of thought with regard to taking over the debts. Yet I have pointed out to the honprable member that the Commission of Inquiry, alluded to in our agreement with the Premiers, has nothing to do with the taking over by the Commonwealth of the State debts. It has to do, as explained when the agreement was first laid on the table, with the arrangement to be made hereafter between the Commonwealth and the States in respect fo-» : the issue of future loans, under a Commission .conserving the interests - of Australia as a whole, on the London money market. That needs a Commission of Inquiry first, - because it.requires a settlement of the ditions upon which priority as to certain -.loans m.ust be granted, and .under which the money market will be approached when either the Commonwealth or the States are saddled with the heavy responsibility of redeeming large existing loans. . If honourable members look at the Statist's record, they will find that .within the next seven or eight years there are, perhaps, three in which .the accumulated amounts to be dealt <with are quite sufficient to occasion anxiety, and to . require prevision, if we are to cope with fresh loans at about .that time without injuring any replacement of existing loans by the issue of new stock. .This complex question should be dealt with ,by an expert financial body. The inquiry - proposed in the agreement is for the pur.pose of establishing such a body, and not .in connection with the mere taking over of the State debts. That, up to the amount of about ^200,000,000, already rests within the power of this Parliament, while I hope that the passage of the measure which accompanies this one will shortly place in our hands the power to take over the whole of the debts. The institution of a sinking fund, to which my honourable friend alluded, is a Treasury matter, which must be the subject of a specific proposal, made probably under the advice of the Financial Commission. Few questions are more critical than some which may be associated with the sinking fund.",29
123,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Commonwealth will not go far wrong if it copies Western Australia in respect to the establishment of sinking funds.,30
124,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wester n Australia has done remarkably well in that matter. - Mr FISHER - Can the Commonwealth be '.anything more than the agent of the States 'under this Bill-? f Mr DEAKIN - A certain amount of - agency work is involved in the mere transfer - of the debts provided for by the Constitution, but there is an opportunity for much more than that, and I have always hoped that more will be done.",30
125,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not provided for,30
126,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It cannot be provided "" for until the terms have been settled. Such 1 subjects cannot be considered in more than ' outline. They are extremely intricate, and are viewed from different stand-points by the various State authorities. All - the criticisms which are being levelled at the con- Government scheme are confessedlybased on forecasts, and, so far as the State debts are. concerned, on forecasts of a very distant future. Those who contemplate the abolition of the State loans look forward to periods regarding which the best financial experts in the world today would not venture to speak except in most qualified, cautious, and general terms. It would be difficult to predict the future of Australia fifty years hence, but to determine the relations of its public and private finances with the money markets of the world at that time is far beyond the power of any of us. That consideration does not relieve us of the responsibility for exercising prudence and caution. We must, prepare .for the future, but, inasmuch as it is so distant, we can discuss it only tentatively, and in an abstract fashion.",30
127,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will not the credit of the Commonwealth aiways be better than that of the States?,30
128,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A short interval may be required to establish the Commonwealth stock, but afterwards, according to the opinion of the most expertfinanciersin London, the Commonwealth will always obtain better terms than the State stocks. Until this Bill has passed from our hands,' we shall not be relieved of the most serious responsibilities which we have yet encountered, and we cannot forget that at every stage we are dealing with political possibilities and probabilities that' defy estimation by the most skilled seer. We know how the opinion of the honourable member for Wide Bay and his friends regarding the prospects of parties at the coming election will differ from that of my friends and myself. If, a week before the polling, our comments are collected, as no doubt they will be, there will be a wide discrepancy between them, and yet we shall have travelled the country, have tested public opinion at many points, and made up our minds that the stream will flow in one way or the other. One forecast will be very wrong, and the other will probably be a good deal wrong. Such being the lesson we receive at almost every election, how can we expect to forecast here. with certainty the political future of Australia, either with or without this agreement? Without it, we should be at sea when appealing to the electors. Without some plan, a variety of schemes would be propounded to perplexed audiences. host of complications would arise, one member being returned for his financial opinions, another in spite of them, and ,a third for some quite different, yet, to his constituents, sufficient, reason. would then have to do the best it could to frame a scheme likely to be approved by the constituencies three years later. Now we propose a definite financial arrangement. Having this agreement, we take to the electors a clearly-defined programme, .which will be explained again and again by every newspaper, and from every platform, in every town and hamlet in the Commonwealth.",30
129,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the views of those whr> oppose the acceptance of the agreement were published at the same length as the views of those who support it, the position would be - satisfactory.",31
130,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's party has a press of its own, newspapers more or less in sympathy with them, ancl other means which make it certain that their views will reach quite as though not the same, electors as we hope to reach.",31
131,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Melbourne Age the only newspaper which is opposing the acceptance of the agreement..,31
132,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And Daily Telegraph.,31
133,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,31
134,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should 'be glad to .discover that there are no exceptions..,31
135,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Without the support of the newspapers, the Government would be in . a hopeless minority on this question. - Mr DEAKIN - I have had the press with me, and, for a considerable portion of my career, pretty strongly against me, and, no doubt, will have it against me again, should I remain in politics' much ' longer. The country will now have a scheme submitted whose merits and defects-espe cially the latter-will , be fully dealt with. 'We ' shall have its decision for' or .against. That will be a great advance, worth much. Those who have sunk their ' personal opinions"", after having done their best to give effect to them and now enable a definite and specific scheme to be submitted for the popular verdict, will be repaid, by the great gain which will follow, for the anxiety ancl labour which the problem has cost them.",31
136,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why did not the Governliberate ment submit an alternative? A Mr DEAKIN - The best alternatives are ""Yes"" and ""No."" - - .",31
137,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The alternative is a bald negative.,31
138,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . If the people Parliament are not satisfied with this scheme, it will be best for them to return to the new Parliament men who can prepare one of which they will approve. I have spoken already about the submission of issues to the people, and the conditions under which this is possible, and have expressed my hope that referenda will increase. But the increase must be gradual, and the subjects submitted must be such as really evoke public interest. The consolation which we must take to ourselves when we hear our proposals travestied, turned upside down"", presented in false lights, and misinterpreted is that after all they are being discussed and considered. We must trust to those who hold other opinions to correct misapprehensions.",31
139,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will all the members of the Ministerial party advocate the acmany, ceptance of the Government's scheme?",31
140,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not aware, though I assume that the members of thp is Labour party will speak with one voice. Their solidarity gives them a great advantage.",31
141,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are not bound on the Sydney this question.,31
142,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will be by the time the election comes.,31
143,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,31
144,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Wide Bay has said that we have no mandate to submit a scheme to the people, but the last two Parliaments at least have been instructed, in general if not in specific terms, to hasten the settlement of the finnncial relations between the Commonwealth and the States.",31
145,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does - the honourable member think that the matter has been seriously discussed?,31
146,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"M a n y of us have dealt with it from t me to time for a long while : past. Whether we have a mandate or not now is immaterial, inasmuch as the acceptance or rejection of the proposal by the - people is specially provided for. Having regard to the fact that during the next four - or five months the attention of Australia will be focussed upon these .financial pro' pbsals, and the issues relating to them, we' may confidently expect to obtain the deand thoughtful. judgment of' the electors. Notwithstanding prophecies of risk and disaster, we may be confident that the situation is being greatly simplified a proposition so fair that, except in regard wishes of the electors. to its duration, no difference of opinion upon its merits exists in this House. It goes to the country endorsed in every detail by an unanimous approval of the House of Representatives given thing except its duration, and the method - of securing its duration by placing it in - Constitution.",31
147,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the most important point.,32
148,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is certainly imporin tant, but it is something to be able to to the people a proposition on which we are otherwise united. Such harmony most unknown in this Chamber. It is extremely rare to find such a consensus of opinion obtaining at so early a stage upon a question critical and provocative of feelthe ing, or in which interests are so keenly touched, and so much involved, as they in this. Let it be matched by any measure of the same character and effect within memory of honourable members, and then, I venture to say, that we start with a greater degree of unanimity in its support than has been associated with any measure substitute something else for it : of like magnitude passed since Federation.",32
149,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is because the vernment have the best strategists on their side.,32
150,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am speaking of quesdifferent tions of which the honourable member, strategist though he is, considering from his own personal stand-point, has generally approved. But some honourable members desire to have an opportunity of refuting me. I commend to this House with confidence a practical proposal which, whatever its defects, has already met large measure of commendation. The root of our confidence, after all, lies in the fact that if it be erroneous, it be amended by the people of Australia, if not at the first, at the second, of asking. The voice of the great bulk the people of Australia, if it were defeated at any time by a combination of local terests, while the population in some of States continues to be relatively much smaller than in others, must ultimately prevail. If , in the light of circumstances, at which we can now only guess, but which would then be actual, there should thing in this proposal requiring to be corrected, as inevitably there will be at some dat<!-it may be five, ten, fifteen, or years hence-the inevitable force of public opinion will amend it, and re-shape it to by meet the circumstances of the time, and the We have laid a good foundation, and I firmly believe, speaking as one forming an opinion on the materials before us, that in the circumstances, we could not have framed a better to everyor more acceptable scheme.",32
151,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cook) [5.20] - We the have just listened to a characteristic address from the Prime Minister, who commenced with an elaborateapology for his desertion of Nationalism, and then indulged a mass of contradictory arguments such send as we are accustomed to expect from him. I am confident that if any person were to is alexamine the speech just made by the Prime Minister, he could find in it either side of the argument that he desired to obtain. The honourable gentleman, for instance, spoke of submission of this issue to the people as offering no electioneering advantage to the are Government, and declared that it would be entirely dissociated from the interests of the candidates in the various constituencies. Later on, however, he told us that if the people did not favour this agreement, they could return men who would be prepared to If the people refused to accept the scheme put forward by the present Government, who Gohave a majority, and desired some other arrangement, how could they obtain it unless they returned to the Treasury bench a set of men? The remarks made by the Prime Minister on that one point him amounted to a tremendous contradiction. As a matter of practical politics, the honourable gentleman knows that candidates for the various constituencies will not be able to dissociate themselves from this issue. It is in its very nature a complex and fara reaching proposal, and it will be demanded of every candidate that he shall explain it to the best of his ability. He will not be can able to take up the "" Yes-No "" attitude adopted in regard to Federation by the time honourable member for East Sydney. He of will not be able to say to the people: "" Ladies and gentlemen, the truth of the inmatter is this-m y opinion is so-and-so. I the voted one way, but I advise you to vote the other."" Is it possible for those who have deliberately expressed themselves as opposed to the placing of the agreement in the Constitution to advise their constituents be anyto accept the Government proposal ?",32
152,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And they made that statetwenty ment with almost sacred deliberation.,32
153,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exactly .,32
154,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],33
155,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can well understand that after the contradictory speech made by the Prime Minister, which no one - could comprehend, members of the Ministerial party had to repair to their own .room to discuss it amongst themselves and .to endeavour to determine what it really .meant. The Prime Minister took me to task because of one or two interjections that I made with the object of ascertaining - what he had in his mind. But it must be remembered that the right honourable member for East Sydney, and the Prime Minister's right hand supporter, the Minister of Defence, were in Opposition for years; that they complained time after time from this side of the House that speeches made by the Prime Minister were quite beyond their comprehension, and that one could find in them arguments on both sides of the question. I have no doubt that in the future, when questions are put to the Prime Minister with regard to some of the points - dealt with in the speech which he has just snade, he will be able to point with equal facility to the ""Yes"" and the "" No . "" - The Prime Minister set up a man of straw - in order that he might have something that he could readily knock down. He replied to a number of statements an regard to uni- iication, which he professed to believe had come from this side of the House, but which had never been uttered. He wished it to go forth that there was a desire on - the part of the Opposition to belittle the States and the power of the States. There is nothing of the kind. There is, however, a. desire on the part of our party to pre'serve the national sentiment from belittlement and degradation such as that to which - it has been subjected by that erstwhile - Nationalist, the present Prime Minister. Take, for instance, the question of the new Protection, on which the Prime Minister ha?, varied his opinions very considerably. This Parliament cannot give effect to that - policy except by an enlargement of its powers. Some powers in that regard are .at present being exercised by the States, and to enlarge the power of the Common' wealth in this connection would be to restrict the power of the States. There is no desire on our part to belittle the States; out there is a desire to take to the Com' monwealth Parliament sumcient power to enable some far-reaching issues, such as - that of the new Protection, to be dealt with ' on national lines, and effect to be given to the will of the people. It is absolutely absurd to say that because a man desires to see an enlargement of certain specific powers possessed by the Commonwealth there is on his part a concurrent desire to belittle the States; but it is quite in keeping with the Prime Minister's present attitude that any proposal which would appear to involve an enlargement of the national side of the Commonwealth should be thought by him to be a mere scheme for belittling the States. That is his present attitude; but it is a.tremendous departure from the noble Nationalism which he so eloquently expounded in the days gone by. I know of no one on this side of the House who advocates the centralization of all governmental control in Australia. The Labour party certainly does not. To do so would be to advocate that which is ridiculous. If effect were given to such a proposition there would be a great agitation in the Commonwealth for home rule in respect of certain matters. There are some governmental functions that can best be controlled and developed by the central authority ; there, are others that can best be controlled and developed by the State authority. There is a difference of opinion as to what powers can best toe exercised by the National Parliament and the State Legislatures respectively; but to say that there is any authoritative opinion on the part of the leaders of the Labour movement, in the direction of the complete centralization of all the purposes of government, is, either from ignorance or party design, to invent a statement which is untrue. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay that even the powers now exercised by the States will have to be further distributed as the States themselves develop. Some of the States comprise huge areas. For instance, the Northern Territory, a proposal for the transfer of which has lately occupied the attention of this House, is nine times as large as England, Ireland, or Scotland ; and since there is in Ireland, notwithstanding its comparatively small area, a clamour for Home Rule, surely, in the immense areas of Australia, a centralized form of government for all purposes could only be the forerunner of a great agitation for decentralization and - home rule. There is no one on this side of the House who takes any other view.",33
156,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Oh ,; yes.",33
157,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say there is not, though it suits the honourable member andsome of his coUeagues to seek supportby making an assertion in which there is no truth. There is only one honourable member "" on this side who advocates complete unification, and even his ideas may be qualified to a considerable extent by the meaning which he attaches to the word. Some believe that there should be one supreme Governmental authority, delegating powers to the local governing bodies, while 'others advocate Commonwealth and State Governments, each exercising sovereign rights within its jurisdiction. suggestion that there is a movement to centralize the whole of the Governmental authority in Melbourne, Sydney, or the Federal Capital, is a bogey erected merely in order to be knocked down; and yet that is what has engaged the eloquence of the Prime Minister this afternoon. In referring to the question of the debts, the honourable gentleman spoke of the futility of predicting conditions in future years. No one asserts that it is possible to cast the operations of the money market thirty or fifty years hence; but, in making preparations for dealing with the lic debt of Australia, we can lay down a correct basis for future transactions. The proposals of the Government are fundamentally wrong, and will prevent the effecpeople. tive management of the debts, no matter what may be the conditions in the money market in the future. If it is impossible to make predictions of the kind, why does the Prime Minister desire to lay down a cast-iron basis for future operations? Why should there not. be some elastic arrangement, capable of meeting the changing circumstances of the future? As a fact, the Government propose to leg-rope the Commonwealth for all time, in regard to the revenue and the public debts, and so ; .deprive us of the advantage of that elasticity which the Prime Minister himself has shown to be so important. In hi,s peroration the Prime Minister urged that there was one part of the Government scheme in regard to which unanimity prevailed ; but he omitted to tell the House that that part has been plagiarized from ..the scheme-.drawn up by the Labour party at their Brisbane Conference. That is information which the Prime Minister did not afford to the public through the pages of Hansard jbut we know, that his speech of today is nothing more than an electioneering device, and no doubt it will be printed in pamphlet, form, and distributed I broadcast., The' honourable, gentleman did Mr J. H.' Colts'. not tell us that, the Labour party were the first to suggest that method of distributing the surplus revenue; and there is no real departure from the principle of the Brisbane scheme, except in regard to the amendment of the Constitution.",33
158,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-As a matter of fact, I did not know the Labour party's scheme when. I went to the Conference; I had seen merely a newspaper report which was unintelligible to me.",34
159,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the State The Premiers, who dictated the present agreement - to the Prime Minister, knew the Labour party's scheme. As a matter of fact, before the Hobart Conference, Mr. Kidston sent to me for a reprint of the scheme which I put forward here in October last year, - in order that he might supply it to the Premiers. In any case it was not necessary for the Prime Minister to know anything-h e did not go to the Conference to learn, but simply to accept forethe dictation of the State Premiers, and he did so very humbly and subserviently. The honourable gentleman might bave beenpub- honest enough to thank the financial experts of the Labour party for formulating the scheme which the State Premiers instructed him to accept on behalf of the The action of the present Government is quite consistent with that of the Liberals for some time past. When the Labour party, which is composed .of the rank and file of the people, draft proposals or measures which are found to stand the test of public criticism, the so-called Liberal party adopt them, and impudently take all the credit. Notwithstanding the fact that members of the Government and some of their supporters have, -. for some years past, denounced the Labour, party and its work's, they have abandoned their election pledges to such an extent that some of the most vital points of their policy have been takenfrom the Labour party's platform. At the same time, they'always contrive to associate with such measures some conservative principle which completely nullifies any beneficial effects. The particular scheme under discussiop was adopted by the State Premiers as a means' of dishing the Labour party, and it is now being forced on the Commonwealth to meet the exigencies of party warfare, set forth by the so-called Liberal party as their very own. I have no doubt that that portion of the schenje which the Labour party originally suggested will be accepted by the people, while tfy? other part, which means interference with the Constitution and the degradation of the Commonwealth-whic h means a disgraceful admission by this Parliament of its inability to exercise the powers conferred Upon it by the people-wil l meet the fate it deserves. I trust that a party will be returned to power able to evolve a constructive scheme equal to all the exigencies of the situation, and thus bring lasting good to the Commonwealth. It is a sorry sight to find gentlemen opposite, who are well qualified to rouse the national sentiment of the people, departing, .some of them in the even'ng of their career, from their ideals of days gone by. They then endeavoured to foster Australian ideals, whereas now they have allied themselves with a parochial, small-minded section, whose object is to limit the powers which the people gave to the Commonwealth Parliament"" under the Constitution. The honourable member for Flinders told us that the Gommonwealth has now to choose between the high road and the low road, and that the choice will determine our line of development. Is it to be the high road of Nationalism, or the low, dusty road of petty parochialism? I hope that the issue, when placed before the people, will be given by the press that fair play which its sacredness deserves. When we show the public that this move on the part of the Government is not only a Conservative move to limit the present powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, but also a desire in the interests of the wealthy section of the community to have hea'vy burdens of Customs taxation"" placed on the shoulders of the masses in Order to save the landlords of Australia from taxation, and to prevent the effecting of any real reform in the basis of our taxation, or the wiping out of the public debt in a reasonable time, I am confident that they will rise to a full sense of their responsibilities, and not only reject the Bill at the polls, but return the Labour party to ""occupy the Treasury benches in this Parliament .in such numbers as to enable it to put forward its great constructive national proposals' and administer them in the spirit in.which they have been framed.",34
160,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member means "" destructive.""",35
161,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They have been sufficiently constructivefor the State Premiers to plagiarize them, and dictate the resultto - the Commonwealth in regard to this-., agreement - . I hope that the people will see through this device to shackle and fetter future generations. I think the brand which might appropriately be applied to the party sitting on the other side of the House is "" Fusion and Fetters."" Mr - MAHON (Coolgardie) [5:48] - Not having addressed myself to this matter in Committee, I may be allowed to say a few words before the Bill passes to another place. ' It seems to me that the Prime Minister is now reaping the harvest of trouble sowed through all his years of office, by his recognition of'State Premiers in (Federal affairs. It was not unreasonable to expect those gentlemen, pampered as they have been with the notion that they have some right to shape the affairs of the Commonwealth, to attempt to dictate to this Parliament at this stage with regard to the division of Commonwealth revenue. They have been encouraged in their usurpation of national functions by the Prime Minister's extreme affability--' I will' not say weakness, although it is doubtful whether any other leader would have submitted to the discourteous and - contemptuous treatment he often received from some of the Premiers - Whatever his object was, the result has not been conducive to the interests of Federation. A charge against the Opposition, of being afraid to trust the people comes with very ill grace from - the Prime Minister, who was a party to the' recent secret caucus of Premiers. He permitted the doors of the - Conference room.to be shut in the' face of the public, deliberately excluded the press,, and up to the present moment has kept the public in the dark as. to the real grounds for the agreement. In the circumstances,. the Prime Minister might' have allowdd that charge . to .be made by somebody else, - if there' were any rea'sop for making it at .all. . J am. not at all afraid.t'o trust the people, but before .we send the.Bill to them, for their opinion, we ought to. have from .the.Prime Minister the real reasons which induced him to change the attitude that he had taken up for years with respect to the financial question. We have a right to expect him to tell us why he dissevered the question of the division of the revenue from that of the taking over bf the State debts. He has told us nothing about - that. The honourable member for 1 Gippsland .asked for those reasons lalst evening, but no reply was vouchsafed. While I am prepared to trust the - people with every confidence to deal with this amendment of the Constitution, being satisfied that they will refuse to enact a pro- vision which would-hamper the majority the future, we must not forget that if change is made in the Constitution minority of the people will be able to keep it there. The honourable member for Parkes showed that 80,000 people could prevent any alteration of the Constitution, even if countries. 900,000 people wanted it. I cannot see why an arrangement could not be made with the States whereby the revenue would be divided for another period of ten years, at the rate of 25s. per head, leaving future Parliament to make any alteration that might be necessary, just as Braddon section does with us. The Parstrongly. liament of that day could, if it so desired, send the question to the people. have in the Braddon section a basic ciple which may be followed with advanany tage. It must be supposed that the men who framed the Constitution, and the people who adopted it, knew what they were - doing when they passed that section in its present form. They knew that no Parimportant liament could see very far into the future, and that a term of ten years was long enough for any arbitrary arrangement exist. We have, therefore, a precebe dent to go upon, and we have the economic experience of the past, which shows the inadvisableness of attempting to legisexperience, late too far into the future. interested in the phase of the subject touched upon by the honourable member for Batman, and other sincere Protectionists. I can readily understand that if the Prothat tective Tanff which the Prime Minister vised and induced the House to pass is be as effective as he anticipated, and other duties are to be imposed later on, or existing duties increased, the Customs venue will considerably diminish, even though the population increase. I notice that the Prime Minister has not developed his argument in regard to New Zealand. He has not been able to prove his wonderto ful theory that, despite the incidence Protective Tariff, the tendency of our venue would be to increase per capita.",35
162,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I had furtherfigures;but they were partly quoted by the honourable member for North Sydney.,36
163,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister gave us certain figures in his original speech; but they did not establish the which he then attempted to evolve.,36
164,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They strongly indicate of Australia. that tendency.,36
165,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y in one country in in the world-Ne w Zealand-and it has been the booming largely on the strength of bora rowed money for the .last ten years.,36
166,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And they show the same tendency for several other Protectionist,36
167,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member did not show that the per capita return of revenue increases under a Protective Tariff.,36
168,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ou t of the three countries a quoted by the honourable member for Flinders-Germany , the United States, and the Canada - two showed that tendency",36
169,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There may be temporary We local reasons which would account for a prinlarge increase in revenue; but to be of value as a guide to the House in a momentous matter of this kind, the comparison should cover a long series of years. I may take it, therefore, that the honourable gentleman has not established that very part of his case. Although he set out to demonstrate it with all the certainty that one solves a problem in Euclid, he did to not succeed, and now even he appears to in doubt about the existence of any such law. I think we are entitled to say out of our common sense and common that a Tariff, if it is Protective, I was much must reduce revenue.",36
170,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On the Protective duties.,36
171,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; and I presume the ideal of the Protectionist section dewho follow the Prime Minister is to proto duce in this country everything that it reif quires. If that ideal is ever fully accomplished, of course we shall have no Customs rerevenue. At any rate, in proportion as that ideal is realized, in like measure will the revenue be reduced. That being so, the time must be close at hand when the Commonwealth will be faced with inability pay to the States 25s. per head out of ot a Customs and Excise revenue. When that rehappens, there will be two courses open. One is to impose direct taxation. There will be some difficulty about that, because by that time the States will probably have both land and income taxes, and any Federal tax must be superimposed upon them. The other course open to it is to impose revenue duties on articles of common consumption which are now admitted law free. This will place an additional burden on our pioneers, on those who are carrying civilization to the remoter parts Revenue duties aTe not - worth much unless they are levied on comoppose ;modities in general use, and presumably kerosene will be the first thing to be taxed.",36
172,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A tax on kerosene - would be very unfair.,37
173,Mr MAHON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Of course it would be, .and I hope that the honourable member will not hesitate to vote against it should be proposed. Doubtless taxes on tea and ""kerosene would furnish the money necesan sary to make up the deficit created by payment of 25s. per capita to the States. While the imposition of revenue taxation may give no concern to a section of the House, there are honourable members to whose principles it is absolutely opposed. I have heard one of those who is supporting the agreement denounce revenue duties It In the most contemptuous terms. But supporting the agreement he is probably - compelling Parliament to impose revenue duties in the near future. Thus his posiportion . tion is illogical ancl difficult to defend. Now, as to the position of affairs should this measure pass, I confess that I do wholly share the alarmist apprehensions that have been expressed. The power of this Parliament over taxation is not menaced. We shall still be able to whatever money is required, even if share of the Customs revenue should prove insufficient. If a majority of the people are determined to vote for an arrangement which will place them at the mercy of minority later on, have we a right to interposed cept them ? Certainly, it would have been Detter to follow the Braddon precedent, .and make an arrangement for another years; a period quite far enough to .ahead, especially in matters of finance. I do not disguise from myself that certain - sinister influences are at work, and will - operate at the coming election to induce ducts ? a majority to bind themselves to a compact which a small minority can always maintain against the wish of the majority. The true position will, however, be placed before the electors by the Labour press party; and my hope is that the national sentiment may dictate a settlement which posterity may have no cause to regret.",37
174,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barrier) [6.81 - I do not intend at this stage time, but I feel obliged to state briefly my reason for voting against the proposed agreement. Whilst unification is not of the platform of the Labour party, and . believe an overwhelming majority of its tion. , members, including the honourable members for Wide Bay and West Sydney strongly on. it, I personally am in favour of it. When a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I stated, during the discussion of the draft Constitution Bill, that in my opinion we should go further towards unification. I said then that I was in favour of substituting a National Parliament for the existing State Parliaments, it and of constituting that Parliament of one House, consisting' of members elected on adult suffrage. I still hold those the views. Had effect been given to them, . neither the State Parliaments nor the Senate would exist. Many objections have been raised to unification, - and no doubt the people are against it. Were the public feeling otherwise, we should have had it. has been pointed out that Victoria and in Queensland were at one time part of New South Wales, and that there was only one Parliament for the whole of the eastern of Australia, but that .the centralization of government in Sydney caused so much irritation that the creation of other not Parliaments was agitated for, and separation took place. But it must be remembered that that happened before the general use of telegraphs, telephones, and railways. raise To-day we can communicate more easily our and quickly with Perth and Brisbane than we could with Adelaide and Ballarat fiftv years ago. The electric wire and the railroad have practically annihilated distance. a This makes unification possible. I am opto the imposition of Customs duties of any kind for the obtaining of revenue. Had I my way, no Government would ten raise revenue by that means. I would look abolish all revenue-producing duties.",37
175,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member impose duties to keep out pro,37
176,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I might impose protective or prohibitive duties, but I would not have revenue duties. The solvency of th; Commonwealth and the States does not and depend on the Customs revenue. In my opinion, it is not the foreigner who pays our Customs taxation. At one time the Ministers of Defence and Home Affairs shared that view with me.",37
177,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have to pay some of to occupy much these duties now.,37
178,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I take it that the honpart orable gentleman still holds that the I foieigner does not pay the Customs taxa*,37
179,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He pays it, and passes it",37
180,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So that'ultimately we pay it. There are some who honestly beof lieve that the foreigner pays the Customs duties. But the Ministers to whom I have alluded, and the Attorney-General, do hold that view. If we are correct, the solvency of the Commonwealth and of the States does not depend on the Customs Excise revenue levied to pay for the serpart of the Constitution. It was pointed vices of Government. T recognise, however, that I am in a hopeless minority.; that the majority of the people of Australia believe that certain Customs duties should, be imposed, and that it is therefore necesthe sary for us to deal with the revenue deIt rived from that source. The State surers ought to be able to tell with some - should now be prepared to favour the iridegree of precision what amount they are to receive from the Commonwealth from year to year. I recognise that they placed in an awkward position if , in paring their Budgets, they are unable to ascertain until the last moment what are likely to receive from the"" Commonsaying wealth, and that it is only fair to States that some definite arrangement should be made. I have no objection the proposed per capita payment of 25s per annum. That is a fair and reasonable amount to return to the States, and': should not object to giving some measure of stability to the agreement in order the Treasurers of the States might know fromr.year to year what they were likely to receive from the Commonwealth. But the objection which ' I hold, in common with'those who have supported the amendtion ments moved by the honourable member for Mernda, is that if this agreement is bodied-in the Constitution-the difficulty removing it will be practically insurmount- .duties? able. We have a perfect right to trust people; but whilst I am in favour of .or'a liy other 'agreement being submitted . the will, of the majority, I ' feel that it unjust, tb those who come after us that a other'source? minority may beenabled^ against willof the. majority, to. retain, agreement in the ' Constitution onceit ' is placed . there.

South ' Wales 'who were ""opposed to the 'Bill. was signed by the president and secretaries the organization, and one of the secretaries of that organization was Senator E. D. Millen, who is now Vice-President not of the Executive Council. One "" of the great objections raised in that manifesto to the Constitution Bill was the difficulty and thaf-would be experienced in altering any 1 - out that it was'almost as rigid as that of - the United States of America, in whichonly three amendments of a serious character had been made, and that they had beenresult of a civil war and bloodshed. seems strange that an honourable senator Treawho endorsed such views at that time 1 sertion of this agreement in the Constitution knowing how difficult it would be for are posterity to remove it. What was known preas the "" Braddon blot "" was in the Constitution Bill as submitted to the first rethey ferendum, and I think I am justified in that a large number of the citizens the of New South Wales were induced to vote for the Bill because it was pointed out that to under that clause it would not be abso- Iutely necessary to raise a penny by the imposition of. Customs duties. It' was I urged that the "" Braddon blot "" would not - compel the Commonwealth Parliament to that raise money by Customs taxation'; that it - merely provided that-if revenue were so - raised, three-fourths of it should be returned to the States.

I am glad to have .the Postmaster-General's interjection, and if his statement is correct, then one of my objections to the agreement is somewhat modified. Still, I do not think it fair to posterity to piace this agreement in the Constitution, and to say that this money must be found for all time, by. means of Customs, land, or any other taxation. The people of Australia today may favour such an agreement, but it is unjust to insert it in the Constitution, knowing, as we do, that it will compel the people twenty-five or thirty hence to raise revenue in a . specific - Way. Whilst I might be more ready to support a referendum to the people on proposal tb return to the States 25s'. per - head of the population out of revenue raised by means of land taxation, yet, howvide ever much I favour land values taxadoubtless tion, I should still oppose the insertion .such a provision in the Constitution. ought not to dictate to posterity how rethough, venue shall be raised. Much of the diffiof"" culty that has arisen could have been viated if , instead of proposing that this .agreement should be. placed in the Constituthe tion without any limitation as to its tion, it had been proposed that it should operate for a period of ten or twelve years, and that it should then be automatically submitted once more to the people, and, 'not reaffirmed,- should lapse. standing my views in regard to direct taxapeople. tion and unification, my main objection to this agreement is that once it is inserted ''in the Constitution by the will of rity of the people, a minority - may ikeep .It there, despite the wish of the majority.",38

(Wide Bay) [7.47] - This Bill is to enable the Federal Parliayears ment, at any time ' it may be desired to do so, to take over the whole of the State debts, and I have expressed a my view entirely in favour of the measure. It was, 1 think, a serious oversight on the part of the Federal Convention not to profor this in the Constitution itself; but the members, of the Convention of thought that one of the first acts of the We Parliament would be to take over the debts, as a matter of fact, it has been one the last things thought of. Recent disobcussions show that some of the Premiers of the States *are not favourably disposed to Commonwealth taking over the debts; durabut, in my opinion^ this is a desirable amendment of the Constitution, and I shall do all I can to facilitate its being carried into effect. It is not necessary to discuss if the measure at length; and I hope that we Notwithshall have the unanimous verdict from the Debate (on motion by Sir JOHN QUICK) a majoadionrner"" to a later hour of the day.

183,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Herbert) [7.52] There are one or two amendments qf which I have given notice, but my object in rising now is to say a few words in regard to the administration of the Act. I give the DeAuspartment credit for a desire to see every to exqualified person enrolled, but it must be this admitted that, in some cases, at. any rate, a there is a want of care in this respect. For a instance, when a claim is put in, there is of no means by which the claimant can know whether it has been granted until the rolls are printed. Of course, there are registrars and registrars-som e are careless, or may have personal or political' predilectionsand in view of their small remuneration we cannot wonder that there is a certain amount of laxity. When a claim is sent in, it is supposed to be entered in a book; and I suggest that that book shpuld be. open to inspection during reasonable office hours.",39
184,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That will be so when the Bill is brought into operation.,40
185,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear of that desirable amendment. In regard to offences under the Act, my experience during the last election shows that while many are committed, great difficulty is experienced in having any action taken. In one case I submitted the most conclusive evidence, but the Department refused to take any steps, though it is hard to see where else the responsibility can lie. If a man commits a burglary, the police take action, and the sufferer is merely a witness in the case; and a similar policy should be pursued under the Electoral Act. The then Minister of Home Affairs told me that the Department was quite unable to do anything in the matter, and I was informed that I or anybody else could prosecute; in fact, the Department itself seemed absolutely helpless. When a penalty is provided for an infringement of the law, it surely ought to be the duty of the Department to see that the law is upheld. I also desire to say that I am very sceptical as to the value of postal voting. The Labour party haye been twitted with being instrumental in securing postal voting, and to that we must plead guilty, because, as a matter of fact, we were most anxious that those who could not get to the poll on election day should not be disfranchised. Unfortunately, like many other good things, postal voting has - been most grossly abused; and I have come to the conclusion that the disadvantages of the system far outweigh its advantages. I intend, if no one else moves in the matter, to propose that the whole of Part X of the Act be deleted. The frauds committed under the system were very glaring at the last election; and in the State elections in Queenslandwhere, however, the system has now been abolished-the abuses would have convinced anybody as to the necessity for reform.",40
186,Mr ARCHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It must be rememberecfc that postal voting in Queensland was notsafeguarded by any regulations.,40
187,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so; but evenunder the Commonwealth Act, which, provides for regulations, there is a great deal of what I may term corruption.",40
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What sort of"" fraud oould there be?",40
189,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As a case in point, I may say that a gentleman and his wife, who were living within 300 yards at most"" from a polling booth, obtained postal voting papers, on the plea that they might - be unwell or something of that sort on* polling day; but, as a matter of fact, they were in perfect health, and both of them, in a manner that looked like "" rubbing it in , "" passed the booth several timeson the day of election.",40
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There was nofraud there. They only voted once, I hope.",40
191,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is so; but I regard it as nothing else but fraud.,40
192,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member guarantee that these people voted' only once?,40
193,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would not guarantee it, but I believe that they did not votemore than once.",40
194,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did they do any particular harm?,40
195,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not say they did, but a great many cases of the kind'' would do harm. I may say that this casewas not brought under the notice of the Department, though others of a moreglaring character were; and I desire to know who is to take action.",40
196,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I ' was anxious to takeaction in several cases, but found all sorts of difficulties in the way.",40
197,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is what I am complaining of, and I contend that these difficulties ought to be removed. It is very difficult to make the conditions* sufficiently stringent to prevent abuses, and' I am willing to admit that it is better torun a little risk in that direction than that people who are honestly entitled to a voteshould be deprived of it.",40
198,Mr ARCHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If women who live twentyo.r thirty miles from a polling booth in bigcountry districts, are not allowed postal' votes, they will be deprived of all opportunity of voting.",40
199,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The cases where electors live at such great distances from polling booths would be very few, and if they did occur a difficulty would arise in securing a qualified witness to sign the postal ballot paper. I know that our regulations are much more stringent than those under the State law, but I have seen so much abuse of the postal voting system in State elections that I feel it would inflict no great hardship if it were done away with altogether. When the Labour party asked for the introduction of the system in the first place it was on behalf of seamen and others who were prevented - from voting by circumstances over which they had no control. If necessary, the case of the seamen could be met by making every coastal steamer a polling booth. I wish to refer also to the question of hired vehicles, with regard to which I have given notice of an amendment. In an access of virtue which was very commendable this House declared that no hired vehicles should be allowed to be used under certain pains and penalties, but unhappily we find that they are still very frequently used and in such a way that it is almost impossible to discover who are paying for them, although there can be no doubt that they are paid for. Motor cars are also largely used. I suppose in most cases they are not hired, but are lent. Still, that is an infringement of the spirit if not of the letter of the Act, and as the chauffeur must 'be paid for his day's work, and petrol supplied, and possibly repairs effected, some charge is probably made in an indirect way. The fact is that some of us are very severely handicapped indeed by the law as it now stands. At the last election friends of mine offered to provide cabs for me and pay for them out of their own pockets without cost to my committee or myself, but I was afraid to avail myself of the offer lest I should find myself prosecuted. Although, as I have said, the Department is very lax in some cases, I feared that if I did anything of that sort they would come down severely upon me. Another amendment which I have circulated has reference to newspapers. has teen an outcry that I desire to muzzle the press. I freely admit that I desire to muzzle it for a limited period-fro m nomination day until after polling-day. But I would point out that the press of today does not live up to the tradition set to it by the press of earlier days. At one iime the press was the redresser of wrongs, and held the scales of justice fairly between party and party and man and man. Today it has descended from its high pedestal and actually crawls in the gutter.",40
200,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not in South Australia.,41
201,Mr BAMFOR D,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Other honourable members from that State say that the press there is just as virulent and just as culpable as that of any other State. The press wilfully misrepresents things.,41
202,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It does so all round.,41
203,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member, of course, is referring to the. Age.",41
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Probably to The: Worker.,41
205,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the right honourable member thinks The Worker is as bad as any other paper, I will agree to shut it up as well as the others for a certain period. All I ask for is fair play.",41
206,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In South Australia the press shuts us up. It gave us one report only.,41
207,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If a man had a long purse, and was willing to pay advertising rates for reports of his speeches, he could secure publication; but by doing so he would probably exceed the limits of expenditure allowed by the Act. The Treasurer has the reputation of being fair and honourable, and a sportsman, and I appeal to the sporting instincts of the men on theMinisterial benches to see that we have fair play in this matter. Even the honourable member for Maribyrnong, when he went UD to the Cyclqrama building on Eastern) Hill , would, I am sure, be shocked to see an eight-stone man enter the ring with a. twelve-stone man. But that is exactly analogous to our position. The party to which I belong goes into the political fight, with both hands tied behind its back. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, on the other hand, has his case put l>efore the public by a paper which has a daily circulation of over 100,000, and is read, possibly, by 500,000 or 600,000 people every morning. But what means have we to put: our case before the public?",41
208,Mr EDWARDS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Worker. There Mr BAMFORD - The Worker comeso""t only once a week, and has a circulation of 20,000 at the most. I shall havemcre to say on the matter when I move my amendment, and am merely now indicating' the lines upon which I intend to appeal totbe Committee in the interests of fair play and manliness. We ought, at any rate, to have the concession made to us that, for a few days prior to polling day-the period' might be made as short as the Government please-the newspapers should make nocomment on any political matter whateverI n South Australia candidates are not allowed to address meetings for a given time prior to polling day. That is an acknowledgment of the principle for which I contend. The idea underlying the restriction is that the electors should be allowed to make up their minds in peace and quietness, before they go to the poll, on the arguments that have been put before them.",41
209,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They allowed to do so in practice, because others, who are not candidates for the particular electorate, come in and address meetings.",42
210,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Everybod y could not - be prevented from speaking; but in South Australia, as far as possible, certain people are prevented from speaking, and, so far as it goes, that is a recognition of the principle for which I contend. I do not suppose that I shall be able to carry the amendment; but when I move it , I shall give honourable members on the Ministerial benches an opportunity of showing whether they possess those sporting instincts, and that love of fair play, with which the Australian is generally credited. . I hope that I shall get some support, at any rate, from that side. Mr THOMAS BROWN [8.13] - This measure is of considerable importance to the electors generally.",42
211,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is only a machinery Bill . No principle is involved in it.,42
212,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It involves the important principle of postal voting, which is now exciting considerable attention. The system was introduced first by South Australia, and the Commonwealth followed her example shortly afterwards. It was originally intended that the principle should be limited to exceptional cases.",42
213,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was introduced by us to deal with seamen only.,42
214,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The reason was that it is not always possible for seamen who are following their vocation to record their votes at a polling place. The only alternative would be to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Herbert, and to proclaim each coastal ship a polling place. It was considered that this provision should be made to meet cases of sickness and ill health, and to allow those to vote who were too far from polling places to be able to attend there. The tendency has been to extend the privilege. The distance from a polling booth at which it is now necessary for an elector to reside in order to be able to vote by post is less than was at first provided for.",42
215,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r this Bill , a postal voting certificate can be obtained on the ground of distance only by electors living 7 miles from a polling place,, whereas, formerly it could be obtained only by an elector living 7 miles from the polling are not place for which he was enrolled.",42
216,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The increase of facilities has disclosed serious weaknesses in the provision, and this will be emphasized as it becomes more largely used. It lends itself to the exercise of undue influence by those who wish for the success of particular candidates. Such"" persons, sometimes bring pressure to bear to induce electors to vote by post who, if left to follow their own inclinations, would go to the poll. Queensland has followed the lead of the Commonwealth in this matter, but has gone much further, and the experience of the election before last there showed that, unless an alteration was made,' vote by ballot would be seriously interfered with.",42
217,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In Queensland, every woman has the right to vote by post. (Calare)",42
218,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Practicall y any woman can vote by post under our legislation. All that it is necessary for a woman to do to secure a postal voting certificate, is to sign a form declaring that she' has reason to believe that she will be unable to attend the polling booth at which she is enrolled, because of ill-health, or absence. On election day, she may neither be ill , nor away from home, and in a number of cases, votes are recorded by post, although the voters were able to go to the polling places. Some vote by post for personal reasons apart from distance, or the state of their health, and others because of the pressure put upon them by interested parties. Abuses might be prevented by confining postal voting to seamen, persons who are ill , and, possibly, persons who are living at a great distance from polling booths. In the country, 7 miles is not a great distance. Many of the difficulties in the way of recording votes have been removed by form "" Q , "" which enables an elector who is away from home to vote anywhere within his State at certain specified polling booths, and under conditions insuring the supervision of properly appointed officials. In every sub-division, there is at least one polling booth where persons who are not enrolled for it may record their votes.",42
219,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member refers, to booths where there are sub-divisional returning officers.",43
220,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Where there are divisional or sub-divisional returning officers. The electoral districts are subdivided, with a view to working the polling places from a common centre, and each subdivision contains at least one polling place where voting can be done under the "" Q "" form. That largely meets the difficulties for which the postal voting is provided, and is not so liable to abuse. Any person can obtain a postal voting certificate by signing a mere declaration. It has to-be witnessed by some one belonging to certain authorized classes. But the witnesses are often strong partisans, and take advantage of their position to advance the cause of their friends, in a manner which would be impossible in a polling booth. Whilst a partisan may secure some immediate advantage for those whom he is supporting, the improper use of electoral machinery is an abuse which may cut both ways. The purity of our elections will be maintained only by eliminating, as far as possible all opportunities for abuse, and it is the duty of all who desire that the voting shall be the true expression of the popular feeling to see that everything end. There are some who practically advocate the substitution of postal voting for the method of voting at polling booths. Some of these are supposed to represent large political factors. 1 was a member of a Committee which was appointed to investigate the conduct of the first Federal election. The possibility, of abuse under the postal voting provisions' was made evident to us, but a witness who represented a large political party, connected with the Kyabram movement, I believe, thought that the amending legislation should be so drafted that every person should have the right to vote by post - without restrictions. He advocated that the conditions surrounding the recording of a vote of that character should be made as easy as possible. One of the reasons advanced was the difficulty experienced by political parties in obtaining a representative vote. It was pointed out that at every election a large number of'' electors, either because of conditions over which they had no control, or because they were indifferent to the citizen rights conferred upon them, failed to record their votes, and it was urged that the provisions of the postal voting system should be extended nnd made as-easy as possible to [206] meet such - conditions. The experience of that system in connection with both Commonwealth and State, elections has been such thati any extension or easement of thefacilities must be viewed with a jealous eye, particularly on - the part of those who wish to preserve the purity of the ballot. It was pointed out that an election for the great city of Melbournewas declared void because of irregularities, and that a great abuse of this system obtained,.",43
221,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the honourable mem-. ber's leader, and others, advocated it stronglv even after that.",43
222,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It . was originally advocated by the Labour party; to meet the case of seamenand others whom I , have indicated.",43
223,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Leader of the Opposition . based his advocacyof the principle on a much broader ground. He put it that it was the natural corollary of universal suffrage. Mr THOMAS BROWN. - He has learned a lot since then, and I am glad to know that he is ready to profit by experience. The honourable member for Wide Bay has had, since then, the experience of an election in his own State.",43
224,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r a different set of, is done to this conditions. ' Mr THOMAS' BROWN - The only' difference is that the facilities for voting by post in that State are a little easier than they are under the Commonwealth law, and the Minister seems to be travelling in the direction of removing the conditions that' surround the use of the system in connection with Commonwealth elections. To the extent that he does so, to that extent. will he cause a repetition in Federal politics of the undesirable experience of the States, which has led. the Leader of the Opposition to desire that the system should be hedged about with more safeguards.",43
225,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He has not so expressed himself. Mr THOMAS BROWr* - If the Minister proposes to follow Queensland legislation in this regard, he will find the Leader of the Opposition's vote against him.",43
226,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This is quite different from the legislation of Queensland.,43
227,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Onl y to the extent that more safeguards are proposed than exist in connection with the system in force in Queensland. The original Commonwealth Act embodying this principle was hedged about with more safeguards than are now proposed, yet the inquiry to which I have referred showed that even under it gross abuses had occurred. It was said that an army of canvassers, popularly known as "" the flying angels,"" visited the' residences of electors, and that a large number of votes were secured in contravention of the Act."" It was pointed out that, in one case, the canvassers were accompanied by a police constable, who witnessed the signatures of the voters, although he was not empowered to do so by the Act. Since then the provisions in this regard have been extended, and, if I mistake not, it would be competent for a constable, under this Bill, to witness signatures to postal votes. The experience of both the Commonwealth and the States should make the Minister wary in proposing to give greater facilities for the abuse of the postal voting system. When abuses are discovered, the offenders should be severely punished. One of the peculiarities of the Act is that it provides that certain things shall not be done. Certain actions are declared to be illegal, and punishable in a certain way, but the Department holds that it is no part of its duty to put the legal machinery into motion. It is well known that in connection with elections unprincipled people are prepared to publish circulars damaging to the character and general reputation of candidates to whom they are opposed.",43
228,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can show the honourable member some real gems that were circulated against me by a Labour candidate.,44
229,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I can show the honourable member some fairly strong ones that his crowd circulated against me.,44
230,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ver y likely.,44
231,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not only can I show the honourable member some gems of the kind referred to, but I was followed by them.",44
232,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was very bad.,44
233,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"T t was bad for me, but those who distributed such circulars did not accomplish their object. It was to prevent practices of the kind that, in an amending Bill, it was provided that such circulars should bear the authority of the person issuing them and the imnrint of the printer. It is a punishable offence, to publish circulars that do not compiv with those provisions, yet, although the abuse is as great as ever it was. there has not been a single conviction. The attention of the Department has been directed to these abuses, and its reply has been that it is no part of its duty to put the law in motion. That may be an easy way of escaping a difficulty, but the Department would have acted more honourably had it refrained from proposing such legislation. When the provision in question was inserted in the amending Bill, the Minister in charge of it said that he would not take the. responsibility of enforcing such legislation. I am convinced, however, that every honourable member who voted for it did so ori the understanding that if the Department discovered an abuse, it would vindicate its own legislation. If that had not been understood, some other method would have been devised to deal with such offences. Does the Minister propose in this Bill to remedy the difficulty?",44
234,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The matter is not dealt with, in this Bill.",44
235,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Now that the matter has .been brought under the notice of the Minister, I trust that he will see that there is inserted in the Bill, before it leaves the Committee, a clause giving the Department power to enforce the provisions of the original Act. It will only be necessary to make one or two examples, and a very grave abuse and miscarriage of justice will be removed with much benefit to the community. Earlier in the day I questioned the Minister of Home Affairs in regard to the powers of the divisional returning officers, and, although I speak only as a layman, I take exception to the legality of the exercise of such powers. The reply seemed to me to indicate that the new practice introduced in the Department is perfectly legal. If that be so, the Minister should make some provision in his machinery Bill for meeting the new state of affairs. First of all, it is laid down as a constitutional principle, that an elector shall vote Only once at an election; and, apparently in order to keep within the spirit of the Constitution, the Electoral Act provides that a divisional returning officer shall not exercise a vote as an elector, but shall have the power to give a casting vote if necessary.",44
236,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is, providing the divisional returning officer lives in the division in which he acts.",44
237,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-But according to the new practice, a divisional returning officer need not be a resident of the division in which he exercises his functions; and in that case he 'may vote as an elector even in the polling booth over which he presides.",44
238,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are only two cases in the whole Commonwealth, one in Melbourne and one in Svdney.",45
239,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But it is possible for there to be as manv cases as there are divisional returning officers.,45
240,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot expect them to live in the citv.,45
241,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the Minister say that in the great cities of Melbourne and Sydney there are not to be found competent resident divisional returning officers? Under the circumstances it is possible for one man to exercise two votes-hi s vote as an elector and a casting . vote.,45
242,Mr MAUGER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not probable, and there is no danger.",45
243,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But it is possible, and I do not know that there is no danger. I understand that the legal opinion is that one vote is exercised as a man nnd an elector, and the other vote is exercised by the officer merely as a machine or instrument of the Department to determine nn election. But if that advice is good, why not give the officer who lives in the electorate the same right?",45
244,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What the honoiable member is suggesting is that we should takeaway from a man his original vote.,45
245,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the Minister is taking away the original vote from every other divisional returning officer.,45
246,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The opinion quoted is that of the law officers in regard to the Act.,45
247,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be so; but when the Minister finds that there is a practice which does an injustice, it is his duty to provide a remedy.",45
248,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not see the necessity in these cases.,45
249,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But a multiplicity of instances is possible. Will the Minister undertake to say that there will be no more?,45
250,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall not prophesy ; but the position arises under an Act for which the honourable member is equally responsible with mvself.,45
251,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I desire pro> vision made tb meet an inequality which has arisen, not so much as the result of special legislation, but rather as the result of legal interpretation. While I do not profree from it. fess to be able to give a legal opinion, I think there is not only an injustice, but an infringement of ; the' Constitution; However, I have done'my duty in calling at-, tention to the matter. If two officers can be singled out and clothed with extra power, all officers ought to be dealt with similarly. There is no need"" to introduce special legislation, because we have before us a machinery Bill by means of which justice could be done. What I suggest is that the postal-voting system ought to be hedged round with safeguards, that the Department be armed with the necessary power and the obligation,,to enforce the punishments provided in the Act for offences, and that the officers shall be treated fairly all round. I undertake to say that the divisional returning officer who resides outside his division is net more intelligent cr impartial than the officer who resides in the division where he per forms his duties.",45
252,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Riverina) [8.58] - I happened to be away at Oodnadatta when the Bill was previously before the House, and, therefore, I should like to take the present opportunity to say - a few words. I think I may say, without egotism, that my experience of matters electoral is just as valuable, if not more valuable, and is, at any rate, more bitter than that of any other member of the House. The honourable member for Calare has dealt generally with the subject of postal voting. I was one who assisted to pass the first Electoral Act, and it was with pleasure that I voted in favour of postal voting, innocently thinking that the right would be honestly and legitimately used. I have learned, by experience,, that the system is not used old but abused; and while I do not desire to decry my own State, I must admit that, in some quarters, the electors there are pastmasters in all kinds of discreditable electoral practice.*. ; I am sorry to say that my electorate seems to be, so to speak, the nursery of all kinds of fraud, from land acquisition in the earlv davs to the manipulation of State elections later on, and, still later, the exploiting of Commonwealth elections. I heard the honourable member"" for Barker say that these things could not be done in South Australia. I hope they are not done there, but however carefully we may hedge the postal voting system round with restrictions. I venture to say.that fraud is always likely to take place.",45
253,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,South Australia is not,45
254,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The testimony of another member from that State rather dims 'to be destroyed. the halo placed around its head by the honourable member for Barker. The election frauds that took place in the early days the States led this Parliament to embody its electoral law restrictions which we thought would prevent similar occurrences in Commonwealth elections, because I am sure.that every honourable member, no matcalled ter what his political convictions are, sires that the vote cast shall always be true reflex of the opinions of the people. But the safeguards provided in the BiH with regard to postal voting, while theorethe tically very strong, in practice are as weak of 'Disputed ""Returns. as tissue paper. Let me show how the was fraud comes in, and how there is no cheek upon it. Tf Brown, or some one representabled ing himself as Brown, sends an application to the divisional returning officer postal certificate, the returning officer, stead of being compelled to send to the applicant, can send it to an agent who is acting, not only for Brown, but others.",46
255,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is sent only to the care of the agent.,46
256,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is exactly where the fraud comes in, because Brown may reprfsented by some .other Brown, and never see the certificate.",46
257,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The people in honourable member's electorate are up every move.,46
258,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Treasurer knows .that well. When he was Minister of Home Affairs.an incident took place, haps by inadvertence on his part, which did the Commonwealth a great injury. I happened in connection - with the disputed election ""for Riverina. When I took my seat in this House on the 4th June, 1904, ""I asked for the production of all the papers in connection with that election order to prove to the House and the counauthorized try the frauds that had taken place, the right honourable gentleman informed me him. - that the whole of the papers had been - burnt! -' - Sir ""JOHN FORREST -^I did not burn - them.

261,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I presume by the in Minister. Af any rate, his answer fo me in is on the records of Hansard. I am not imputing anything'improper to him, but'am pointing out-a danger. When I pursued the matter a little further my attention was to - a section in ' the ""Act providing dethat the papers should be retained until a the election could be no'longer questioned. I suppose the Minister or his officers regarded the election as closed, seeing that matter had been decided by the Court Technically that right, but the ""result was to deprive the House of evidence which would have enmany of the frauds that were perpetrated at that election to be effectively for a prevented for the future. in Sir JOHN FORREST - The papers could it direct not show them, could they?",46
262,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The papers' would for have become public documents if laid on the table of the House.,46
263,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not ballot-papers, surely ?",46
264,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , undoubtedly. Those papers were shown not only to mybe self, but to a number of others, including may officers in the Home Affairs Department. They saw the evidences of fraud, and can the bear out my statements today. The proto duction of some of the rolls, ballot papers, and postal voting-papers in connection with that election, would possibly have put some of the persons responsible perfor. what took place in. gaol. There were a large number of. complaints in regard to t that election, every one of which would have been amply verified by .the papers. One of the cases was as follows :-An individual whose riame I need not. mention was the : manager of a number of stations, and also in a ""justice of the peace, and, therefore, an witness for postal ballot-papers. but He had a large number of employees under He applied for certificates in 'their names. He received them, took them to the employees, and got them filled up without any other witness being present. He received their votes, arid was supposed to post them back to the divisional returning officer. He indicated to his employees the way in which he wished their votes to be and cast, and they were practically under duress to vote as he directed, or lose their employment. T believe most of them voted accordingly for the candidate whom he favoured, although they really wanted to vote another way. The Department, knowing what had taken place, but finding could not obtain sufficient proof to 1 enable it' to mete out punishment, remember fused, after that election, to trust any - individual in the electorate to conduct vote by post? its affairs there, but sent up one of its own officers. My experience and knowhonorable ledge of the postal voting system leads to the conclusion that the safety of the say. Commonwealth and its electors lies in the direction of restricting its use to cases actual illness or absence at sea. other cases, if the elector cannot find time or make arrangements to cast his vote a polling place, it may be better that should lose his franchise for the time being than that present conditions should be alperly lowed to continue. Arrangements could made by which those who were not entitled by illness or absence at sea to obtain postal voting certificate, could apply for , "" Q "" forms at the nearest polling place on the day of election - If an elector of age ancl length of residence. were in the district of Calare, and left made a declaration on a "" Q "" form , that he was enrolled for a particular to allow them to remain unfilled. subdivision in Queensland, Western tralia, or Tasmania, the returning officer case. should be empowered to let him vote that subdivision, holding back the vote until he could communicate with the turning officer for the subdivision for which the vote was cast, as is done under the absent voters' provision.",46
265,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That procedure would be less liable to abuse than is postal voting.,47
266,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ye s j'because no vote would be counted until if was made pretty certain by reference to the roll for the subdivision that it had been rightly cast. was informed the other day that only assistpolice ant or divisional returning officers are powered to accept declarations under form "" Q "" that the absent voter cannot go'into any polling booth. I do not know why it should be necessary for absent voters to polling booths where there are assistant returning officers. Before the amendment of the Act, the "" Q "" form could any one voting outside his district; and, in some cases, outside his State; and it seems . Mr CHANTER to me that if it could be used in the -'ner which I have suggested, it would many of the requirements for which postal voting was instituted. In Committee, shall move to restrict postal voting absowish "" Iutely to those who are incapacitated by i health fromvisiting a polling place, and that it to those who are at sea.",47
267,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The 'honourable would not allow those who are living at a distance from a polling place to,47
268,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would not. The member spoke so fully on this me subject, that I have not very much more to In regard to the collection of the rolls, I was under the impression that it of was arranged with the State authorities that In all - police officers should be told off to visit every house in allotted areas with applicaat tion forms. I understood that it would be he their duty to act as authorized witnesses, and see that application forms were protilled in, afterwards forwarding them, be through the post, or in some other way, to the registrar for the district. Cases have a come to my knowledge, however, in which the police have been content to call at houses, asking who the inmates were, and who were entitled to be enrolled by reason It was to the individuals concerned to fill up the forms to the best of their ability, or The AusMinister asked me to mention a specific That I am prepared to do now, for though privately, because I do not wish to get a policeman into trouble by making rehis name public. The honourable gentleman vvill be satisfied, after hearing my statement, that there is ground for an inquiry as to the extent to which what I complain of has been done. What we all desire is to ascertain the true opinions of the people of the country. For that purpose, it is, first of all, necessary that all duly qualified electors shall be enrolled. Electors must be protected against their own carelessness or indifference; and if they will not put I their names on the application forms, the should do it for them, after asking em- - the necessary questions. I-hope that there are not many cases bf the kind to which I have referred. If there are, a great many persons will be disfranchised through 'not knowing how to deal with the forms. to go Mr THOMAS BROWN - There - are. many .cases in which the.police say that they have . sent - in - names, but the names-do not apbe used by pear in the rolls. - I do not know how m'anthat can be prevented; but strict inquiry meet should be made to ascertain whether the fault lies with the Police Department or I - with 'the registrars. Another suggestion T to make .to.the Minister is that after l l - - each election, lists should be compiled bf those who have voted by post, both men and women. They should be filed in the head-office of each State, and after they have been carefully checked, made public. Of course, no intimation will be given as how the votes have been cast; but this publication would lead to a scrutiny which would have the effect of scaring those who now use the postal-voting provisions improperly. I do not wish to mention names, because the papers have been burnt, and I cannot prove my assertions; but I know of many cases in which this provision has been abused. Had the names been published, it would not have happened a second time. It is not illiterate persons, or those in the lower social ranks who commit this abuse, but persons who ought to be patterns of virtue. There would be no violation of the secrecy of the ballot if what I propose were done; but a very salutarycheck would be exerted to prevent abuse of the postal-voting provisions. I have had to pay dearly for my experience in electoral matters. Parliament made the law, and I had to pay for its interpretation, I found that when I had abundant evidence to convict persons of fraud, and was prepared to lay a charge, the Department, following the advice of the Attorneythat General of the day, would not initiate a prosecution. It wished to put the whole trouble and cost on me. I think that it is the duty of the Department - and the Bill should be amended to make that clear - to prosecute in every case in which a candidate or other person declares that fraud has been perpetrated. I hope that the Minister will take a special note of this matter. No honourable member cares to institute a prosecution except in the defence of his rights. The Act provides for various penalties, but the Minister knows that, although cases in which fraud has been clearly proved have been remitted to him by his own officers, no secution has been initiated.",47
269,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Department holds that it is no part of its duty to initiate prosecutions.,48
270,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I join issue with the Department in that regard. When it obtains ptoof of fraud it should initiate a prosecution.,48
271,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It ought to be responsible for such prosecutions.,48
272,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . The Minister of Home Affairs is a member of the legal profession, and I hope and believe that he will look carefully into the matter, with a view of making provision in this Bill for the initiation of prosecutions. The refusal of the Department to initiate prosecutions is the result of a decision given to by the Chief Justice of the High Court in my own appeal case. Those acting for me in a professional capacity had abundant proof that certain electoral offences had been committed, but His Honour, although the head of the Court of Disputed Returns, said that he had no power to deal with them. He declared that they had to be brought before a lower Court. The knowledge of the absence of machinery to punish offenders has led to the committal of offences which would not otherwise have taken place.",48
273,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Peopl e understand now that there is nothing to fear.,48
274,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. Men who used to shake in their shoes now say, no doubt, "" The Chief Justice of the High Court cannot punish us if we abuse the Act; the only man who can is So-and-so, and he dare not touch us for reasons which need not be stated."" I come now to the question of the rolls which are now being compiled. A new system is being introduced in that a large number of polling-places were previously individualized are now being dealt with under a collective system. The rolls are accompanied by maps showing the boundaries of the subdivisions, of which there may be twenty or thirty in a large country electorate.",48
275,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And also the parishes.,48
276,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has evidently jumped at the conclusion I at first formed that various names shown on the maps were those of parishes, whereas in reality they are the names of sheep stations.",48
277,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The maps are the most pro- up-to-date that can be obtained from the Lands Departments.,48
278,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not denv that; but I do say that they are of no value for electoral purposes. What object is served by placing on the map .the names of various places at which there are no polling booths? The object of supplying with the list of voters a map of the electorate should be to furnish more information to the electors, but, as a matter of fact, a great deal of useless information is supplied. A man who is living on the borders of a subdivision wants to know primarily the name of the nearest polling-place at which he can record his vote. I recognise that the cost of altering these maps in the direction I have suggested would be very great, but the maps as now issued are of no value for electoral' purposes. Some time ago I suggested that list of the names of polling places within each subdivision should be printed and should immediately precede the map and the list of voters. I am told, however, that there are objections to the > adoption of-that course. It is said that the Attorney-General thinks it might lead to complications, since after the rolls had been printed and distributed newpolling places might be proclaimed.",48
279,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And others might be struck out.,49
280,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so, but the difficulty. is not serious. The great desideratum is the supply of information as to the location of 'polling places. the final rolls have been distributed very few additional polling places are likely to be proclaimed or withdrawn. tional polling places were created or others were withdrawn the interests of the Department could easily be protected by a proclamation in the Government Gazette, which would be just as binding as an Act of Parliament. Every citizen is supposed to be familiar with the law of the land, and the contents of the Gazette. My suggestion, if adopted, would protect the Department against any action which might otherwise lie against it for not having fieu the addition or subtraction of a particular polling place. If immediately a notification to that effect were published in the Gazette and circulated throughout the Commonwealth, it would be ample for all protective purposes.",49
281,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That would hardly get over the difficulty of a polling place not appearing on a map, and a sufficient number of voters being misled by its nonappearance'to affect the result of an election.",49
282,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has not quite caught what I wished to convey. I do not"" desire to put the Department to any expense.",49
283,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not the expense to the Department, but the effect upon an election which T am thinking of.",49
284,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not said that I want the names of the polling places to appear on a map. I merely remarked that that would be a better plan to adopt. What I desire is that the map should be taken awav, because, in my opinion, it gives no information. A simple list of the names of the polling places should be attached, as it always has been, to the Federal roll, so that any person buying a roll for a subdivision or a division, could find out that within that area there were certain polling places. It would be a very simple matter for the Department to arrange, and if there were any additions or subtractions to be made after the printing of the rolls, that could be easily dealt with by a notification in the Gazette. I know that on the border line between Riverina and Hume many electors do not know whether they belong to one electorate or the other. At the election held in 1903, in one case no less than ten persons presented themselves to the nearest polling place, which happened to be in the Hume electorate; but, unfortunately, the officer After did not know his duty, and refused to allow them to vote. He could have allowed them to vote on the "" Q "" form, as other If addiofficers did. Theytook the information for what it was worth, and would not go to the trouble of travelling to the proper polling place, and the consequence was that not one of them voted. What matters it to the Department whether a man lives in an adjoining electorate. Let an elector be given the privilege of recording his vote at the nearest and most convenient place. That is an easy matter to arrange. As rolls are supplied to officers, no trickery noti- or fraud could be committed. I hope that the Minister will look into these points and indicate his intentions before the Bill is taken into' Committee. I have had a bitter experience of the' administration of the Electoral Act, and I am speaking tonight with the object of trying, as far as I can, to protect the interests of every honourable member, and to guard against'fraud being perpetrated in their case, as, - unfortunately, it has been in mine. '  the honourable member for Riverina, I have had to suffer to some extent from vagaries, or peculiarities, in the working of the Electoral Act. The system which is being introduced differs from that which was in vogue at the last election, when there was a separate roll for every polling place. A number of polling places are now grouped, and a common roll applies to every polling place therein. That appears to me to offer a very fertile means of committing fraud, if persons are anxious to defeat the.ends of justice and exercise a power which the law never contemplated that they should have. There is nothing to prevent persons from voting at one of the polling placeswithin a group, and then visiting the others, theirnames appearing on the common roll. They would make their claim to vote, and though they would undoubtedly be called upon to state whether they had voted previously at the election, there would be no means of detecting them if they did vote, unless it chanced that some person had seen them enter' different polling places and record their vote. That, in my opinion, is a very serious defect indeed. In Victoria we have a system which has very much to commend it, from my point of view, and that is the numbering of the ballot-papers. 1 should like to see it adopted for the Commonwealth. Of course, I know that it is urged that it affords a means of learning how persons voted, but in actual practice no one has ever been injured, to myknowledge, by the operation of the system. If there should be a scrutiny, and anybody should have committed an offence, it would be a very simple thing to obtain the proof and bring the culprit to justice. \. hope that the Minister will consider the advisability of embodying the system in the Bill. In my case the presiding oflicers were found to have committed a number of very serious errors. Indeed, it was owing to an error of these officers that I was seated on petition. It came out in evidence that they had committed the error not only in my case, but also in regard to the Senate elections. I venture to think that there was not an election in the Commonwealth which could not have been upset on petition on like grounds.",49
285,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How did the honourable member suffer?  siderable bill to the lawyers. In the case of the second election which I had to con test, the returning officers - were compelled to sign a declaration that they had read and fully understood their instructions, and it had a remarkably good effect. 1 do not know whether the regulations to be adopted for the Commonwealth contemplate that course; but I certainly think that if they do not, they should.",50
286,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ye s they do.  that; because it affords a very good security for the efficient conduct of elections. Another matter to which I desire to refer is that of objections to voters By scrutineers. The Act provides that a presiding officer, at the request of a scrutineer, shall note any objection to the right of a person to vote and keep a i record of the note; but it appears to me that a great deal more is needed. I have i't from various persons who acted as scrutineers in my case,, that though they protested - against certain votes, those votes were allowed, and there was no means of identifying the votes afterwards.",50
287,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That matter is provided for in the Bill.  that my experience of the Court of Disputed Returns is that, though it is designed to prevent unnecessary expense, it results in very heavy charges; and I have come to the conclusion that an Elections and Qualifications Committee, with whom justice rather than law would prevail, would be. preferable. I feel somewhat warmly on this subject, because, although I do not care to cast a reflection on any court of l a w , ! am forced to the conviction that a Court of Disputed Returns is notlikely to inspire the same confidence as would a tribunal representing the various parties and sections in-the House. There is a sense of fair play amongst honourable members which would lead them to decide matters justly, while the cost would be comparatively infinitesimal. I offer these un- observations in the hope that they will have some effect.",50

The right honourable member for East Sydney also said the other night that MCDonald, C. I had stated that we, as a Commonwealth, could do as we liked with our money. I challenged that statement, and have been unable to find it in the report of my speech. The right honourable member said that he was not positive about the point. I find that a report of . the statement was sent to Brisbane without a qualification, and that some political capital is being made out of it. I am sorry that the Prime Minister was so persistent in his statement today, especially as. he must admit that the Hansard report does not give him a leg to stand upon. I wish to inquire what the business will be for tomorrow and Tuesday?",51
293,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-P-rim e Minister) f r o . 6 ] - I desire to say that while the statement of the Leader of. the Opposition is correct, nevertheless, while he was speak- . ing on the occasion referred to, I took down the expression as I thought it f e l l from his. lips. It was, as I understood, a statement about "" sweeping away"" State .Rights.",51
294,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The word "" sweep "" is in the report.",51
295,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I took it as a convenient text to hang some remarks upon, in reply to the honourable member. He has since shown me the Hansard proof of his speech, and I find that there is no such' precise expression in it . There is an allusion to State Rights, but I feel sure that the word "" sweep "" was used in some way.",51
296,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The word "" s w e e p"" is there. Will the Prime Minister be kind enough to read the passage, if there, is still any doubt?",51
297,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not in any doubt after the honourable .member's assurance, but cannot comprehend how I came to misconceive the expression.",51
298,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The suggestion about' sweeping away State Rights is not justified by the passage. Will the Prime Minister be good enough to read it?,51
299,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The following is the part referred toTliere will urise in Australia a young militant and determined party which will nwcep uway all these stumbling-blocks in the way of true national progress. This determination to secure for the States rights which are not good for them, will not assist them '» any way, but wil) ultimately react against their interests, und, as (be honourable member for Robertson indicates, help largely to increase that section of the people who believe that we should have a National Parliament with much greater powers, and' State Parliaments with greatly diminished powers. .This is evidently a correct report, and I am not disputing it. But in some way I took the word "" sweep"" and the term "" State Rights "" down together. Of course, I do not challenge the Hansard report, and regret that I made the mistake. I have been asked to mention the business for Tuesday. On that evening we shall endeavour to arrive at a final determination with regard to the Northern Territory agreement, and I ask honourable members to then dispose of the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.9 p.m.",52
