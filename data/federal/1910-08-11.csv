ELLIOT JOHNSON - Has the Prime Minister seen the extraordinary prothe mises of the Labour candidate for Kooyong, who is reported in this morning's newspaper as having said, among other things, that he would propose ."".the subsidizing of grand opera houses in the larger of the several capitals,"" and the "" general use of the lightest wines that can be duced in the Commonwealth""? Is that part of the Government policy, and is the winter months? fact that a member of the Ministry was appearing in support of the candidate when these utterances were made to be taken an endorsement of his proposals?",14
1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No other person than myself will announce the policy of this Governrnent. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Prime Minister has not answered my quesmonths, tion. I wish to know whether, as Dr Erson is the. accredited candidate of ' the party train. of which the honourable gentleman is the head, he endorses the promises made at the meeting last night, to which I have just called attention.",14
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,No Government would endorse everything said by candidates! God help a Government if it did that. EXAMINATION FEES.,14
3,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether the regulation referred to in his reply yesterday to a question asked by the honourable member for Parkes concerning examination fees for boys applying for the position of messenger, has been in existence for years, what was the reason for amending it, and what was the nature of the amendment? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Regulatio n 222, as passed in 1903, required the imposition of fees at all examinations. Under the system, which has rapidly extended, of - examination for promotion within the'ranks of the Service, tests are frequently held to determine the fitness of officers for promotion from one position to another, or from a lower to a higher division of the Service, and as it is desirable to encourage officers to submit themselves to tests, it was thought 'advisable that it should be left to the discretion of the Public Service Commissioner whether the fees in such cases p.m., should be waived or reduced. That was the effect of the notification of the Sth June last referred to by the'honourable member for Parkes. I refer the honourable also to a copy of a report by the Public Service Commissioner on the subject of examination fees which was laid upon table of the House on the 3rd instant. TASMANIAN MAILS.",14

If so, will the Minister make arrangements, - if possible, to obtain accommodation elsewhere than in the Council's premises? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The present post-office is in the municipal building, and the Commonwealth has been endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the City Council to rent two additional rooms in t to remove the disabilities under which the public and the staff suffer j but so far the ideas of the Commonwealth and the City Council as to a fair rental for the rooms have been so very divergent that it has been impossible to arrive at a settlement.

TARGET MARKERS' FEES. : Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice- 1.

In view of the fact that the majority of members of rifle clubs are working men who voluntarily devote their leisure to perfect themselves in rifle shooting for the - defence of their country, will the Minister for Defence, consider the advisability of abolishing the fee to rifle clubs for markers' services, and transfer the cost of the same to the Defence Department?

The Minister will reply to the honourable member's second query when he obtains the information referred to in No. 1. NA WIT H FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (for Mr. BRUCE SMITH) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticer.

If such a communication is in existence, and has not yet been made public, will he lay it on the table of the House for .the information of honourable members, to'enable them to ascertain whether the concession made to Canada is to be made to all the Dominions equally?",15
11,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. A communication was recently received from the Colonial Office, forwarding a copy of House of Commons Paper No. 129, covering correspondence on the subject. 2'. That document is available in the Library, but I shall have no objection to moving for its inclusion among our Parliamentary Papers if honourable members so desire. PAPUAN APPOINTMENTS.

OLD-AGE AND INVALID",15
12,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Wentworth) [2.43] - I move That this House is of opinion that old-age or invalid pensions accruing between the date of the last payment of the same and the death of the pensioner should be paid to the heir or heirs-at-law of the deceased. My object is to draw attention to a serious injustice under which old-age pensioners are suffering at present. Section 15 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act of 1908 provides that every person who has attained the age of sixty-five years, or who being permanently incapacitated for work, has attained the age of sixty years, shall, while in Australia, be qualified to receive an old age pension. That section is not at present being operated upon in the Commonwealth. The old-age pensions are paid in arrears and not in advance, and the result is that if a man dies, say, thirteen days after the last payment, the Treasurer has failed to pay him thirteen days of pension to which, under the Act, he was entitled. If I were to move that the pensions be paid in advance a point of order would be immediately raised that I was seeking to impose an additional burden upon the taxpayers. Not being in the Government-than k Heaven ! - I should be entirely out of order in proceeding in that way. I have, therefore, had to take this step in order to ventilate this injustice under which old-age pensioners rest. I do not think it can be said that death is the fault of the pensioner, but if he dies, say, thirteen days after receiving his last payment, I think the least the Government can do in the circumstances is to pay the pension to which he was entitled to his heir or heirs-at-law. The difficulty will, of course, be to find who are the heirs of the deceased. That is really the whole problem that confronts us.",16
13,Mr CHANTER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,What is the difficulty there? If there are any heirs they will,16
14,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The Prime Minister saw me in reference to the subject after I had given notice of the motion, and pointed out that his advices were that the cost of finding out the heirs of an old-age pensioner PAPER. would be greater than the amount of pension which would have to be paid to them. discussing the question with me .the Prime Minister said he was prepared to pay the pensions to the old-age pensioners",16
15,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I did not say that. I said that they should be taken to be paid in advance, and that all future pensioners PENSIONS. should come in on that basis. In other words, the pension is for the pensioner and for no other.",16
16,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That seems rather rough on the present pensioners. I do not wish to put the Prime Minister in any false position because he was talking to me personally about these matters, and was perhaps not weighing his words, but I understood him to mean that the pensions were to be paid in advance.",16
17,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,They will all be treated as paid ih advance. - Mr KELLY - Eve n if they are not?,16
18,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,And the other point is that the money is required by the law to be paid to the pensioner and not to his heirs or successors.,16
19,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Then is the Prime Minister prepared to carry out section 15 of the principal Act, which, in effect, directs that while a pensioner lives he is entitled to a pension at the rate of ios. per week? It is of no use considering him as having been paid in advance. In this matter I am ventilating a legitimate grievance of the old age pensioners.",16
20,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The cost of administration would be treble the amount that had to be paid.,16
21,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not wish to propose any special course, and if the Prime Minister can point out a means whereby old-age pensioners can receive their rights under existing legislation I shall be satisfied; but they are entitled to payment up to the date of death, and are not now getting it, because their fortnightly instalments are paid in arrears and not in advance.",16
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The Prime Minister said they are to be taken as paid. But if a pensioner died, the money actually due would be his, and it ought to somebody.",17
23,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It is his money, and ought to be paid. If the Prime Minister will see that the money is paid to one, I do not care if the Department given the power to decide, for instance, who are the heirs, not at law, but under this practice. The Prime Minister does not like that proposal?",17
24,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I do not think we could decide that question.,17
25,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"In ventilating the subwhat ject, my whole desire is to Treasury incurs no serious financial obligation other than those already imposed under the Old-age Pensions Act. I want the pensioners to receive the money to sympathy. which they are entitled; I do not wish lawyers to obtain a certain amount in have relations. tracing the person or persons to whom these payments ought to be made. Prime Minister were to take the step to of paying old-age pensions in advance, of this kind. instead of in arrears, there would be no further objection to offer. In such circumstances he would be able to say"" Every man has got on the average slightly more than that to which he happen. is entitled."" If a man died thirteen days after the last fortnightly pay., he would have received one day's he was Treasurer? payment more than that to which he was entitled. But at present the Commany cases. monwealth is, I think, suable by latives of every old-age pensioner who died a few days after the last payment. That is the position in a nutshell, and cannot help thinking that unless lation is either amended with a view of doing justice or of legalizing the injustice already done, the Government, some fine morning, will find that they have incurred all sorts of legal penalties by reason of to the payment. their having acted contrary to law. We cannot refuse to pay people something which they are entitled without incurring certain pains and penalties. If a person, at the time of his death, is entitled sum of money from another person, heirs at law have a right to it. I same way an old-age pensioner is entitled to ios. per week up to the time of his death, but that right has not cognised.",17
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,All other pensions are paid up to the date of death.,17
27,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"-Certainly . Of course, it is only fair to say that, in many cases, it is difficult to determine who are the heirs of to be paid old-age pensioners.",17
28,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,There is sometimes it the same difficulty in other cases.,17
29,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Ye t other persons are some paid up to the date of death. I think is that if the heirs-at-law of old-age pensioners had the means to appeal to the law Courts, they could insist upon the same course being followed under the Old-age Paisions Act.",17
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Unles s a man makes a legal claim he cannot obtain is due to an old-age pensioner at the see that the time of his death.,17
31,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Quite so. In old-age pensioners we have a class of the community, of all others, most entitled to our",17
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,They generally,17
33,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But the relations usuallv If the are not in happy enough circumstances insist upon their legal rights in matters,17
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The Treasurer looks into such claims, and pays them if he thinks they are right.",17
35,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That does not always - Mr FISHER - Did the right honourable member for Swan pay such claims when,17
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I did in a great the re Mr KELLY - I hope that the Prime has Minister will treat this question from a non-party stand-point, and deal with it on I its merits. He says that he does not prothis legispose to pay such claims.",17
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Prime Minister did not say he would not pay them. What he said was that there was great difficulty in ascertaining who was entitled,17
38,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not object to the to Department taking somewhat extensive powers in order to be able to pay the friends and relatives of deceased old-age to a pensioners the money to which they are his entitled, without legal cost. n the Mr WEST - The pension amounts to is. 5jd. a day. A man would not be likely to go to law for the sake of recoveryet been reing one day's arrears.",17
39,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But that is no reason why we should refuse to give these people their rights.,17
40,Mr WEST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I agree with the honourable member.,18
41,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"We are dealing with people who are unable, in cases of this kind, to go to law, and that is all the more reason why we should deal generously and openly with them. I am asking only for justice, and am convinced that the House will support, if not my particular proposal, at all events one that will insure rough-and-ready justice to the old age pensioners of Australia.",18
42,Mr WEST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Something has to be done after a pensioner's death.,18
43,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The first thing that the relatives have to do is to bury him. What is the position of an old-age pensioner? A man cannot very well live on ios. a week, and he is dependent, to a considerable extent, upon the kindness of his relatives or friends. Those relatives or friends have to bury him after he dies. Are they not entitled to the amount due to him at his death, in order to give him decent burial ? That is all I ask. It is a simple thing. The last right of a citizen of this Commonwealth is that he be decently buried, and I think that the House might well accede to my proposition. I am not - wedded to the particular wording of the motion. If any one can find a way out that will give justice to the old-age pensioners, while safeguarding the Treasury .against legal costs, no one will be better pleased than I shall be. This is not my particular baby. I shall be very happy to see the motion amended in any way honourable members choose, provided that it - carries out my desire to secure justice to the old-age pensioners who are affected in this regard. I do not think I need detain honourable members much longer. I have put my case, I hope, temperately, and have endeavoured to draw attention to a .grave injustice, which will react on the Department if any speculative lawyer cares to take up cases of the kind on behalf of litigious people.",18
44,Mr BAMFORD,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It does not concern the - old-age pensioner, because he is dead.",18
45,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member says that once a man is dead it is no concern to him how he is buried. My honourable friend is very material, but I venture ""to express the opinion that there are in this - community many who would live less happily than they do if they thought they - were to be buried in a way that those who knew them would consider unworthy. I wish to see every man and woman in this community given decent burial.",18
46,Mr WEST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Why not have cremation?,18
47,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I have no time now to discuss cremation. All that I can say is that what old-age pensioners are entitled to at the date of their death their heirs should receive, in order that they may give them decent burial.  honourable members of the Opposition voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill?",18
48,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I am delighted to have an opportunity to answer that question. When that measure was introduced we were assured that it had to do with nothing more than certain financial adjustments between the States and the Commonwealththat it had nothing to do with old-age pensions.,18
49,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,18
50,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The difficulty is that honourable members give utterance to calumnies on the platform, and that we are, by the rules of the House, debarred from giving any reply. However, I am delighted to have the opportunity to expose this particular calumny so far as the Standing Orders permit. It is well known to all who address themselves to the consideration of public affairs in an honest, straightforward way that no section of this House is opposed to the principle of Commonwealth old-age pensions; and I hope that no member of this House, on the public platform or elsewhere, will express any doubt as to that fact merely in order to cast discredit on political opponents. I have placed . the position very temperately before the House, and I feel confident that the kindly consideration of honourable members will commend it to the Government, and that a remedy will be found for the injustice. *",18
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Swan) [3.2] I am aware that, according to practice, and, I think, the Act and regulations, pension for any broken period in the event of death is not paid. The regulations, I may say, came into force before I assumed office, and I could never see the iustice of this provision, though I did not take steps during the few months I was at the Treasury to alter it. The pensions are paid fortnightly, and not in advance, the first payment having been made a fortnight after the Act came into force. It is probable that a pensioner, in the event of death, will most likely be in debt to the boardinghouse-keeper, or others with whom he has been living, and, under the present regulations that debt will not be paid. That, in my opinion, is not fair, though I well understand that there are difficulties, and that the present method is the more convenient to the Treasury. It might have been possible to pay the pensions in advance; but, in that case,, there would have had to be an alteration in the procedure necessary under the Audit Act, which provides that money must be due before it is paid. In all pensions of which I have any knowledge the pensioners receive payment up to the day of death; and I cannot see why a different plan should be adopted with regard to old-age pensioners, who are generally persons with very slender resources. It is quite possible that a pensioner may have a wife and family or others dependent on him; and it is not reasonable that he should be placed at a disability as compared with other pensioners under the Crown. This does not accord with our ordinary ideas of what is right; and we ought to take a step in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth. In some cases the oid people have homes of their own, though these may not be very sumptuous; and, as sometimes both husband and wife have pensions, the payment, it may be for a full thirteen days, is a great consideration. Something should be done, in view of the fact that, if a pensioner lived a day or two longer, the full amount would be paid. The Treasurer will find it very hard to find arguments against the proposal now made, the only one beingthough really it is no argument at allthat the suggested payment is not convenient. The Treasury may ask to whom the money has to be paid; but the Treasury is not bound to pay .money unless it is demanded, and the right of the person demanding it has been ascertained. cases where letters of administration are necessary, the Treasury has to be satisfied that the payment is justified. I know that the Treasury often pays money to relatives and other persons if it is satisfied as to the right of those persons, the advice of the Crown Solicitor usually being taken on the point. In the event of a case not being made out, the Treasury has only to hold its hand and demand letters of administration, or some other Sir John Forrest. proof. As to the death of an old-age pensioner without any funds at all, the amount due would be useful at such a time.",18
52,Mr BAMFORD,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It cannot be more than,19
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Pensioner s need not draw the money every fortnight, but, with certain limitations, may draw larger sums at longer intervals. But even the small amount of £ i is useful in a house in time of trouble and death; and as we have entered upon this beneficent measure, we might go a step further. I am not going to press the matter on the Government, because it is for them to decide what should be done. I can only advise what I take to be the right and proper course.",19
54,Mr GLYNN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Angas) [3.10] - Sectio n 40 of the Pensions Act provides that pension money must be claimed by the pensioner within twenty-one days of the date on which it is due, and that he must produce his certificate. That makes it impossible for the Treasury to pay arrears accrued on a pensioner's death, or to make a regulation of which the Auditor-General would approve allowing that to be done. The existence of letters of administration in these cases cannot be contemplated, because, generally, the pensioners have nothing to leave. If a pensioner had ^ 5 0 or so in a savings bank, his next of kin could, under the Savings Bank Acts of most of the States, obtain it on mere application and proof of identity. That is the law in South Australia in regard to Savings Bank deposits not exceeding £ 5 0 . I suggest to the Treasurer that we might adopt a principle similar to that of the friendly societies, which allows persons to nominate others, whose names are entered on the books of the society, as those who shall benefit at their death, no letters: of administration or other proof being required. Similarly, every pensioner might be allowed to nominate a person who, on In his death, should receive the accrued arrears of pensions.",19
55,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But that could not be provided for without an alteration of the law.,19
56,Mr GLYNN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I think it would require an amending Act. We might provide that a pensioner should be allowed tr> nominate some one to the Registrar, and thus dispense with letters of administration and other proof. On a pensioner's death being established, the Department would pay to the person nominated whatever amount had accrued. Of course, a claim would have to be made within a certain time, unless there was sufficient reason for postponing it.",19
57,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [34J-- I thank the honourable member for T Angas for his suggestion. The honourable member for Wentworth is right in saying that I admitted in a conversation that this # was a very difficult and expensive matter to deal with from the Treasurer's point of view. It is a mistake to think that I am hard-hearted. I am merely following the example of my predecessors.,20
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Labour Government came into power to reform everything.,20
59,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is so. The right honourable member for Swan, who seconded the motion, admitted that, although he was Treasurer for a period ten times as long as that during which I have occupied the position, he did nothing to remedy this anomaly.",20
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It was never brought .up.,20
61,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The right honourable member's inaction does not in any way reflect on his goodness of heart. The honourable member for Angas properly states that the law forbids us to pay any sum that may have accrued between the date of the last payment of a pension and the pensioner's death. The Commonwealth has no desire to keep back the money from next of kin, but it has no legal power to pay it. On an average 500 pensioners die every month, and the work involved in ascertaining those legally entitled to arrears, could arrears be paid, would cost probably not less than jQz in every case, and in some cases £4. or £5.",20
62,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I suggested a rough-andready procedure.,20
63,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It will be admitted that, as a matter of abstract justice, a pensioner or his next of kin should, if possible, receive every penny of the pension payable to him. The suggestion of the honourable member for Angas that every pensioner should nominate some one to whom an accrued balance might be paid in the event of his death seems a feasible way out of the difficulty, and one that would relieve the Commonwealth of great trouble and expense.",20
64,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am ready to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas, and to amend the motion so as to give effect to it.",20
65,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not object to the motion being passed in that form. The Government are willing to pay what is due to the pensioner or those he leaves behind him, but they do not wish to give an opportunity to lawyers and others to earn money in settling the affairs of old-age pensioners, nor do they desire to be involved in legal proceedings or expense. Probably the best thing to do will be to provide that future payments of invalid and old-age pensions shall be taken to be payments in advance.",20
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That would save a lot of trouble.,20
67,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No substantial injustice would be done by that arrangement. The Government propose to reduce before next Christmas, the age at which women will be eligible for pensions, and to provide for invalid pensioners. It seems to me that when we issue a proclamation dealing with those matters we might also provide that pensions shall be considered to be paid in advance. We desire to do all that is possible to make the pensioners happy and secure in their pensions.",20
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,-Person s who are not entitled to pensions should be prevented from getting them. Many persons who are not entitled to pensions get them.,20
69,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The right honourable member has put his finger on a sore spot. Furthermore, if arrears of pensions were payable after pensioners' deaths, there would be persons who would try to earn a little in connection with the recovery of the money, even though the amounts would not be greater than 10s. or £ 1 . This would involve the Commonwealth in expense, and might put us to the indignity of having to appear in Court.",20
70,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member suggest that the pensions of persons who have died should be considered to have been paid in advance?,20
71,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Legall y there is no obligation on the Commonwealth to pay arrears of pensions to the next of kin of a deceased pensioner. The only question is one of equity, and it is very difficult to determine who should get the few shillings due to a pensioner on the date of his death. The Government do not wish to be hard hearted, but I think that it would not be unfair or unjust to say that in future all pensions shall be considered to be paid in advance.",20
72,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member speak of future or existing pensions?,20
73,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not suggest that the present pensioners should be paid' an extra fortnight's pension; but the first payment to new pensioners might well be taken to be a payment in advance. Then if the pensioner died next day no one except the ""Government would suffer any loss. At the jpresent time the legal assumption is that the payment is in advance. What I suggest appears a safe way out of the difficulty.",21
74,Mr LIVINGSTON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Barker) [3.25]. - I am pleased that the honourable member for Wentworth has brought this matter forward, because I know of several cases of hardship. In one instance a pensioner obtained credit, and the person who gave it was not able to secure'repayment out of the - amount of pension which had accrued between the date of the pensioner's death and :the date of the last payment of the pension. 'Then, at Kalangadoo, pensions were not paid for several months because the post office is situated on railway premises, and the Railways Commissioner could not see his way to allow the stationmaster to undertake the work. There the pensioners were several months without receiving their money, and, in the meantime were getting a little credit. One of them died without receiving any of his pension at all, although it should have been paid for several months beforehand. The relatives thought that they could collect the arrears, but found that they could not. That is one case of hardship, and I hope that when it is brought under the notice of the Treasurer he will see his way to pay the money to the relatives. I am sure that if he looks into the case he will do justice, because it is a deserving one.",21
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Hume) [3.26]. - I do not think that, so far as the discussion has gone, the matter is quite settled. I understood at first that the Treasurer said the pensions would be taken as paid in advance, and that he meant by that that the pensions are due, and if they are not paid, they are still the property of the pensioners, so that if a pensioner dies in the meantime some one has to take the responsibility of receiving the money. The method suggested now by the Treasurer does not get away from the fact that sometimes there is money held in the Treasury to which the pensioner is entitled.",21
76,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It gets the Commonwealth out of the difficulty.,21
77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The amounts due in these cases are so small, as they can only be due for a fortnight, or, possibly, in some cases, a month, that the Treasurer or his officers ought to ascertain, if they can, to whom they are due, and pay them. The Treasurer ought to be indemnified for making those payments, and I think we can trust any Treasurer to see that they are made to some one to whom they are rightfully due. If , as hi the case suggested by the honourable member for Barker, persons have advanced money to the pensioner, as is often done, they ought to receive a certificate that so much is due to them, so that if anything happens to the pensioner that certificate can be produced, and the Treasurer ought to be indemnified for honoring it at once.",21
78,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Unde r the present Act there is no power to pay, even in those circumstances.",21
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If there is no legal power, I think the Treasurer is right in saying that there should be an amendment of the Act. The Treasurer should have power to pay if he is satisfied, instead of going through the rigmarole of going to a lawyer's office, because these pensioners and their relatives are mostly people who can ill afford to pay legal costs. If the Treasurer will take the responsibility, and pay the money, I am sure no one will take exception to that course, but it would be better to make it technically legal by an amendment of the Act or by issuing a proclamation.",21
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Parramatta) [3.29] - I entirely agree with the last suggestion of the honourable member for Hume. That is a way out of the difficulty. A great deal more is being made of these difficulties than there need be. The Government could not go far wrong if they simply used the machinery that they at present have to find out the bona - fides of these payments. The legal position would need to be tested only when some mistake had been made. The Government have certain agents who now, on their behalf, look after the business of paying old-age pensions. The bank, or the Deputy Commissioner, or the person responsible, whoever he might be, could find out the bona fides of payments of this kind in precisely the same way as they now find out everything about an old-age pensioner before he is considered eligible for a pension. That process is tedious in the extreme, and wants simplifying greatly. I have cases of my own which have been under the consideration of the Department for three or four months. The Department are still inquiring, and still finding out. Surely while they are doing all that kind of thing at the beginning of the pension, the same machinery could be set in motion to save the Government from paying any money to a person not properly entitled to it. agree with the Treasurer, that he ought to set his face like flint against anybody making money out of these old-age pension payments.",21
81,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,And leading the Commonwealth into great expense at the same time.,22
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Exactly . But I do not see why the Treasurer could not avail himself of the machinery that he already has to insure the bona fides of these payments.,22
83,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The law is against it. The money must be paid to the pensioner, and he must give a receipt.",22
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,O r somebody to who acts for the pensioner.,22
85,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I think not.,22
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Tak e the case of old-age pensioners who have been inmates of benevolent asylums, in my ""own district. Very often, before an old man can get out of an institution, and become a pensioner, he has to nominate some person to receive the money, and look after it for him.",22
87,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is in cases where he is not competent to look after his own estate, but that part of the law does not app-ly to these cases.",22
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I do not see why the same process should not be followed to insure the proper destination of money in case the pensioner dies.,22
89,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Old-ag e pensioners .who are capable of managing their own affairs would not allow any one to be appointed to look after the money for them.,22
90,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"As a matter of fact, the Government will not allow an old man to come out of one of those homes until he has somebody to take his money for him, and make himself responsible for its wise expenditure. If that is the case today, what is the difference between using that machinery to insure the proper destination of the money while the pensioner lives, and using the same machinery to see that the money goes to its proper destination when the pensioner is no longer in need of it? I see no difficulty, but if technicality in the law prevents it, it-is the easiest thing possible for a Bill to be brought down to correct it. I strongly advise the Prime Minister to do that, and so put the matter beyond doubt. It cannot be right that the State should engage to pay these old men their pensions, and keep part of the money back because death I overtakes them. In many cases, the pension does not liquidate all the liabilities of a pensioner who is sick, and the person who looks after him, and acts as nurse to him during his illness, often without special payment, is surely entitled to receive what little residue of money is due. I am sure the Prime Minister can-find a way out of the difficulty if he sets about doing it. I shall move an amendment to make the matter clear. If carried, it will give the Treasurer the authority of die House to take this course, even if it involves a technical' breach of the law. What if the law isstretched a little in a case of a charity of"" this kind, and, unfortunately, we have still' regard these old-age pensions as charities.",22
91,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I do not.,22
92,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member cannot get out of it while the law/ exists as it is.,22
93,Mr WEST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Every person who lives to the age of sixty-five ought to be entitled to it.,22
94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I think so, ton. The matter will never be on a satisfactory basis until every element and attribute of charity is eliminated from it. In the meantime, I shall move an amendment to give the Government the requisite authority to make these payments.",22
95,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Auditor-General would not allow us.,22
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I suppose the Auditor-General overlooks worse cases than that.,22
97,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member never said anything worse than that in his life.,22
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I know of many matters which do not appeal, to the pathos of our human life such as this one does, but which are still outstanding between the Auditor-General and the Departments. The question of legality is constantly cropping: up in nearly all the Departments with; regard to the payments they make from time to time. I do not think the Prime Minister would go very far wrong if he "" chanced"" it in the cause of charity. some Charity covers a multitude of sins, but the honourable member need not even regard the question from that stand-point, for he could bring down a small amendment of the Act, put it through in one night, and so make his action legal. I move That after the word ""deceased"" the following words be added :- "" or such person as old-age pensioner has nominated."" That will give him the right, before his death, to bequeath, so to speak, the balance due to him. If that is not lawful, at rate it obeys every other law in the world stances ? except the mere dry statute law. I am sure the Prime Minister would get the consent of every member in the House to an alteraan tion of the Act if it is necessary. I want coppers. to raise another matter in connection with old-age pensions-the question of the mates of hospitals and benevolent asylums. I raised it more than once when my own colleague was at the Treasury, and some of if thing should be done as speedily as possible.",22
99,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member think the inmates ought to receive the pensions?,23
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I think the hosmonwealth pitals ought to receive payment when pensioner is an inmate.,23
101,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member voted against that when I moved in that direction.,23
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I do not think I did.,23
103,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member will not be in order in discussing the matter which he has just raised, even on the amendment that, he has moved.",23
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am going to put myself in order by moving as a furwould, ther amendment following that which I have just indicated, the addition of the words and is further of the opinion that payment should be made by the Government to the pital authorities when and so long as sioner is an inmate of any such hospital.",23
105,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,We must first deal with the original amendment.,23
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I intend these words, sir, to form part of the one amendintention ment. My idea is that the Government should make some payment to the authorithe ties when an old-age pensioner becomes inmate of a hospital. I understand that the rule now is to pay nothing to the hosin pital during the time that the pensioner sick. The pension accumulates to the, tent of twenty-eight days while the penit. sioner is in the hospital, and upon his discharge he receives the amount that has accrued.  to keep all persons in indigent circumstances, who become inmates?",23

109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And the rule the hospitals is that a man shall pay, he can, for his treatment.",23
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The hospitals sue pretty readily in such cases. ,23
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"In New South Wales it was the rule, prior to the Comtaking over the payment of oldthe age pensions from the State Government, to pay the hospital authorities 5s. per week in respect of old-age pensioners who were inmates, and to save the remaining 5s. per week for the inmates to receive on leaving. Nowadays the Federal Government pays nothing in such cases to the hospitals.  pitals have to treat these old people, and to keep them, if there were no old-age pensions ?",23
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Of course they but the principle underlying the payment of old-age pensions is that these old people shall be relieved of the stigma of pauperism. We have no right to treat them as if they were paupers in the strict hossense of the term. It is wrong for the the penGovernment to throw upon the private charity of the community the whole burden of keeping an old-age pensioner when he happens to be sick. I do not think that the Government are carrying out the and purpose of the Act so long as they refuse to make some payment to hospital authorities while old-age penan sioners are inmates of such institutions. What an idea it' is that we should bring this beneficent legislation, and, when is an old-age pensioner is sick, and in need exof even more sympathy and consideration than usual, should stop the payments under",23
113,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Mone y accur3ular.es to his credit in such circumstances.,24
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The pension accumulates for twenty-eight days, and if the pensioner remains in the hospital for six months, the Government saves five months' pay. That system cannot be defended upon any humanitarian ground, nor upon any fair business-like consideration of the whole matter. These hospitals, private in the sense that private subscriptions support them, are not rich, and I contend that the Government should pay those in which there are old-age pensioners, not perhaps the full pension, but some allowance, as was done under the State system in New South Wales. I think, by the way, that the provision for the accumulation of the pension for twenty-eight days relates only to inmates of benevolent asylums, and not to the case of pensioners in hospitals.",24
115,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No , it applies in both cases.",24
116,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I think that that is so, but I shall verify the statement in a few moments.",24
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It is only fair that the Government should make some payment to hospitals. for the care and treatment of old-age pensioners. electorates of Parramatta and Nepean there are a number of old-age pensioners who are inmates of these institutions, and the tax upon the hospital authorities is a very heavy one.  it was before old-age pensions were paid?",24
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It is greater than it was under the State system in New South Wales, because the hospital authorities then received from the Government 5s. per week in respect of every old-age pensioner who was an inmate. They saved the remaining 5s. per week as a little bonus to help these old people to convalescence when they came out.",24
119,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The pensioners themselves received nothing.,24
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I thought they did. Some allowance, at all events, was made by the State Government for the fact that the hospital authorities took over from the State the care and control of these pensioners and nursed them back to health. The Federal Government ought not to allow old-age pensioners to be so burdensome to local hospitals. In New South Wales they are concentrated in various places. concentrated particularly in the electorates of Parramatta and Nepean, and they all go to the one local hospital, which is feeling the burden very keenly.",24
121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The position is the same in Hobart and Launceston.,24
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I dare say that it is. If the Government cannot meet the position in any other way, they ought to make some special grant to hospitals and benevolent asylums caring for these old people, who are gathered from every quarter of each State.",24
123,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If the honourable member had only thought this way last session it would have been all right. We then moved in this direction, and he opposed us.",24
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If the honourable member did so then, I suppose there will be no trouble now.",24
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If the Government would pay portion of the pensions to the hospitals who look after these old people, that would be a reasonable course to pursue.",24
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is all that I am asking.,24
127,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,And the honourable member and some of his party voted against In the such a proposition last year.,24
128,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,We did not.,24
129,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member is another who voted against it. I refer him to Hansard, vol. L . , page 1602.",24
130,Mr JOSEPH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,COOK - At that page I find this statement,24
131,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I ask leave to withdraw my motion.,24
132,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That was a motion dissenting from the Chairman's ruling. Look at the division list.,24
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,There is no division of that kind shown - The honourable member ought not to try to make party capital out of a proposal of this kind.,24
134,Mr ROBERTS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is a shockingly inold-age correct statement. There were two divisions on the question.,24
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"At all events, I hope we shall have the honourable member's support in the effort we are now making to secure a modicum of justice to the local hospitals, which relieve the Government of the duty of attending to these old people while they are sick and incapable of looking after themselves. By the adoption of the motion as amended I think we shall take a step forward in liberalising They are this humanitarian legislation. We shall make it, at any rate, more just than it is, and somewhat more liberal, both to the pensioners themselves and to the local authorities, who are now excessively burdened.",24
136,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Calare) [3-53]-- I do not think that the amendment will secure the object which the honourable member has in view, or avoid the difficulties that have occurred, from a legal stand-point, in connection with these payments. In New South Wales we had a State Old-age Pensions Act in operation for some years, and if a pensioner became an inmate of a public hospital his pension practically ceased. The Government made it a practice, however, to allow the authorities of the hospital of which he was an inmate a direct payment of 5s. per week whilst he remained there. One of the grievances of pensioners so situated was that on leaving the hospital they had tn wait a month before the next payment was due, and that they were thus left without money at a time when they were most in need of it. Very often these old people are only convalescent when they are turned out practically without any money. The principle of recognising the claims of "" hospitals of this kind was debated in the last Parliament, but was not adopted. However, the Administration, recognising that pensioners have some claims, agreed to pay the pension for twenty-eight days after the pensioner has been sent to a hospital, - though, if he mains for a longer period no further payment is made. Only the other day I had a conversation with the secretary of one of the leading hospitals in my electorate, and he told me that the Commonwealth system had its advantages. Very often, I was told, the pensioners did not remain in the hospitals for any considerable length of time, and it was to their credit that they recognised their obligations, and were always ready to make a reasonable payment out of the money paid to them for the twenty-eight days.",25
137,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The pensioners cannot have much left for themselves !,25
138,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"But they have a little left; whereas under the State law they had nothing. There is a general feeling amongst hospital authorities that some arrangement, similar to that which obtained under the New South Wales Pensions Act, should be made in the case of Commonwealth pensioners. The officer to whom I have referred informed me that on no occasion had a pensioner treated in his hospital refused to pay a fair share of the amount he received; but, of course, that, is a matter which rests with the pensioner, who may refuse, while the hospital authorities are powerless to insist. It must be remembered that a pensioner may have to remain much longer than twenty-eight days under hospital treatment, and in such case, under the present plan, no return whatever can be made to the hospital.. 1 trust that the proposal of the honourable member for Parramatta will be regarded as reasonable, and I strongly recommend it to the favourable consideration of the Government, so that hospitals may receive a fair proportion of the pension, not only for twenty-eight days, but for the whole time that a pensioner may be within their walls. I am in sympathy with the object of the honourable member for Wentworth, but I do not think that the method proposed is the best to attain it. The honourable member asks that the payments shall be made to the heirs of the pensioner.",25
139,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I have accepted an amendment substituting a person to be nominated by the deceased.,25
140,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That , of course, removes considerable objection, because, if that provision were allowed to remain, it would give rise to those very legal difficulties that the Prime Minister is striving to avoid.",25
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I have submitted re- an amendment to add the words "" or such person as the pensioner may nominate.""",25
142,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Then that means that . the words as to the heir remain ?,25
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I desire to give the pensioner the right to say to whom the money shall be paid.,25
144,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"A pensioner has that right at present, and no motion is therefore required.",25
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That right does not operate after his death.,25
146,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I believe the honourable member is right, and that the money is forfeited after death. What is sought by the motion is that the money shall be paid to some one who has taken an interest in the pensioner, and not some one who merely makes a claim as heir-atlaw. Most pensioners have very few friends, though I know many who receive the greatest kindness from persons interested in them. The Department has discovered that heirs-at-law secure legal assistance, and the claims have to be contested at a cost which is sometimes greater than the amount involved. In my opinion, the best way to secure the object we have in view would be to strike out the words "" to the heir or heirs-at-law of the deceased "" and insert in their place "" in satisfaction of the just debts incurred by the pensioner.""",25
147,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The just debts might easily exceed the amount of the pension.,26
148,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Department is only required to meet the debts to the extent of the money due.,26
149,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The storekeeper, for stance, might get the money instead of the nurse.",26
150,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Demay have every consideration. partment would be able to determine the claims as they were submitted.,26
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That would be a very unpleasant duty in some cases.,26
152,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Not more in unpleasant than determining who are the heirs-at-law. Very often the person nomiThe nated might not have any debt against the pensioner, and that person would have to determine to whom the money should be paid, and he ""might recognise the - claim of the nurse as against that of the storekeeper or others whose position was not so strong in equity.",26
153,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,In any case it is more portant to adopt the principle than to talk out the motion.,26
154,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not Treasurer wish the principle to be stated in garbled terms, which do not express the end in view. I hope the honourable member will drop the reference to the heirs-at-law.",26
155,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I have already dropped it.,26
156,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Suppos e a pensioner has no debts?,26
157,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Then the that money will go back to the Department.,26
158,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"After all, it is the pensioner's money, and he ought to be to leave it to whom he likes.",26
159,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"When a brought pensioner nominates a person to draw the for Wentworth. pension, he does not intend to leave the money to that person.",26
160,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Any beneficiary under a will has to meet the just debts of the ceased.,26
161,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The amount of the pension is so small that I am afraid it would take more than the money from the Department to get a will proved.,26
162,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,My honourable friend is taking points.,26
163,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Not at all ; but, if so, I am only following the example of the honourable member. I desire that people who may not be related to the pensioner, but who may have incurred expense in providing medical attendance and so forth, should be recouped.",26
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is exactly what we are providing for.,26
165,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member seems to take a peculiar way of doing so. I admit there is a germ of incorrect principle in the motion; and I hope the Prime Minister will take the sense of the House so that fair and just claims,26
166,Mr CANN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Nepean) [4.8] - I am somewhat interested in this question, seeing that there are upwards of 2,000 of my constituents in benevolent asylums; and I am sympathy with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parramatta. inmates of these institutions suffer a certain amount of hardship. It is perfectly true that, once within the walls, they have to nominate some one outside to be responsible for them if they desire to be discharged; and, if such a condition be imposed, it is only fair that there should bea provision such as that proposed by imthe - honourable member for Parrama'.ra, because, otherwise, the person nominated is bound to suffer injustice. I trust the will give favourable consideration to the proposal, which, if carried, will prove a great boon to the pensioner inmates of benevolent institutions. The condition that a pensioner shall nominate some one to be responsible for him very often proves irksome, and large numbers of old people so circumstanced regard themselves as almost prisoners. I trust the Treasurer will see his way clear to make the lot of these poor people easier.",26
167,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Wide Bay-Treasurer ) able [4.11] - The proposal now before the House goes further than that originally forward by the honourable memher,26
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I purposely left the terms of the amendment open, to give the deGovernment discretion in the matter. . Mr FISHER - The proposition now is so open that it has no limitation.",26
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Then the honordue able member can suggest one.,26
170,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Unde r this proposal, if the honourable member were to set up a hospital and take in old-age pensioners, he could secure the payment of their pensions to himself.",26
171,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"A man could not keep a pensioner in a hospital for three times the amount of the pension. Mr FISHER.""-We know that there are old-age pensioners who cannot look after themselves, and there are, unfortunately, those who are prepared to make money by looking after them, perhaps in places which hospitals might be called hospitals.",27
172,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member for Parramatta will accept any alteration of his proposal which will make it clearer.,27
173,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I should like him to let me know what is in his mind.,27
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I meant public hosthe pitals.,27
175,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Is it intended that the whole of a pension shall be paid tq a hosthat pital during the time that the an inmate of it?,27
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I have left it to ject to that. the Government to decide that. In New South Wales hospitals used to draw half of the pensions of old-age pensioners were inmates.,27
177,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"In my opinion, the States which have been relieved of the obcomment. ligation to pay old-age pensions, and will soon be largely relieved of the obligation to pay invalid pensions, have acted rather ungenerously, in constantly claiming payAdelaide. ment for small seivices in connection with administration.",27
178,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Why does the Comalways monwealth cease to pay to a pensioner while he is the inmate of a hospital?,27
179,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Because so long as he is in a hospital, provision is being made his support; but the pension is allowed accrue ior a term ot twenty-eight days, that on leaving the hospital the pensioner may have 40s. with which to make a new start. It must be remembered that the public hospitals are institutions where not be paid? only old-age pensioners, but also all other citizens who cannot afford to pay for medical and surgical attendance elsewhere, may be properly treated, and why should they be paid for the treatment of old-age pentar sioners, seeing they are not paid for the are cared for. treatment of those who are not pensioners and cannot afford to pay for themselves ?",27
180,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But at present the Commonwealth makes money out of the illligious ness of an old-age pensioner.,27
181,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is an oblique way of looking at the matter. If a person were hand. receiving ios. or £ 1 a week as a pension from a private employer, the hospital would not expect to receive part of that sum for its attendance on him. Apparently the desire of honourable members is that, instead of the pension accumulating for only four weeks, while the pensioner is in hospital, it should accumulate indefinitely, until he comes out again; but that is not the object expressed by the amendment.",27
182,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,We desire that the which care for old-age pensioners shall be paid for doing so.,27
183,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It seems to me that the motion says one thing, and that what honourable members desire is something quite different. The pensions either belong to pensioners, or they do not. If it be held that the pensioners are entitled to draw their pensions whether in hospital or not, is a proposal different from the one pensioner is we have before us.",27
184,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Personally , I do not ob",27
185,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"There is a good deal who of new-born zeal evident on the part of honourable members opposite, though about that. I do not wish to make any further",27
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I hope that the honourable member has not in his mind the statement of the honourable member for,27
187,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I need not apologize for my position in this matter. I have been in earnest in regard to old-age pensions. What I think about the proposal of the honourable member is that, if it were determined to pay any part of the pension for to some person or institution other than to the pensioner, it would be difficult to say so where to stop. I should like to know, too, what is meant by a public hospital. Does not the proposal raise . the consideration whetlier private hospitals should not also Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Ver y few pensioners are inmates of private hospitals.",27

We must be logical, and cannot deal with this matter with a wave of the MrKELLY - We are not now legislating; what is before the House is merely a motion. If it be adopted, the Minister can safeguard the Treasury as he may think proper.",27
190,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is so. The details of administration to which I have referred cannot be settled off-hand.,28
191,Mr KELLV,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Accep t the principle, and look into the details afterwards.",28

193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I desire to make a personal explanation. When I was speaking previously the honourable member for Adelaide interjected that I and others on this side voted last session against proposition that hospitals should receive State since Federation. the pensions when the pensioners were instances, mates. I have looked up the debate which the honourable member directed attention, and can find nothing of the So far from it being the case, we were against it, but in favour of it ; and that the person who was against it was the honourable member for Adelaide himself. He is reported to have said, on 22nd 1909, Hansard, page 1598So far as asylums are concerned, I am prepared to follow the honourable member, cause I understand there are private asylums Victoria, and as there is no definition of the term "" as y l u m "" in the Act, any asylum, vate or public, would be entitled to the",28

Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. TASMANIA: CUSTOMS LEAKAGE. Debate resumed from 4th August (vide page 1126), on motion by Mr JENSENThat, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the State of Tasmania be granted a sum of Twenty-five thousand pounds yearly by the Commonwealth for a period of nine years, to recoup the said State for the loss sustained in Customs leakage since the advent of Federation.  derstand that the honourable member for New England on the last occasion intimated his intention to move to strike out certain words from the motion. In his' absence I shall move that amendment. I move That the words "" in Customs leakage"" be left out. Judging from the past admissions of Treasurers and others who have made inquiry into the position of Tasmania, it is evident that she has suffered very considerably as It is not so clear that this has been altogether caused person by leakagethrough the Customs. There and is is a consensus of opinion that a certain amount of leakage has taken place, but some difficulty in arriving at the actual amount. Section 96 of the Constitution gives power to assist a State situated as - Tasmania is at the present time. A still greater reason for supporting the motion is that Tasmania has increased her direct, the taxation to double the extent of any other In the circumit is only due to Tasmania that the to Commonwealth should come to her asmy sistance. The case has been well stated kind. on behalf of Tasmania by her representanot tives, and I shall content myself with movI find ing the amendment I have indicated.",28
196,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Wentworth) [4.33] - I do not quite understand what the omission of July, the words "" in Customs leakage"" wiil really mean. It is practically impossiblenot to assess the loss that any State has sufbefered from Federation, if you take that in loss in its broad, abstract meaning, in thepriway now suggested by the honourable mempayment. ber for Grey. What we were previouslyasked to vote upon was a very simple prolikely position with which I have already expressed myself as in some sympathy. .1. bewaited, - of course, before definitely depenciding, to hear the statement of the Prime Minister on the subject, and I regret that he has not given it to us this afternoon.  for Ballarat suggested this amendment.",28
197,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I should like to know how far it will carry. Might it be that any State has suffered loss of decreasing manufactures under the Tariff? Any person, for instance, goes to Launceston will see on the outskirts of the town, in the shape of an soap factory, near the river, a monument Federation. to the Tariff that used to exist in Tasmania against imports from Victoria. There a number of other factories like that one, which used to be protected against torian and New South Wales competition, but have been closed up under Inter-State Free Trade. This might be held to be loss suffered by the State since Federation. It might be argued by some persons that, inasmuch as taxpayers of the State had suffered a loss, in wages, and industries had leader. suffered a loss in output, therefore the State had suffered loss as the direct .result of entering the Federation, and Commonwealth ought to recoup it. know the honourable member for Grey cloes not intend that, but the bald words of motion as amended may give rise to a numtion ber of misunderstandings, and somewhat difficult for people who are trying to keep up the end of Commonwealth popularity in those States which are not altogether satisfied under the Union. I not think we ought to pass a motion which, by its vague terms, may excite a number of people to think that they are going get far more than we intend to give In the absence of the several times ferred explanation of the Prime Minister, I am inclined to support the proposition to make up to Tasmania her loss in Customs leakage. That is a definite or an approximately computable amount, but it is impossible to compute the loss sustained in any State since the inception of Federation. Further, is the ioss susquestion tained since the advent of Federation be held to be loss sustained owing to havposition ing joined the Federation? To what loss will the motion as amended refer, and how sustained?  - nearly ,£200,000 per year in her Customs revenue.",29
198,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If the honourable memI ber says that, well and good. If he menought tions the loss that he proposes to recoup, it is all right; but the loss which the tion, as amended, would refer to, would be absolutely unrestricted, because it would mean any loss sustained anyhow since the .advent of Federation.  held to the amount of .£25,000 per annum by virtue mentioned in the motion.",29
199,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is so; but the who motion, by implication, says that that £25,000 covers the whole loss which Tasold mania has sustained by any means since That implication will immediately raise a whole network of arguare ment in rebuttal, especially the ex parte argument that is based upon the prejudices Vicof this or that section of the Commonwealth. I see no objection to the term "" in Customs leakage."" I do not think it is a offensive to the present or past holders of the position of Minister of Customs.  by the honourable member's own",29
200,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I did not hear him. the Was he hyper-sensitive as to the feelings 1 of present or past Customs Ministers?  the it a question of Customs leakage. Sec96 provides for this being done if the make it Commonwealth thinks necessary.,29
201,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"We . all understand that we have power to supplement the finances of the smaller States, but there is nothing do in the Constitution to prevent us informing the State benefited exactly why we propose to benefit it. That is fair not to only to that State, but to the rest of Austhem. tralia, from which we take the money. deHere we have a definite statement of au injustice suffered by reason of Customs leakage, and it is for that reason that we are supporting Tasmania. We are supporting her claim not because she is somewhat embarrassed financially, but purely because she has suffered at the hands of the Commonwealth. If we open out the by omitting these words, we then to ask whether Tasmania has reached such a financially, that, apart altogether from Customs leakage and other matters, she is entitled to demand our financial support to maintain her financial stability. No representative of Tasmania would suggest that she has reached that stage. I agree that that State is in somewhat difficult circumstances, and am willing to do all can to meet her in her difficulty, but we to state in this motion the reason for which we are prepared to grant this sum, moso that the people who sent us here will realise tiiat what we are doing is to remedy an injustice, and not to confer benefit on a particular section of the people at the cost of the rest of the community.",29
202,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Cowper) [-4.44] - The motion as amended assumes quite a different aspect from that which it originall,y presented. The contention of the mover was that Tasmania should be recouped by the Commonwealth in respect of a Customs leakage assumed to have occurred owing to the fact that large quantities of goods consumed in Tasmania had been imported in the first place into other States, and that, under the bookkeeping system, the Customs duty collected upon them, had not been credited to her. Whatever may be said in regard to the matter we need to know first of all how this leakage has been brought about. The statement of the mover of the motion, and those who have supported him is that residents of Tasmania, from choice, prefer to buy their goods in Melbourne or Sydney, and tiiat they carry them to their homes in such a way that Inter-State certificates are not issued in respect of them. In this way, they claim that Tasmania has lost considerable revenue, and that she ought to be recouped in respect of that loss. Why do the people of Tasmania do this? On the admission of those who support the motion, it is that they find that they can buy to better advantage in Victoria and New South Wales than in their own State. Whose fault is that? It is certainly not the fault of the Commonwealth, nor is it due to the Commonwealth Tariff. fault lies with the business people of Tasmania, who are unable, apparently, to compete with business houses in other States. They cannot be observing such business principles as would induce the people generally to obtain from them what they want.",30
203,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But Inter-State certificates are not obtained in respect of many of the goods purchased in other States by visitors from Tasmania.,30
204,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"My point is that the business people of Tasmania are responsible for the leakage, if any occurs, rather than the people of that State, who make purchases in other parts of the Commonwealth. If I had a business house, and my customers, after a time, passed my doors to buy elsewhere, the fault would rest with me. The trouble would be either that I was unable to supply them with the goods they required, or that I charged too much for them. The business people of Tasmania could remedy the trouble by importing their own goods, and selling them at a price that would meet with public approval. I rise, however, not to advise the business people of Tasmania how they should conduct their establishments, but, first of all, to ask upon what basis the determination has been arrived at that Tasmania has suffered a loss of £25,000 per annum during the last nine years. What data have we to justify the claim? The nine years' period represents the life of the Federation, and I wish to know whether Tasmania has suffered this loss as the result of Federation. It may be, and perhaps, is true, that there has been a diminution in the amount of Customs duty collected in that State since Federation, but when we speak of a loss under one heading, we have also to ask ourselves whether there has not been a gain in other respects. Has Tasmania gained nothing under Federation? Has she not secured under it in Melbourne and Sydney markets that she did not possess before?",30
205,Mr FOWLER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And , above all, a market in Western Australia?",30
206,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I thank the honourable member for his interjection. Was it not the promise of such markets that induced Tasmania to enter the Federation ? Was she not hampered in the sale of her products, particularly her fruit and potatoes, by not having a market of her own?",30
207,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,No . She had just as The good a market as she has today.,30
208,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"When we are considering a loss, we must not forget to look at both sides of the ledger. Whilst Tasmania may have lost in the direction ; indicated, the fact remains that she has been, as the result of Federation, a considerable gainer. On the admission of the representatives of that State, the people of Tasmania find in Sydney a market which they never had before, and they admit that it is a better market than they could get anywhere else. Before supporting a motion of this kind, I wish to be thoroughly satisfied that Tasmania can establish a claim to have suffered any loss whatever. She must show that she has suffered a loss under Federation by reason of Customs leakage, and I want to be assured that, as a set-off against that loss, she has not gained by an increase in the values of her products, as the result of securing a wider market. The mover of the motion, and those who support it, will have some difficulty in showing that Tasmania has suffered a loss of £25,000 per annum. If it were proved that, as the result of Federation, that loss had been sustained, we should be able to consider whether or not it was advisable that she should be recouped. On the evidence at present before us, however, we could not think of granting this sum. Tasmania went into Federation with her eyes open. In the Senate she has the same representation as the larger States; and she has obtained, under Federation, a market for her goods which she did not previously possess. If this sum of £25,000 per annum is to be paid for nine years, where is it to come from? It must come from some of the other States; and I should like to know when this sort of thing is going to stop. It is becoming rather monotonous to find that some of the States, either because of new financial arrangements, or from other causes, are bearing more than their fair share of the cost of Federation. Tasmania, as I have said, entered the Federation with her eyes open, and the people of that State have a responsibility to themselves. We do not desire to press that side of the question to a greater extent than is necessary to secure reasonable conditions ; but we should not be acting fairly if we accepted an ex parte statement that Tasmania had suffered a loss. It must be shown that there has been a general lossthat, taking the losses in respect of some items, and the gains in respect of others, there has been an actual loss. I should be glad to have evidence to satisfy me that a general loss had been sustained by Tasmania, and not merely a loss in respect of only one item. . 1 sympathize with any State that has actually suffered a pecuniary loss as the result of Federation; and recognise that, in such cases, the Commonwealth can afford assistance. But, in this instance, the claim for consideration has not been clearly established ; and I cannot see my way at present to support the motion. It will rest with others who follow me to prove that there has been such a loss as is alleged, and that the gain in other respects has not made good that loss.",30
209,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"North Sydney) [4.50] - I should like to explain, Mr. Speaker, that when this motion was last under discussion, I moved an amendment providing for the reduction of the amount claimed from £25,000 to £15,000 per annum, and omitting all the words after "" years,"" with a view of inserting, thereof, the words, "" under section 96 of the Constitution."" I did not put that other amendment in writing, because the consideration of the motion was automatically adjourned under the Standing Orders; and I had to take up other business which lowed immediately after. I distinctly moved the amendment",31
210,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I would point out to the honourable member that the honourable member for New England was speaking when the debate was adjourned,31
211,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is true,31
212,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It must have been at an earlier stage that the honourable member moved his amendment. I may say that it was not handed to me, and that I did not put it from the Chair. If the honourable member desires to move the amendment he has indicated, I am sure the honourable member for Grey will temporarily withdraw that which he has moved, in order to give him an opportunity to do so. Had the amendment been formally put from the chair, it would have appeared in the Votes and Proceedings.",31
213,Mr GB EDWARDS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I admit, Mr. Speaker, that I did not put my amendment in writing; but I formally moved it, and it appeared in Hansard, and in the public press. If I am at liberty, I should like now to move it.",31
214,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am just informed by the Clerk, that the reason why the amendment does not appear in the Votes and Proceedings is that, although it was moved by the honourable member, it was not seconded, and, therefore, lapsed.",31
215,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Wilmot) [4.53] - I had no intention of addressing myself to the motion at this stage, because I desired that the House should come to a vote; but, having listened to the honourable member for Cowper, I have come to the conclusion that he has scarcely grasped the principle upon which this claim - is made. The motion was submitted in a very able speech by the honourable member for Bass; and 1 should like briefly to state the basis of the claim. Under the bookkeeping system, each State is credited with the Customs duty collected on goods that are consumed by it ; but a large quantity of dutiable goods from other States is consumed in Tasmania, and she is not credited with duty collected in respect of . those goods. For instance, in the case of many goods which are imported into other States, but consumed in Tasmania, the latter State gets no credit, owing to the in lieu failure of the bookkeeping system.",31
216,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,What about the side?,31
217,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"There can be no other side."" If Tasmania could prove folher loss she would not have to come to this Parliament for redress, but would simply lay a claim before the High Court. We cannot prove exactly what we have lost, but we can show that it must have been something considerable; and Tasmania certainly has a moral claim on the equity arid good conscience of Parliament.",31
218,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,What is the value of the goods which have gone into Tasmania without Inter-State certificates?,32
219,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The Statistician of Tasmania estimates the loss at £40,000 per annum.",32
220,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is a wrong estimate.,32
221,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It may be, but, tainly, the Statistician of Tasmania must know more about the matter than does the Minister of Trade and Customs.",32
222,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Statistician is more interested ! - Mr ATKINSON - I admit that.,32
223,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"What is the Department's estimate of the loss? "" Mr ATKINSON - I do not know that the Department has made an estimate. loss is not the fault of the Customs officonsideration cials, because it is on"" goods come under their notice that the loss is made.",32
224,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Is there smuggrown ? gling?,32
225,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"There is no smugno gling, but simply a breakdown tem inaugurated under the Constitution. ,The honourable member for Cowper has this ported apples ! afternoon made a good many statements that are quite wide of the real issue, amongst other questions, he has asked, "" What about the other side ?"" As I have already pointed out, there can be no "" other side,"" because the fact is admitted that Tasmania has suffered a real loss through no fault of her own. If Victoria and New South Wales have received most of the money, which should have been credited to Tasmania, the fault lies in system; and it is the duty of this Parliathat ment to recoup Tasmania.' It is impossible to state exactly what the loss has been, but in the year 1908-9, as shown in a paper circulated by the Premier of Tasmania on the 5th July last, out of £295,668 credited to that State on account of Customs duties, possible. no less than £139,193 was so credited on account of Customs on goods originally ported into other States, while the balance °f £ S6>575 represents duties I originally imported into Tasmania. This means that 47 per cent, of the duties credited to Tasmania were derived from Inter-State imports, while in Victoria 5 per cent., and in New South Wala* 8 per cent., were so credited. Had Tasmania been paid on a per capita basis, she would in some 5'ears have received £90,000 more than was actually handed over under the bookkeeping system; and it surely cannot be said that that amount represents the difference between the consuming power of Tasmania and the rest of the Commonwealth.",32
226,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,How do the imports per capita compare with those of pre-Federation days ?,32
227,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable cermember mean imports from oversea?,32
228,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The complete imports.,32
229,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I have not the exact figures, because I did not come prepared for the question. The imports oversea into Tasmania have increased very slightly, while the Inter-State imports have extended largely. Tasmania is doing her duty by dealing with the States, while the latter are getting goods from outside; and yet The Tasmania is told that she is to have no whatever in respect of an adthat do not mittedly just claim.",32
230,Mr SAMPSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Hav e not the exports from Tasmania to the other States also,32
231,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,They have grown more than could be expected from the of the sysnormal increase pf trade.,32
232,Mr FENTON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,They have always ex,32
233,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Quite so; and we and, have always had as free a market in Sydney as we have today. Some honourable members talk about Western Australia as a free market, but I can assure them that one large item of produce from the north-west coast of the island cannot go into Western Australia owing to a regulation prohibiting the importation of potatoes grown within 50 miles of an area infected the with Irish blight. We can see, therefore, the advantages to Tasmania are rather visionary, while the loss remains. However, I can see that a long speech is not at all likely to secure more votes, ancl it is better that a division be taken as early as Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) im- [5.5] - The motion is rather peculiar in that no date is proposed from which this on goods payment is to commence.",32
234,Mr JENSEN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"A Bill will have to be introduced if the motion be carried. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The only motion does not state when the leakage took place, or whether the payment is to date from the beginning of Federation or from the passing of the motion.",32
235,Mr JENSEN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Certainl y from the beginning of Federation, because there is no bookkeeping system after this yeai. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It seems to'me that the motion will involve an immense amount of work. In the first place, in order to arrive at the alleged age, all the records of the imports which have passed through the other States into Tasmania during the whole of the period will have to be consulted j and this may prove costly to the Department. I have not been able to ascertain from the speeches of honourable members whether the Customs authorities admit that there has been any leakage.",33
236,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The Customs autliorities do not admit that there has been any. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It ought to be established that there has been a leakage before any payment such as is proposed can be made. I do not desire to approach this proposal in any hostile spirit, provided a case can be made out that the State of Tasmania has really suffered a disadvantage, and has just grounds for her claim for payment. It is strange that every State except New South Wales is crying out for some special consideration.",33
237,Mr MATHEWS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"What'specia l consideration is Victoria asking ? New South Wales is asking for very special consideration in the shape of a Federal Capital inaccessible to all but New South Wales members! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is not a special consideration; it was an originalcondition of Federation that the Capital should be in New South Wales. Victoria desires a monopoly of the manufacturing industries and of the markets of the other States, with legislation to prevent competition from outside, as, for instance, in the case of harvesters.",33
238,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No such thing ! Harvesters cannot be made in New South Wales ! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is utter nonsense. Western Australia has received special financial consideration, and now desires a transcontinental railway.",33
239,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Order ! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am only showing that all the States except New South Wales are asking for some special consideration, though New South Wales is really the State that has mainly to foot the bill. It costs New South Wales more to meet the expenses of these claims than it costs any of the other States.",33
240,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It is the same cost per head. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - But is the aggregate New South Wales is calledupon to pay much more. Nevertheless, I do not wish it to be supposed that I am opposed to the payment of a fair and legitimate claim. Honourable gentlemen leakwho claim concessions for the State which they are representing should substantiate the justice of their claims. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - We have agreed to give £250,000 to Western Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I have said that every State except New Soutk Wales is obtaining special consideration.",33
241,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Poo r Ma State! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Ne w South Wales has to suffer all the time.,33
242,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Sh e can afford t« do so. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The fact that a State can afford to be bled is no justification for bleeding it. I , as a representative of "" poor Ma State,"" as the Minister of Trade and Customs has sneeringly called it, must keep an eye upon her interests. Necessity is the only justificatioa for these special grants. I shall not oppose any just claim, but must oppose claims which I consider unjust. For how long is it proposed to continue the special .payments to Tasmania ? ",33
243,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The loss complained of has occurred during the nine years which have elapsed since Federation. Henceforth, under the per capita distribution, there will not be a loss. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - How has it been ascertained that there has been an annual loss of £25,000 during the past nine years ?",33
244,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The facts'are in dispute, and must be examined. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The loss which Tasmania has suffered has been variously estimated by those who are supporting her claims, at amounts ranging from ,£25,000 to ,£40,000; but it is all ex parte. No proof of loss has been furnished, and we have no means of ascertaining exactly what the State has lost, or even whether there really has been any loss. Therefore, it would be better to omit from the motion the reference to a specific sum. It can then be ascertained by the officials what the leakage, if any, has been, and the amount thus determined can be provided for on the Estimates.",33
245,Mr FISHEK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Bot h sides must be heard. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Certainly. We have so far had only ex forte statements. The facts can be ascertained by an investigation, and a refund should then be provided for on something like a proper basis, according to the facts as disclosed by the evidence. It would be dangerous to leave out, as is proposed, the words "" in Customs leakage,"" because then the motion would be asking for the payment of £^25,000 a year to Tasmania for no assigned reason. It would make the payment appear as a charitable dole or a gift for no apparent reason. I understand that the State is asking, not for charity, but for a refund to which she is entitled, if the facts as alleged are shown on investigation to exist.  leader suggested that it would be dimcult to prove the leakage alleged, although every one knows that it has occurred. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Every one does not know that. The Treasurer is not sure about it ; and the Minister of Trade and Customs disputes the claim.",34
246,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"There may be a loss of ,£2,000 a year. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - If it is admitted that there has been a leakage, the words "" in Customs leakage"" should be retained. I shall be glad if the honourable member for Grey will withdraw his amendment, so that I may move a prior amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. - Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I now move That the words "" of Twenty-five thousand pounds "" be left out. The carrying of that amendment will make it possible to fix any amount that may be determined to be the actual loss which .Tasmania has suffered.  proposes to draw a blank cheque. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is not so. The motion, if amended as I propose, will readThat, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the State of Tasmania be granted a sum yearly by the Commonwealth for a period of nine years to recoup the said State for the loss sustained in Customs leakage since the advent of Federation. If my amendment is agreed to, I shall propose a subsequent amendment, providing that the sum to be paid shall be such as may be ascertained to be reasonable after an investigation of the facts. The motion will then not be equivalent to the drawing of a blank cheque.",34
247,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member may not move two amendments. He will have to get some one to move the second amendment for him. ' Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I shall arrange for that.,34
248,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I second the amendment.,34
249,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member may not do that, because he has already spoken; indeed, he has now spoken twice in this debate, once on the main question, and once on the amendment which has been temporarily withdrawn. This shows the inconvenience arising from an irregular way of conducting the proceedings of the House.",34
250,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,May not my speech be considered to have been withdrawn with the amendment on which it was made?,34
251,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Practicall y that must be taken to have happened; but the position shows the inconvenience of the loose way of doing business which has prevailed in the past. In the future, I shall not permit the withdrawal of amendments, and now give honourable members notice to that effect.",34
252,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I second the amendment. Mr KELLY ' (Wentworth) [5.23] - If the motion be amended as proposed, the House may safely pass it. It is acknowledged to be difficult to say now exactly what loss Tasmania has suffered in Customs leakage. If the amendment be agreed to, it will throw upon the Government the responsibility of ascertaining what is due to Tasmania. When that has been done, the Minister of Trade and Customs can ask for a special grant, based on the facts he will be able to lay before the House. We are not now making a grant. If that were proposed, it would be unconstitutional, because only a Minister of the Crown can bring forward a proposal imposing any charge on the taxpayers. All we are doing is to express our pious belief that Tasmania should be reimbursed for the loss she has sustained through no fault of her own, but through 'the faults of our system. Surely, therefore, the most sensible course is to say that the amount Tasmania should receive is the amount to which she is shown, after careful inquiry, to be entitled. Has any evidence been adduced sufficient for. this Chamber to come to a definite conclusion as to what that amount really is? The Minister of Trade and Customs estimated the other day that the loss, at the very maximum, would not exceed £15,000. If that is so, it would be absolutely wrong for this House to grant £10,000 in excess. I would like the mover of this motion to express an opinion on this proposition. All he wants is that the injustice shall be rectified j but he would have a very poor prospect of success in a House like this, constituted of persons representing all sections of the Commonwealth, if he simply said, "" We give you no facts; we demand this particular sum of money, and you must give it us."" The representatives of other States will give him justice, but how can we find out what justice is until an inquiry has been made? That is all that the honourable member for Lang asks, and I am sure that every honourable member, while feeling sympathy with Tasmania in her exceptional circumstances, feels that he has also another and more personal duty to act as the trustee of the public affairs of the Commonwealth as a whole. The vast bulk of honourable members would be infinitely more disposed to accept the motion as proposed to be amended than as first suggested. It is clear that the Ministry are not too enthusiastic about it.",34
253,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Ministry have not taken any action. . I purpose sending the matter to a Committee to investigate the facts.,35

255,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It would not be a blank cheque.,35
256,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable, member might just as well knock the motion question at all. out straight away.",35
257,Mr BAMFORD,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If the Committee of inquiry estimated that Tasmania should receive more than £25,000, would the honourable member agree to that?",35
258,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I will agree to pay to Tasmania any sum to which a competent tribunal decides that she is entitled to Customs leakages. The honourable member for Denison insinuates that tion behind the amendment is to defeat the motion by a side wind. That is extremely unjust. The very first words I addressed of in the House. to the House on the question, when the responsible Ministers refused to express their opinion upon it, was that I was in entire sympathy with Tasmania and that all I wanted to arrive at to justify my voting for the proposal was the facts as they were understood by the Minister in charge of the Department. I am therefore perfectly consistent in advocating an inquiry into the amount due to Tasmania. Tasmanian representatives are asking for something which they are not constitutionally bound to get.° I think they are in equity entitled to it, and it is because of that tiiat I propose to give it to them, but I do not propose to give them either more or less than the amount to which they are fairly entitled, as ascertained by a proper inquiry. The Prime Minister tells us now that he proposes to submit the question to a Committee.",35
259,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I said that a month' ago.,35
260,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It does not matter when the honourable member said it. Does the honourable member for Denison accuse the Prime Minister of trying to side-track the motion when he proposes an investigation?,35
261,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Not at all.,35
262,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Ye t the honourable membei makes that accusation against me when I propose a judicial investigation ! Surely we can deal with this matter apart from party bias, and purely on its merits. Is this a party catchword for subsequent use in Tasmania ? If it is, honourable members will be inundated with this sort of claim upon the Federal Treasury, and the representatives of the larger States will have to be very careful how they meet such demands. I regard the matter as outside of party altogether, because it was strongly urged in this House by the honourable member for AVilmot, and all through the lobbies by the honourable member for Wilmot and the honourable member for Franklin.",35
263,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It is not a party,35
264,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Howeve r Tasmanian representatives opposite regard it, they cannot say that Ministers, who are responsible to the House on the question, have been mirrors of candour about it. I do not think the Prime Minister has yet explained to the House to what extent he owing"" thinks the leakage has occurred.",35
265,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I explained it in two the intencolumns in the press.,35
266,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member is always explaining in the press instead ME. FISHER - That is more clever than accurate. A deputation comprising all the Tasmanian representatives waited on me.,35
267,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The House is entitled to be consulted in a matter affecting the funds of the Commonwealth. This afternoon the Prime Minister's main anxiety was to postpone the discussion of the motion.,36
268,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is not only inaccurate, but is a misleading statement that ought not to be made.",36
269,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member turned to the honourable member for Bass and asked him if he would move the postponement of the motion. The honourable member for Bass then got up and moved accordingly.,36
270,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Quite wrong.,36
271,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member for Bass would not have moved the postponement to put off the solution of this question on his own initiative. Every honourable member in the House saw the Prime Minister turn round and suggest to die honourable member for Bass that he should move the adjournment to another date.,36
272,Mr JENSEN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,He did it for my own good.,36
273,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And , of course, incidentally, to postpone the motion ! I would have preferred that the Prime Minister should give us a full statement of the position as he sees it as head of the Government. We have no right to vote a particular sum to meet d. difficulty which has not been definitely outlined. We do not know the extent of the money that will be required, and it is of no use pretending that we do know. Let the matter be inquired into by the Prime Minister's Committee, or some other competent body, and on its report let the Prime Minister ask the House to vote a sum. Did the Prime Minister say he had a Committee already?",36
274,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I did not.,36
275,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I understand that a month ago he announced that he was going to have a Committee, but apparently he has not acted on that thought.",36
276,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I propose to send the question to a Committee of the House.,36
277,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Surely the responsible Minister could have an investigation made,36
278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,If the honourable member really wants the matter settled could not have a better way than to send to a Select Committee.,36
279,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,So long as the motion is amended by knocking out the amount and leaving it to be settled afterwards by quiry.,36
280,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It does not matter what amount is mentioned in the motion. The Committee will recommend a certain amount, if any.",36
281,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"But if the motion passed in its present form, would the Government follow the recommendations of the Committee, or obey the order of the House to pay a certain amount? Surely we are not being asked to pass a mere placard ?",36
282,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member ought to be. satisfied if the Prime Minister says he will appoint a Committee.,36
283,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member mean that it will not be necessary in that case to pass the motion at all ?,36
284,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I do not think it matters whether it is passed or not.,36
285,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The.Ministr y ought to allow no motion to pass unless they are prepared to act on it.,36
286,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Le t the debate be adjourned and a Committee appointed.,36
287,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am prepared to vote on the motion immediately if the sum is not specified. Let us say that Tasmania should be granted by the Commonwealth a sum to recoup her for the loss sustained in Customs leakage since Federation, the amount to be determined by some tribunal appointed for the purpose. If we amended the motion in that way, it would simply be"" a question this afternoon of deciding whether or not we believe that Tasmania is entitled to a special grant on account of having suffered loss as the result of Customs leakage. Personally, I think she is entitled ro a grant.",36
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member is out to block it.,36
289,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"To be rebuked by the honourable member for blocking anything reminds me of a jungle tale, where the pheasant was rebuked by the rogue elephant for damaging the foliage. I am not attempting to block the proposal. I am simply pointing out that if we pass the motion as proposed to be amended we commit ourselves to nothing more than the principle, and the House will have an absolutely free hand to agree to the amount which will, be named ? when the responsible Minister asks for authority for a special grant to Tasmania. he If the Prime Minister is anxious for the it motion to proceed, he will jump at the amendment.",36
290,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Wonderfu l 1,36
291,Mr KELLY,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member insays "" Wonderful,"" and always looks as though he felt it, but if he were really sincere in suggesting a Committee he would jump at the opportunity now presented. He cannot go wrong in. accepting the' amendment. It is right into his hands, and if he refuses to give it his sympathy and support it will be clear to the people of Tasmania that his real attitude is what might be expected from a gentleman who says he is appointing a Committee and does nothing, and who asks for the adjourmnent of a debate that has a chance of being closed.",36
292,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Balaclava) [5.40] - I think that the House should be satisfied that an actual leakage of Customs revenue is suffered by Tasmania, before passing a motion providing for the payment of a sum of money, by way of compensation, to that State. The suggestion made by the Prime Minister is reasonable, and I think that we ought to adopt it. if a Select Committee be appointed, and, upon its investigation of the facts, reports that there has been a leakage, then we shall be justified in voting for the payment of whatever sum it determines Tasmania has lost. The statistics show that, prior to Federation, Tasmanian imports from the mainland were twice as large as were her oversea imports. It would therefore appear that the loss of revenue suffered by Tasmania since Federation has been in respect of Customs duties that were collected on goods imported direct from the mainland. During the first year after the lishment of Federation, the Customs revenue of Tasmania fell off to the extent of £100,000.",37
293,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And it has since fallen off to the extent of £150,000 per annum.",37
294,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"This shows that a great part of the Customs . revenue derived by Tasmania in pre-Federation days was in respect of goods exported from the mainland lo that State. On the other hand, we find that her exports to the mainland have increased to the extent of 50 per cent, since Federation. It would appear, therefore, that Tasmania must have gained considerably; and that, instead of taking the statement of the Government Statistician of the State that the loss has amounted to £40,000 a year- a statement which must be mere guesswork-w e should have regard to the views of the officers of the Department of Trade and Customs. They have at their disposal better material, and are in a better position to determine the actual leakage, if any, than is the vernment Statistician of any State.",37
295,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But they do not see the goods in respect of which the loss of Customs revenue occurs.,37
296,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No ; but their great experience should guide them. They can take the average of the imports and exports from one State to another during a given period, and also the Customs value per head of the population of each State. In the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that the materials at the disposal of the Customs officials should enable them to supply information better than any mere guesswork on the part of a Government Statistician. I am not suggesting that Tasmania is not entitled to any money.",37
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Treasury of Tasmania has lost money; but the people of that State have become wealthier since Federation.,37
298,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No doubt they have gained considerably by reason of their increased exports. I think that the mover of the motion ought to be well satisfied with the offer of the Prime Minister to refer this question to a Committee to report to this House, and that the people of Tasmania ought to feel that they are going to receive justice at the hands of the Commonwealth.",37
299,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [5.44] - Fro m the outset of this agitation, 1I have had in view, as every representative of Tasmania knows, a definite and distinct estab- policy. The Premier of Tasmania was good enough to see me on the subject ; and, in the course of a rather lengthy interview, I went into the whole question, not only with him, but with every representative of Tasmania in this House. I discussed the position with them; and it seems to me that once we have a fixed basis to work upon, the matter is simplicity itself. On the one hand, the Tasmanian authorities, including the Government Statistician of that State, allege that, since the transfer of the Department to the Commonwealth, serious losses have been suffered by Tasmania, by reason of a Customs leakage. The allegation is that there has been a Customs leakage, due, in some instances, to laxity on the part of the Department, but largely owing to a peculiar disposition on the part of Tasmanians to visit the mainland, purchase dutiable goods here, and to carry them home, either on their backs, or in their baggage; so that Inter-State certificates are not issued in respect of them, and Tasmania is thus Go- deprived of considerable revenue. I do not wish to discuss the question of which State or States reaps the advantage; but the Commonwealth itself certainly derives none from this practice.",37
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The whole advantage is gained by Victoria and New South Wales.,38
301,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not wish to discuss that phase of the question; but, obviously, the Commonwealth revenue is not benefited to the extent of a penny by reason of the remissness, if any, that occurs in this respect. During the period referred to, the Commonwealth has returned to the States, not only the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled, but, in addition, over £6,000,000 of surplus revenue. That being so, the Commonwealth, as such, has not benefited to the. extent of a penny by reason of the lapses, or want of vigilance, alleged on the part of Customs officers.",38
302,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,We have recognised the gain as being between State and State up to the present time.,38
303,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Quite so. The case presented by the parties concerned-and there are others who wish to help them in a way foreign to the original request-is that Tasmania has suffered because of this Customs leakage. They say that oversea goods, on which Customs duties have been paid, have been purchased on the mainland by visitors from Tasmania, and carried home by them in such a way that that State has not been credited with the amount of duty collected upon those goods. So far as I am concerned, that explanation, in itself, is not sufficient. The Commonwealth figures do not at all agree with those of the Tasmanian authorities. That being so, I , as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, charged with the care of its finances, am not in a position to invite the House to support any such motion as this until actual facts have been discovered to justify it.",38
304,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Can we ever discover them if people carry dutiable goods from the mainland to Tasmania, and no record of those goods is made by the Department ?",38
305,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"There are certain facts which could readily be placed before a comparatively small Select Committee. I do not wish to prejudge the recommendation of such a Committee, but I think that we should be able to place certain facts before it, and that it should be in a position, from the evidence submitted, to come to a reasonable conclusion, and to bring up a report which could be discussed and, perhaps, approved in a way that is impossible in connection with a motion of this kind. There is, after all, merely a haphazard statement as to the actual loss sustained, and it is, therefore, desirable that both parties should be heard, and a decision arrived at. It is not a big question, and I do not think that we should go beyond the issue actually involved. That is the view I have held from the first. I have submitted it to the honourable member for Bass; but it would have been out of place for me. to intervene before the honourable member had had time to ventilate this question in the House. He was entitled to ventilate it in any way he thought fit. A Government need not necessarily take serious notice of such a motion as this, even if it were carried. That, however, would not be a very dignified attitude for the Ministry to take up. I think that it is desirable that all the words after the opening word, ""That,"" should be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" a Committee of this House be appointed to inquire into and report upon the alleged leakage of Customs revenue or loss to the State of Tasmania during the nine years since Federation."" That offers a sensible way out of the difficulty. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is practically my amendment.",38
306,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Such a proposition would be in accord with what I said a month ago to a deputation of representatives of Tasmania which interviewed me on the subject. I could only make a statement to them. I could not suggest that they ought not to say this or that in the House.,38
307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,They were quite within their rights in bringing this motion before the House.,38
308,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Undoubtedly , and it would have been impertinence on my part to say that they should take any other course. The Government will give very serious consideration to the report of a Committee appointed to investigate the whole of the facts. We must have a reason for taking action, and must endeavour, in such a matter, to deal justly as between Tasmania, or any other State that can make out a good case, and the Commonwealth. The facts being in dispute, it would be hardly worthy of the National Parliament to pass in a haphazard fashion a declaratory resolution which, after all, would not be binding on the Government. The question involves the discussion of one of the gravest principles associated with the finances of the Commonwealth. No responsible Minister could accept such a motion as this, which might mean the initiation of proposals leading us anywhere and everywhere. It would not be a dignified and national course of procedure to follow. The Government take the responsibility of refusing to initiate proposals of this kind, which might endanger or embarrass the true policy of the Federation. For these and many other reasons, but mainly for the purpose of ascertaining the actual facts, I ask the honourable member for Bass to agree to his motion being amended so as to provide for the appointment of a Select Committee. I am prepared to accept any reasonable nomination, and I suggest, without consulting any of the parties concerned, that we should have a Committee of seven, comprising two representatives of Tasmania and one representative of each of the other States. I suggest two representatives of Tasmania because, if there were only one, and he became indisposed, that State, which ought always to have a representative on the Committee to present its case, would be unrepresented. What the Government desire is to get at the facts, and not to cause any delay, because the sooner we arrive at a determination the better.",38
309,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Does the Prime Minister desire to move the appointment of the Select Committee, or would he rather an honourable member did so ?",39
310,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It is the usual and courteous practice to allow the honourable member who introduces the subject to move the appointment of the Select Committee, though I had jotted down some names, which, however, I shall not suggest. appeal to Tasmanian members, and to the whole House, not, in this important matter, to establish a precedent in the National Parliament that may lead to the gravest financial difficulty, or to such wrangling ought never to take place between the States.",39
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Parramatta) [5-5°l-- I agree almost wholly with the honourable member for Balaclava, who suggests that there should be an inquiry before an assessment is made. The honourable member for Lang had that object in view, only he proposed to compass it by two amendments instead of one. There ought to be an investigation into this whole question, which has been before the House for years. Two or three Treasurers have considered the matter sympathetically after investigation with such resources as were at their hands. Personally, I do not care much for the way in which the motion is worded, because I take a broader view than would be indicated by any of the terms used. For instance, I am not satisfied that the motion should be based merely on the ground of the Customs leakage, though I admit there may be a very good case on that score alone. I prefer, as I have already said, to take a broad Federal view. There is no doubt that, apart altogether from Customs leakage, Tasmania has been dealt a heavy blow by Federation.",39
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Tasmanian Treasury has been dealt a heavy blow.,39
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Quite so; but I am not so much concerned with that aspect. While the Treasury of Tasmania may have been dealt a heavy blow, we must remember that what has not gone into the Treasury has been left in the pockets of the Tasmanian people. I am speaking purely from a revenue and financial point of view. I do not say that all this money has gone into the pockets of the people, but a great proportion has; and we are on sound ground if we put aside those considerations and take the broad general effect which Federation has had on this small State. I have an opinion, which amounts almost to a conviction, that, owing to the superior organization of industry in the two large States, Tasmania has been hit very severely in her manufactures alone. Those manufactures, since Federation, have not prospered in anything like the same ratio as those of the larger, more populous, and better organized States. In this connection, I Tasmania has been affected very adversely by the setting up of Inter-State Free Trade. VVe ought not to allow one of our family to suffer in this way. If honourable members like, we may regard Tasmania as the Benas jamin of the family, and entitled to consideration at the hands of the Treasurer for the time being on the broad general ground that in a number of ways she has been adversely affected through the operation of Inter-State Free Trade. 1 suggest that all the words after "" That "" be struck out, and the following inserted:A Select Committee be appointed to consider the question of a special grant to the State of Tasmania, in consequence of the adverse way in which her finances have been affected by Federation.",39
314,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Will the honourable member look at this draft of an amendment, which I have prepared on similar lines to his own, but in which I speak of the loss to the State through entering the Federation.",40
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Prime Minister's draft amounts to much the same as my suggested amendment.,40
316,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The representatives Tasmania will see the difference, because, to speak of a special grant is to pre-judge the matter. I suggest a report on the leged loss.",40
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I suggest a I special grant, merely as a matter for completely investigated. consideration. We desire to ascertain whether such a grant is justified on the broad general ground of the admember verse way in which Tasmania's finances head have been affected. I further sugestimated gest that the Committee should consist of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . the Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, the honourable member for Hume, the Minister of Trade and Customs, the that. honourable member for Lang, the honourable member for Bass, and the honourable ber for Franklin.

320,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I think it ought to be to the mover of the motion to suggest the names.,40
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I am merely making a suggestion.,40
322,Mr FISHER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I must say that I feel self quite unable to act on a Committee that kind.,40

[53] val, but there is quite a different tone in the reception of this matter f rom what we saw last week. As to what the Prime Minister said, I submit to him that this proposal is not in itself a precedent. The honourable gentleman is himself proposing, and it has always been proposed, that a special grant should be made to Western Australia; and to that proposal neither the people nor the of representatives of Tasmania have ever offered one word of protest. Then, again, the Prime Minister urged that this matter alshould not be sprung on honourable members and passed without investigation; but contend that it has been thoroughly and It was investigated by the honourable member for Swan, when Treasurer, and by the honourable for Hume, when Minister of Trade and Customs; and, on the report from the of the Department, the latter Minister the leakage at, I think,",40

329,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Did the honourable member left for Hume, when Minister, state any sum?",40

Sir Thomas Bent was prepared to recognise his responsibility if Mr Wade would do like the wise, but Mr Wade declined, and Sir do Thomas Bent would not act on his' own",40

333,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I have tried as far as possible to prevent party feeling entering into this matter, and God help the interests of any State if their recognition or non-recognition of justice depends on party considerations ! I gave this motion exactly the same support when it was moved by the honourable member for Wilmot, as I think the honourable member for Bass will admit I have given to his proposal. This is a question of right and justice. The Customs officials are the very worse authority we could take on the subject, because, to appeal to them, is like asking the policeman if he has kept order on his beat. This leakage is a matter that does not come before the Department, because if they had seen the leakage it could not exist.",41
334,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I think Dr Wollaston recognised that there was a leakage.,41
335,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Yes ; when he went into the matter; and I think the present Minister of Trade and Customs will find that recognition on record. At any rate, it is a matter of public knowledge that Dr Wollaston, when at the head of the Department, did recognise that there was a leakage.",41
336,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"But it was never estimated at more than £2,000'or £3,000.",41

One need only visit the northern parts of Tasmania to discover that thousands of pounds' worth 'of goods are sent there constantly from Victoria for which Inter-State certificates are not obtained, and of whose value the Customs officials, therefore, know nothing. Apparently the honourable member for Bass finds that the support which he had a reason to expect for this motion is being withheld, and is, therefore, forced to agree to the pointment of a Select Committee. I am g-lad that inquiry is to be made by a Committee, and not by some other body. Mr .FISHER - The proposal is not an afterthought with me.",41

By careful saving he of the had managed to put together enough to When he got be out of work, he tried to sell this land. It was put up by auction, and he was offered £ 1 7 0 for it. He did not consider this a fair value, and he declined to accept it. His son then offered to take the land from him on time-payment at the rate of £ 3 per month. It was only a family arrangement between the father and the son. Some two years ago, he applied for a pension under the Queensland Act, but his apwas refused, as he then had in his name this land, which was estimated to be worth considerably more than £ 1 7 0 . lieu He made a sworn statement before the police magistrate that he did possess - I the land at the time, which was partly true. Subsequently he this transferred the land to his son in accordance with the arrangement made that between them, but which was only a arrangement. He then applied for a pension under the Commonwealth Act, hut was told thnt he had purposely transferred the land to his son in consideration of love and affection so that he might participate in the benefits of the Commonwealth Old-age Pensions Act, and his application was refused. I brought the matter under the notice of the Treasurer's predecessor, and it was reported on. I admit that the papers are somewhat against the applicant, but I know from personal experience that the old gentleman is in a very poor way indeed, and has nothing whatever to live upon except the amount the son gives him-somethin g like £ 3 per monthwhich the son may cease to contribute at any time.",42

360,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"At a conference of those interested in the dairying industry, held in Brisbane on 3rd June last, to discuss Mr Lockyer's report, the follo.wing resolution, amongst others, was carriedThat in view of the fact that it is practically impossible for reasons well known to the trade to insure that every box of butter will contain exactly the same weight in spite of every care and honest intention, the butter manufacturers of Queensland consider that fines for short weight should be abolished, and that factories should be allowed to make up any deficiency to standard weight. I do not wish to go into the merits of the report, and would not like to repeat here without the Minister's consent the remark that he made with reference to that resolution.",43
361,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I do not mind giving the honourable member permission to repeat what I said about that. I believe in 16 oz. to the lb.,43
362,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is an insinuation that those who supported that motion do not believe in 16 oz. to the lb. A subsequent motion carried wasThat the Department of Agriculture be approached for the purpose of providing more suitable sensitive scales. The Agricultural Department of Queensland are administering the Commerce Act for the Customs Department, and therefore they are no doubt interested in the question of having suitable machines for weighing produce for export. In the Brisbane Courier a few days ago, a little light was thrown on this matter, and that is what I wish to refer to to-night. Perhaps the Minister will be relieved to learn that I do not intend to go into the very vexed question of grade marking, or weights and measures.",43
363,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I expect to hear the honourable member on that about a fortnight hence, on the occasion of the deputation.",43
364,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The article in the Brisbane Courier is as followsAccording to a British firm of scale makers, weighing machines and scales need not be of so high a grade for Australian use as is necessary to satisfy the British authorities. Writing to the Acting Comptroller-General of Customs, in reply to some inquiries as to invoice values, the firm said :- "" We should also like to explain the several patterns in our export list do not appear in the Home list. The weights and measures regulations in Australia being less strict than they are here since the Weights and Measures Act 1907, the class of some machines sold for export is not of a sufficiently high grade to enable them to pass for trade use in this country."" VVe have passed a Commerce Act to protect the British or foreign buyer against inferior quality, light weights, and so on; but while we have made provision for weighing our produce when it is tendered for export, no provision has been made to see that the machines that are imported are of the high standard required, for instance, in London. I am pleased to say that we are not dependent solely upon imported weighing machines. In Brisbane, we are manufacturing machines of a very high standard. It has come quite as a shock to me to know that machines such as Eairbank's, or the Avery machines, which have had a large sale throughout Australia, are not up to the standard required by the British Board of Trade.",43
365,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The letter does not say that.,44
366,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It says that it is not necessary that machines exported from Great Britain should be of the high standard required for Home use. The question of weights in the industry with which I have been connected has been a vexed one for the last twenty-five years. found ourselves in a difficult position. We imported a machine from Denmark, for which we paid £,S°> thinking we would get an absolutely accurate instrument. We have had our consignments of butter in forty, fifty, or a hundred box lots held up because there was, perhaps, one box which turned the scale at 56J lbs., and the Customs Department have asked us to sign a declaration that we had committed a breach of the law. The Minister might do something to protect the Australian trade against . the importation of inferior machines. If present legislation is not sufficient to allow the machines to be graded as they come in, some measure should be introduced to give the Minister power to grade imports, if we have to submit to the grading of exports, so that our own people may be protected against shoddy stuff from other countries. If that does not commend itself to the Minister as a good remedy, perhaps he may be able to do something through the High Commissioner by intimating to these people in London that we want only the best for Australia.",44
367,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It is the State Governments that will have to take action to bring their weights and measures into conformity with those of the Board of Trade.,44
368,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I am pleased to notice that the Minister will shunt some duties on to the State Governments. I hope he will take that view in regard to the land tax.,44
369,Mr BEARD,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,They will not take it on.,44
370,Mr SIN CLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,-Then perhaps they will not take this on.,44
371,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Then we shall do it.,44
372,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am pleased to have the Minister's assurance that he will give the matter sympathetic consideration. I am thankful to him for what he has already done, for I notice from yesterday's Herald that he has sent a copy of this letter to the various State Premiers. The position I take up is that the Commonwealth Government check our exports, and so check the work done by these machines, if imported machines are used, and they might also take in hand the question of seeing that only the best machines are put on the market from foreign countries.",44
373,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Cowper) [7-55]-- I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General some of the disabilities for which his Department is responsible. Although the honourable gentleman is not present, I trust that his colWe leagues will bring under his notice a matter which, I hope, will engage his earnest attention, as soon as the facts are put before him. I refer to the delay in the construction of telephone lines in country districts. We were led to believe from' remarks made in this House a few weeks ago, that it was the intention, not only of the Government, hut of the Parliament itself, that telephone facilities should be placed at the disposal of all persons in country districts. That promise, however, is not being realized. Whilst I admit that these works cannot be carried out in a few weeks, I would remind the House that in a number of cases applications for telephone extensions have engaged the attention of the Department for a considerable time. Notwithstanding the urgent representations made by those directly concerned, as well as by their parliamentary representatives, they have been delayed year in and year out, and we do not seem to be able to reach finality. Applications are made for the construction of lines in country districts; the severe terms imposed by the Department are complied with, the necessary deposits are lodged, and guarantees insuring the Department, in some cases, against loss, for a period of seven years, are signed, yet no attempt is made to carry out the works. We were told at first that the cause of the rletay was that the Parliament had failed to vote sufficient to cover the whole expenditure necessary. In last year's Estimates, however, the sum placed at the disposal of the Department was larger than that voted on any previous occasion. The amount asked for wns voted, ancl. indeed, I have never known the Estimates of the Department to be reduced. This increased vote having been made available, the next excuse ollered by the responsible officers for the delay in carrying out these urgent works was that they could not obtain the requisite number of skilled, experienced men to supervise the erection of the lines. After tenders have been invited in some cases, the further excuse is offered by the Department that the material necessary to complete the work is not available. In such cases, we have to wait the acceptance of tenders for the supply of that material. 1 dare say that honourable members are aware that the usual practice followed by the Department is to call for tenders for the erection of the poles, and the fixing of the wires, the Department itself supplying the wire, insulators, and other material. During last session I and another honourable member waited on the then Postmaster-General in regard to this matter, and found him most sympathetic. I believe that he did what he could in the way of urging his officers to recommend suitable men as supervisors. He was prepared to agree to the temporary appointment of additional hands; but for some reason or other these men have not been made available. The honourable gentleman communicated with, his officers in New South Wales, with the result that they placed three more men on the supervising staff for that State. Instead of their services being utilized, however, as intended by the then Postmaster-General, their addition to the staff was taken advantage of to enable leave that had accumulated to be given to the men in that particular branch. 1 may say, in passing, that I have no fault to find with the granting of holidays to the men. My complaint is that they have not been able to get them before. These additional men, at all events, were not used for the purpose intended, and the position is not improving. If anything, it is getting worse. To substantiate my statement, and to illustrate the difficulty that I have experienced in endeavouring to have these works carried out, I propose to read a letter which I received from the Department a few days ago, and which I am afraid is typical of many received by representatives of other districts. This letter, which was addressed to me from the Postmaster-General's Department on 29th July last, reads as followsSIR,-With reference to'your inquiry .of .the 8th instant as lo the position of the matter of the proposed erection of a telephone line between Wauchope and Long Flat, New South Mr John Thomson. Wales, I have the honour to infoim you the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, who was asked for a report on the subject, advises as follows in regard thereto :On the u t h May last Mr J. Thomson, M.P., submitted the names of the proposed obligors for the line in question, the erection of which is warranted under "" Guarantee "" conditions. As, however, the line has been listed by the Acting Senior Inspector and the Manager, Telegraph Branch, 73rd in order of urgency on the list of similar works, and as it is considered that only forty-three of such works can be undertaken during the current financial year, Mr Thomson was informed on the 17th June, 1910, of the position of the line on the list, and that there is little or no prospect of its being erected during the year 1910-n. Such a state of things is not creditable either to the Department or to the House. VVe encourage people to believe that we are prepared to grant these facilities. We talk in an airy way about our desire to enable people in country districts to communicate with each other by telephone, but we ought not to lead them to believe that such facilities will be granted within a certain time. We certainly ought not to ask them to send in the necessary deposits, and to sign the required guarantee, when there is no prospect of the works for which they ask being carried out for at least two years. Communications in respect to the line mentioned in the letter 1I have just read, have been passing between the Department and myself since 1907, and it would appear diat we are not to get any further ahead before, at the earliest, 1911. The Appropriation Bill, as a rule, is not passed until December, with the result that the Department has no time to call for tenders for the supply of material and the carrying out of these works before the expiration of the financial year. I hope that the Postmaster-General will take this matter into his serious consideration, and see whether he cannot clo something to grant the relief sought. The public ought not to be misled. I shall have to place myself in more direct communication with the Department, but I take this opportunity to ventilate the matter, so that the public may know the difficulties with which honourable members are confronted in trying to press upon the Department the claims of their constituents.",44
374,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Darling Downs) [8.5] I wish to direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to a matter that is causing dissatisfaction in many country districts. The Department seems to have laid down the rule that residential quarters shall not be provided in connection with new country post-offices. In many country towns where new postal buildings have been recently erected, postmasters find it utterly impossible to secure suitable residences for themselves and their families. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is not this a matter for the Postmaster-General's Department ?",45
375,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It concerns both that Department and the Department of Home Affairs. 1 take it that the Minister agrees with my contention, and will see that his colleague does the right thing.",46
376,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Is not the policy decided by the Postmaster-General's Department?,46
377,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Yes . As a matter of fact, I brought this subject under the notice of the Deputy Postmaster-General in Queensland about two months ago, and was informed that it was proposed to hold a conference of officers representing the Department of Home Affairs and the Postmaster-General's Department. It is evident, therefore, that the matter relates to the two Departments.",46
378,Mr BATCHELOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I suppose that it lies between the two.,46
379,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And , between the two, it is falling to the ground.",46
380,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It seems to go from Department to Department.,46
381,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No doubt the honourable member for Calare has a similar grievance. This complaint, which is a substantial one, has been brought under my notice by several Progress Associations and two or three local governing bodies. I should like particularly to mention the position at Oakey and Jondaryan. If the honourable member will look into those two cases, he will find that strong protests have been forwarded. The question is a very pressing one, and is urgent for the reason that T understand that the Minister will possibly be calling presently for tenders for the erection of new post-offices. In accordance with the practice always followed by his Department-the practice of having plans prepared some time before the Estimates are passed, so that tenders may be called as soon as the money is availableI am sure that the honourable gentleman, with that business-like alacrity which he displays in connection with his own private affairs, will have a number of these plans in readiness. I ask him to see that the plans for new post-offices make provision for proper residential quarters in townships where it is impossible for officers to lease private residences. If it is intended to arrange for the conference that I have mentioned, I hope that it will be convened forthwith, or that the Minister will, at all events, have the question determined before the Estimates are introduced.",46
382,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Calare) [8.8]. - I wish to emphasize the complaint made by the honourable member for Cowper. This grievance is not a matter of yesterday. The position has been unsatisfactory in New South Wales for some years. For a couple of years we were informed that the trouble was due to want of funds. The stereotyped reply to requests for telephone extensions and new mail services was that the matter would receive attention when funds were provided. Very often it was intimated that the requisite funds were not provided in the then current year's Estimates, and that provision would be made for them in those for the ensuing year. Last year the climax was reached when we were informed that all the funds necessary for the works in New^ South Wales were being voted, and assured that all the causes of the trouble would be forthwith removed. We find, However, that the trouble remains, though the grounds are shifted. Instead of it being a matter of funds, we are told that there is a lack of material, and that there is not a sufficient staff of supervising officers. If I understood aright the letter read by the honourable member for Cowper, there are about seventy requests for services, but that the staff is able to cope with' only about thirty-three in the current year, leaving some twenty-seven to be dealt with next year. The demands of the community are not stationary, but growing; and next year we shall find these twenty-seven necessary services supplemented by a large number of fresh requests. I admit that in the past we have been asking the Department to "" make bricks without straw."" If we do not provide sufficient money or enable the Department to engage the necessary staff, the work cannot be carried out; and this is a matter which should engage the serious attention of those in authority. A properly organized Department would see that provision was made for the necessary staff when the money was being voted; but apparently the whole business is carried on in a haphazard or piecemeal way, so that when there is sufficient money provided, it i? discovered there is insufficient material for the work with which the staff is competent to deal. This state of affairs is not at all creditable to the Administration, and it causes a good deal of hardship to that deserving section of the community who are doing laborious pioneering work in the outlying districts. I hope, however, that under new management better conditions will prevail .",46
383,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Wilmot) [8.15] The telephone is a great' convenience in country districts, - and is often an inducement to people to settle in the remoter parts of the States. From one end to the other of Australia land settlement is urgently desired, and it could, I think, be materially promoted by a Httle attention to telephone extension. I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he can see his way to do away with the guarantee system, which falls very heavily on that deserving class to which the honourable member for Calare . has referred. In my opinion, it is high time the Department rose to the occasion, and removed this obstacle to the extension of a very useful adjunct of civilization.",47
384,Mr THOMAS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Where would the honourable member draw the line?,47
385,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It is for the Postmaster-General to'frame the policy; and I am sure that if he gives this matter tention he will be able to devise some system more satisfactory than the present one. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to introduce further legislation in connection with old-age pensions; and it seems to me that there ought to be some method of reviewing the pensions already granted! If we may take notice of what we hear when travelling about, there are, apparently, a good many people in receipt of pensions who are not deserving of them, while many others, who are really entitled, are debarred on technical grounds.",47
386,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Department is very keen on that point!,47
387,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not think that in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act there is any provision for such a system of as I suggest. There is another point in connection with old-age pensions to which the Ministry might direct their attention. In many cases men who apply for pensions . have been separated from their wives for years, but because the latter happen to own property, the"" husbands have their pensions reduced to the extent of the interest on that property, though they derive no benefit whatever from it. I feel confident that that was not the intention of Parliament when the Act was passed; and I hope that this injustice may be removed. The time is coming, in my opinion, when we shall have to seriously consider some system of collateral contributions in connection with these pensions, such as there is in Germany, assisted by subsidies from the Government, or a system such as is adopted in the case of friendly societies. A policy of this kind is very necessary, because it will remove the tendency that these pensions have to sap the self-reliance of the people, and, further, it will make for the permanence of the system.",47
388,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member think that people simply live to claim old-age pensions?,47
389,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,No ; but the prevalent disposition to run to the Government for everything certainly has a tendency to sap the self-reliance of the community.,47
390,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,At sixty-five years of age? ^,47
391,Mr ATKINSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I hope that it is the object of every man to so order his life as not to need an old-age pension; but if the suggestion I have made were acted upon it would give those contributors who were not in need of a pension the satisat- faction of knowing that they were helping their less fortunate, fellow citizens.",47
392,Mr SAMPSON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Wimmera) [8.20] - I desire to call attention to the slow rate of progress in the establishment of rifle ranges throughout the country districts of Victoria. In my own constituency, which is, perhaps, the largest in area in the State, there is much ground for complaint on this score, and it is much to be regretted, seeing that the rifle clubs, placed on a proper basis and efficiently managed, could be rendered a most potential means of support to the regular lines of defence within the Commonwealth. There are large centres with' quite inadequate target accommodation, and with no places where the various clubs can centralize for regular competition; and, review no doubt, money could be profitably expended in this connection. The defence policy will, no doubt, be debated when the Defence Bill or the Estimates are before us, but I may say that we shall never get the best out of our rifle clubs unless some form of compulsion is introduced so that reasonable shooting efficiency may be insured. The adult section of the community, who are, perhaps, beyond the provisions contemplated under Lord Kitchener's scheme, could, I think, by means of the rifle clubs, with the aid of compulsion, be made good shots, and thus rendered of value to the Defence Forces. However, in order to justify expenditure in this direction a great deal more target accommodation will have to be provided; and, further, the Department could, with great advantage, institute a thorough system of inspection, with the view not only of providing that accommodation, but of encouraging the formation of new clubs. It is necessary, by establishing competition between small clubs, to create 'that spirit of emulation which makes so directly for efficiency. The honourable member for Wannon and myself have had various interviews regarding the establishment of a rifle range in his constituency, and I have received several complaints from centres in my own constituency. I hope that the responsible Minister will grapple with these matters in earnest. Much will be achieved if the lines suggested by Lord Kitchener are followed. We could spend the money which we vote for rifle clubs to better advantage by abolishing the voluntary system and establishing a compulsory system. At present many a club with a large membership contains only a small proportion of efficient marksmen. But with proper organization, proper provision of targets, and compulsion, we can make the rifle clubs a most valuable second line of defence, capable in time of war of rendering great assistance to the regular troops.",47
393,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Parramatta) [8.28] - I endorse the remarks of the last speaker regarding the encouragement of rifle clubs. There is some friction in my own State, of which I do not quite know the rights and the wrongs, and the sooner these troubles ate straightened out and the rifle clubs are put on a sound basis, better it will be for all concerned. But I rose to speak on other grievances. Nearly every union supports a newspaper of its own, but it is only now and again thaii one has an opportunity to read the lies which are thus scattered through the constituencies, and which it is impossible to overtake and refute.

Had there been more head, more fairness, and decency, I should not have this complaint to make. I am about to call the attention of the Government to some very serious allegations regarding what is happening under their control of the Departments. As they have been in office for about four months', it is time tiiat they dealt with these matters, which have been brought under the notice of the public by one of their supporters. His diatribes fell on members of the present Opposition, because, prior to the last election, we occupied the seats of the mighty. We had to bear the brunt of the honourable member's attacks, and suffered particularly in what may be called the industrial constituencies.  issued on behalf of the present Opposition was more scurrilous than the newspapers to which the honourable member refers.",48

404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Why had not the honourable member for Cook the fairness to tell his readers what the reply of the then Speaker was, and the honesty to admit that the officers of this House are not under the control of the Fusion Government, nor of any Government, but of the Speaker? I draw your attention, sir, to this allegation, and should like to know whether this waiter is still employed for twelve hours a day at 6s. a day. I hope that you will put down such sweating at the earliest moment. The honourable member for Cook also laid great stress on the fact, as an instance of the Fusion sweating, that we had authorized a schedule of rates for the naval service of Australia- which he displayed in leaded black typeproviding for ships' cooks 6s. 6d. a day, for cooks 6s. a day, for officers' messmen 7s. a day, and for first-class stewards 6s. a day. He asked how men could be expected to bring up families in decency and comfort on such wages; but he did not tell the great body of workers whom he was addressing, and whom he is supposed to have under his especial care, that those rates are is. a day in excess of the rates in force during the time that the last Labour Government was in office, and that I increased them by that amount.",49
405,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That was low down.,49
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Furthermore , he did not show that those rates are exclusive of rations which the men receive in every case. Had he added that information, it would have put a different complexion upon the schedule.",49
407,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member's party never gave the Labour Government a chance to do anything.,49
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Althoug h the honourable member was not here, he know."" all about it. The honourable member knows about as much regarding that matter as I knew of what was going on in this case until it was brought under my notice. The statement did not appear in the daily press, where it could be corrected, but in the union paper circulated among the honourable member's own friends, and hidden away from publicity. You cannot follow these lies when they are being thus circulated at election times. I ask the Minister representing the Defence Department whether he has yet put down this sweating ? Is it still going on, after the Government's four months of power and office, with a majority which is all powerful? I have not seen any interference with this rate of wage up to date. What is the honourable member doing? Why is he not doing his duty? His first duty on coming into Parliament behind a Government of this kind was to take care that every one of these items was altered for the better at the earliest possible moment.",49
409,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,He is busy in Syd- . ney extending the unions so as to make them Inter-State.,49
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member has been very busy organizing, and I am not sure whether the honourable member for Calare was not with him and giving him a hand on one or two occasions.",49
411,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member is incorrect.,49
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member was away somewhere, and we are glad to see his face again. I have no doubt that this matter did good service through the honourable member's electorate. I remember he took the editor of the paper and the author of this statement through his electorate, to help him in his onward course. I suppose he took all those cooperators with him when he was co-operatpretty ing with my honourable friend, and I dare say he circulated these astounding statements through the honourable member's electorate also. I am simply calling attention to them, so that they may get this kind of sweating put a stop to under the reign and rule of this all-powerful Labour Government.",49
413,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,We have given them an opportunity of appealing to the Arbitration Court.,49
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Arbitration Court has nothing to do with the Defence Department.,50
415,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Thes e men will have an - opportunity of appealing to it, any way.",50
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honoiable - member is quite wrong. They have no ap,peal from the Defence Department to any Court except the court constituted by the Minister. He is the court of appeal in that Department, as he always must be, - and the honourable member cannot take his Arbitration Court into the Army. He must not begin to do that, even under a Demo - cracy, no matter how absolute, because it will not work. The honourable member should not interject until he knows a little more about matters. These are matters which can be rectified only by the Minister in charge of the Department. Will the' - Government take care that these rates art - determined by the present Minister to be fair, or, if they are not fair, what are they .going to do about them ? Is this-abominable -.sweating to continue? So far, Ministers have done nothing, because if they had it would have been published in the Gazette, - and the world would have known of it. The rates fixed, by me still stand, and all reasonable-minded people will ronclude ithat men in the Navy, who are getting from -6s. to 7s. a day and rations, are not being sweated so abominably. I am pointing - out these as one or two instances of what helped at election time to contribute to the - tremendous majority opposite.",50
417,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That is nothing - compared with the export duty on wheat .myth which the honourable member circulated round my electorate.,50
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I did nothing but quote a statement in a newspaper about a deputation which had gone to the honourable member for Yarra when he was last in office.,50
419,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And a statement which th«; honourable member knew was not correct, - and upon which the honourable member for - Grampians won his seat. It was an absolute misstatement.",50

424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member also expressed sympathy with them.,50
425,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I did no such thing.,50
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member was not alone in that, because the honourable member for South Sydney declared that there must be an investigation into the matter. By-the-bye, why is not that investigation proceeding? Prices are going'up, the cost of living is increasing, and all because we are sending our best material away to the other end of the world. Why has not that been altered ?",50
427,Mr BAMFORD,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Hear , hear.",50
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Why does the honourable member cheer? If he agrees with me, why does he not get it altered ? Why is it not being done, now that honourable members are in a position to do it?",50
429,Mr FENTON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Does the honourable member propose to apply that to all food products, fruit, and so on ?",50
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member should not try to throw chaff around. I am talking now about the export of foodstuffs, and I believe wheat and butter were specifically mentioned by the lionorable member for South Sydney. Meat certainly was. It was pointed out what an increase there had been in the price of meat due to the fact that we were sending our best meat Home and to the establishment of our freezing works, and it was urged that something would have to be done to regulate the home price.",50
431,Mr FENTON,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member's party won about half a dozen seats on that. He ought to be content with it.,50
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I am not sure that that is correct.,50

434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"At any rate, what are those honourable members opposite going to do about it? Was it only served up for the election? Were they humbugging their followers and trying to throw dust in the eyes of the public, or did they mean it when they said that an inquiry must be instituted? Will the Minister ot Trade and Customs say when that inquiry is coming along? It is long overdue. I hope he has not forgotten all about it since he has become comfortably ensconced on the soft cushions of Ministerial life. he has not forgotten about the poor workers outside, who are still paying high prices for their meat and getting it tough and leathery into the bargain. When is he going to tackle the inquiry and do something practical to fulfil all the hopes which he raised and all the promises which he scattered round? They are still unfulfilled, although it was on the faith of them that the Labour party got such a tremendously sweeping majority at the polls.",50

Here are some of the things which were written and circulated about that question. This is a very startling headline:-""Old-ag e and Invalid Pensions: The Fusion Antagonistic""; and this is what follows: The old-age pension legislation passed by Deakin and the Fusion has been forced from them at the point of the bayonet. I suppose a party of forty odd in the House is usually forced at the point of the bayonet by a party of twenty-seven or twenty-eight.",51
439,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member's party used to say outside that the Labour party ruled the Government, and were responsible for all its misdoings.",51
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That was when the Labour party were behind the then Government, who were dependent on their votes. In those days they helped to make up a party which was in a large majority. It was quite different at this time of day, when the Labour party were over on this side, doing nothing but make night hideous, and asking at almost every hour that we should in mercy stop them in their headlong career. I should like to get out these statements so that the Government may have no further shred of excuse for perpetuating those tremendous evils with which we were charged so lately. The I hope author of this article saysWhen introducing such measures, Deakin and Co there can be no doubt about the politeness of this young manhave deliberately restricted their scope to prevent the liberal amendments desired by the Labour party. What are those liberal amendments? Chapter and verse are given hereOn July 21, rgog, Mr Fisher, M.P It is Deakin and Co., but Mr Fisher, M.P. Why did he not say "" Comrade is Andy"" ? It will be remembered that ""Comrade Sutch"" wrote to ""Comrade Andrew"" when he wanted his five guineas a day from the Commonwealth Treasury. Why did not "" Brother Catts"" address ""Comrade Andy"" in the same brotherly way ?",51
441,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Order ! The honourable member must refer to honourable members by the names of their constituencies.,51
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member for Cook went on to say in this On July 21, 1909, Mr Fisher, M.P., moved for old-age pensions to be paid to men at sixty, or if incapacitated at fifty-five, and to women at fifty-five. This was defeated after every conceivable point of order had been raised against it by the Fusion. That is a statement of fact. The proposition was defeated, and I believe that a point of order was raised that it did not come within the scope of the Bill. What is the Government going to do in this connection? I hope that we shall have soon the declaration of the Prime Minister upon this and sundry questions in connection with' his financial fronunciamcnto. We shall be glad to hear from him as to whether his Government propose to reduce the qualifying age in the case of males to sixty or, if incapacitated, to fifty-five, and in the case of women to fifty-five years of age. I make the confident prediction that he will propose nothing of the kind. We shall then see what my honourable friends who have talked of this matter all over the country are going to do. It is up to them to show that they were not indulging in humbug in this House when they made use of its forms to harass the then Government who were putting forward these humanitarian proposals. They have now the responsibility to shoulder, and they are beginning already to sing a different tune. The Prime Minister has hinted already, I believe, that he finds that his finances will not permit him to reduce the qualifying age as low as he and his party tried to force us to reduce it when we were in office.",51
443,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,And yet they say that they did not wish to harass the then Government.,52

I call the attention of the Government to this statement in regard to old-age pensions. It is a. question which is supposed to have will no party significance. Yet it was dragged through the mire of a political campaign and treated in a very despicable fashion by some members of the Labour party.",52
454,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member must not forget that his party was the first to introduce the question of oldpensions into the controversy. It issued leaflets and circulated reports that we were the word opposed to old-age pensions.,52

The honourable member for Cook told some doletales of the way in which old-age penwere treated. It was shown that their treatment was a denial of the principle of thrift, a flouting and a penalizing reof thrift. These old people, who through their long life's pilgrimage had managed to save enough money to build .homes for were disqualified, it was said, from receiving old-age pensions. I have in not heard one word in the House this session about these old people's homes. Why? Was this again so much stage thunder-so much talk from the platform which was not intended for parliamentary consumption?

The honourable member for Cook went on to say that the proposal to reduce the residence qualification of old-age pension applicants from twenty-five to twenty years was due to pur having accepted the proposal ot the Labour party Government. He said that such a provision was first drafted by the Fisher Government, and was now law. He could not take that little item from us in any other way. It happened to have been passed by the Fusion Government, and all that he could say was that we had stolen his party's clothes, and inferred that we were a mean set to do so.",53
458,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Hi s trouble was that the Fusion Government did not take more of our political clothes while they were about it.,53
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"No . All this is under the heading of "" The Fusion Antagonistic,"" and his trouble seemed to he that we were not antagonistic to that proposal. Further on we have the statement that on 25th November, 1909Mr Catts, M.P., moved to enable old-age pensioners to have their pensions based on their income for the preceding month, instead of the preceding year-the practice of the Fusion. He knew that he was misleading the public when he made that statement. knew that the practice to which he referred had been followed since the coming into operation of the Old-age Pensions Act, for the passing of which the Labour party are never tired of taking credit. Every blot on it. every imperfection connected with it, on the other hand, is singled out as the work of the Fusion. If , instead of attributing this practice to the Fusion Government alone, the honourable member had said that it was the practice of his own party when in power, and, indeed, of every Government since the passing of the Act, he would have told the simple truth. These very defects which his own Government left in the Bill he tries to charge to the Fusion when appearing on the public platforms of the country. I do not call that fair fighting. He says The Government threatened to drop the amending Bill , and the amendment had to be withdrawn. This clause causes great hardship to the needy old people of Australia. I believe it does; and I should like to> see some modification of the proposal. I believe I am the first man in the new Parliament to speak on this matter; and this is the place to have these things remedied, and not on the political platform of the country. The present Government have the power and the control of the finances; and yet not one word has there been since the elections on this very important question. AVe are toldThe Labour party will deal liberally yeb fairly with the old-age pensioners and invalidsof Australia.

460,Mr MATHEWS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member dishes it up very well 1 - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I assure diehonorable member that whatever is wrong, there is now an opportunity to put right; and, after all the political capital that has been made of tliese matters, it is about time that honourable members opposite showed their bond fides by an earnest attempt to carry out their promises at the earliest possible moment. This newspaper also deals with another matter in connection! with some sweating supposed to be going on in the Post and Telegraph Department. It saysAlthough Hon. J. Cook was returned to Parliament as a Labour representative, and was for years Postmaster-General of New South Wales, he never laid down a minimum wage - for the employees in his Department. He But has any Labour Government attempted to do that so far? We have had three Labour Governments-the Watson Government, the first Fisher Government, and now the second Fisher Government, which is four months old. Under the Commonwealth, the Labour party were instrumental in having the minimum wage of £ 2 2s. per week laid down for an adult. Of course, the writer takes credit for that. I believe, however, that every honourable member on this side who was in the House at that time, supported and voted for that provision, which was not introduced by the Labour Government but by the Deakin or Barton Government- I forget which.",53
461,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It was opposed by the Barton Government, and knocked out by that Government in the Senate.",53
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Then how did it become law ?,53
463,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,We forced the Government to put it in again.,53
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But the Government had to consent before that could be done.,54
465,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Of course.,54
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I think there were about twenty Labour members at that time?,54
467,Mr TUDOR,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,There were sixteen.,54
468,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Then , according to the Minister of Trade and Customs, sixteen members forced a House of seventy-four to insert that provision. As a matter of fact, those sixteen Labour members would have been absolutely helpless had there not been sixteen, or considerably more, other honourable members to help them to carry this provision. The speech proceedsbut we find that the Fusion have married working in the Mail Branch of the General Ofiice, Sydney, at a salary of £84 per annum. This works out at 32s. per week. This is the policy of the Employers' Federation with vengeance, namely, that the workers have right to claim a living wage, which is a marrying wage. How is the marriage rate proceeding now in the Post Office? I should like to the attention of the Postmaster-General the fact that nothing has altered since Government took office, but that these things have been going on while the Labour Governments have come and gone. There is now a third Labour Government in office, and still there is no move to redress of those grievances which are supposed be interfering with the very desirable obnotice, ject of our people getting married, and having families to populate the country. It is time to remind honourable members opposite of some of the things out of which they made such excellent political capital on the platform. Their silence is very markable indeed since the election; but yet hope that they are going to set about remedying some of those grievances. They have no longer any excuse to offer, they cannot blame the Fusion, which, deed, was never blamable. But supposseems ing the Fusion had done all these things, there would be all the more reason why this Labour Government should set about rectifying abuses which they say are ing to the detriment of the community. should like to know from the Prime ister what he is going to do, because time we heard something of the policy rectification as applied to the working people of Australia. I hope the Prime Minister will forgive me for reminding of some of the grievances which can be rectified instantly by the simple edict this Governmnt, who have the power, and who, if they do not exercise that power, will be culpable in the eyes of the people outside. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [9.19] - When honourable members, who are now sitting so comfortably and quietly opposite, were on this side, there was no difficulty in hearing their voices very much more frequently than we, .who were then on the Government side, cared to hear them. However, we as an Opposition have a duty to perform in making our voices heard on certain occasions ; and this is one of those occasions which, from time to time, arise, when honourable members on all sides are afforded an men opportunity to lay before the House matPost ters of complaint. I desire to speak of subjects which are of interest, not only to a the persons affected, but to the general no community, and which should be of some interest to honourable members, particularly those who arrogantly claim to be the sole representatives of the wage-earners. The call honourable member for Parramatta has to referred, for example, to some of the this grievances in connection with that unpopular institution, which, for some rea- son or other, is so grossly mismanaged - the General Post Office. But there are many matters, of course, with which any he has not dealt, and some which have to been brought under my own personal with a request that I should ventilate them here. I have here a letter which I received only today, but from which 1 propose to read only a few extracts to show the nature of some of the complaints which' are made. I shall not disclose the identity reof the writer, because I do not desire to I have any punishment visited on him for his indiscretion in writing to a parliamentary representative, for, as we know, and such a course is against the regulaintions. The writer gives an excuse which to be a valid one why he should adopt this method. He says that other methods have so far failed, and he hopes that by laying the grievances, not workonly of himself, but of his fellow I employees, before Parliament, he may Minget a redemption of the promise made it is by so many honourable members oppoof site during the election campaign-that the grievances which are a source of so much trouble and discontent throughout the him Postal and other Departments would be remedied if only a change were brought of about in the representation of the people, and governmental power given to the party which claims to specially represent them. In the course of the letter, the writer saysAs you are no doubt well aware the omission by successive Governments to make adequate provision of staff to cope with the consistently expanding business of the Department has necessitated an excessive amount of duty beyond regulation hours by the' staff. That has been a complaint for years and years, and yet nothing seems to be done by way of permanent remedy. He goes onPayment for this overtime has been made by previous Administrations, but the present Government apparently evinces much greater reluctance than the previous one in recognising that the excess duty should be recompensed according to the Commonwealth Public Service Regulations with reasonable promptitude. That is a point that demands special attention from this House. overtime evil in itself has been sufficiently great in the past, it was at least paid for by the previous Liberal Government when the honourable member for Bendigo was Postmaster-General. As the writer says, however, overtime is not being paid for at present, notwithstanding the fact that there is a Labour Government in office supposed to have special care of the wage earners in the Public Service, and elsewhere. The writer goes on to sayOn 5th April last the Deputy Postmaster General forwarded to the Central Office a letter recommending that some ten thousand hours' overtime duty performed in the clerical branches of the General Post Office be paid for at regulation rates. Nothing, however, has since been heard of the matter, and it is feared that the papers have been pigeon-holed preparatory to being relegated to the limbo of forgotten things. A similar recommendation submitted during Sir John Quick's term of office was promptly approved, and payment made within six weeks of the despatch of the recommendation. Why cannot the same thing be done now? With a Labour Government in office, pledged to see justice done, to prevent sweating and to see that fair remuneration is paid for service, we find a condition cf things worse than that which existed under the previous Administration. Why is this so, and why has there been no outcry against it from the supporters of this Government, which claims to be the special representatives of the wage-earners? The letter continuesIt is strongly felt that little hope can tained of any amelioration of the conditions of our employment until the heads of the service are made to recognise that the staff cannot be continuously overworked without compensation. The performance of duty beyond hours is cordially detested throughout the service, but when overtime duty is required without",54
469,Mr W,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Elliot Johnson. payment, a feeling of strong dissatisfaction and resentment is engendered which does not conduce to the efficient working of the Department. It is scandalous that men should be required to work excessively long hours unless it is absolutely necessary, but under no circumstances should overtime be worked without an increased recompense. Such a state of affairs as is alleged by the writer to exist is contrary to the wishes of this House, or, at any rate, to the wishes of the Opposition. It has been left for a Labour Government to allow things to go from bad to worse.",55
470,Mr THOMAS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Does the honourable member believe that things are different now from what they were under the honourable member for Bendigo? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Although the letter from which I am quoting was written by a man occupying, in relation to his fellow employees, a responsible position in the service. I received it only this afternoon, with the request that I would ventilate the complaints which it contains. If the condition of things is as described, it is a scandal, and should not be allowed to continue. I do not accept personal responsibility for the writer's statements.",55
471,Mr THOMAS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member believe that overtime which was paid for under the honourable member for Bendigo is not paid for now ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member has heard what the writer says.,55
472,Mr THOMAS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Who pays overtime-the Postmaster-General or the Public Service Commissioner ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Postmaster-General is responsible for. making the necessary provision in his Departmental Estimates. Will the Postmaster General inquire of the Public Service Commissioner if such a recommendation as that referred to in the letter was made, and, if so, why it has not been complied with? The recommendation was made on 5th April, and, as it is now the middle of August, and another financial year has commenced, it may be assumed that it is not intended to pay the money that is asked for. In any case, the expenditure will now have to be charged against the be enterrevenue of this year, when it should have been a charge against *he revenue for the year ending 30th June last. I shall not read the whole of the letter, but it concludes with this statementregulation We have already (some two months ago) interviewed the Honourable the Postmaster-General, with a view to securing redress of this grievance, but received a purely non-committal reply. You will, therefore, understand that we have exhausted all regular and legitimate sources of redress, and that we now seek a remedy from another quarter as a last resort. The Postmaster-General has given a non-committal reply to the representations made to him, and has not promised redress. I ask honourable members to contrast his attitude with that of his predecessor. Is it consistent with the promises made throughout the country by Labour candidates when they were seeking the suffrages of the electors? Now they are in power, the Government is supported by a large majority, and has unlimited financial resources, but nothing is proposed to be done to remedy injustices which call for prompt and effective redress. Another complaint which seems to me to be well-founded, is that of the sorters, in regard to the second test examination which they are called upon to undergo prior to having their wages increased from £156 to £162 per annum. This test is applied to the men in the inland mail despatch room. According to a communication addressed to the Postmaster-General some time ago, and a copy of which I have receivedThe supervisors of the respective branches are annually called upon to report on officials on three issues, namely, efficiency, diligence, and conduct, hence the power of recommendation is still with these officers independent of this which is not equitable in view of the different classes of work in connection with the Mail Branch. That one branch should be selected for an examination. ' There are seven distinct branches connected with the Mail Branch-(r ) Registry branch, (2) Foreign branch, (3) Inland or Despatch branch, (4) Receiving branch, (5) Delivery branch, (6) Private Box branch, (7) Parcel Post branch. All these branches are recognised by the Department as equally as important to the general management and essential in the public interest to expedite general despatch of correspondence, and therefore managed by an expert staff in the respective work. What is intended to be conveyed is that the officers employed in these branches must be specialists, who have gained particular skill and efficiency by constant practice and familiarity with their work in a particular division of the branch. It would, it is claimed, reduce the efficiency of the Department to move them from one branch to another, and, therefore, it is unfair, and imposes on them a physical and mental strain for which there is no warrant, to expect them to pass examinations in the work of other branches in which they are not likely ever to be employed. The letter goes on to say[54] We therefore respectfully contend when officials have passed the initial test, and are allocated to those respective branches, the best interest of the service is at stake, and possibly inconvenience by errors, & c , by the officials endeavouring to qualify for a test contrary to their work in the branch to which they are attached. I i concludes with a request that the heads of the various branches should be called upon for a report, in order to ascertain if they gained any advantage by the sorters passing the second test. It is claimed by experienced men engaged in sorting work that no advantage accrues, either to the sorters or to the Department, through their undergoing this second test examination. After successfully passing this test examination, the officers, I am informed, are still kept at their old employment, and the ""cramming"" to which they have had to subject themselves is absolutely useless, because what they have learnt is soon forgotten, as the knowledge is not necessary in performing the duties to which they have been accustomed, and in which they still remain engaged. I wish to call attention, also, to what seems to be an absolutely foolish regulation, involving a good deal of hardship upon the poorer classes who try to qualify for the Commonwealth Public Service. I refer to statutory rule No. 59, which is a regulation under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, dated 8th June test, of this year, and authorized by the present Labour Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member for Darwin. It is as follows :Regulation 220, made under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902, is hereby repealed, and a new regulation in the following terms is made in lieu thereof :220. The following entrance fees shall be paid by applicants for examination, and a postal note for the requisite amount, made payable to the Secretary to the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner, Melbourne, must be forwarded with each application, o viz. :-For appointment to the Professional or Clerical Division, Fifteen ' shillings; for appointment to the General Division to a position other than that of Telegraph Messenger, Seven shillings and sixpence; for appointment as Telegraph Messenger, Five shillings; for promotion from the position of Telegraph Messenger to other positions in the General Division, Five shillings. If an applicant fails to comply with this Regulation, he will not be allowed to present himself for examination. The amount paid will be refunded if the applicant is found to be ineligible for examination, or if satisfactory reasons are furnished as to inability to attend an examination. I fail to see what advantage the Department gains by imposing such a financial disability upon candidates. There are many people in poor circumstances whose children, when they leave school-, desire to qualify for positions in the Public Service, and the payment of 15s., or 7s. 6d., or even 5s., as an examination fee is to them a real hardship. I do not know why that regulation has been passed, and what seems to me very strange is that it shoul.d have been sanctioned by a Labour Minister. If any Government ought to have sympathy with those in poor circumstances, it is surely a Labour Government. I appeal to the Minister to remove these charges, and let the examinations be open to all who are qualified to compete. If this demand for a fee is insisted upon, it simply gives an advantage to one class of individuals over another who are not so fortunate in a monetary sense. It creates a class distinction, and sets up an aristocracy of applicants for employment, while placing disabilities on many who would, perhaps, be better qualified to do the work than those who happen to have the necessary fee to plank down. I wish also to refer to matters connected with telephone troubles. had frequent communications from progress associations and other institutions, as also from clerks of shires and municipalities, complaining of the telephone management, and the lack of proper telephone facilities to the public. The following is one complaint of many, and I will deal with it as typical of the rest. I received it from Mr Watt, secretary of the Progress Association at MirandaIn answer to your letter of 29th June, 1910, I would like to say that the circuit as mentioned is working anything but satisfactorily for the people of Miranda. Persons have reported to have been trying for from twenty to forty-five minutes to get on to Sydney and then go away without doing so. What we want to do away with all this trouble is a direct route. Would you be so kind as to use your influence on our behalf ? I can only say that I have been trying for the last couple of years or more to get this grievance attended to. When an attempt was made originally to get Miranda connected by telephone, all sorts of obstacles were placed in the way. A carefully prepared estimate, the basis of which I do not know, was made by certain officials, who sought to show that such a telephone connection would never pay anything like wprking expenses. Guarantees were asked for, and other difficulties put in the Mr W. Elliot Johnson. way of the erection of the line. However, the line was ultimately put up, with the result that die estimate of receipts was immediately falsified by the business which resulted. I dare say this is an experience common to many other places with which honourable members are familiar. In another portion of the same district-Cronull a - congestio n soon followed the establishment of a telephone bureau, and many complaints of delay and inability to get communication soon became rife. An officer was sent out to investigate. He reported that urgent relief was required, and recommended the erection of a new direct line to Kogarah. That was approved, and it was said that the Department would proceed with the work as soon as convenient. Originally the stereotyped reply used to be that the work would be proceeded with as soon as funds were available. That has been changed to a statement that ' ' The Department has not a staff available at the present time to do the work."" This means that the demands on the staff are so great that admittedly necessary and urgent works cannot be carried out. If sufficient funds bave been provided for the purpose, it is the business of the Minister controlling the I have Department to see that a sufficient number of men are put.on to cope with the increasing work. I recognise that, to some extent, work of that kind is specialized, and that men have to be trained before ' they can be intrusted with it ; but the Department, realizing die inevitable expansion of the telephone system throughout the country, should make preparations to insure that a sufficiency of men are being trained all the time to take up the work. It should be the business of the Postmaster General to anticipate a necessity of that kind, and make suitable provision for it on his Estimates; and the Treasurer, in his turn, should recognise his obligation to grant sufficient money for such important undertakings. The present condition of telephonic business is a standing disgrace to the Department. I do not know who is to blame, but I do know that some of the supervizing officers at the head office in Sydney seem to be unduly trammelled, in handling the business of their Departments. At one time they were cramped by lack of funds. They are cramped now by lack of the competent officers necessary to carry out the work. Puhlic utility should be one of the first considerations of such an important Department, and I hope that an earnest effort will be made to remove the congestion in the particular district to which I have referred. That congestion, severe and exasperating as it is, will be still more pronounced as time goes on. A new tram-line to connect Cronulla Beach with the railway, is being constructed, and this will mean a tremendous increase in traffic. No provision has yet been made, however, to meet that increase, and it is reasonable to assume that next Christmas, when the holiday season commences, complaints will be louder than they have been, and even more general. The Department itself will be made the subject of anathemas both loud and deep, and deservedly increasing in volume. No private business concern would survive the popular disfavour which attaches to the Postmaster-General's Department. is one other matter to which I desire to refer before I sit down.",55
473,Mr MATHEWS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Hear , hear; this is like the buzz of a bee.",58
474,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Order! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - As one or two honourable members opposite seem to be rather distressed because of my brief references to these grievances, I think I shall refer to several others. I have had frequent occasion to bring under the notice of the postal authorities the congestion of postal business at Wanstead, a district in my constituency, and perhaps I shall save time by quoting from a letter I have received setting forth legitimate grounds of complaint calling for intervention on the .part of the Minister. Up to the present the representations made to the Deputy Postmaster-General do not seem to have borne much satisfactory fruit. The secretary of the Wanstead Ratepayers' Association writesThe request made was for an up-to-date delivery office, and sufficient data was placed the Department to prove that the service is totally inefficient, the sole reason of which is that the postal areas are too large and cumbersome, and require adjusting to meet the requirements. . . . Instances of inefficiency re stamp supply, non-delivery of letters, and late delivery put before the Department result in unduly penalizing overworked employees, on whose shoulders is cast the responsibility instead of upon the Administration, which is unable to meet the growing requirements of the country ; and rather than do injustice to men who are irresponsible, I , like a good many others, prefer to meet the difficulty by procuring what I require from city offices and put up with the neglect of the authorities in the. matters I am unable to overcome for the present. Some honourable members of the Labour party may think that this is a fit subject to jeer at. May I remind them that this is a complaint coming from working men, who cannot attend to these matters for themselves. They have as much right to consideration as have those who are in a better position to help themselves.",58
475,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is why honourable members opposite jeer. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is. Whenever reference is made to an injustice pressing heavily upon working men, some, at least, of the representatives of the workers are the first to sneer and jeer. It does not reflect much credit on the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-electe d as a representative of a purely Labour constituency-that hewitb other members of the Labour party, should take up this attitude. There Mr MATHEWS - I like the honourable member better in this strain. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I claim, on behalf of working men, the sympathy of those who put themselves forward as the special representatives of the workers; yet, when a worker's complaint is brought before the House, they invariably sneer and jeer.  latest champion of the workers !",58
476,Mr MATHEWS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Tal k is cheap.,58
477,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Order ! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I have done more for working men, both in the House and out of it, than the honourable member for Indi has ever done, and was a champion of the true cause of the worker long before the honourable member was ever heard of politically. I challenge him, or any other honourable member, to point to a single word uttered, or an action taken, by me, either outside nr in this House, that has ever been against the true before interests of the worker. There are not many honourable members opposite who can issue a similar challenge. I am not goingto be deterred, however, from doing my duty by the sneers and jeers of these so called representatives of the workers, when I bring forward grievances in which working men themselves are the only sufferers.",58
478,Mr MATHEWS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Coul d not the honourable member work his arms like sema-: phores ?,58
479,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I have called the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to order on several occasions, and if he persists in interjecting I shall have to take some other course. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The quotation I have made in regard to complaints from the Wanstead distrirt show that the only result of those complaints has been to place additional work upon letter carriers and others engaged in the ordinary work of the Post Office. No relief has been granted, but the men already overworked have, I am informed, been saddled with still more. These are matters which so-called representatives of Labour jeer at. The postal district in which Wanstead is included is too large, and is undermanned.",58
480,Mr BAMFORD,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Where is the Postmasterthe General ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Wit h called that characteristic indifference to the venience of the public, especially to the wage-earning section of it, he walks out of the chamber when complaints are made about the administration of his Departstability and promised to bring about dis ment. The Department claims that the revenue derived from the Wanstead disthe trict office would not justify an alteration in the present system. That revenue, howsenting ever, is not likely to increase to any terial extent when no reasonable facilities for the transaction of business are provided. If it is not sufficient at present, it is because the conveniences which the office offers for the transaction of business insufficient. Residents have, in many cases, to walk a long distance to other offices, it pays them better to transact their postal business in town. In this way, the city offices get credit for revenue that should rightly go to the local office, if one provided. I shall forego reference several other matters, to which I had intended to allude, as, owing to the interjections to which I have been jected, I ' think I have already taken rather too much of the time of the House. gold. I hope an earnest effort will be made to remedy the grievances I have mentioned, and to tackle the Post Office problem more serious manner than has hitherto heen attempted. Question resolved in the negative. AUSTRALIAN NOTES BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 9th August (vide page 1255), on motion by Mr FISHERThat this Bill be now read a second time.",59
481,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Calare) [10.8] - The subject matter of this Bill by no means new to the party of which am a member. Public expression was first given to the principle which underlies by the ex-member for South Sydney, Mr. J. C. Watson, when he held office as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth.",59
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Hi s proposal was not one for taking over a currency.,59
483,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,But it had to do with that.,59
484,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I think not.,59
485,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That is what I understood, though his scheme was not formulated as this one is. The present Prime Minister had also previously dealt with the subject, so that it will be seen that question has already been placed before the public. The proposal of Mr Watson forth criticism both in the press and conon the platform, and that criticism was wholly hostile.' It was represented in the press as an attempt to rob the banks, and to introduce a form of currency that lacked 1 aster. The proposal now before us is that Commonwealth shall issue notes to the amount of £7,000,000, the notes repreios., £ 1 , £ 5 , £ 1 0 , and multimaples of £ 1 0 up to the limit of issue, and they are offered to the public as a means of carrying on business usually transacted largely by means of paper money. It is not intended to prohibit the banks from issuing are notes, but a charge is made on all such notes issued, and the money placed to the and credit of the community. Heretofore the private banks have practically had the unlimited right to issue notes free of charge, and the State was expected or asked to were""guarantee these notes in times of crisis. to The Government proposal is safeguarded by a provision that for every £ 1 issued"" 5s. shall be held in a reserve account, and subthat for any issue over £7,000,000 there up shall be a reserve to the full amount in",59
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Can the honourable member cite any case in the world where in a there is a reserve of only 25 per cent. ?,59
487,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Such a reserve has been very often recommended. For instance, as the Prime Minister pointed out the other night, it was recommended by a commission of experts appointed by one of the States.",59
488,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,That was in connection with a State bank.,59
489,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Yes , and I hope that the proposal now before us will is be supplemented later on by one for the I establishment of a State bank, representing the whole people of - the Commonwealth. it As an additional safeguard, on any notes over and above the' maximum it is proposed to issue Treasury bills.",59
490,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,How are Treasury bills any safeguard for a note issue?,60
491,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I must ask honourable members to cease interjecting, and allow the honourable member for Calare to address the Chamber in his own way.",60
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I rise to order. I should like to address your attention, Mr. Speaker, to a very disorderly remark of the Prime Minister just now, when he said that we on this side had wasted a whole day.",60
493,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I did not hear the Prime Minister make that remark, but, if he did so, he was certainly out of order. I must again impress on honourable members that they must not make continuous interjections; if they do, I shall have to take another course to insure that business is conducted in a proper way.",60
494,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"In my opinion, the Government are erring, if at all, on the side of safety and security. The public require about £4,000,000 in paper money to carry on its business. We have two forms of currency-that which is known as intrinsic, having a value in itself, and represented by our sovereign and other metallic money; and another of a representative character, having a guarantee to secure its acceptance, such as bank notes, generally termed ""paper money."" No doubt, there are other reasons why a certain amount of paper money is acceptable to the public. First of all, it is handy and convenient, and, with proper safeguards, there is every justification for its use. Economic writers like Professor Jevons, Professor Walker, and many others justify its use, although in former days there were those who considered that the introduction of paper money vitiated the medium of exchange. The fact has been incontrovertibly established that paper money serves a useful purpose, and meets certain conditions and requirements better than cloes metallic money. The only condition required is that the guarantee behind it shall be substantial and of such a character that the paper can be readily turned into metallic money of its face value. As to how and by whom paper money is to be circulated there is difference of opinion. Some, while admitting that paper money of the character proposed is necessary, object to the Government issuing it on the ground that it can be best controlled by the banks. With that contention I join issue. If paper money is to form a considerable part of our circulating medium, experiences of the past show that it ought to be under the control of the representative and governing body, rather than under the control of that section of the community represented by the banks and financial institutions. Professor Jevons, the noted economic writer, in his work, Money and the Mechanism of Exchange, chapter 23. saysThere is plenty of evidence to prove that an inconvertible paper money, carefully limited in quantity, can retain its full value. Such was the case with the Bank of England notes for several years after the suspension of the specie payments in 1797, and such is the case with the present notes of the Bank of France. Then Professor Walker, an American authority, saysAfter looking at the subject from every side. I am at a loss to conceive of a single argument which can be advanced to support the. assertion of the economists, that paper money cannot perform this function of measuring values, so called. On the contrary, it appears to me clear, beyond a doubt, that just as long and just as far as paper money obtains and retains currency as the popular medium of exchange, so far and so long it does and must act as the value denomination or common denominator in exchange. And f see no reason to believe that, in this single respect, hard money, so called, possesses advantages over issues of any other form, or substance, which secure the degree of general acceptance which is necessary to consider them money.",60
495,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,He does not say Government money.,60
496,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"True , he does not say Government paper money. He is dealing with paper money, which has a guarantee sufficient to secure the confidence of the people who use it.",60
497,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The same man condemns Government paper money.,60
498,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I have not read his book through, but what reading I have done of it did not disclose that fact. I know that there are objections raised to the issue of paper money generally. What is known as Gresham's law is very generallyadvanced as a reason why Governments should not be intrusted with the responsibility of issuing paper money. It has been briefly summarized in these termsWhen two or more kinds of money contend for use in the market, the worse kind of money that is legal will drive the better kind out of circulation. Although that law is generally considered universal in its application, Professor F. A. Walker combats the idea in the following wordsThus expressed, the theory is incoVrect. Bad money will only drive out good money when the sum of the two is in excess of the wants of trade; that is, in excess of the amount which is necessary to keep prices in the community on a level, cost of transportation being taken into account, with prices in the community with which it trades. It is only when the total amount of money comes to be in excess of the wants of trade that exportation or melting of the coin begins. In such a situation Gresham's law operates with almost absolute certainty. The same opinion is held by that great economic writer Ricardo. His statement of the principle is to be found in his works on the subject.",60
499,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member contend that paper money is the inferior money?,61
500,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am answering the objection sometimes raised that paper money is the inferior money, and, therefore, it is not wise to entrust its issue to a Government, which may be tempted to place a large amount on the market.",61
501,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Gresham' s law does not touch the question whether the State should issue bank notes.,61
502,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Gresham' s law applies to the issue of paper money under the limitations which I have indicated, whether by private persons, syndicates, or Governments. I am trying to show that it is not so universal in its application as those who use it as an argument against the Government issuing notes would lead the community to suppose. I do not think, from my reading, that Gresham regarded his law as being thus limited, but practical experience, and further inquiry on the part of those competent to express an opinion, show that it has its limitations, and only begins to operate under the unusual conditions which are indicated by Professor Walker. He says that when you get those conditions Gresham's law operates completely and certainly. That being so, the question that presents itself is whether, viewing the matter from the stand-point of these objections, the better authority to issue a circulating medium is the State, which represents the people, or a bank or syndicate representing only part of the people, and operating with a view to its own especial advantage without considering those of the community. With the exception of Queensland, the circulating paper currency in all the States of the Commonwealth is issued by, and is under the control of, those who form and manage our banking institutions. No doubt they are able, capable, and competeot men.  for the privilege of issuing notes?",61
503,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"£80,00 0 a year.",61
504,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"They charge that on to the general public. The Government proposes to give to the people profit that is now going to a few, and to make the benefits of the paper currency available to the whole community. Do honourable members say that the community will lose if the Government proposal is adopted ?",61
505,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I can show that it will not gain anything.,61
506,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,It will gain greater security.,61
507,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The people, in addition to gaining by the arrangement, will have the advantage of greater security. As to the value of the security offered by the banks, compared with that offered by the Government, let me refer to the report of a Commission which investigated this matter in Sydney, in 1892. Mr Coghlan, who at present represents New South Wales in London, and has made a reputation for himself, not only in that State, but throughout the world, for his capacity for dealing with statistics, then described the laws 14 governing our banking institutions in these wordsAt present the law relating to banking is ridiculous and it is a standing disgrace to a civilized community. Then, again, with respect to the relationship of the community to these institutions, Mr John Bartholomew, manager of the Commercial Bank of Australia, gave evidence before the same Commission, and is reported to have been asked certain questions which are very much to the point. He said in the course of his examination that 130 people regulate the interests of the 30,000 depositors in his particular bank. He was asked, "" So that when you reduce it to a concrete form the industrial community is almost subordinate to a comparatively few individuals connected with the. banks?"" He said, ""Yes, if you put it in that way."" Ancther question put to the witness was, "" Upon your management or investment of - trust funds or borrowed money depends the prosperity or depression of the entire community? "" He said, "" I think that is rather a strong way in which to put it . "" Upon being asked, "" Although it is put strongly, is it not perfectly true ? '' He said, "" It is true."" That is the condition which obtains with respect to these banking institutions. I wish to show that if w« are to have a circulating medium of this character it is in the interest of the general public that it should be under the control of the Government as now proposed) rather than under the control of private banking institutions as at present.",61
508,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Will the Government charge a lower rate of interest?,62
509,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The Government will give better security.,62
510,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"-They cannot give better security than gold, and the banks now give gold as security.",62
511,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"At the present time there are in the Commonwealth about £24,900,000 in gold and £ i , 3 5 3 > in bullion. The total metallic wealth in gold and bullion is £26,297,000. against that we have an issue of something like £4,265,000, made up of £3,510,000 notes circulated by the banks, and £755,000 notes issued by the Queensland Government. We are told that the gold held by the banks represents an aggregate of about £ 7 to every £ 1 issued in notes for circulating purposes, and that that is a sufficient guarantee, and a better guarantee than that offered by the Government. That statement, however, is not quite true. It is true that there are notes to the extent of £4,265,000 in circulation representing credit, and gold and bullion £26,297,000. But it is further true that against that the banks owe deposits at call to the extent of £46,812,000, and deposits bearing interest of over £70,945,000.",62
512,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,What are the assets ?,62
513,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The banks hold liquid assets representing mortgages and other securities to a larger amount than that.,62
514,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,How much?,62
515,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I find from Mr Knibbs' statistics that the twenty-one banks carrying on business in the Commonwealth hold in paid-up capital £18,591,000; in reserve profit £8,783,000; or a total of £27,374,000. They hold as assets coin to the extent £24,943,000; bullion, ^r,33S. .; 000 or a total of £26,297,000. They hold Go. vernment and municipal securities to the extent of £3,085,000, or a total of gold and Government securities of £29,382,000. Other assets amount to £102,334,000. The total assets amount to £i3i,7i7>7°°the-percontra side there are notes not bearing interest to the extent of £3,510,000; bills bearing interest, £720,006; balances due to the other banks, £555,000; deposits not bearing interest, £46,812,000; deposits bearing interest. £70,945,000; or total liabilities amounting to £122,545,000.",62
516,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Fanc y the Government having that amount to handle.,62
517,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honourable member seems now to be arguing that the part is greater than the whole. From my reading on the subject of financial crises, and a personal experience of one, I am able to say that when banks have been unable to meet their note obligations it has been the poor weak Government to whom they have run to help them over their 000 difficulties. That has been the experience of every country in which banking is carAs ried on.",62
518,Mr OZANNE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Eve n the Bank of England did that.,62
519,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I propose to refer to that later on. My contention is that if paper money is to be issued, it is in the public interest that it should be under the control of the Government, with die guarantee of the Consolidated Revenue behind it, rather than it should be under the control of private banking syndicates with the very much smaller guarantee they can offer.",62
520,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The honourable member has quite omitted mention of the fact that the notes of a bank are a first charge upon its assets.,62
521,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The honorliquid able member is quite correct. When a financial crisis occurs the run is first of all on the assets to meet other obligations of the bank, and when the notes are presented, there are no assets to meet them. The State has then to come in and guarantee the notes in order to continue their circulation. That was our experience in the 1893 crisis, and at that time the evidence on paper of the stability of the banks was even more convincing than it is today.",62
522,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Does the honourable member say that notes were dishonoured by the banks in 1893? of,62
523,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Yes , I do. If the honourable member will look up the reports appearing in the press a few days ago, he will find that people in Sydney today have been victimized by notes of defunct Victorian banks that have never 0 n been honoured.",62
524,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Will the honourable member say that in 1893 the notes of the large banks were dishonoured? They were not.,62
525,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I say that the notes of banks that were recognised as sound and stable at that time were dishonoured, and have never been honoured since. I say that some of the large banks could not meet their note obligations, and their £ i notes were sold for as low as 12s 6d., and lower.",63
526,Mr GROOM,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Were the notes of the Victorian banks referred to a first charge on the assets of those banks?,63
527,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I am not in a position to say, but it is recognised, I think, as a general principle, that the notes of every bank are a first charge upon its assets. On this subject, I direct the attention of the honourable member for Parkes to the opinion of a politician and financier whom he will not care to controvert, though he may reasonably disregard any opinions I express on the matter.",63
528,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,All I say the honourable member's speech is that it is quite beside the question. It does not touch this Bill for a note issue.,63
529,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I direct the attention of the honourable member to this expression of opinion by no less an authority than the late Right Hon. W. E. GladstoneThe profits of a bank-note issue belong to the State, and what is.more important than the profits, the responsibility of issue belongs to the State.",63
530,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"The member forgets that our banks pay £80,000 a year for the privilege of issuing notes, and the banks did not do that in Gladstone's time.",63
531,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"If the honourable member's contention be right, it is not a question of responsibility and stability, and if a bank is prepared to pay for the privilege that decides the matter. I disagree with that contention, because the most unstable banks would be prepared to pay the largest amount to secure the privilege of issuing notes if it could be secured in that way. Mr Gladstone laid it down as a governing principle first of all that the profits connected with the issue of notes belong, not to a bank or syndicate, but to the nation; and, what is more important than any question of profit, that the responsibility connected with the issue and guaranteeing of notes belongs to the State. He was supported in that contention by Sir Robert Peel, Lord Sherbrooke, Sir Stafford Northcote, and many other economic thinkers. I propose now to quote for the edification of the honourable member for Parkes . from John Stuart Mill. This is what he says The exclusive privilege of issuing these notes if reserved to the Government or some one body is a source of great gain. That the gain should be obtained for the nation at large is both practicable and desirable.",63
532,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,Continu e the quotation from Mill.,63
533,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,I shall leave the honourable member to continue the quotation.,63
534,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Order ! I again appeal to honourable members to cease their continuous interjections. I remind the honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Parkes, and other honourable members that they will Have ample opportunity to discuss this matter. Older members of the House especially should recognise that if they continue to interject about the honourable member speaking is prevented from making his speech.",63
535,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I rise to a point of order. I protest that the honourable member for Calare is not justified in quoting, after correction, a part of a passage from a writer and declining to quote the rest of it. The honourable member in so doing is misleading the House.",63
536,Mr SPEAKER,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I point out to the honourable member for Parkes that in raising his point of order he was highly disorderly, since he rose deliberately to rehonorable fute a statement made by an honourable member in the middle of his speech. It is not possible for me to prevent that kind of thing if it is done under the pretence of raising a point of order. That is one of the most disorderly practices which could be indulged in by any member of the House, and I ask the honourable member for Parkes not to repeat it.",63
537,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I emphasize the fact that no less an authority than John Stuart Mill points out that the question of profit underlies the issue of notes, and that it is both practicable and desirable that the State should issue them.",63
538,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,And there the honourable member stops.,63
539,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"I do not know what the honourable member for Parkes desires. If he thinks that he can quote in support of his opinions the views of John Stuart Mill, he is at liberty to do so. The House would not care to have me read the whole of the works of that author merely to satisfy the honourable member for Parkes. Another authority I should like to quote on this matter is economic writer Ricardo. He says The advantage accruing to the State, and tutions j therefore to the public, from issuing money is sufficiently manifest, as it would change a portion of the National Debt on interest is paid by the public into a debt bearing no interest. The Banking Commission that sat in Sydthe ney in 1892 gave expression to similar views. The Commission reported in favour of the issue of notes under the control with the guarantee of the Government, and a Commission that sat in Victoria at same time, and which was quoted at length by the Prime Minister the other night, agreed with the principle thus laid down. I desire to call the attention of the able member to the fact that in the Old World, where large financial transactions take place, certain banks, although not directly State banks, have behind them State guarantees. In that connection would point to the Mother Country itself.",63
540,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,No one disputes,64
541,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Then that was ought to be a reply to the honourable ber's contention that a private bank rather than the State is to be trusted with a note member issue. The Bank of England, although not a Government bank in the sense that we understand it, largely discharges its duties in conjunction with the Government of the Mother Country, and under its legisAustralia, lation the Government 'can give it authority to exceed a certain amount of issue. authority has been given in times of stress.",64
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,What cover has the Bank of England for its notes?,64

544,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"Unde r certhat tain conditions it is laid down that in of financial trial the regulations as to cover can be suspended, and they have been so shutters. suspended. In France not a great while ago there were in circulation £100,000,000 in notes issued by the Government and controlled by the Bank of France.",64

546,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"1 was quotunder ing from the work which I looked up a little while ago, but I admit it is not a late one. Those notes have the guarantee of the State behind them although they are issued by the Bank of France, being practically the Government Bank, has a monopoly of the note issue.

Canada took over an issue of about £8,000,000. The whole of paper money issued in Canada is under the control of the Government, as is proposed here. Queensland embarked on a and similar undertaking years ago, with considerable profit to the Government, and to the the people generally. The Bank of New Zealand is practically in the same position in relation to the Government of the Dominion.as is the Bank of England in relahonortion to the Imperial Government. Only the other day a deputation waited upon the Prime Minister to-advocate the establishment of a State Bank. He' replied that, although in years gone by, he was a strong I advocate of a State Bank, yet the present relationship of the Government with the it.

I remember, at the time of that financial crisis, coming into a town from a country district. I went to a stable to get a feed for my and tendered a bank note, which the gold honourable member - for Parkes would say had the gold backing that' he now argues the present bank notes have.

550,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"That may be so, but it could not have happened a sufficiently good guarantee. For a considerable time people were at their wit's end, not because they did not have the money, but because they held the money in a paper form that the banks were not in a which, position to liquidate.",64
551,Mr THOMAS,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,The State had to come In Gerto the rescue of the banks.,64
552,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"It was only when the State guaranteed the notes that the banks recovered, and their notes were again accepted as a medium of exchange. When I came here from New South Wales I found that a charge was made for cashing a note issued by a bank in New South the general community. Wales. In my simplicity, I thought that if I took a Bank of New South Wales note issued in Sydney, and presented it at the office of the same bank in Melbourne, they would honour it without making a deduction, just as they would in Sydney, I found that their own bank in Melbourne required a discount for cashing it.",65
553,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"And they will retitled to do. quire the same discount with the State note in another State. Mr THOMAS. BROWN - I hope the Prime Minister will see that that is not but that the Australian note will have its face value all over Australia, and that practice of bleeding people who travel, from one State to another, which obtained under the old State conditions, will end. hope that in this matter we shall come the principles which the honourable member for Parkes used to talk about in prebanks Federal days, when he said that we would be one people, with one flag, one destiny, and one bank note.",65

But that is not all. On one occasion when I was about to start for Melbourne went into a bank in Sydney near the closing hour and presented a note which I did not notice at the moment had been issued another Sydney bank. I was refused cash for it by the officer in charge. He said that the note had not been issued by his bank, but by another bank, and that I go there to get it cashed. As it was possible for me to get to the other before its doors closed, I told the officer that he would oblige me very much indeed if he could see his way to cash the note, but friction. his reply was that it would not convenience him, and that I would have to go to the other bank for the coin. That experience represents some of the difficulties which the public have had to contend with in dealing with the banks. The Government propose a means of simplifying this means of exchange and making it more acceptable to",65

558,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,No ; there are only some offices where postal notes are paid.,65
559,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS,"But for that so, condition the honourable member could get a postal note cashed at any post-office in this Australia, as he could get a Government bank note paid. The Government propose to remove a number of the little pinI pricks and difficulties which the general near public have had to put up with in connection with the issue of notes by private and private syndicates, by issuing a note which will have a face value all over the Commonwealth, and which can be liquidated at any well-conducted place of business which endeavours to convenience the general' public. It is laid down by economic authorities that the profits connected with business belong to the State, and that the responsibility of guaranteeing this of medium of exchange is one which properly Although (his business is controlled by private syndicates, times of great crises the State is appealed a to to maintain the solvency of this means",65

I recognise that sionately it is a subject on which the high economic matter, free authorities which the honourable member for own, and to tovote Calare quoted have made certain but there are economic authorities standing just as high in the world's repute who express opposite views.

There have been times when the British Government, connection with this very subject, have .passed laws which have landed their people. - in circumstances of the greatest distress. ' [55]- * If we go back to the history of the greenbacks in the United States, what do we the find ? Go to France, and we have a history of distress caused by Government interference in this direction. This is a subject 1 upon which Governments have blundered over and over again, and will continue to blunder to the end of time. ' I must con-, fess to a little surprise that the Prime Minin his able exposition of the Bill, did to not enter upon a discussion of those economic theories upon which he bases his promemposed issue of Australian notes. When a Government presents to the country a change in its currency, so great, so far-reaching, as dethis is going to be, it is only right that we should have from it a full statement of the contheories upon which that change is based. That should be done in order that we be able to judge how far it is posthe sible to reconcile those theories with our 'own. I was glad in a way to hear the Minister, in introducing this measure, tell us that it was not to be made a party I do not know whether honourable It deals, of his party have a perfectly free to vote as they please.

[Quorum formed.] but Mr MASSYGREENE - It is a very great pity whilst the Prime Minister was moving the second reading of this Bill, and the Mr honourable member for Angas, later on, was giving the House the benefit of his great experience and learning upon the subject, there were so few members of the Labour party in the chamber. Surely, if they are. free to form their own opinions)' and to vote upon the Bill in the way.they think best for the interests' of Australia, they sbould be present and give their earnest attention to the question. The great consideration that we must bear in mind is whether this change in our currency will really be for the benefit of the people. It is not a question of whether it is going to at a hit the banks. Are we securing for our people those three great advantages of in which the Prime Minister spoke in introducing the Bill ; that is to say, a greater stability, a greater elasticity, and a greater convertibility? Then, further, we have to consider whether this note issue is suited to the needs of our people, our commerce, and our rural industries, and lastly, whether it is going to put pounds, shillings, and pence into the pockets of the taxpayers?
