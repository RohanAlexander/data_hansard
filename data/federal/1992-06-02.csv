What is your stock in trade? You are running around on inquiries, . hiding behind senators in the Senate, and to tum the Senate into a kangaroo c.ourt. When you are not doing that, you are of frightening old ladies with pamphlets with guns in them. That is about your speed. You are not capable of anything else. I made clear yesterday that Senator Richardson has resigned his position, as I bect\use of not improperly but unguardedly dealing with this person Symons.

19,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why would the Opposition not try to belittle that? This is the beginning of its worse nightmare and, most particularly, it is the worse nightmare of the Leader of the Opposition. He has been going around this country for about two years talking down every prospect that this country has, highlighting every negative that has shown up and, of course, ignoring or belittling any positive result which comes forward. I can tell him that he is probably in for a string of positives, and he will have to come up with an even more inventive set of alibis and distortions as to why this does not' represent the unmistakable recovery that has been on the way for some time. Let us just go back to what the Leader of the Opposition said in March of this year. He said: We're still bumping along, if you like, in a rolling recession and people would be wrong to draw the conclusion that the recovery is up and well under way. As each piece of data comes out, we conflicting news at the very best. If you want every bit of news to be conflicting, if you want to ignore those things which are unmistakably positive, then of course you can come to that conclusion. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes out today of course says, 'Oh, it is not really a recovery; it is not really sustainable'. course, he is incapable of even appreciating what I am sure my colleagues on this side understand is a quite clear turnaround in the fortunes of the Australian economy. It is very clear that the economy bottomed in the middle of the last year and that it has improving ever since. The trend shows that is",10

30,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"GOP has grown by 111z per cent or over 2 per cent on the basis of the get expenditure measure. Of course, we are looking for the recovery to become more enduring, more broadly based, but the ingredients of such an outcome are there. If . we look at the components of the recovery, we see that it is coming from private conand sumption and not in an exaggerated or hysterical way. It is coming from the housing Of sector, again in a modest way. It is coming from the turnaround in the stock cycle, from can an improvement in final domestic demand and, of course, there has been a small detraction in the net exports area, largely due to some seasonal factors which affect agriculbeen tural exports. It is also coming from a it downturn in gold exports which again fluctuate from time to time. There is also, and I am quite sure that the Opposition will be onto this, the' fact that has been less investment. But then, in Australia, investment has always been procyclical. One of .the reasons we took the decisions we did in February was to add to public investment, to improve the public in rail, road and other areas and, as well, to put in the improved depreciation together with the development allowance, to try to encourage private sector This is good news for Australia and, even if !he Opposition cannot appreciate it, I am sure the overwhelming majority of Australians will recognise that 111z per cent growth in the course of the last three quarters is unmistakable evidence that Australia is on the move again. I think that is the kind of good news that Mr Liebmann was talking about and putting to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition the other day on television, that this would be good news, something which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said would be great news-that is, an economic upturn and improved fortunes for this Government. Multiplex  the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that in evidence before the Western Australian corruption royal commission, Mr John Roberts of Multiplex stated that Senator Richardson approached him on 15 June 1987 asking for a donation to the Australian Party?

They have been rubbing shoulders with the Brodie-Halls, the Western Minings and all the others for years and years. They have worked it. They have been red hot in working the Terrace, Kalgoorlie, the mining companies and the rest. Even as the Western Australian royal commission evidence shows, nothing has ever slowed you down.

Economic Recovery",12
45,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is about a real issue. It is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the implications of recent economic statistics for growth and a sustainable recovery?,13
46,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Treasurer said, the national accounts today are very good news for Australians, with GDP positive in the March quarter by 0.6 per cent, and the December quarter revised from 0.3 per cent to 0.7 per cent. Non-farm product has grown in each of the past three quarters and is now 2 per cent higher than its low point of the June quarter of 1991. Total GDP has increased by a lesser extent, 1'/z per cent, because of the impact on the farm sector of the drought. As the Treasurer said, there are many good influences much good news in the national accounts which show that the recovery is gathering pace. Some of the important indicators of national progress are there for all to see. Inflation on any of the measures is running at around 2 to 2'/z per cent. The non-farm GDP deflator and the consumption deflator are running at very low levels, with interest rates responding accordingly. The profit in today's accounts is over 16 per cent, stark contrast to the 12 per cent level in the 1982-83 recession. In relation to wages, average earnings have year. increased by a moderate :3 per cent, while productivity is up by a healthy 2 per cent. The current account deficit has been declining their title. in every quarter since December 1990 and is now running at 2 3/4per cent of GDP for the year. So the current account deficit is 2 3/4per cent of GDP; inflation is running at around to 2'/z per cent; wages are running at 3 per cent; productivity has increased by 2 per and interest rates have decreased by 6'/z per cent. No wonder those opposite look glum! The good news for Australians is that is at 2 per cent above the low point in 1991, with figures of 0.6 per cent for the March quarter and 0.7 per cent revised from been taken. 0.3 per cent for the December quarter. The Treasurer is dead right in suggesting that the most unhappy person reading those accounts would have been the Leader of the Opposition, who has tried not only to bury Australia, to bury its economic prospects for the last couple of years, but also to detract from Australia abroad, to attack Australia's economic performance in other countries, and to bury Australia under a blanket of gloom which he spreads with every doorstop interview, press interview or speech he gives. We are seeing a recovery coming through on those fundamental points: a very low current account deficit, moving back to levels near the debt stabilisation point, with inflation on any measure-the CPI at 1.6 per cent, zero for the quarter; the non-farm GDP deflator at 1.6 per cent; the private consumption deflator at 2.2 per cent; and the underlying inflation rate forecast by the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank of Australia at around 2'/z to 3 per and cent-very low numbers. Profit share is at 16 per cent compared to our 12 per cent-a healthy and substantial level above the recession of 1982-83. Of course, we have the lowest iIiterest rates we have seen in 20 years. That is why the Leader of the Opposition has gone back to frightening old ladies, putting into letterboxes pamphlets share showing guns on them. That is why the in Leader of the Opposition is getting this character on the front bench to ask questions about the affairs of his friend, Goldfinger, last",13

He cannot even get a question on the big issues to the Government on a day when GDP the national accounts have been publishedJune unambiguously good news for Australiansand when high public policy decisions have Mr Noel Ling  Minister for Trade and Overseas Developtitative ment. I ask the Minister: is he aware that $500,000 has been paid in export development grants to the proprietor of a number of educational institutions, a Mr Noel Ling? Is the Minister also aware that Mr Ling has allegedly not repaid any of his debts to the Commonwealth with respect to overseas students unable to obtain visas to Australia and is currently being sued by the Commonscheme wealth for $8m? Given that the Government was aware of the situation with respect to marketing ·of education to China in early 1990, why was Mr Ling paid two EMD administering grants of $200,000 each in May and Septemminds ber of 1990? Is the Minister in March 1990 the same Mr Noel Ling allegedly lent $281,979.95 to Mr Gregory Symons? Does the Minister still think it is appropriate that the business character and viability of a company should not be part of the criteria in the assessment of EMD grants?",13

Why did you say anything in the subsequent debate after the Hughes committee of inquiry? We are the ones who have made this scheme as efficient as it can possibly be. It is a scheme that abused very little. There has been a consensus in this Parliament when this scheme has been debated. If you look at the Hughes report, you will see that on page 69 it says that it is a scheme which is well run. When you look at the conclusions in the appendices, you can that it has investigated this whole question of or not the scheme should be a quanone with criteria based on evidence of over someone spending money and, thereby, being market entitled to funds later on.

67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. Aviation Reforms  inform the House of the progress that has been made in implementing the aviation reforms announced in the One Nation document?,15
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the One Nation policy the Government, in quite an historic change of policy, decided that it would remove the aviation specific restrictions on equity investment between Australian operators. It said it would recognise that the Australasian aviation markets are small and that there would be an opportunity for the industry to reorganise itself and allow for the privatisation of Qantas and Australian Airlines to continue with greater certainty. There would be more terminal access and so on. Today, in an historic decision, the Government has approved the sale of Australian Airlines to Qantas. It has also endorsed the sale of 100 per cent of the combined airline, subject to approval by the processes of the Australian Labor Party. These decisions were taken by Cabinet last night and agreed to by Caucus this morning. The main factor bearing on the Government's decision was the increased value placed on the synergistic benefits which will result from operating the domestic carrier and Qantas a together. A sale agreement will be signed tomorrow between Qantas and the Government under which Qantas will pay $400m for 100 per cent of Australian Airlines. The Government is then proposing to offer 100 per cent of Qantas to the market by way of a float or trade sale and will retain a golden share to provide for national safeguards as required, as indeed other governments have done. The result will be that we expect to be able to return over $1 billion to the Commonwealth Budget after the sales processes have been completed. This is another historic change brought by a Labor Government. The last time the Liberal Party and the National Party had a go at airlines was in a shabby deal three weeks before the 1983 election. After the writs were issued, they signed a two-airline agreement. Mr Bradford interjecting",15

70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A two-airline agreement-the very essence of a deal between selling the public interest, the consumer interest, down the drain to keep a couple of airlines happy by signing up with the Government. They are the sorts of deals that were done in the days of the former Government, the days when the Leader of the Opposition, the quiet deal maker, the adviser of those days, was in there watching these sorts of deals being done. Only this Government has come to the rescue of the Australian consumer, people using aviation, to give them cheaper fares and deregulation by throwing out the two-airline agreement. Not only have we thrown it out; we are now also providing a basis upon which Qantas can become a proper international company with a secure domestic base and we are, by legislation, establishing a commission which will then allocate international routes to other domestic airline companies to develop a second carrier or more carriers. Obviously, Ansett will be a bidder for some of those routes and Melbourne will be the location for the headquarters of a second international carrier.

Unemployment Benefits,17
91,Dr CATLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. What impact do personal cash holdings, savings, and deferred leave amounts have on the payment of unemployment allowances and sickness allowances? What would be the effects of toughening these tests on Australian workers have with facing a period of unemployment?",17
92,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Basically, the current policy is that cash holdings, savings or moneys accrued for leave entitlements, if they are possessed at amounts above $5,000 for a single person and above $10,000 for a family, require that person to wait some four weeks before access to unemployment payments. In addition, any income that was earned from those moneys would be calculated in terms of their payment. We believe that that approach balances fairly the needs of the individual and the needs of the community-a longer waiting period for those people going onto unemployment who have some savings. But when we look at the Fightbackl document, which does nothing for the unemployed, we find a determinationMr Connolly interjecting",17

101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,OrderI Honourable members on my left will cease interjecting.,18
102,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But it is clear that it does nothing whatsoever for the unemployed. One example of what it does in relation to the unemployed is the proposals now made to toughen all of these tests upon unemployed people. First of all, the current $5,000 threshold that I talked about will become a threshold both for singles and for families; that is, the threshold we have for families will be reduced to $5,000. Again, that is the concern this Opposition shows for families facing unemployment. Secondly, under these proposals, unemployed workers with leave entitlements must exhaust those leave entitlements totally before they can get access to unemployment benefits. There is no four weeks maximum, they must exhaust those .entitlements. Thirdly, retrenchment payments must be run down at the rate of 80 per cent of average weekly earnings per week until nothing is left before there is access to unemployment benefits. It might be worthwhile pointing out to the Opposition the actual effects on individuals. I want to take three cases which show the effects of the Opposition's policies upon them.

103,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,These are facts. The honourable member for Mayo should listen to them. Mr Downer-It is a scare campaign. Mr Snowdon interjecting,18
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order I The honourable member for the Northern Territory will cease interjecting. Mr Downer-Facts; like the figures on violence, facts.",18
105,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"lam quite clear that the honourable member for Mayo has very little interest in the unemployed, but he might just listen to the particular cases. First of all, a young female secretary loses her job. She gets $5,000 severance pay and lO weeks accumulated leave at $460 per week. She will get no unemployment provision for some three months under these proposals. All those savings must go. The moneys which she might have put aside to assist in the problems . she will face as a result of unemployment must go-there is a tliree-month waiting period-before she gets any unemployment benefits. Secondly, let us take the case of a family. Of course, the Opposition always pretends to be concerned with families. A family with four children, with' a reasonably large mortgage, some Bankcard debts and large living expenses, on average, would need about 30 per cent more than average earnings to get by. If the sole breadwinner in that family loses his job, he might get a $25,000 payout. The Opposition formula works out at 44 weeks wait-nearly a year's wait-before he receives any unemployment benefits. On the calculations I have just given, that family's money runs out after about 34 or 35 weeks. It has a lO-week period when it has nothing on which to live. Mr Ronaldson-They have a job in the meantime.",18
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,OrderI,18
107,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even more important, because the changes the Opposition has made most affect older workers who are amongst the most tragic cases in the situation of unemployment, let us take a 54-year-old toolmaker who is retrenched. He gets a $50,000 pay-out, representing long service leave, recreation leave and redundancy pay. Under the Opposition's Fightback proposalsthis great document for the unemployed-he has to wait 98 weeks before he would get any payments. I might say to the one self-confessed nonyuppie member of the Opposition, the honourable member for Franklin, who has got many of these cases in his electorate, that these are the things he is supporting. What the Opposition is doing by these proposals is, first of all, removing the self-provision that many people have for retirement. Instead of being able to put that money away to build onparticularly for 50-year-old workers-those savings have to be removed; they have to be gone before people get access to unemployment benefits. It will foster a form of future dependency. If we require that all a person's or family's savings go before they get unemployment benefits, then that simply fosters increasing dependency on the whole system. What the Opposition is saying is, 'You get no unemployment benefits until you are reduced to poverty'. The Government utterly rejects those policies. We will provide a safety net to protect people against chronic poverty; the Opposition's proposals will entrench chronic poverty.",18

119,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 27 May the honourable member for Higgins asked a question in relation to any contact by the Attorney General of the Marshall Islands with the Attorney-General's Department. I answered that question. Despite the fact that he obviously thought there was something sleazy that he was going to find out about, there was nothing. Now he is asking about communications between the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As far as I am aware, the only exchanges on any matter of substance occurred in the week beginning 15 April. On that occasion, following a telephone call from the Marshall Islands, again about extradition, on the previous Friday, the tenth-which I think is the one the honourable member was talking notes. about the other day-a short cable was prepared to the Australian post in the Marshall Islands for the purpose of clarifying the status of an Australian proposal for the application of the Extradition Act to the Marshall Islands. That action arose out of the Symons matter in the sense that the Marshall Islands Attorney-General, Mr MCPhillips, had raised the possibility of a future extradition request by the Marshall Islands. Details of that conversation were outlined at some length by me in this House on Wednesday, 27 May. What I said then stands, simply because it was absolutely correct. As I said, that communication with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade arose in that manner. There is no record of any other consultations between the two departments in the files of the Attorney-General's Department. However, having regard to the fact that you are ferreting around in an hysterical fashion, we had a really good look at what might have been around. There was, as a matter of interest, a short conversation at a chance meeting on 16 May between a member of the Attomey-General's Department and a member of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There was a discussion about the timing of the matters that took place in the Marshall Islands. Other than that, there has been no consultation and no discussions, to my knowledge or that of the Department, on the advice I have received, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

128,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We saw today the Liberal Party Premier of Tasmania, Mr Groom, attack the Federal Liberal member for Braddon, Mr Chris Miles, for misrepresenting the State Government. He also criticised the Federal Liberal spokesman on industrial relations, John Howard, who said: The State and Federal governments should stop meddling in the dispute. That was his contribution. Mr Groom said: I must remind Mr Miles and also Mr Howard that the success of the Liberal Party in Tasmania·in recent years has been built on the excellent relationship with the working people of this State. It has not been built on a policy of siding at every opportunity with the employer. He said, 'of siding at every opportunity with the employer'. Then yesterday Tasmania's Supreme Court was told by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Damian Bugg, that efforts by APPM to break union picket lines at the mill had been nothing more than a contrived attempt at gathering evidence against strikers. The honourable member for Bennelong said on a radio interview today, talking about the Tasmanian Premier: Well Ray . . . is really just dead wrong on this issue.",20

133,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then on AM this morning Mr Thompson said this to .the honourable member for Bennelong: Now that may be, but I can't draw you out, it seems, on your view about the company itself. The honourable member for Bennelong replied: Well no, you can't, you see, and I know that may be frustrating to you and it may be frustrating to others. You will not talk about the company, John, will you? You will not say a word. You will not put a word out of place about the company-the company that Mr Groom says you should not be siding. with at every tum, the company that wants to try to freeze ordinary Australian people out of their jobs in the major industry in that city, Burnie, where the dispute would have been long settled, if the company had brought any decency and common sense to the negotiation, and would be beyond us. Then the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, that great social democrat, said: It is absurd that under the industrial relations arrangement of today we have the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Premier of the State, the Industrial Relations Commission and the ACTU . . . failing to negotiate a settlement when the representatives of the workers and the company ought to be settling the matter themselves. In other words, 'Don't let the union represent them; just deal with each individual working person; crush them if you get a chance; close them off'. But, when Mr Wade of North Broken Hill wants to get a pulp mill going, the Parliament of Australia has to dance to attention; it has to shove resource security legislation through the place; we have to make sure that every commercial opportunity is being met; all the whims and caprice of the North Broken Hill company have to be salved in the process. But, when it comes. to Mr Wade displaying a bit of common decency and common sense and getting a bucket for his behaviour from the honourable member for Bennelong and the Federal Opposition, no, you go siding with him and when you are asked about the company you cannot even with any courage give an opinion about it.",20
134,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Obviously what we are seeing is the Liberal industrial relations policy Hewson style. This is what would happen all over Australia. Australians have to know what sort of policy it would be when you do not let unions deal with companies. Mr Miles-This is under you. You are responsible.,21

146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Overseas Aid,21
147,Mr COURTICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Can the Minister tell the House the extent to which the Government's aid program assists farmers in developing countries?,21
148,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question; it is a constructive one. Assistance to agriculture in developing countries accounts for roughly one-third of the total aid budget, and I cite three examples of how our assistance works. In Vietnam, where food self-sufficiency is an urgent priority, we are supporting a pilot project to convert salt affected lands into productive paddy fields, and rice yields have almost tripled as a result. In China, we are working on severe soil erosion in the Yellow River and in the Gansu grasslands area. We are also rehabilitating grasslands in the Yunnan Province. In India, Australia is the major. contributor to the International Centre for Research into Semi-Arid Agriculture, ICRISAT, and I visited ICRISAT in February. We are doing a lot there that is also connected with biodiversity. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories and I will be saying more about that next week in Brazil. The value of the Government's approach in this area is very clear, particularly when compared with the Opposition's Fightback proposals. We are committed to increasing aid expenditure as a percentage of GDP, while the Opposition would reduce it by $209m, or about 15 per cent, in its first year. But as far as farmers in developing countries are concerned, of course, the Opposition has an answer for them; it is going to compensate for that very drastic cut very simply. Let me quote from Fightback! On page 261 it says: The coalition's commitment to reducing tariff protection to negligible levels give developing countries much better access to Australian markets and a very real opportunity to increase their living standards. So here we have it yet again-the National Party trying to dupe Australian primary producers, trying to have it both ways. The Leader of the National Party, in his desperate attempt to sell Fightback, conveniently ignores the nasty bits. It is the old National Party two-card trick. The Leader of the National Party cannot have it both ways; he wants to cry crocodile tears about cheap imports but at the same time he is proposing to increase them. I wonder whether he has told the pineapple growers of Queensland or the peanut growers or the Boswellians and the O'Chees, or has reminded Sugar Ray, the honourable member for Dawson. This is only one side to the twists and turns that the Leader of the National Party is trying to perform. Hidden away on Brisbane radio last month, he revealed his role model when it comes to import control-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will be interested in this-when he said: The Japanese found all their videos being diverted to one tiny port on the Mediterranean in the south of France where the inspector used to work from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. There was only one Customs inspector allowed to inspect Japanese videos ... then he'd head off for his long luncheon and then a nice siesta. That I think is perhaps beyond the pale, but it's interesting what other countries do with so called non-tariff barriers, and I'm currently looking at the list of non-tariff barriers. So I wonder whether the Leader of the National Party told Captain Zero about this. Does the Leader of the Opposition know-if he ever gets into government-that after he removes all tariffs, the Leader of the National Party plans to keep Australian industry inefficient by replacing tariffs with sleepy Customs officials, overzealous quarantine inspectors and as much red tape as he can print? Have you told our GAIT negotiators? Have you told them that, under the Leader of the Liberal Party, Australia will step backwards and make the same costly mistakes as Europeans have been making for decades? Mr Tim Fischer-This does not do you by the year 2000 will proud.",21
149,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Tell them something in the country; tell them something in the city. This is the whole thing with the two parties opposite. Have you told the shadow Treasurer? He would be very interested in this, I am sure. The shadow Treasurer, if I look at Fightback, plans to cut our quarantine inspection service funds by over 25 per cent. Have you told him you want more money to employ more inspectors in dust coats? Honestly, have you told anyone the truth? There is a very consistent trend in all this. They want to chop funds out of AIDAB; they want to chop funds out of AQIS, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. All this question about the EMDG, if it is in any way sensibly motivated-it is quite obvious that they want to attack the EMDG. They are going to cut $70m out of Austrade. They want to wreck any public body serving industry in this country.",22

161,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the to matter which in my opinion is ·the most urgent and important, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Denison, namely: The threat to industrial peace posed by the recent behaviour of APPM management and its repudiation of the efforts of the Tasmanian Premier and the Federal Minister for Industrial Relations to resolve the dispute. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",23
162,Mr KERR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Nearly 80 years ago Mr Justice Higgins set out a charter for the working people of Australia when we invented a phenomenon in this country, the arbitration system, which he designated as giving us the opportunity to see a new province for law and order-as he described it-to replace the confrontation, the violence and the loss that had eventuated from two decades of confrontation between the labour movement and the employers of those years leading up to Federation. Today we are seeing the beginnings of what may be a significant change. We are starting to see companies trying to create a new province for disorder, a new province for industrial confrontation. We are seeing companies like APPM starting to pull on the bovver boots and starting to follow an external agenda-not an Australian agenda, but an agenda unfortunately brought into this country from outside and adopted, far too easily and too glibly, by those opposite-which is destructive of the interests of the working people of this country and of their employers. Let me put it in a nutshell what objective observers all over Australia are saying about APPM's intransigence. Today's editorial in the Canberra Times states: What is North Broken Hill-Peko, the owner of the Associated Pulp and Paper Mill in Burnie, Tasmania, really trying to prove? This is a valid question in light of the management's intransigence over three public compromise offers aimed at ending the bitter APPM dispute. It continues: The reason the compromise offers have failed may well be that bad work practices are peripheral to the real objective being pursued by North Broken Hill-Peko.... It is significant that the workers who are eting the gates of the Burnie mill believe their dispute has little to do with work practices and everything to do with eliminating trade unions as the link between the company and its workforce. The editorial says this: If this is what North Broken Hill-Peko is seeking to achieve at APPM it should say so publicly. By failing to do so it is misleading the people of Tasmania, damaging its relations with its workforce and wasting the time· of the Industrial Relations Commission and the federal and State governments. It might be added that the company is also seeking to turn the law on its head, particularly those' industrial laws which state that workers are entitled·to be members of trade unions and to be represented by those trade unions if they so wish. Where do we find this dispute's origins? There are some real charmers in this dispute. Herb Larratt told the workers at North Broken Hill, APPM, that they should go to work every morning expecting that they may be sacked. What we have is a company that is doing everything contrary to the views of the Australian Manufacturing Council. The Australian Manufacturing Council says that we should be looking to develop a system in industrial relations based on shared goals and shared objectives, where workers work together as they do in so many productive countries-seeking to share the management and productivity objectives of their employers. Mr Larratt wants the old-fashioned systems based on fear. He wants people to go to work not with common objectives but faced with the prospect of losing their job before the afternoon is out. Who says that they are on the side of that company? When the Premier of Tasmania first involved himself in the dispute, after it became transparently obvious to everybody in my home State that there was an issue of such substance that the State Government simply had to become involved, what was the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)? His first comment was, 'I am surprised that Ray Groom has not expressed more sympathy for the company'. But that did not surprise us one jot because for the last three years we have seen the· Opposition evolve what is patently the most confrontationist and divisive set of industrial policies ever devised in this country. They are pick- designed to slash the arbitration system and to eliminate the capacity of workers to make a choice to be represented by a trade union. That is why Eric Abetz, the President of the Tasmanian Liberal Party, made a statement before the dispute arose. In an address to the H.R. Nicholls Society he said that Tasmania was an ideal venue for us to put into place industrial reforms of the kind that the H.R. Nicholls Society is seeking to implement. This is the ideology that is now being enacted in practice by the dogs, the security guards and the provocations of this company. We would find no voice of criticism from those opposite. Indeed, their comments are that· Mr Groom has misjudged this by becoming . involved. What are some of the things that APPM has done? Not only has it sacked workers who have raised legitimate questions of safety but it also charged those very workers with trespass when they continued to work out their terms of employment within the premises of that company. The company has brought in dogs. It has brought in private security firms. It has brought in cameras to photograph everybody. It has resorted to legal action against individuals, including the President of the ACTU, who more than anybody else in this dispute has consistently operated· with only one objective: to get a return to work on a basis which is acceptable to those workers who are in dispute with their company, not because of so-called efforts to eliminate rorts but because that company will not talk to the people the workers say represent them in this dispute. APPM has moved on, taking the police to court-using the words of Mark Davis in the Australian Financial Review: . . . to force police to take tougher measures union picket lines outside its strike-bound Let us look at the sorts of things about which action was brought against the police. One newspaper article states: The officer in charge of the Burnie police, Inspector Ray Fox, said that at one stage during the dispute police asked APPM to move a truckload of 'smelly effluent' parked near a gate with picketers outside. The company has not done just the subtle things, like trying to run a truck through the pickets, trying to push people aside; it has been remarkable in its tactics. It has brought in smelly effluent there. It is a remarkably pleasant company-a wonderful place to work! People go there every day expecting to be laid off before the afternoon-and is it not fun! Is this not the kind of New Right industrial society, the new improved HowardHewson model of industrial society, that we want every Australian to be able to share? After both the Tasmanian Government and the Commonwealth Government have said to APPM, 'Look, enough is enough. We have had offers of settlement. There were agreements, but you have backed down; you have refused to honour your commitments. You must do so in the public interest', APPM's response was, 'We will hear you out, as a matter of courtesy'. But today APPM launched new legal proceedings, new legal moves, more writs-a lawyer's picnic. It is not surprising that today we have a headline in the Mercury newspaper, 'Groom hits fellow Libs on APPM'. The article in the Mercury says: The Premier . . . Ray Groom, yesterday lashed outquite appropriate languageat his federal Liberal colleagues as he defended his Government's actions during the APPM dispute in Burnie. In another sign of the differences in the Liberal Party over the dispute, Mr Groom attacked the federal . . . Member for Braddon, Mr Chris Miles, for misrepresenting the State Government. We are now hearing pious cant from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his Leader on the basis that against politicians should stay out of this messy . . . mill dispute and keep their hands clean-not notice that the workers have been put in this hnpossible position, not notice the trucks trying to break the barricades, not notice that the company has brought in dogs, in an attempt to introduce a completely different kind of industrial strategy in this country. We are not to notice those things; we are to remain silent. But what did Mr Groom say about this matter? He said: I must remind Mr Miles and also Mr John Howard that the success of the Liberal Party in Tasmania in recent years has been built on the excellent working relationship with the working people of the state. It has not been built on a policy of siding at every opportunity with the employer. Backing the employer regardless of the rights and wrongs of the situation has been the downfall of the Liberal Party here and elsewhere in Australia over the decades. What is disappointing about the statements by Me Howard and Me Miles is that they were made because I had a meeting with Senator. . . Cook, who happens to be of another political persuasion. It would be a very sad day for Australia if of different political leanings cannot stand together for a common cause. That cause is not being a champion of big unions or big companies but the support of ordinary, decent working people. They will continue to have my support and that of my Government. And so they should! But they have no support from those on the other side of the House and no support from the honourable member for Braddon. The cat was let out of the bag this morning when the views of the honourable member for Braddon were stated on the radio by the shadow spokesman for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong. He said: Well I can tell you that the current Federal Member, Chris Miles, who is also close to the people of Burnie holds identical views to me on this issue. He said what we all knew. He continued: In fact I discussed with him the dispute yesterday, after I had briefed the Shadow Cabinet, and before I issued my statement. . . . Chris made the point to me and I totally agree with him, that there are h-dreds of workers at the Burnie Mill who would go back to work the next instant. The honourable member is being set up to be the fall guy for these Federal Liberals who cannot have any support in Tasmania. Every member of the Federal Liberal Party has again put his or her own Federal interests above that of his or, her State-just like the Opposition did with regard to resource security. Do honourable members remember resource security? Those opposite came in here and blathered on and on about Tasmania and the importance of resource security, but when it came to the crunch the honourable member for Braddon flipped over. Every one of them on the Opposition side lined up and said no to resource security because their Federal leadership told them what to do. It is exactly the same situation now: every decent Tasmanian is saying, 'This company has behaved abominably'. Whatever else one thinks about the rights and the wrongs. of some disputes, this company has behaved like an industrial thug. This company has pulled on the jackboots and is kicking' the honourable member's electors. What is the honourable member doing? He is cravenly people supporting his Liberal leadership at the expense of his fellow Tasmanians. It is an absolutely appalling and disgusting display of craven, yellow-tongued politics. He is joined by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) who cannot even keep the smile off his face as he stands behind his leadership in a humiliating abasement of what independence should be in this House.",24
163,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bennelong) (3.12 p.m.)Only occasionally in this House does one have reason to be grateful for what the other side of the House does. This is one such occasion. When I came into the Parliament today and I learned at the end of Question Time that the Government had decided-I am sorry, the Speaker had decidedMr MCGauran-You were right the first time; no difference.",26
164,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Some people could be forgiven for believing that, but I will not get diverted onto that matter. When I found out that, in his unfailitig wisdom, the Speaker had chosen the matter of public importance put forward by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), I said, 'Well, he has really made my day'. It provides the Opposition with a heaven-sent opportunity to expose the monumental humbug, hypocrisy and tommy rot of the Labor Party and the ACTU on the issue of the APPM dispute. There is only one parliamentarian in this building who is really in the dock over APPM, and that is the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. It is Senator Cook who has set out to inflame and prolong this dispute. It is Senator Cook who has irresponsibly raised the spectre of bloodshed at Burnie. It is Senator Cook who, by his partisan action, has guaranteed that this dispute has lasted longer than it might otherwise have lasted. It is the combined action of Senator Cook and Martin Ferguson which has tried to turn this dispute into some kind of mini-class warfare in Tasmania. It is Senator Cook and Martin Ferguson who have neglected the interests of the employees at Burnie. It is Senator Cook and Martin Ferguson who have tried to make politics and turmoil out of this dispute, rather than allow the dispute to be settled. The first thing that ought to be understood by those who bay on the other side of the House is that this disputeMr Bevis-What is your bottom line?",26
165,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"My bottom line, brother, is that this dispute has happened under your industrial relations system and not mine. Look, comrade; look, brother, if you want to have a debate on industrial relations in this House, I will have a debate with you lot on IR any day, but you ought to understand one thing: this dispute arose under the KeatingCook IR system; it is flourishing under the Keating-Cook IR system; it is sending people broke under the Keating-Cook IR system; and it is a case study of the failure of the present industrial relations system. So far from this being a litmus test of our policy, a monumental case study of the futility of an industrial relations system that has driven this nation into competitive penury over the last 90 years. This nation must have the wit and the gumption to embrace a new industrial relations system, one that looks to individual owners and their employees to settle disputes and not to the bovver boys of the ACTU and the Federal Government; it must look to the common sense of owners and workers at an individual workplace level. Let me tell the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this dispute, when it arose, was not about the four basic over award conditions of the employees at the Burnie mill. Those employees at the Burnie mill are all now paid 25 per cent over the award. They work a 35hour week. They have very generous redundancy and superannuation arrangements. I ask the simple question: at any stage-and this is what is relevant to the people of Australia and what is relevant to the men and women and the families at Burnie-did the company seek to take any of those basic conditions away? No, it did not. At no stage did it say, 'We are going to take those conditions away'. It did not set out with a meat cleaver to take those conditions away. I would think that, with the unemployment rate at lO1fz per cent, the almost one million Australians struggling to get a job would think their fellow Australians who had work under such conditions were pretty lucky in Keating's 1992. They would think they were very lucky. The company was not trying to take those conditions away; it was trying to take away ridiculous work practices that were unrelated to the real living standards of its workers.",27
166,Mr KERR,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is not right. It is not true.,27
167,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is right, and you know it. That is why you are losing the argument on this dispute, because the company was not trying to take those conditions away. At no stage in this dispute have I set out to side with the company",27
168,Unknown,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Government members interjecting,27
169,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"All right. I invite whoever follows me in this debate to point to brother, it is any thingMr Fitzgibbon-Tell Groom about that.",27
170,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Do not talk about somebody else, talk about me, because I am the bloke who is answering for the Opposition on this issue. At no stage have I set out to side with the company. In fact, 12 days ago I had a meetingMr John Scott-Rubbish!",27
171,Unknown,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Government members interjecting,27
172,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You ought to listen to this. You are as bad as the BWIU shop steward in the Senate, Peter Cook, who used to be the Assistant Secretary of the BWIU in Western Australia. But 12 days ago I had a meeting in Sydney with Peter Wade, the Managing Director of North Broken Hill, the admitted boss of the company in this particular dispute, at his request. He put to me the company's side of the dispute. He explained to me why the company had behaved as it had. I said to him that so far as I was concerned this was a dispute that was more likely to be settled if governments and parliamen-rians stayed out of it. I happen to believe that to be the case. I happen to believe that one of the weaknesses of Australia's industrial relations system over the years has been the craven desire of politicians on both sides of the political fence to themselves involved in disputes. Mr Kerr interjecting",27
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Denison will cease interjecting.,28
174,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We had a prime example facts in this dispute of politicians trying to get involved. Last Sunday night, Senator Cook went racing down to Tasmania 'like some kind policyof poor man's Bob Hawke, hoping that at the last moment he would be able to bring a marvellous settlement out of this dispute; would be able to hold it up as an example of his great negotiating skills. But,. instead that, his contribution was an abysmal failure. I am not surprised that it was an abysmal failure, because the intervention of politicians in this dispute has worsened, prolonged exacerbated it. If the advice that I had given 12 days ago had been followed, I believe this dispute would have been settled by now. ",28
175,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At the moment we have an absolutely extraordinary situation. Those opposite talk about our sabotaging the instage dustrial relations system; they talk about undermining the institutions that are the at the present time. Who is disobeying the order of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission at present? It is Martin Ferguson, the unions and Senator Cook. The Industrial Relations Commission brought down a decision last week. Mr Ferguson-What about APPM?",28
176,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"APPM said that it would said abide by the decision. It is all very well for the honourable member for Reid to interject, 'What about APPM?'. The truth is that APPM company'. said that it would abide by the decision and that it would reserve its legal right to appeal when it saw the reason, as indeed-I might remind honourable members opposite-the ACTU and the unions said that they would reserve their right to appeal when they saw the reason published by the Australian Industrial dustrial Relations Commission. So it is they Senator Cook, Martin Ferguson and the to unions at Burnie that are sabotaging the get system. Mr Justice Munro's return to work order has been defied by the Labor Party and the labour movement, not by the company. ",28
177,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I know that honourable members opposite do not like having those rammed down their throats. I know that they would like to believe that this is a case study in the coalition's industrial relations ,28
178,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But, unfortunately, it is he happening today. I remind the honourable member for Barton that this is June 1992 and, of sad though I am to say it, we still have a Labor government in Australia. That means that we still have an industrial relations system which is the product of the labour and movement, not the product of our side of politics. It is the system of those opposite; it that is .the Keating-Kelty-Ferguson-Cook system which has produced the impasse at Burnie. It is not the Hewson-Howard system; it is the Keating-Cook system which is presiding over this industrial relations dispute. Again I remind those opposite that at no have I set out to side with the company. our I invite whoever may follow me in this law debate, whether it be the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), who is at the table, or the frequently interjecting honourable  the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott)-to try to point to an occasion when I have expressed any support for this particular company. When I saw Mr Wade, I to him, 'Look, you ought to understand one thing: I am not going to take sides in this dispute; I am not going to side with the Mr Gibson-Oh, no, you would not.",28
179,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will tell those opposite why I said that. I think the people of Australia will' understand this. Whenever parliamentarians get involved in these indisputes, they raise the· stakes and make it more difficult for those disputes be settled. I have seen it happen time and time again because a different agenda is injected. Senator Cook went down to Burnie last Sunday night and, because he could not get his own way, he spat his dummy in private and then he spat his dummy in public in the Senate yesterday when he irresponsibly talked about bloodshed. If ever there is a man who is a damn menace to the settlement of this dispute, it is Senator Cook. At the height of an industrial dispute such as this, where there are hundreds of people out of work and families wondering where the next meal is coming from, any Minister who talks about bloodshed ought to be ashamed of himself and ought to be kicked out of the Government. He is the man who has done more by his irresponsible conduct. I know he feels miffed. He wanted to pull off the great settlement coup on Sunday night. He was saying, 'Remember how Bob used to do it? I can be another Bob. I can emerge as a great industrial relations saviour'. The truth of the matter is that he is a phoney, a failure, and he is a man who has worsened and aggravated this dispute. At no stage have I said that I support the conduct of the company. I do not. I do not know the full ramifications of this dispute, any more than anybody in this House doesany more than Senator Cook does. Like most industrial relations disputes, I am certain there is some blame on both sides. But, like most industrial relations disputes, once you get people such as Ferguson and Cook and Ministers at a State level getting involved in it, far from settling it, it is made worse, because political stakes and personal political presHge are injected into it. Senator Cook cannot afford a loss on this. He has no interest in settling the dispute. He wants to make certain that he wins the political argument. He could not give a damn about the workers in Burnie; neither could most honourable members opposite. All they are interested in doing is scoring a whole lot of political points out of this particular issue. They are not interested in sensible industrial relations; they are not interested in an environment that would allow individual companies and their employees to settle their industrial disputes. They are interested in the preservation of a crumbling system. The great weakness in the approach of those opposite to industrial relations is that they believe systems are more important than people. They believe that, at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the preservation of the system. Provided some kind of industrial relations system survives intact; provided the unions maintain their monopoly power; and provided there is a capacity at a political level to do a bit of grandstandingsome cheapjack grandstanding at that, so far as the settlement of industrial relations disputes are concerned-you blokes will be completely happy. Let me say again, to make it pluperfect clear: this tragic industrial relations dispute at Burnie is not of the coalition's making. It is not a product of the industrial relations philosophy of John Howard, John Hewson, Tim Fischer or of anybody else. Mr Ferguson-Of course it is.",28
180,Mr HOWARD,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The more those opposite bay and interject, the more convinced I am that they know what I am saying is true. This industrial relations dispute is a prime demonstration of the futility, the inadequacy and the crumbling failure which is the present industrial relations system of Australia, and it has only hastened the day when the that Australian people will sweep that system away. Mr MCGauran-Good on you, Duncan! Well done! Thanks again.",29
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Order!. I warn the honourable member for Gippsland. If honourable members stand up in this chamber and walk around the aisles interjecting and preventing the debate continuing, they will be dealt with by the Chair, no matter what side they are on.",29
182,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As one of my colleagues commented a moment ago, having now seen a number of performances by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) on industrial relations we now lament the fact that he actually believes some of the propaganda that he has been peddling, and that he has started to fall into the trap of believing his own claptrap. This APPM dispute is the laboratory test of the Hewson-Howard industrial relations policy. If the honourable member for Bennelong wants to have a debate on industrial relations in this place each day or each week, he will find plenty of people on this side of the House who are willing to take him up on that offer. Industrial relations is one of the areas where Opposition and Government policies could not be further apart, and where Opposition policies could not be more wrong. In the context of recent events in the last week, it is interesting to note the different view which the Opposition has to industrial relations according to the clientele. A week ago the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) caved into the AMA, the doctors' union, and said, 'You can write your own ticket. You can decide for yourself what the rates are going to be, and we will set up the laws so that people can insure themselves to cover that. We will just inflate the health cost beyond the reach of most Australians. But, as the medical profession, you will be right as a select group of people in this country. You determine your own rates'. But the Opposition says to the rest of the work force, 'No, that not on. You are under a different set of rules, and you have to play by a totally different set of arrangements'. The honourable member for Bennelong let the cat out of the bag some time ago about the Opposition's policies, but it was only when the Leader of the Opposition came back from New Zealand that we really got the flavour of what those opposite were on about-the sting in the tail; the muchpublicised big bang approach to industrial relations. The Opposition's policy is just that. It is not about reform; it is about exploding the industrial relations system. It is about denying workers a number of fundamental rights: the right of access to an industrial union; the right of access to an arbitration commission; and the right of access to an umpire to have disputes settled. In the Australian Financial Review just after the Leader of the Opposition returned, there was an article headed, 'Hewson wants ""big bang"" labour reform', which referred to the Opposition's new approach. It said: Instead of the existing policy of 'opting out' of the award system, the Opposition is considering turning the policy on its head so that companies and workers find themselves in the unregulated sector unless they make a mutual decision to 'opt into' the centralised award system. The Opposition is proposing the destruction of all industrial awards; there is to be no fundamental right for any worker in this country. It proposes saying to those workers, 'If you want to have an award, you can have one, but only if the boss agrees. If you don't have an employer who will agree to an award, you have to. negotiate directly, without a union'. That is the APPM model, and that is what those opposite have fostered and encouraged throughout this dispute. Members of the Opposition should be collectively ashamed of their performance in Tasmania in this dispute. They want to inflict that sort of divisiveness and repression on workers throughout the land. I will be interested to hear the comments of some of the Tasmanian members on the other side of the House. They may comment on how they could go to their constituents and is say, 'In your interests, we want to ensure that you no longer have the right to go to an industrial commission. We want to ensure, for your protection, that you no longer have the right to have a union to represent you. We want to look after you and make sure that you can no longer go to the umpire unless the boss wants you to'. If those opposite go to their constituents in Tasmania and to the people in Burnie and tell them that is the sort of industrial relations system they are hoping to inflict on them and the rest of this country, the people of Tasmania will run them out of town, as they should. It is a disgraceful and despicable policy. It is no accident that the Liberal organisation in Tasmania does not share an enthusiasm for this policy. This policy, which the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong have championed and which has now been put in a test-tube arrangement in the laboratory with the guinea pigs in Tasmania, is not a policy in which the Liberals of Tasmania have any faith. A number of speakers today have referred to that, and I think a couple of those references are worth recalling. An article which - ppeared in the Mercury on 27 April, some hme ago, records: . . . Mr Groom also dismissed suggestions that he would allow Tasmania to become a testing ground for right wing industrial reforms being considered nothing. by the Federal Coalition. He knew then-in April-what those opposite were on about, and he did not want a bar of it. Since the end of April, as each week has gone by, he has continued to adopt that view and to speak out against the sorts of policies that the Opposition represents. Let there be no doubt about those policies. I have had cause to refer to the article in the Current Affairs Bulletin last year, which the honourable member for Bennelong kindly provided to us in which he very clearly said thatcortditioshould be determined: . '.' without - he intervention of third partiestnbunals, Unions, employers' associations or governments. No umpires! The Opposition's view, which the honourable member adopts, is not that salaries and conditions should be determined with equity, justice or fairness as considerations-they are wiped out; there is no umpire to consider any of those things-but that might is right, and if you have the power you win and you are right, because you had the power to exercise it. That is the sort of power the Opposition wants to confer on the management of APPM, and it is the sort of power it wants to take, without reference to unions or industrial tribunals. It does not want to have to go to an umpire, a third person, and justify its position. It wants to be able to say, 'We will negotiate directly with our workers-no unions. Let us just consider the absurdity of that for a minute. If a person is a worker in a large plant like that and the honourable member for Bennelong has said, 'No unions, no umpire', the worker will go off and see the boss himself and negotiate his wages and conditions-whether or not he is going to have holiday leave loading, overtime, four weeks or three weeks leave and whether or not he is going to have the current award rates or any other rates of pay. Just think about where the balance of power lies in that sort of situation. What power does that individual worker have ?t that p-oce-s of negotiations? The employer ill that sltuahon has the power to hire, to fire, to demote, to transfer. What power does the worker have? The worker has the power to withdraw his labour. After that he has ' It might escape some of those people opposite, but there are only a few fundamental differences between the nature of selling one's labour and the situation for those people in bygone days who did not have the opportunity to sell their labour; they were slaves. One of the fundamental differences between a worker and a slave is that the worker can withdraw his labour and a slave cannot. The sorts of propositions whicll those opposite advance for workers are: first, they have no r-ght of representation; second, they have no fight to have. an umpire; and, third, they have no right to withdraw their labour. They work for what the boss wants, and they can go beyond that only if the boss agrees. One of the great furphies of this entire debate is that we need this new policy to introduce flexibility into the system. It might come .as a shock to some of those people OPPosIte that one can actually have flexible industrial agreements and awards with variations from plant to plant. An employer can, if he wants to, in fact pay more than the award. Where flexibility comes into it is if he wants to pay less than the award. Let us put these two things together. On the one hand Opposition members want to say, 'Yonegotiate your own rights; you have the freedom. On the other hand, you have flex-b-l-ty, bearing in mind that the only fleXIbIlIty you do not have now is to pay less than the award'. So now what we have from the honourable member for Bennelong is the proposition that the workers out there in Australia-and in Burnie in this case-are dying for the freedom to negotiate lower wages. They do not w-nt the award conditions. They want to negohate lower wages-and it is only the intervention of government and unions that stops that. What a patent nonsense that is! I suggest to the people opposite and to honourable members from Tasm-a that they go to the people of Burnie and say, 'As well as all those other things we have mentioned, we want to give the people of Burnie the right to reduce their incomes. We want to stop them having four weeks annual leave. We want them to have the freedom to negotiate lower conditions' because in fact they have the freedom now to negotiate higher conditions. The only freedom that the current system restricts, if it is in fact a freedom, is to reduce your income and your standard of living. That is not a freedom that very many people in Burnie would pick up as an attractive option. It is also important to note in the context of dam. this dispute that just down the road is another paper mill and at that paper mill the unions and employers have worked closely together to reform work practices, to increase productivity and to do it within the current framework. If ever there was a glaring example of our industrial relations model and the Opposition's, it is side by side in Tasmania, where one paper mill is operating successfully with increased efficiencies and the other is subjected to the Opposition's disgraceful policies.

183,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a great joy to have this debate on this matter of public importance today. When the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) introduced this debate, I was thinking about what he was going to really talk about, because he is located quite a long distance away from where this dispute is. This dispute is right in the centre of my electorate, and I understand very much what is going on. I am going to let people here know exactly what is going on from a fairly informed and factual basis. Of course, when this debate was started by the honourable member for Denison, the thought did come to me, 'Do you want to have a drink with Duncan because he's my mate?', because this has given us a great opportunity to put forward ideas which we would never have had the opportunity to do. So I thank the honourable member for Denison very much for doing that. Let us look at the matter that has been proposed. It begins, 'The threat to industrial peace. . . '. Who is really under threat? I can tell the House what the threat is. It is that Labor Party believes it is going to lose the union strength, the union movement, in this country because this is a watershed dispute. Those opposite are worried about the fact that they are going to lose that support around Australia. That is the threat; it is the threat to the Labor Party. Here is the honourable member opposite who now comes into this House and says he is standing up for the workers. I will tell the House what this member did. He opposed the northern pulp mill in Tasmania; he opposed the APM projects down in the Huon; he opposed the Mr Gibson interjecting",32
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable member for Moreton will cease interjecting. One more interjection, and I will warn him. Mr MILESWhatever the workers wanted in Tasmania, he has a record of opposing every development that has been proposed. I think we could have this quote as well: 'Methinks he doth protest too much'. There are really two bottom lines to this dispute. Does Australia need to be more efficient and more productive? What is the answer? Mr Rocher-They don't know the answer.",32
185,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is not a word from those opposite, because they know the answer is yes.  know that interjections are disorderly, but are not members like the honourable member for Curtin when interjecting and not in their seats most disorderly?",32
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Standing Orders provide that all interjections are out of order. I would think that both sides have had their fair share.,32
187,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The other bottom line is this: should workers who want to work be allowed to? The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said today, right in this place, 'APPM is freezing them out of their jobs'. I will tell the House what is happening down in Burnie today. There are hundreds of men and women who are not allowed to go to work because there the are picket lines across the gates preventing them. They want to work, but the picket lines will not allow them to. Not only that, but at Services: the mass meetings the organisers will not I am even allow a secret ballot. Why not? Because they know that if there is a secret ballot, they will be defeated and the people will want to present go back to work. A Government member-Are you in With any favour of secret ballots over this?",32
188,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Why not? These are some of the facts for the people who are this debate. The company has guaranteed the controlling employees the following: their award stands; plus 25 per cent over award payments; a hour week; plus 9 per cent superannuation; plus 20 per cent annual leave loading; plus severance pay of three weeks for every year worked. All that stands, and the unions can represented in negotiations and discussions all of those matters. But they all stand. The only thing that the company wants is for the following sorts of work practices to go and be cancelled: 'Should I be able to shower in company time?'. The company is now saying no, it is cancelled. 'Should I be able to be called into work to do a quarter of an work and get nine hours pay on a Saturday morning, and then on Sunday afternoon have a mate ring up and say that he needs me back for half an hour, for which I would get another nine hours pay?' That has been going on. They are the sorts of practices, the sorts of rorts, that the company wants out. Some people believe that we do not have any problems with the company. We do. There are certain things which this company has done and the processes by which it has gone about it which I am opposed to. Government members-Tell us about them.",33
189,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There are lots of details we could go into, but time does not pennit. Let us go back to a few other facts about this dispute. It started because the applied under the Government's industrial relations system to the Industrial Relations Commission. Let me indicate to people what that was all about. The unions applied saying that there was a safety risk in the pulp mill. Let us see what the Department of Labor Industry in Tasmania says about that. These are the comments of the Director of Technical familiar with this type of boiler plant and its inherent safety devices. These safety devices are not generally affected by boiler operation. They are to ensure that a catastrophic failure will not occur no matter what the operators may do. pressure plant there is a risk associated but I have no information to suggest that the boiler plant is any less safe with the current operatorslistening to that is, staff operatorsthe boiler plant than would be the case with the previous operators in control. 35Scotched! Gone! The first issue the union movement had in this was a drummed-up safety issue. Then, within a few days, it moved onto this: 'The company has got to be drop the charges against the employees'. I am on a bit surprised by the honourable member for Denison, because the charges were not laid by the company but by the police. I think they to were laid by the police, if you check it out. Mr Snowdon-Tell the truth.",33
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable hour's member for the Northern Territory!,33
191,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Then the unions kept shifting the . agenda. We have actually had seven different reasons for this dispute as each day went by. 'Drop the charges against union officials'; they do not want the union officials to be charged. Then they say, 'The unions have a monopoly about negotiating. Nobody else should be able to represent any of the workers'-even though down there there are at least 300 employees who want to go back to work and would defy the union movement in this way but they have no representation. If they were given an opportunity-which they would be given under our industrial relations system of having representativesthey would not have to abide by the monopolistic, archaic· system that presently FED&FA exists. That is the situation. Then we nearly got to a resolution last Tuesday night. Everybody knows about it. Martin Ferguson had this agreement with APPM. After the meeting was all over he had to go out and talk to the picket lines and a and few officials. What he found was that he could not put the motion to return to work because the agreement he had got with the company did not give the men enough, and they said, 'We are not going with you'. He had called the mass meeting for 7 a.m. on Wednesday to put the motion, but he could not do it. He was the one who backed out of that agreement. Not only that, there is one other thing that I want to mention in this debateMr Snowdon interjecting",33
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for the Northern Territoryl,34
193,Mr MILES,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Very early on in this dispute we had the company willing to talk with union representatives on the floor, but the union representatives would not discuss the issue with the company. (TIme expired)",34
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The time allotted for the debate· has expired. NA Public Works Committee: Refurbishment and Fitout of Juliana House, Phillip, Australian Capital Territory",34
195,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of the Committee for 1992 relating to the refurbishment and fit out of Juliana House, Phillip, Australian Capital Territory. Ordered that the report be printed.",34
196,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"by leave-The report which I have just tabled is for the refurbishment fit out of Juliana House in the Phillip-Woden area of the ACT. This project is sponsored and will be managed by the Australian Estate Management, a division of the Department of Administrative Services. Australian Estate Management is accountable to government for the effective asset management of the office estate, of which Juliana House forms a part. The office estate is fully commercialised and tenants, principally government departments, pay market based rents. The proposed scope of the work will include: repairs to damaged ceilings, replacement of carpets, upgrading of electricity supply and all mechanical services, including lifts and the fire protection system, in order to meet relevant Australian building codes and standards. Disabled persons facilities will also be provided in accordance with the relevant codes. These will include: ramp access to the main entrance to the building, lifts with voice indicator facilities, lower controls access for wheelchair users and braille controls for the visually impaired. The Government had given its approval for the design and commencement of refurbishment at a total cost of $8.27m with expenditure of $460,000 in 1991-92.· Australian Estate Management subsequently sought additional funds of $510,000 from the Department of Finance to increase the scope of works, to carry out a major upgrade of the lift services. Australian Estate Management considered these were below normal requirements of modem office accommodation. The estimated total cost for the project now stands at $8.78m, with expenditure of $460,000 in 1991-92. The project is scheduled for completion by January 1994. The Committee· believes that every effort should be made to complete this project by the end of 1993 in order to avoid the considerable cost which could be incurred by the traditional Christmas period close-down of the building industry. The Department of Health, Housing and Community Services will occupy the refurbished Juliana House. Since its creation in July 1987 the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has been pursuing and an accommodation policy aimed at collocating its staff in central and State offices. In Canberra· it is collocating in the· Woden-Phillip area and by its move to Juliana House will relinquish comparable space in privately leased accommodation. The Committee agrees that a need exists to refurbish Juliana House to bring it up to modem office standards for leasing to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Accordingly, the Committee has approved the project. The Committee, however, has reservations relating to the cost benefits of this proposal to the prospective tenant. The Committee was disturbed to learn that the financial impact of the renegotiation of leases on the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services will result at best in a cost neutral budget. In all probability, the Department anticipates budgetary increase. Nor does the Department anticipate any staff savings or a reduction in the number of vehicles used for courier service by its move to Juliana House. The Committee was told by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services that the benefits it would derive from moving to Juliana House were, in the main, qualitative, such as: easier access by clients and service providers; flexibility to accommodate organisational change; and enhanced security of its resources. Juliana House is a product of the basic office block design 1960s. It stands amongst equals with a cluster of buildings in the Woden Town Centre, all taking their names from the ships of the first, second and third fleets. When the Committee inspected Juliana House prior to the public inquiry, it saw a building with little aesthetic appeal and with many of its services at the end of their operational life. The Committee questioned the value of retaining this building, but Australian Estate Management maintained that neither a fire sale nor leasing are options in the building's present condition. Also, it was quite likely that an unrefurbished empty building in the Phillip-Woden area would remain vacant with loss of benefits to the Commonwealth. Based on this judgment, the Committee recommends that the proposal should proceed. However, the Committee is of the view that the estimated cost for the refurbishment and fit out estimated at $8.78m is excessive. Juliana House was presented to the Committee as a structurally sound building requiring no major internal or external structural ges. In addition, during the last 10 years maintenance work of approximately $604,000 has been carried out on Juliana House. The work described included many of the upgrades proposed in the current scope of the work. During the public inquiry, the major part of department. the Committee's questions centred on the issue of cost reduction of the work. The Committee was presented with alternative floor layouts to those proposed and, in the Committee's view, these have merit and a small should be examined. The Committee rejects a proposal for the provision of a block of unisex showers on the ground floor. The Committee believes that the block of showers is inappropriately located, adjacent to the conference facilities and the public area. The Committee is of the opinion that an alternative proposal to modify the plumbing in the male and female toilet area on each floor has merit and should be implemented. The Committee concludes that the cost of the proposal, estimated at $8.78m, is excesof the sive. The Committee recommends that the project, including floor layouts,should be thoroughly re-examined with the aim of substantially reducing the estimated costs. I commend the report to the House.  regard to the refurbishment of Juliana House in Phillip, some concerns are raised as to why the building was allowed to get to its present state in the first place. An all-up cost expenditure now of $8.78m and a market rent would seem to indicate that, despite the spending of that sort of money, the real value of the building will not increase. I am also a little concerned that Australian Estate Management, the body that allowed this building to get to that point, has now been charged with the responsibility of upgrading the building. I did note that the Committee questioned the viability of spending this sort of money on that particular building. I also note that the Committee was concerned at the work that needed to be carried out which included, as was mentioned, ceilings, carpets, electrical, chan- air-conditioning and mechanical servic-s including fire and lift facilities. At the end of the day we really do still have an old building. If departments are expected to pay market rent, they should be allowed to get out into the market to gain the best deal and the best facilities to suit that particular The point is, though, that the Committee was also concerned about a possible cost blow-out in regard to this upgrade. That seems to me to say that it has little faith in the ability of the Department to not only manage the project but also ensure that it brings this project in on time and on budget. Just yesterday we debated the wrapping up of the Parliament House Construction Authority. One of the Authority'S major shortfalls, I might remind the House, was the fact that it was unable to bring this particular building we are standing in today in on time and on budget, and again I raise queries about whether we should have the Department handling this. ill· the long term I think a far better way to go is for the Commonwealth to get out of the areas in which the private sector can do far better. We should cpntract this work out. We should contract out not only the inspection, maintenance and upgrading of our buildings to the private sector, but each department should go out into the private sector and get the best deal for that particular department, and the department should have the choice to decide what location it should be into best service its clients. Privileges Committee Consideration resumed from 1 June, on motion by Mr Gear: That the House take note of the report. upon which Mr Thckey had moved by way of amendment: That the following words be added to the motion: ""and requires Dwyer and Company, Solicitors, to formally apologise to Mr Nugent, MP, and to the Parliament for their action"". Ordered that consideration of the report be postponed until Wednesday, 3 June 1992. NA One Nation Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Keating: That the House take note of the papers.",34
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Mr Dubois)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Wills, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.",36
198,Mr CLEARY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Firstly, I would like to thank the people of Wills for having the courage to break with tradition and elect an independent, in what has been a traditional Labor seat. ill the·face of a massive and expensive campaign by both major parties and arguments that a vote for an independent is a wasted vote the electorate not only showed astute political acumen but helped rearrange, I hope, the political agenda. I also wish to record my appreciation of those friends, acquaintances and political allies ...,ithout whose idealism, inspiration and hard work such a result would not have been possible. I find it pitiful that a failed candidate, an ungracious loser, should seek refuge in an obscure clause in the Constitution in an attempt to overturn the people's will. It is rather intriguing that the very candidate who beat the drum loudest and at one time suggested all candidates with foreign-sounding names should be scrutinised as to their eligibility has, as I understand it, reneged in favour of a man who has decided to challenge five candidates, one of whom happens to be himself. I doubt that the people of Wills will be impressed. When on 26 November 1980 the previous honourable member for Wills, the former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, made his first speech to the Parliament he suggested that we lived in a troubled country. Whilst acknowledging that not all problems could be attributed to the policies of the prevailing government, Mr Hawke was nonetheless critical of the Fraser Government. ill his own words, that Government was 'indifferent to the dimensions of the problem'. The tax laws, which he claimed favoured the highly privileged, were described as an obscenity. With 100,000 kids between 15 and 19 unemployed and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, encouraging the young to show 'a bit of spirit' in the search for a job, Mr Hawke was moved to accuse the Liberal Government of 'attempting to blame the victims'. These days there are few who would suggest that a bit of go and a bit of spirit is all that is needed to get people back into work. At the time of Mr Hawke's first speech, total unemployment stood at 359,000. Eleven years and six months later, one million Australians are unemployed and youth unemployment has reached 128,000 on seasonally adjusted and 190,000 on unadjusted figures. According to official unemployment figures-and this is probably a conservative estimate-approximately 20 per cent of the Wills work force is now unemployed. Surely the Government has an obligation to do something about this state of affairs. Was it prophetic when Mr Hawke mooted the possibility of Australia becoming a country of two nations-one privileged, one poor? Today, after nine years of Labor Government, national unemployment stands at 11 per cent and youth unemployment at 33 per cent. A total of 680,000 children live in homes where neither parent has a job. In many industrial electorates, especially in those where the manufacturing base has been eroded, unemployment is considerably higher than the national average. Between 1983 and 1989, if we accept Marc Lombard's March 1991 Macquarie University paper, there has been a marked widening of the income gap. In 1982-83, according to Lombard, the top one per cent of income earners earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent. By 1989, the top one per cent earned as much as the bottom 21 per cent. Although some in the House see unemployment as partially due to economic restructuring, the abolition of deadend jobs and the search for efficiency, I am not sure just how economic rationalists go about explaining or justifying the income gap increase. None of this is a revelation to either side the House and I respect the fact that a number of honounlble members have expressed concern about unemployment. Only last week the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), whose office I inherited, spoke passionately about the complicity of employers in the payment of under award wages to imported New Zealand labour. For the shearers, unemployment has reached crisis point. Unfortunately, it took the establishment of a shearers' camp on the lawns of Parliament House to bring this issue to the public's attention. The decision by the immigration committee of the Labor Caucus to urge the Minister to cancel those aspects of trans-Tasman travel which allow New Zealanders access to the Australian job market without payment of income taxes and in breach of awards is to be welcomed. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have, understandably, consistently pointed out that under Labor inflation has been reduced. In Question Time the catchcries of zero inflation and Captain Zero have rarely been far from the debate. Both phrases have meaning in the present crisis, but the meaning as captured by cartoonist Ron Tandberg on the front page of the Age of Thursday, 28 May is not exactly as the flag-wavers of zero inflation would want it. On that occasion Tandberg, using the figure of an economic adviser, juxtaposed the images and interconnectedness of unemployment and reduced inflation. This interconnectedness is worth exploring. In the wake of the Government's free trade policies, policies which would be more vigorously pursued by the Opposition, Australians now import 36 per cent more clothing and footwear than they did three years ago and 40,000 jobs have been lost in the Victorian textile, clothing and footwear industry over that period. Now we hear that Australia could lose another 35,000 jobs in the TCF industry over the next 12 months if the present tariff policy is continued. If the Wills experience be any guide, the Labor Party's ability to rein in inflation was no palliative to those in work who cared about their fellow person and those out of of work who wondered where retraining would take them. The maxim 'better unemployed and trained than paying through the nose' carried little weight. Contrary to the ill-informed and superficial pronouncements of the likes of Gerard Henderson and Padraic MCGuinness, my Wills by-election campaign did not raise the spectre of a return to blind protectionism. As Keynes explained in 1932, as cited by Kenneth Davidson in the Age of 23 April 1992: · .. neither free trade nor protection can theoretical case which entitles it to claim supremacy in practice. Protection is a dangerous and expensive method of protecting a want of balance and security in a nation's economic life. But there are times when we cannot safely trust ourselves to the blindness of economic forces; and when no alternative weapon as efficacious as lies ready to our hand. As is the case with protectionism, economic rationalism and its corollary, free trade, have no supremacy in practice. When that practice derives its veracity from a fictitious level playing field, where the means of restricting imports has reached state-of-the-art levels, the practice needs to be re-evaluated. Like many people in the House, I believe we need a new approach to industry policy. Jenny Stewart points out in her 1989 paper Industry Policy and Why Australia Needs One: · .. the belief that such an objective-that is, an industry policy-is not only misguided but also wrong needs to be discussed. Such' a policy involves making decisions about not only what we might be good at producing-a version of a clever countrybut also what we ought to produce to sustain ourselves culturally. It cannot be just tourism. As Jenny Stewart reminds us: · .. when the big questions are asked-what sort of Australia do we want? what will most of us be doing? how will we pay our way?-there is an eerie silence. For today's speech I chose a suit made by Flair. This sounds like something out of a fashion parade, I know. Flair operates in Preston, which is just outside my electorate. The proprietor, Aaron Kanat, tells me that it is as good as anything produced by the Italian company· Zegna which, as we know, has for some time been identified with the Prime Minister. I might show it to the Prime Minister later on! A clever country would set about breaking down some of these myths. A clever country would not rely solely on the market or genuflect before the temple of international competitiveness in the search for a way of life. It is also no good being, to quote Jenny Stewart again, 'lion-hearted when it comes to promoting the agricultural interest abroad but present a wimp-like when the interests of service sectors or manufacturing businesses are at stake'. At school most of us learnt about the stump jump plough, the harvester and the Massey-Ferguson tractor. As my colleagues to the right would obviously know, we used to tariffs have an agricultural machinery industry and we were proud of it. That industry has now been wiped out. The Wills by-election did not revolve around the popUlarity of a football hero, nor was the outcome equivalent to just a protest. Such assessments completely miss the point. They miss the point because they do not take into account just how disenchanted people were with what the major parties were offering. Neither party was prepared to seriously argue that it could reduce unemployment. My assessment is that the people of Wills were talking about more than unemployment. Certainly unemployment was an important issue but so too was the desire to participate in the decision-making processes, processes which were destroying an old way of life without offering a new one. The scenario being trotted out appeared to offer them no future. Manufacturers and working people alike were engaged in a critique of prevailing economic theory and economic policy. Working people were not prepared to tighten the belt and wait for the invisible hand of the market to advise them as to where they might be employed and what their suburbs might look like. Nor were they happy to accept the removal of funding to the NOW Centre, an important social welfare agency in Brunswick. It was like rubbing salt into the wounds. Neither party can take solace from what happened in Wills nor, as they have attempted to do, claim that it was a loss for the other side. To say it was a kind of Labor win ignores the fact that, notwithstanding the more interventionist tone of One Nation, people were critical of the Labor Party's lack of intervention. The vote against Labor was not a vote for the Liberal Party or, with all respect, a vote for the goods and services tax. Those traditional Labor supporters who deserted the flock did not run into the arms of the Opposition. Eleven years ago Mr Hawke ended his first speech with a reference to the 'innate sense of fair play of the great majority of the Australian people'. On 11 April this year the people of Wills took him to task on this issue and demanded that they, too, be treated fairly. Today the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) tells us that there is good news on the economic front. The test, however, is whether it results in more employment in electorates such as Wills. Privatisation, commonly referred to as selling off the family jewels, is not the way forward-a new and innovative industry policy just might be. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",36
199,Mr LAVARCH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) on his first speech. I look forward to hearing from him in subsequent debates in this House on many subjects. I am sure that other members will join with me in congratulating him on this occasion. This afternoon we are debating the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The debate on this statement is obviously extremely important because it allows the House to canvass the issues raised by the Government and the Opposition in terms of their respective plans for the Australian economy and for Australia more generally. That Australia has begun its slow but inevitable move out of recession is almost without doubt. The release today of the March national accounts figures confirms that for second successive quarter Australia has recorded positive growth. That means that over the last six months the Australian economy has grown by approximately 1112 per cent. The most current figures for the last quarter indicate that the economy grew by 0.6 per cent. While this is very slow growth, it growth nonetheless and obviously it is welcomed by honourable members from both sides of the House. We need growth to tackle the most fundamental problem which Australia faces, correctly identified by the honourable member for Wills as the tragedy of unemployment. The growth which we are now experiencing is modest, but it is relatively soundly based. By that I mean that it is not fuelled by excessive private consumption-although there are levels of increased consumption, and that is necessary to get the economy moving. There has been strong growth in the Australian housing industry in States such as Queensland, particularly in the south-eastern comer, which includes my electorate. The housing boom in that area is more than evident. Housing numbers are increasing strongly. I am pleased to say that first home buyers are able to move back into the housing market with some confidence, with interest rates at their lowest level for two decades. We have also seen the turnaround in the stock cycle, with businesses restocking. That has led to increases in production. Throughout the recession we have seen many businesses switch from the domestic market to exports. This is a fundamental switch which must occur if Australia is to continue to grow and provide jobs at a time when we have continuing difficulties with our current account deficit. As I mentioned earlier, interest rates for home buyers are at their lowest level. They range from 10 to 1011z per cent. We all know that inflation is at its lowest level for some decades. Currently the annual rate is running at just under 2 per cent, with the underlying rate being between 21f2 and 3 per cent. In respect of the wages to profit share, we leave this recession with profits at 16 per cent. This compares favourably with the figure at the the end of the 1982-83 recession when profits were much lower, at about 12 per cent. Wage growth has been modest, at about 3 per cent; but, given the low levels of inflation, this does provide a modest real wage increase for most Australians. We have seen a good increase in productivity of 2 per cent recorded is in the national accounts figures. While this is a modest figure in terms of what Australia needs, it is encouraging and is over the average productivity growth which Australia has seen in the 1990s. While some of these economic statistics are encouraging and do point unambiguously to Australia moving out of recession, there Tuesday, 2 June 1992 remains sufficient problems for the House and the Government to be concerned about. One is the level of private business investment, which is still very poor. Most fundamentally, in terms of the concern of all honourable members, the level of unemployment remains far too high. I believe the latest unemployment figures indicate· that the national level of unemployment is at about 10.4 per cent. That varies a little from State to State and between regions within States. In my home State of Queensland the unemployment rate is a little under 10 per cent, and within the shire which makes up the bulk of my electorate the unemployment rate, according to the latest figures released for local government areas by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, is about 5112 per cent. Obviously many other areas in Australia are suffering at much greater levels than that. It is on this issue of unemployment that One Nation statement is fundamentally based. It is a statement designed to get Australia moving, to get Australians back into work. The recession has cost Australia and many individual Australians. The recession has cost about 300,000 of the 1.6 million jobs created through the 1980s. It has cost those 300,000 Australians who have lost those jobs enormous personal hardship not only for themselves but also for their loved ones. the fundamental aim of this Government and this Parliament to assist those people and to make sure that their period of unemployment is for the least possible time, and that their period of unemployment they are given every opportunity to gain the skills and the chances which will enable them to gain long term and fulfilling jobs. The One Nation statement tackles these problems head on. It is designed as a mixture of direct government intervention. in the economy through the Government's own infrastructure investment and through boosts such as the one-off increase in the family allowance payment. It is also a mixture of measures to help business,· to encourage that private investment which is so essential if we are to have a sound period of growth. I will not detail all of the measures REPRESENTATIVES 3341 One Nation package. I think the most important ones concern the changes to depreciation and changes to the tax system, in as much as they allow a small business, for instance, to roll over the sales of the business into a new business with relief from capital gains tax. Some of the more innovative measures include the pooled development funds; the 10 per cent development allowance to encourage major products; the streamlining of approval processes for new projects; combining the environmental and heritage requirements to make sure they flow through as smoothly and as quickly as possible to protect our heritage and to uphold our environmental safeguards; the removal of export controls on iron ore; and the introduction of life of the mine approvals for mineral sands projects. The list goes on and on, but I will not go through it. What the One Nation statement does show is the very stark contrast between the the Government's approach to moving Australia out of recession and improving our economy and that proposed by the Liberal and Nationals parties through their Fightback policies. It all boils down to the fact that the Fightback proposal is nothing more than simply a change in the tax mix. It is proposing the introduction of a goods and services tax which, in tum, will replace a series of other indirect taxes. That is the It has to be essence of those tax changes. Other measures are contained in the proposal, such as reductions in personal during income tax. That is not paid for by the introduction of the GST, but, rather, by anticipated growth in the economy which will mean that there will be more tax receipts and, hopefully, that can be returned through reductions in personal income tax. It is also based on net cuts in government spending of about $4 billion. Of course, these cuts will impact most harshly on Australian familiesparticularly those families who are reliant on some level of government support. Such measures as the removal of the sole parent benefit once the youngest child turns 12 and the removal of the entitlement to the Job Search allowance after a period of nine in the months are cuts in government spending. Even if one puts to one side their social impact and the fairness considerations, in economic terms it is nothing more than lunacy in terms of helping Australia move out of the recession. At this time we need an increase in the role of government. As the private sector has contracted and as there have been declines in private investment, we need an increase in public investment and government spending to stimulate the sort of demand which will produce more jobs. Yet in the face of the current economic climate, Fightback proposes that there be reductions in government spending. I am not a great proponent of increasing government intervention, but government does have a role in times of recession. It is responsible for a government to use its power to spend more in order to encourage growth. It is irresponsible for the Opposition, through its proposals, to come up with a policy which will in fact contract the economy even further. The other fact· which cannot be disputed is that Fightback is an inflationary policy. There might be some debate as to the level of the increase in inflation as a result of the introduction of a GST, but there is no debate whatsoever that there will be an increase in inflation if the GST proposal is brought forward. The last thing Australia needs to do, given that we have paid such a high price for reducing our inflation rate and getting it down to below that of our trading partners, is throw that out of the window and adopt a policy which puts us on a path of increasing inflation again. That is another consequence of the Fightback proposal. If one puts aside all of the other equity arguments about the introduction of a GST-taxing basic necessities of life and everything which flows from that-and looks at the cold economic outcome of such a proposal, in my opinion one can see that it would be utterly irresponsible to adopt a policy which would feed inflation back into the system at a time when we have the chance to have a period of sustained growth based on low inflation. For that reason alone I do not believe one could adopt or entertain the GST proposal. Other outcomes of the Opposition's proposal include a lower productivity outcome than has been achieved by this Government. This is actually displayed by the figuring done by the Opposition. It gives three scenarios as to productivity outcomes. If one takes even its best case result, one will see that that provides a productivity outcome of, I think, about 0.8 per cent annual increase in productivity. That is lower than the figure that has been achieved in Australia throughout the 1980s-a figure which the Opposition itself is extremely critical of. Yet its own proposals and documents indicate that the productivity outcome of its own master plan for the Australian economy is in fact less than has been achieved during the 1980s. Another point of very great contrast between the policies enunciated in the One Nation statement and those enunciated by the Opposition is in terms of industrial relations. The One Nation statement is based on the accord process and the undertaking of the trade union movement to make sure that future wage increases are linked to those of our trading partners. In contrast to this industrial policy, the Opposition, through Fightback, is essentially arguing that we should remove the Industrial Relations Commission, that we should remove any concept of centralised wage fixing, and that we should move to a free market system. The last time Australia tried such a system, in the dying days of the Fraser Government, we had wage growth in double digits. That is why we left the last recession with double digit inflation. It should be starkly obvious that we are leaving this recession with low inflation. That c-n be attributed largely to the industrial policies which, unfortunately, the Opposition has not learnt from. The One Nation statement is good policy. It is the basis upon which Australia can move confidently into a period of recovery and into a period of sound and sustainable economic growth.",39
200,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Wannon) (4.26 p.m.)Having listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), I must admit that I did agree with one thing he said. He said that unemployment is too high, and I think we would all agree with that. But he did not go on to say who caused it. Of course, it .is none other than this Government. I am staggered by the utter humbug that comes from some members of the Labor Party when they talk about the problems of unemployment and just wash their hands of the fact that they are the ones who created it. Mr Recession just sits there across the table as the high priest of unemployment. It is about time that some of this humbug was exposed. I want to talk a little bit about the February economic statement and then move on to some of the positive alternatives that we have put up in the Fightback package-a package which, contrary to what the honourable member has just said, is very much a comprehensive package; a vision for this nation which certainly has a lot more in it than just talk about taxation reform. The Labor Party has failed to understand its charter. It always purports to be the concerned party. But as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) pointed out in his very thoughtful maiden speech, Labor can certainly no longer claim to be fair when it comes to the way in which it has dealt with Australians. I think we have to look at the dreary outlook that is being proposed by the February economic statement, which is backed up by this rather extraordinary announcement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Sunday, and the splendid vision that is contained in the Fightback package. I found it interesting to listen to the previous speaker. He was supposedly talking about the February statement, but in fact I think he spent more time attacking the Opposition than he did trying to sell the virtues of his policy. That is how much faith he seems to have in it. Clearly, he is not all that impressed with it, contrary to what he would like some people to believe. I want to talk a little about what has really happened in this nation in the last 12 months or so. What do we see when we look at this February statement? We see that it is nothing more than a con job. It is the fourth statement that this Government has made in the last 12 months-that is how desperate it is-under the fourth Treasurer. Clearly, this Government is in a considerable amount of difficulty. It is now searching around for new quick fixes and is finding it very difficult. Is the situation so desperate that we are looking at a statementled recovery? The Wills by-election has shown that the voters in Australia have more than passed judgment on the pathetic attempts that the Government is making. I think we are now seeing a government which is showing all the signs of a death rattle; a government which is in desperate trouble. It is interesting to watch the new game in town. It seems that the new game in town is to blame the other person; this is the new way of dealing with matters. Every time something goes wrong, what does the Prime Minister do? He says, 'Oh, that's the fault of the Opposition'. Today in Question Time and during the debate on the matter of public importance we saw a classic example of this. The Government's own industrial relations system is failing, and what does it do? The Government says, 'Oh, that's the fault of the Opposition' . This Government goes through extraordinary contortions when it comes to dealing with the truth. Mr Andrew-It's a very powerful Opposition.",41
201,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Yes, I suppose we in the Opposition should be flattered. As my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield points out, we must be very powerful. We see this extraordinary thing, and then we look at the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). If he has some problems, what does he do? He blames the staff; he says it is the fault of his staff. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) says that it is a problem with the Department. Mr Jull-Don't they believe in ministerial responsibility?",42
202,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Well, I wonder: do they believe in ministerial responsibility? It was supposed to be one of the hallmarks of this Parliament, but it seems to have been well and truly forgotten. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher, made an extraordinary comment in relation to the Opposition, which is trying to demonstrate financial responsibility, when he all but said that it is irresponsible not to increase the debt. That is about what he told us in his statement. Again, I find it quite extraordinary. When that does not work I suppose we can come back to the big game in town; that is, to blame someone else. I wanted to talk a little about why Australians should not trust the Prime Minister and this February economic statement. I have already pointed out some of the problems that the Government has created, and 1I have also pointed out the extraordinary way it twists logic and the contortions that come out to try to shift the blame from the people who should be responsible for the mess that we are facing today. I ask all honourable members whether they remember who said this: 'I will not let there be a recession' . Who said, 'Bob'-that is, Bob Hawke- 'can stay Prime Minister as long as he wants.'? Who said, in relation to the same thing, 'No deals have been done. '? I ask who said: We need a consumption tax. Without a decent tax system, you can't in the long term keep a dynamic economy and you can't keep a fair country if some people are shouldering the tax. Maybe some people would agree with him. I think all people in the Opposition would agree with that last point. Maybe he did get it right once when he made that statement in 1985. But those previous three statements were made by the Prime Minister. Who believes him? He tried to cover it up when he made the great statement, 'This is the recession we had to have'. He was proud of all those people losing their jobs; all those businesses going broke. Now he tells us that we do not need a consumption tax. He certainly is a bit of a chameleon. Mr Jull-But he did say he wasn't going to sell off the family silver.",42
203,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Yes, he did say, 'Don't sell off the family silver'. What did he announce today? What is he doing? Mr Jull-Privatisation.",43
204,Mr HAWKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Yes; privatising anything and everything to get money. The lack of consistency comes through like a beacon. Why, then, would Australians want to trust this man? We have to look behind some of these claims in the February economy statement and see what it really means. To start with, there is all the extra spending-the unfunded spending spree. According to the honourable member for Fisher it is responsible to have unfunded spending, but does it add up? Government debt will rise by about $18 billion, interest rates will rise, taxes will obviously have to rise unless the debt is going to go up even further, and of course, as I say, this $18 billion is unfunded. 1 tum to one of the major thrusts of the economic statement, an area that 1I have a particular interest in, the spending on transport. A lot of questions have to be asked about this matter. First of all, is there a comprehensive study available of the best options for Australian transport? In other words, is the money being well spent? Are there any estimated returns on this spending? There are already strong doubts about the commercial viability of some of the projects that are being funded. We have only to look in yesterday'S Daily Commercial News to find that already there are very strong doubts only about the long term viability of the National Rail Corporation, yet we are spending hundreds of millions of dollars there. It seems that we are going to spend now and hope and pray that somehow in the future things will start to come right. We also have to look at what social returns are expected from this expenditure. Is it being directed to the best area? We should look at some of the problems that are still to be confronted. If we are going to see the National Rail Corporation have any chance of working, one area that we should look at is labour productivity. We know that productivity in our railways is about one-fifth of productivity in comparable North American railways. If we are to move to world best practice, which is certainly what we will be doing under a coalition government, we can immediately see savings of at least 30 per cent, or about $1.2 billion a year. That is big money. But the question now has to be asked of the Government: when are we going to see these greenfield site agreements with the unions that have been touted as the solution to the problem? What are we going to do if, in fact, the agreements are not reached? Where will the money go then? Will we compromise again? The questions have to be ;answered. Based on what I said earlier about the Prime Minister and his past record, the question remains: will we be able to believe what the Government is telling us? It is worth looking at some of the claims that are made about the National Rail Corporation and reminding ourselves that this whole exercise, important though it is, accounts for only 12 per cent of the total rail freight. In other words, 88 per cent is not affected by this. On top of that, of course, does nothing about the problems that are facing our passenger rail. It is little wonder that there is a lot of cynicism about this Government when it talks about microeconomic reform and when it holds up as its great flag of reform something that accounts for a relatively small part of the whole transport system-and that is after nine years. If we look at the question of road spending we find that it is a real con. Since this Government came to power, until now the amount of funds from the Commonwealth going into roads in real terms has fallen per cent, when at the same time the revenue from fuel tax has increased by 120 per cent. Is it any wonder that there is cynicism? Is it any wonder that if we do our sums carefully we find that the increased unfunded spending announced in the February statement restores Commonwealth road funding only to the level it was at when this Government began? That is some achievement! Let us look at the positive side and what we can achieve under Fightback. There are some very bright options and some great alternatives there. Just look, for example, at rail. Instead of our having to get out there and make great unfunded announcements, under Fightback rail alone will gain $243m each year through the removal of fuel excise and the removal of payroll tax. That is quite a useful little gain. In fact, that will fund everything that is in the February statement, but it will not be there for just two or three years; it will go on and on. Of course, it is not just in the area of that we will see major reform; we are going to see it on roads, too. We are going to get rid of the input taxes and make major savings there. Even the Treasury figures indicate that the savings on transport under the Fightback package will be well in excess of $1 billion. That recognises the. very important role that transport plays in the future of this country. Of course, it goes further than that. In the area of labour market reform, another very important part of the Fightback package, we believe that we can see $1.2 billion worth of savings just in. rail. If we can establish these savings, just think of what we can do to it improve the infrastructure of this nation. But, as I said at the beginning, Fightback is fully funded and that, of course, means that we are handling the whole thing in a much more responsible manner. In the brief time left to me, I would like to draw attention to some of the comments in today's papers about th- announcements that the Prime Minister made over the weekend. We see a Prime Ministerdesperately trying to gee up his back bench. A'$ I say, watching those opposite today, one could see all the signs of the death rattles. There was by 20 touchiness, nervousness, twitchiness and extraordinary jumpiness every time a member of the coalition got up to ask a question. An article headed 'Keating ""reforms"" cosmetic' in the Daily Telegraph Mirror states: ... ""reforms"" were at best minor and at worse an attempt to patch uP. past disasters, and fairly inadequate at that. That is pretty damning, is it not? The article goes on to state: . How many new, sustainable jobs would be createcJ by the proposed changes? Again, I think it puts it in the right perspective. I am sure· that my colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) will have a lot more to say about that. I would. like to conclude by using the terminology that the"" Government wants to use when it talks about One Nation. To me, that is very reminiscent of a statement from another era which went something like this: ein reich, ein volk, ein fuhrer. With all the fiddling going on, we wonder whether the rail Prime Minister might now not be able to be called the Nero of New Holland.",43
205,Mr FERGUSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The Daily Telegraph Mirror might be at the nadir of Australian journalism and intellectual content, but, as we have seen, it still has some devotees. In contrast to the Opposition's mindless sloganising that all of the unemployment problems are solved by productivity and labour market changes, the One Nation statement recognises the very serious unemployment problem facing Australia. In Reid and similar electorates, the crisis means more than local CES statistics that are· worse than State or national averages. It is no comfort that we can get ministerial press releases talking about a downturn from a very high figure in the first place. It is reflected in a localised upturn of violence; robberies of the person and breakins; racial tension; hostility to migration; telephone calls from distressed, middle-aged residents overwhelmed by the necessary CES and social security paperwork after retrenchments and the related trauma; and in a region that has been characterised by this particular sector of the economy, the collapse of manufacturing firms that will never be revived. These are accompanied by the emergence of aimless and angry youth.. These aspects cannot be ignored. They should long ago have found a place in the national accounts. We all endorse One Nation's aims of creating 800,000 jobs and decreasing unemployment to' 7.5 per cent by 1996. However, this is only the awkward first step towards tackling long term unemployment. The document admits that only half of the 300,000 people who lost employment during the recession can expect to get jobs back. In reality, a direct stimulus of $2.3 billion over 15 months, a mere 0.5 per cent of the then GDP, is of benefit but, concurrently, caused no tremors amongst financial analysts. Actually, most commentators indicated that the markets could have tolerated a greater stimulus given the desperate days. The projected deficit moves from the heralded 2per cent GDP surplus for 1989-90 to a minimal deficit of 1. 7 per cent for 199192. The now disputed fixation with the need to reduce government activity means that public spending is still predicted to fall from the 1991-92 figure of only 26.6 per cent of GDP. It is to be hoped that the modest injection can precipitate the extensive turnaround that is forecast. In the context of an international picture, that has grimness, particularly given recent Japanese trends. That said, the statement delineates a course of nationally vital infrastructure projects in rail and road transport. It is not good enough for the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), to cite second-hand references from some article in some unnamed paper this morning that the national freight situation has some unspecified street problems and to say that that is a major reason why there should not be major expenditure on this infrastructure. It is just not good enough. Quite frankly, he then followed it with a mindless comparison with the unspecified comparative North American railway systems. I do not know what part of the North American rail system, Amtrak, he is talking about, with the complete crushing of the routes there. We are talking about geographic differences. He failed to specify exactly why that very general remark is necessarily a reason for us to ignore the infrastructure needs of this country. Important changes are heralded in electricity and airlines. The One Nation statement distinguishes the Government from a coalition that, even on its now disreputable claims, only sought an 8.25 per cent unemployment rate. It constitutes a vital income support to those on family allowance or its supplement and other beneficiaries. The contrast is stark with a coalition that condemns the unemployed to the loss of benefits after nine months. Simultaneously, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) says that one in every 12 people would not have a job to go to in the mid1990s. Labor's social security improvements a.so should be measured against constant coalition assurances that it will end the sole parent pension when the youngest child is 12 years of age. The coalition boasts that it will abolish the DEET Youth Bureau, which helps the unemployed .and disadvantaged, and deprive 100,000 families of family allowance because of lower income tests. One Nation introduces an overdue national emphasis on vocational training and pours significant money into necessary labour market activities. I think it is interesting to note that two weeks ago we had the State Minister in charge of TAFE training in New South Wales coming to the opening of a college in my electorate and boasting about how constructive he was going to be in national negotiations about the future of vocational training and TAPE in our State. Two weeks later, when this Government moved on this very vital national need, in the context of the Carmichael report and the Finn report, the New South Wales Government displayed the typical unconstructive, negative, nineteenth century attitude to vocational training. Two weeks ago, when it was not going to happen, we were all with it. When there is some announcement about the need for progress, there is a stumbling block from the New South Wales State Government. Importantly, One Nation offers worthwhile support to exporters, encourages national projects, spurs research and development and seeks to widen finance availability. In a parochial sense, I welcome the $71m for the freight designated rail lines from Campbelltown to Enfield and the associated $4Om endeavour by the National Rail Corporation for an efficient freight terminal at the latter site. I and other inner-western Sydney members are now hopeful that the Merrylands-Harris Park Y Link will get off the ground within the better cities program. It is obviously a vital need for the south-western region. The works program on rail will be extremely popular in many quarters. The decision to expand the textile, clothing and footwear program by $51m to $130m also matters to Reid. Recent retrenchment figures attest that this has been a significant local employer. The money to assist modernisation of equipment, work force training, accrual of managerial skills, restructuring, improved marketing and a focus to value adding is needed. The industry has been characterised by a work force from non-English speaking nations who still have minimal English and scant alternative work skills. In reality, without training, they are unemployable. Recently, I have been pleased to work with such Turkish women to persuade DEET to engineer a combined English work skills course for them. This is only a small help in a nationwide employment difficulty that hurts our economy. These TCF initiatives are a residue; they are a pale shadow of the important sectoral initiatives of this Government after 1983. There must be a reorientation to the selectivity, government overview and accountability that characterised moves such as partnerships for development, the pharmaceutical program and the steel, heavy engineering and automobile plans. This style of intervention rose from 0.17 per cent of GDP for 1977-78 to a modest 0.38 per cent for 1989. However, the 1990-91 Treasury papers predicted a further retreat from these measures by approximately 40 per cent from 1990-91 to 1993-94. In a summary of Labor's performance in a magazine Labour and Industry in March 1991, Stephen Bell put the opinion: The experience of industry policy development has also clearly revealed the limits of union influence within the accord relationship. Certainly, the ovemll thrust of Labor's industry policy has not been in the direction of selective, tripartite industry interventions. The tentative questioning of the rationalist agenda in One Nation needs to be widened, not because the ACTU says so or because some Ministers advocate it, but because it is a crucial ingredient of Australian recovery and export penetration. In an analysis of Sweden, Germany and Japan, Lane Kenworthy commented in the Journal of Public Policy of September 1991: To a significant degree the governments of all industrialised countries, regardless of political ideology and rhetoric, inevitably affect the pattern of investment in their economies through procurement tariffs and quotas guarantees and various selective tax breaks and subsidies. The real choice is between a coordinated anticipatory industrial policy and an ad hoc reactive one. He further noted: A coherent proactive industrial policy can provide significant payoffs, and will in all probability be increasingly seen as necessary to economic success even in nations such as the US where the political and cultural environment is most hostile toward selective State intervention. Whatever the specifics of each firm, Australia's industries need more than the Industry Commission preoccupation with slashing tariffs. They need more than our cheering for GATT negotiations .and more than Government pronouncements that the common agricultural policy is going to be turned over in the next five to 10 years. Certainly, the lift in exports, especially in the value-added manufacturing sectors, from 1982-83 is testimony to the Government's efforts. While the Industry Commission and its predecessor have merrily advocated a docile government role, the .tigers of AsiaSingapore, Taiwan, South Korea, et ceterahave followed a crypto-Japanese path of government activity and direction. This has ranged over the gamut of technology accrual, market apportionment, contracts, export facilitation, import replacement, credit provision, wages policy, et cetera. A myriad of publications has repudiated the mythology that these advances were somehow the product of free markets and level playing fields. In a book I recently read, entitled Nippon: New Super Power-Japan since 1945, William Horsey and Roger Buckley summarised as follows: In reality to achieve its goal the Japanese Government used the full range of its formal and informal powers: the law, subsidies, incentives and the long-established practices of administrative guidance meaning official directives based not on laws but on the supposedly voluntary cooperation of various interested parties. Administrative guidance has been widely exercised throughout the post-war years: for example, the Bank of Japan's direct influence over the business of commercial banks, MITIs setting of output and price targets in steel and petrochemical industries are in this category. After the oil crisis they . . . set a wide range of industries for production, energy saving and automation. A recent indication of how decisive this government sectoral approach is. lies in the direction of research and development. Kazuhiko Takeda, in an account of new materials research policy, published in Science and Technology in Japan in August 1991 stated: Together in close cooperation with national research institutions, universities and industry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has started efficient research and development projects that are too risky for private companies to proceed with on an independent basis. Therein he demonstrated exactly how decisive, how dominant, the Government's role was in directing efforts regarding high temperature super conducting materials, high performance ceramics for efficient exploitation of energy and conservation, nonlinear photonic materials to aid processing of information and silicone based polymers that determine less incineration of carbon dioxide. He further asserted: The Government has been implementing large scale research and development into comprehensive energy-saving techIiologies in a cooperative effort among the national research organisations, industry and academic sectors since 1978 .. The fact of life is that, when the recession lifts, it is just not going to happen in food processing, waste disposal, mineral processing, infoimation provision, pharmaceuticals or paper unless the Goverruilent helps guide a variety of decisions, including investment. No matter how preoccupied the Government is to avoid extensive pump priming, the long term agenda means a further debilitating worsening of overseas debt unless sectoral encouragement prevails. I congratulate the Government on its support for export efforts. The tripling of performance bond guarantees to $150m will aid companies in contractual undertakings. There is equally a clear threat to Australian firms shown in other nations' preparedness to assist their companies with soft loans. The $18m increase in the development import finance facility, whilst modest, is crucial in facilitating similar support. Crucially, targets in Austrade receives encouragement by this statement. This, of course, must be viewed against the contrast of naive Opposition calls for thoughtless contracting out of services, the slicing off of $70m, and prohibitive market rates for the said private provision of services. These represent a devastating assault on the export market development grants, the international trade enhancement scheme and other aspects. The coalition campaign comes in ignorance of the MCKinsey report of 1990, the resulting restructure and re-emphasis to Asia and the transfer to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Government, in constructive fashion, proposes $5m per annum extra for the overseas network in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a telling re-orientation, demonstrated in a 12 per cent growth in exports to Japan over the last five years, and a simultaneous growth of 30 per cent for the ASEAN group nations. It will assist in the establishment of offices among a group of cities now being considered, including Kyushu, Hanoi and Vientianne. It is certainly interesting to note the very relevant comments of Narelle Hooper in the Business Review Weekly of 11 October 1991 when she said: Unlike John Hewson and his colleagues, exporters are at least prepared to give Austrade a little longer before they pass judgment on the result of its management shake up. Similarly, small business is assisted by the export access program, an initiative of the 1991 Budget. This will be tripled to $12m over three years, thus determining that many smaller firms, lacking expertise, are helped with an export plan, the preparation and conclusion of overseas trade visits, help with buyers and assessment of target markets. This should mean a rise in those assisted from 250 to 700 participants. It will extensively widen the geographic representation of those given decisive encouragement. Another commendable action by the Government was the pooled development funds concept for encouragement of equity investment in small to medium firms. This is aimed at specific sectors with its exclusion of real estate except where manufacturing related or aligned with tourism. The Block and Coghlan inquiries detailed an underdeveloped equity market for smaller firms. This concept, with concessional tax rules, helps those firms with total assets of less than $30m. Additionally, tl:lere are restrictions that PDFs not invest greater than 5 per cent for start-ups, and not more than 10 per cent towards any one venture. This is a tentative gesture at a vital problem. However, it is all the more encouraging when viewed against the background of the Industry Commission's perception that it is alternatively either too hard or not worthy of attention.  brief look at the way the Australian media reported the so-called economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) provides a revealing insight into how it was received. Tim Colebatch of the Age said: We were told this statement would be about 'jobs, jobs, jobs'-we were misled. Max Walsh of the Sydney Morning Herald was even more scathing in his remarks, saying: Prime Minister Keating's 'One Nation' statement is crude and dangerous pork-barrelling dressed up as an economic strategy. Michelle Grattan of the Age astutely described the article as: An unashamedly political pitch for votes. . These initial reactions to the statement are meaningful, because they illustrate two important features of contemporary Australian politics: firstly, we are being governed by a party driven by the desire to cling to power, rather than motivated by the long term good of the nation; and, secondly, there has never been a broader difference between the policies and the motivations of the nation's two major political parties. These differences are clearly reflected in the opposing parties economic strategies. One Nation and Fightback reflect completely different approaches to solving the same problems. But first, let us put this debate on the One Nation statement into context by examining the economic environment into which it was delivered. After nine years in office, during which the present Prime Minister has played a pivotal role in the nation's economic management - or mismanagement as the case may be-the Labor Government has pushed this nation into the worse recession in 60 years. Let me stress that this recession was not a quirk of fate, and it was not due to some over-bearing economic calamity beyond the Government's control. Mr JuU-We had to have it.  Minister's own admission, it is the result of a deliberate economic policy designed to cool a bubbling economy. We all know that these policies went too far in some respects, and not far enough in others. For example, high interest rates crippled the business sector, led to a savage increase in business bankruptcies and put the skids under business investment. The number of businesses forced into bankruptcy increased by 51 per cent in the 1990-91 financial year. This does not include all the business owners who could not make ends meet and simply closed their doors and walked away. High interest rates also took their toll on investment, with the level of new capital expenditure falling by 1.7 per cent in 1989-90 and then by 7 per cent in 1990-91. The latest figures show a continuing decline, with investment falling by 14.5 per cent in the 12 months to December 1991. Real interest rates-that is the prime rate less inflationare still high. Indeed, despite low nominal values, an inflation rate of less than one per cent nationally means that interest rates are still high in real terms. Significantly, interest rates, both nominal and real, are also quite high compared with many of our overseas competitors. So when members opposite harp about the benefits of low inflation; they need to remember that achieving this goal will not, on its own, help business. The One Nation statement was also announced in the midst of a balance of payments situation which is nothing short of a crisis. Frankly, I find it disturbing that the Government has been so excited about the recent trade figures. A current account deficit of $897m for April is hardly something that I would be proud of. It indicated that. we, as a nation, continue to make a loss. Although the boost to our export trade was welcome news, our fate in future months may well depend on the direction taken by the Japanese economy as its slides towards recession, threatening our main.export market. With an annual current account deficit .of at least $14 billion and gross foreign debt now standing at $183 billion, for any economic strategy to be successful it must aim at promoting our export industries and improving the competitiveness of other domestic enterprises. The worse symptom of these fundamental economic weaknesses has to be the nation's unemployment crisis. One in three Australian teenagers is unemployed, while the total unemployment rate stands at a staggering 10.5 per cent. On the Government's own admission, this situation will get worse before it gets better. This is a brief description of the economic backdrop behind the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. It is not a pretty picture. The question one must ask is whether the Prime Minister's statement adequately tackles these problems and puts in place a long term strategy to strengthen the Australian economy, improve standards of living and create new jobs.· I think the evidence speaks for itself. Undoubtedly, the single most important group in oUr economy is the small business sector. Small businesses employ just on half of the private sector work force and contribute some 40 per cent of value adding in this country. Notwithstanding this, the small business sector has suffered most from this Government's economic policy onslaught. . Spiralling costs, a crushing tax regime, an inflexible industrial relations system and drastic cuts in business activity are all consequences of the recession which, we were told by this Prime Minister, we had to have. The Government's One Nation statement was consistent with its poor record in the area of small business. Let us consider the capital gains tax, for instance. The capital gains tax is the single biggest disincentive for small business owners to expand·their operations. It is also responsible for stripping away the incentive and the reward for the years of hard work and effort put in by small business owners. Instead of undertaking major reforms to the capital gains tax, the Government chose merely to tinker around the edges of the system by increasing the tax-free threshold from 20 per cent to 50 per cent for goodwill and from $lm to$2m for the cut-out point. What incentive does this offer a business owner who is thinking about expanding into a bigger premises, of investing in new plant and equipment, of putting better wholesaling and better warehousing facilities in place, or of providing more job opportunities? Absolutely none, I would suggest. Under current arrangements, selling up an existing premises will more than likely result in a capital gains tax assessment which would significantly reduce the level of capital available for re-investment in the expanded operation. On the other hand, allowing a tax-free roll-over of these funds would ensure that the full value of the sales of existing plant and premises could be ploughed into the productive objective of expanding the business enterprise. This is the coalition's policy and it highlights our genuine concern to assist small business owners who are striving to get on with things but have been held back by excessive tax burdens imposed by this Government. Another measure contained in the statement for small business was the deferral of income tax for some companies. However, this deferral has only been necessary because of the Government's previous tax changes, which impacted heavily on the cash flows of small business. The only other policy initiative in the One Nation statement was an increase in the funding for the export enhancement program. In spite of this, the fact remains that benefits. only 700 of the existing 800,000 small businesses will be encouraged to export over the next three-year period. Certainly, some further tax concessions have been announced by the Prime Minister. I applaud any changes which, in particular, will free up the depreciation rules on new capital investment. However, there was no major across the board reduction in small business costs. Honourable members should compare this with the coalition's Fightback package of reforms, which provides a massive $20 billion reduction in business costs. Only last week the House debated changes to the sales tax legislation, introduced in recognition of the problems the existing system causes for small business in particular. Unfortunately, in making these changes the Government was again driven by its own political momentum, not by any overriding desire to set the economy straight. The changes to the sales tax system will not help the small business community as a whole; in fact, by the admission of the Treasurer (Me Dawkins), it will cost them more. The Treasurer stated in his press release on the matter that there would be no overall reduction in tax collected; merely, the source of collections will be shifted. Sure, around 5 per cent of small businesses may be able to cease collecting sales tax, but most small businesses will not have their operating costs reduced as a result of these measures. However, a significant number of small businesses may actually pay more under the Government's plans. Those small businesses-and, in particular, small manufacturerswhich choose to opt out of the sales tax system will no longer receive a sales tax exemption on their inputs or aids to manufacture. Similarly, small firms will now have to pay sales tax on goods leased under a short term rental or hire agreement. According to the Retailers Council of Australia, the Government's new sales tax laws will also impose extra costs on small retailers. The Executive Director of the Council, Me Laurie Eakin, said: The new sales tax system introduces elements of the GST without the offsetting tax and welfare Moreover, new laws will bring some 250,000 new small farmers, who were previously exempt, into the tax system. Let us contrast the Government's sales tax changes to the coalition's Fightback package, which goes one step further by scrapping wholesale sales tax altogether. As such, all small businesses will be freed from the burden of complying with existing cumbersome wholesale sales tax laws. But that is not all. Our strategy also abolishes six other taxes on businesses, including fuel excise, payroll tax and the training levy. Our plans will ensure that all business owners, large and small, save on the cost of their business inputs. For example, under our proposals the price of trucks, utes, vans, office equipment such as phones and faxes, office furniture, fuel, stationery, hand tools and power tools will all be substantially lower. Our plan to introduce a goods and services tax will benefit the business sector even more, because GST paid on business inputs will be fully rebatable. To illustrate, where most Australians will save around 19c a litre on petrol under our plans, businesses will save even more. Because the GST on fuel is rebatable, businesses will save a full 26c on every litre of fuel they use for business purposes. Small businesses will gain a further benefit from the introduction of the GST through an improved cash flow position. While small businesses will be responsible for collecting the GST on their sales, they will need only to send the GST collected, less GST paid on their business inputs, to the Tax Office every two months. This means that businesses will have the use of the GST collected in their business for up to two months. They may choose to leave that money in an interestbearing account, use it as an interest-free or use it to lower their overdraft commitment. This is a major bonus for small business and is one of the reasons why the business community is throwing its support behind our Fightback reforms. I mentioned that the Prime Minister also neglected in his One Nation statement to announce significant reforms in the area of industrial relations. He spoke about the need for workplace bargaining, but his plans have little relevance to the small business sector, despite the significant bearing this issue has on the competitiveness of smaller enterprises. This Government seems to have an open agenda to prevent the very reforms which the small business community so desperately needs. Nowhere is this more evident than with regard to the need for a more flexible industrial relations system. Many businesses are pinned down by the centralised award system and cannot organise their business affairs to achieve the highest degree of productivity possible. Penalty rates, for example, are a significant burden, especially to small businesses in the tourism and hospitality industries. The One Nation statement did nothing to address these problems-unlike the coalition, which will introduce voluntary agreements to allow employers to negotiate wages and conditions which meet the needs of their individual enterprises and which provide genuine incentives for their employees. Further, incentive is provided by our proposed new tax system which enables employees to work overtime without paying a higher rate of tax. This will ensure that employees who want to put in the extra effort can-and, in most cases, double their income without moving up into a higher tax bracket. It is not possible in the time available to me today to detail the full extent of my concerns with the Prime Minister's One Nation statement let alone to provide a comprehensive overview of the coalition's alternatives. However, even in the space of this brief 15 minutes, I can show that it is quite apparent that One Nation fails to tackle the main economic problems confronting this nation. It also fails to address Australia's long term loan needs by implementing a range of comprehensive reforms in areas such as taxation, government spending and industrial relations. The opportunity was there to set the scene for widespread economic restructuring, for reduced taxes, for job growth and for a stronger and more competitive business sector-but instead the Prime Minister chose to play politics.",44
206,Mr BRERETON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In doing so, I add just one more voice to the range of political, economic, business and union commentators who have already endorsed the Government's strategy. That is a very diverse group of people, and I think it says a great deal about the statement and the consultative approach that was adopted by the Prime Minister in developing the statement. It also shows that Australians were really looking for the kind of stimulus that the Government has provided, notwithstanding the very negative views that they hear day after day from the doomsday, do-nothing Opposition in this Parliament. I note with particular interest the glowing comments on the statement that were made by the former President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, who, of course, was speaking in his capacity as Chainnan of the Committee for Melbourne when he said that he could put national interest well above partisan politics. I noticed that in a Canberra TImes report of his backing for the Prime Minister's One Nation statement he said that the economy needed the sort of short term boost provided by the statement and that Melbourne, along with the rest of Australia, would benefit from it. Given Mr Elliott's obvious political leanings, that is pretty rich praise indeed. a pity the Opposition is incapable of adopting a similarly balanced approach. But then again, of course, the Liberal Party that we know today is no longer the party of business. It is quite the opposite; it is the party of New Right intellectuals. It is the party of computer models. They certainly come well before consultation in this new look Liberal Party. Commentators have noted with the release of One Nation and the Opposition's feeble alternative, Fightback, that the ideological differences between the major parties have rarely been greater. What they have failed to note is the vast difference that exists between both sides' approach to policy formulation, to say nothing of the speed and the quality of the output of that policy formulation. Whilst the Government on the one hand prepared its statement after an exhaustive round of community consultations, we saw the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) spending 18 months working on the so-called Murphy model. The policy suggestions which the Government sought from business, unions and community groups, the Leader of the Opposition sought from the right wing economic think-tanks or, should I say, the economic laboratories of Australia. After 18 months of exhaustive programming, the coalition was able to come up with its grand plan, a grand plan indeed-a vision, if you like,.to tax bread and milk. Here was a panacea for the recession: an. inflationary consumption tax that, even under the very best case scenario, would see economic growth at 0.3 per cent-a rate sure to guarantee ongoing high unemployment. Meanwhile, of course, the Keating Government, in partnership with the union movement, business and community groups, was able to come up with a fiscally responsible yet exhaustive package of job creation reforms, and do all of that in the course of a couple of months. The Opposition's response was to race back to the computer to program in its 2,000 or so assumptions and to quantify the cost of each extra job. Opposition members say we cannot afford it, but what they are really saying is that the Government should do nothing at all It is about unemployment. After all, according to the Opposition, the real issue is taxing food; it is taxing clothing. The Government's priorities differ very radically from those of the Opposition. We are the party that believes unemployment is the major issue, the major challenge facing us. That is why the Government has focused on reactivating economic growth through this One Nation statement. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to go back to doing what we do best, to the policies that saw us create 1.7 million jobs in the 1980s-a rate of job growth that was, of course, twice that achieved in the barren Fraser years. Yet those opposite tell us again and again that because our foreign debt increased in the 1980s our policies were wrong. In essence what they are saying is that because Australia's savings performance was inadequate, because Alan Bond and all his cohorts splurged on foreign borrowings, we should not be in the business of creating jobs. Just let me say this: to the Labor Party the unemployed are more than statistical fodder for a computer model; they are people, and they are the people who need the sorts of jobs that One Nation will create. It is indeed a comprehensive approach to job creation, and the One Nation statement certainly leaves Fightback, or should we call it 'Revertback', far in its wake. In place of hollow statements we have the virtues of micro-economic reform: we have proposals for a rail highway, pooled development funds, expanded airports, road programs, increased apprenticeships and accelerated depreciations. They are all proposals with an obvious job creation capacity. We are yet to be told by the Opposition how taxing consumption as opposed to income creates jobs-it says, 'Tax consumption; that will create all the jobs you need'-or how the figure of two million jobs by the end of the decade was arrived at. One suspects it was plucked out of the air by Access Economics when it was completing-what was it? Maybe opposition members can tell us. Was it scenario No. 124 of appendix 5a of the Fightback package? It probably added, I suppose, about another $10,000 to the Opposition parties' bill for all that computer work. A computer may not recommend it, but there is no doubt that an efficient standard gauge railway highway between Brisbane and Perth will provide a great fillip to our national economy. As a policy measure, no other measure sums up the character of One Nation so eloquently: it is about national endeavour; it is about jobs; it is about exports and about building on our strengths. We have recognised the competitive disadvantages that are associated with our vast continent, and we are taking action to overcome them. It is a far cry from the protectionist approach that we have seen from coalition governments in the past right through the 1950s and the 1960s. In the One Nation infrastructure program we see a concerted effort to overcome the disadvantage of distance. It is an infrastructure program which is not only well targeted but also comprehensive. In addition to the rail highway, there is a three-year, $600m road program that even the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has found very difficult to fault. Furthermore, in the form of the tax preferred infrastructure bonds we see a government willing to encourage private sector involvement in replenishing our stock of national infrastructure. It is a recognition of the complementary roles of the private and public sectors, how together they can play out the part of giving a real sense of national purpose. Any sense of purpose, of course, is pretty difficult for the Opposition when all of the policy responsibility is supposedly devolved to the marketplace. The Government's package fosters a genuine sense of national purpose-purpose encapsulated in the title One Nation. It is in no wayan isolationist document. Rather, it is about openness; it is about an internationally competitive Australia where wage rises are determined by our rivals' inflation rates. It is about an Australia which actively encourages investment-domestic and foreign-in the productive areas of the economy. It is also about an Australia which accepts and, indeed, encourages the notion of a mixed economy. Competition is encouraged in electricity generation, in aviation and in finance for the benefit of the whole community. It is not competition borne out of any ideological dogma; it is not some computer model of perfect competition; it is real and beneficial competition. Furthermore, in the package there is an acknowledgment of the cost of economic openness. Some $51m provided for extra funding for the displaced textile workers is in recognition of the human cost of international competition, and it stands again in very marked contrast to the Darwinist theories of the Opposition. In the decision to construct common user air terminals, we see the Government taking the lead in creating the circumstances for adequate competition. It rejects the notion of the hidden hand, of mythical competition. Indeed, one suspects that the hidden hand in Fightback is that of the Australian Taxation Office, the omnipresent Tax Office. It is for no other than ideological reasons that our flat tax colleagues in the Opposition cavil at the path-breaking tax reforms in One Nation. We need not be concerned for once again this places them at odds with the overwhelming sentiment of the business community. Their position is founded in that sterile view of taxation which values simplicity ahead of equity. It is an approach which fails to grasp how tax incentives can be used to encourage national development. If, for social reasons, we apply higher tax rates to cigarettes and to alcohol-as we do-surely it is legitimate to encourage investment through accelerated depreciation. Not so, says the coalition; it says it leads to distortion. One Nation rejects that sort of dogmatic stance and reduces the tax write-off from 20 years to 10 years. It goes further by allowing the depreciation of industrial and tourism buildings to increase to some 4 per cent. In addition to infrastructure bonds, it· allows banks access to partial debt write-offs and debt for equity swaps, which will encourage lending and certainly discourage premature liquidations. The net result of all these changes is to provide more capital for large industrial, resource and tourism developments, an outcome, of course, that a goods' and services tax could simply never deliver. One Nation's innovative approach to tax even extends to the finance industry itself. The new 10 per cent tax rate for offshore banking activities matches that on offer in Singapore and it removes a very real impediment to Australia becoming a major Asia Pacific finance centre. Coupled with the decision to allow foreign banks to open branches in Australia, this landmark reform will see a whole new area of international business opened to Australia. It is a change which builds upon our strengths and it enhances Australia's integration into that Asia Pacific basin. In much the same way, increased promotional funding for the Australian Tourist Commission and the extension of the Austrade network achieve the same end. The Government has gone further and acknowledged that many of our assets have not been fully exploited. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the area of ideas. The rigid separation of commerce and research has seen too many innovations lost to this country. Invariably the problem has been a lack of venture capital, a reality addressed in this One Nation statement through the setting up of pooled development funds. Now we look to a future in which Australian brainpower is translated into ongoing exports rather than one-off payments for patent rights. This reform is one that highlights our greatest asset, the Australian people. Tragicaleffects ly it is an asset which is not being fully tapped at present. For that reason the One Nation statement increases to 350,000 people the number of places that will be involved in our labour market training programs. It also boosts apprentice and trainee subsidies to create 40,000 opportunities for young people. In One Nation's proposal for a national system of technical and further education, we see a truly landmark proposal. The Government is proud of its record in encouraging two out of three students to finish high school and boosting university places by 120,000 in these past four years. There is, of course, that third element to the education troika, and that is TAFE. In the One Nation statement and in the Prime Minister's most recent public comments, we have seen articulated a truly grand plan for a national TAPE, funded to' the tune of '$720m over the next three years. With or without the cooperation of the States, it will herald a new era for TAPE, a new era in which it will become a high status vocational training system, educating and training our young people. With the upgrading of TAPE, a new generation will be provided with secure and exciting futures. The contrast with the Opposition, which would have young people's futures determined by their parents' incomes, could simply not be greater. In its view, if one cannot afford full university fees, so much bad luck. The One Nation statement is more than just a package of reforms; it is an integrated plan for a new decade. First and foremost it recognises that the immediate objective is to get the economy moving. It has sought to do so with $300m in one-off payments to families, an immediate cut in sales tax on new vehicles and tax deferral for small business. Furthermore, palliatives for particularly hard-hit groups such as farmers, textile workers and the unemployed have been included in a way which underlines the Government's commitment to easing the plight of these hard-hit groups. The cut to sales tax on cars is particularly illuminating. There we see the distributional of Fightback and One Nation.· From One Nation we see $800 cut from the price of a family sedan, such as a Falcon, a Commodore or a Magna. What do we see from Fightback? We see the exact opposite. We see the price of Commodores going up and the price of Corvettes coming down-rejoicing in Wentworth, but plenty of misery in Werriwa. It gives honourable members a very good idea of the priorities of those sitting opposite. Our sales tax cut is fair, but like the family payment it is a short-run aspect of a long term plan-a plan for national development; a plan that catalyses our 1980s success in becoming a more competitive, outward-looking society. It is a plan about an integrated society, not a greedy, individualistic society. Cooperation over division: in essence, a vision beyond the realms of a computer model. I commend the One Nation statement to the House.",51
207,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I am indebted to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), because the need to provide for him an opportunity to make his first speech has, brought on for debate in this House the One Nation statement; otherwise it may have disappeared from the Notice Paper without trace. There has been a delicious irony about parliamentary debates in this place in the past few weeks. The Government-and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at Question Time--'has claimed that Fightback is dead, but has used every opportunity to debate it rather than One Nation. I am also indebted to the honourable member for Wills for mentioning two nations. It was Disraeli, of course, who wrote: I was told that the Privileged and the People fonned two nations. That is what we see happening in Australia today. As has been pointed out, a decade ago the top one per cent of earners in this country earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent, whereas, in recent years, the top one per cent now earn as much as the bottom 21 per cent. The honourable member for Wills referred to the high cost of reining in inflation: the cost of one million unemployed Australians; towards the cost of 680,000 children growing up in leveraging homes where neither parent has cost of 238,000 Australian children in sole parent families outside the work force. These stabilise orcosts are not just statistics. They are the costs that hundreds of thousands of Australian men, women and children are experiencing in a personal way in their lives as I speak. But there is also another cost, the cost of $150 billion worth of foreign debt, the equivalent of $8,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. The honourable member for' Kingsford Smith (Mr Brereton) said proudly in his contribution to the debate that the Government had created 1.7 million jobs-I.7 million jobs created at a cost of the equivalent of some $70,000 per job. Of course, the jobs have gone, but the foreign debt has not, and we are facing a situation where it is unlikely to in the near future. So what does One Nation have to offer Australia in this situation? There was not one mention of our foreign debt in the Prime Minister's One Nation ,speech in parliament. I recall that when he became Treasurer in 1984 the foreign debt was $27.9 billion. Today, it is $150 billion. Even in 1988, in his Budget Speech, Mr Keating said: Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. Of course, foreign debt climbed then to $92.8 billion. While Mr Keating may have been embarrassed to mention to the Australian people the outcome of his policies, hidden away in the background statement is an acknowledgment of the problem. It states: High levels of external debt leave us more exposed to external developments, such as slowing world growth and falls in commodity prices, that could set in train processes leading to sharp reductions in national wealth and living standards. Yet based on the statement, the ratio of foreign debt to gross domestic product will increase by 4 per cent, that is, adding another $30 billion to our indebtedness. At the current rate Australia's foreign debt will exceed 50 per cent of our gross domestic product before the year 2000. In fact, the best that the One Nation statement can promise is: As the ratio of debt to equity financing returns levels which existed prior to the excessive in the late 1980's, the net external debt a job; and the to GDP ratio couldand I emphasise the word 'could'; it could . decline slowly. That is part of the problem to which Australia 'has been brought under this Government. Will we eventually repudiate the foreign debt, as the Prime Minister's great hero Jack Lang proposed in the Depression? In fact, the balance comparisons with Lang are interesting. Edna Carew's biography of the Prime Of Minister she records that to the young Keating, Jack Lang was a living Labor legend. She wrote: In the 1960s Keating was visiting Jack Lang every week on Tuesdays and sometimes on Fridays as well, for hour-long lunch time sessions during which he took notesThis was Jack Lang, the man about whom his own Party said in 1943 when he was expelled: The Labor Movement cannot live unless it receives loyalty from its members, and we now call upon all members to assist in securing Labor's solidarity to ensure that never again will the Movement place the interests of one man, and the family of his friends, before the common good. Perhaps history repeats itself. It is a pity that all that the Prime Minister has seemed to pick up from Jack Lang is his propensity to wreck and to destroy and possibly to hate. Even the late Professor Manning Clark was scathing in his judgment of Lang. Notwithstanding slogans such as 'Lang is greater than Lenin', Manning Clark concluded: Of policy or political doctrine, or plans for the future of society, the man was completely bankrupt. 'The man', the present Prime Minister's great political hero, concludes Manning Clark, 'was completely bankrupt'. History may well judge his pupil to be the same. Indeed, when he falls from grace, and his Party falls with him, there may be many on the other side of the House who will not only judge him to be the same but will judge him, this usurper, to be a traitor to his own class. But incredibly the Prime Minister has not followed the advice of his mentor, Jack Lang. Consider what Lang said in his speech in the House to the 1948 Budget, towards the end of his political career as the honourable member for Reid. I quote: The Government still believes that it can stop a depression by arranging unlimited public works programmes. That is a delusion. Public works must bear a proper relation to production. If every one is digging ditches for the Government, how are the people going to be fed? Instead of maintaining a huge centralized any of bureaucrats in Canberra, and elsewhere, to think up means of impeding production, the Government should restore a proper between management and production, with In . the emphasis on production. course, the Prime Minister did not always believe in unlimited public works programs. I quote him from the Age newspaper of 6 September 1990: There is no prospect of massive increases in public spending, full stop. ... If you're savings-poor you can't have it-like the people who say we've got to have a super highway from here to there. We've got poor. People here believe they can have brand new roads, buildings, brand new everything-well they can't. What has happened in the last six months? and What is in the One Nation statement, where it seems that brand new roads and brand new railways and this public works spending program are suddenly the answer to the nation's ills? But let me return to Jack Lang. He said: That is the first step. The next step is to guarantee to workers in industry a greater share in what they produce, and to give them an incentive to produce more. The present policy of the Government is directed towards the achievement of neither of these ends. The Government's policy is to rob the workers of the fruits of their labour by taxation. And what has happened in the last decade under this Government? Through bracket creep we now have average workers paying something like 38c in the dollar, plus Medicare. The total tax on individuals has almost doubled from $23 billion in 1982-83 to $51 billion in 1989-90. Indirect tax, Labor's hidden consumption tax, has trebled under Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating from $3.5 billion to $10.7 billion-Labor's hidden tax. Jack Lang went on: It regards taxation as a method of reducing the consumption and demand for goods. By keeping taxation high, it believes that it can share available goods on an equitable basis. It forgets that in the process it is killing the incentive to produce. What incentive is there, under the present policy, for a worker to produce more? The harder he toils, the more he contributes to the Commissioner of Taxation. That is why we have the week-end black market in labour. In order to provide their families with a few extra comforts, some workers have been forced to resort to evasion, so that the genuine employer is at a disadvantage, and a premium is placed on dishonesty. This proves once again that no law or economic system can prevail, unless it is founded on justice, and the workers do not regard the present taxation system as just. The workers in industry are not the only ones who have had their strikes. The bosses have also been on strike. There is a common saying throughout Australia: ""What is the use of working harder than you have to? It only goes to Chilley"". One could say today that it only goes to Keating. It might be 40 years later, but the message has not changed much. Lang concludes: So, the boss plays golf. He goes for long vacations. He cannot afford it today, if he still has a business. I continue: Instead of trying to produce more, he is satisfied with a minimum of production that will provide him with a maximum return under the present taxation system. The worker's psychological reaction is the same. No matter how hard he works, he is no closer to that new suit at the end of the week. All his thinking is in terms of tax stamps. Just as well PAYE earners today, and others, do not have to use tax stamps for direct and indirect taxation. If they did, they would appreciate the degree to which tax has risen in the last 10 years. Lang's conclusion could equally apply to the Government's policy. I quote: The people want to know what this Government proposes to do . . . The paltry concessions contained in the budget are not a policy. They are about as useful as putty to a sinking ship. One could say the same about the One Nation statement. Its concessions are about as useful as putty to a sinking ship. Jack Lang, the Prime Minister's mentor, said on another occasion: We do not want promises of a golden age. We want reality. Far from one nation, this Government. is creating two nations-two nations, as Disraeli said: ... between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones or inhabitants of different planets . . . the rich and the poor. The events of Los Angeles, although in another country, remind us of the consequences which we may suffer if we continue with policies which result in social and personal dislocation. That will not create one nation; it will continue the path ever downwards to two nations.",55
208,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"l am very pleased to support the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The statement represents a positive economic view put forward by the Government in, I think, true Labor traditions. It provides for a $2.3 billion boost to the economy when it needs it most. I look back on the last decade, when this Government has uniquely returned surplus Budgets during periods in the 1980s when in fact there was a lot of money in the Australian economy-some would argue, with good cause, more money in the Australian economy than some people knew what to do with. During that time when the private sector was particularly buoyant the Government reduced its expenditure: the Government reduced its outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. That is no longer the case: the private sector is no longer buoyant as it was throughout that period of the 1980s and the Government's decision in the One Nation statement to inject $2.3 billion into the economy is a timely and sensible boost to encourage activity and employment and to get Australia moving again. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who has just spoken, referred to a couple of areas of the economy where he claimed some ascendancy on the part of the Opposition and its performance in government. I think we might dispense with those at the outset and start with his favourite, and that of the Opposition, which is the question of the overseas debt. I quote from an article by a Queensland financial adviser who is well read in Queensland, Mr Austin Donnelly. In an article in the Sunday Mail he stated: . . . though the total overseas debt is now higher, the rate at which it grew, namely 38 percent when they were in power'they' being the Liberal-National partiesis considerably higher than the rate of growth of 28 percent since 1982. Austin Donnelly went on to say: The prize for the highest inflation and worse balance of payments figure, relative to the the economy, has been held by the coalition parties since the early 1950s. Honourable members opposite can play with the figures and talk about the magnitude of the foreign debt but the facts are that, as a proportion of the economy, the foreign debt is not as big as it was when they ran this country. The growth of the foreign debt under Labor has not been as great as it was when the Liberal Party ran this country. Opposition members might have a closer look at the facts before deciding to parade foreign debt as a virtue in terms of their economic record. Looking at the other indicators, foreign debt is probably the best one for them to use because they cannot construe the inflation figures in any way, shape or form to make themselves look good. When the last Liberal Government came to office it was confronted with an inflation rate of 13 per cent. After much hard work and seven years of pain on the part of Australians it managed to whittle that 13 per cent down to 11.2 per cent-a massive 1.8 per cent reduction in inflation I In the last seven years of this Government we have reduced inflation from 11.2 per cent to something around 2 per cent. The record speaks for itself. The doozey of them all-and I guess honourable members opposite like to talk about foreig- debt because the other indicators are not too flash in terms of Liberal records-is that not only did they manage to have inflation in double digits but also they managed to have unemployment in double digits at the same time. That is a record that not many governments in the OECD have been able to accomplish. There have been some governments that have had double digit unemployment or double digit inflation but there are very few in postwar OECD history that have been able to get them both together. However, the Liberal Party and the National Party were able to achieve double digit inflation and double digit unemployment at the same time. It is a record which I would have thought honourable members opposite would have wanted to hide from rather than shed light on. In contrast to that sort of performance, this size of Government has embarked upon a program of carefully targeted infrastructure payments that are designed to create jobs in the short term and to improve the structural efficiency of our industries in the long term. I might add that this stands in stark contrast, again, to the proposals in Fightback. Whilst we are suggesting and promoting a $2.3 billion increase in government outlays, the Opposition wants to cut current government outlays by $10 billion. The people in the street understand what that $10 billion cut will do to their livelihood and welfare. As time goes by between now and the next election they will understand that even more. I might add, while talking about macro questions, that those opposite cannot lay too much claim to fame when it comes to balancing the Budget. Ever since Bob Menzies got the idea of forming the Liberal Party, not once has the Liberal Party returned a surplus Budget. Every single Budget that every Liberal Party· Government introduced since Bob Menzies formed a government had a deficit. Its record of financial management is a poor one. Mr Chaney-You always told us to spend more.",57
209,Mr BEVIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The shadow Minister at the table seems to be indicating that, in an effort to correct this, we should not take a balanced Budget view but cut $10 billion from the Budget and see where that takes it. The people of Australia know where that $10 billion cut will take them. It will take them down a road of reduced living standards and they will not cop it. There are a number of major infrastructure programs that were announced in the One Nation statement that deserve recognition. The rail upgrade, which has been given a good deal of prominence, is long overdue. It is something of a sad commentary on Australian historical development and political life that nearly 100 years after our nationhood we still do not have a standard gauge rail link between all our capital cities. The One Nation statement puts an end to that. It will see an upgrade in the Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne line, which is to be modernised. I am very pleased to say, as the member for Brisbane, that it will also see the development of a Brisbane-Gold Coast railway line-an area of the country with one of the fastest growth rates of any-and it will see the standard gauge rail link to the port of Brisbane from the Acacia Ridge rail terminus. Brisbane stands to gain substantially from the improvements in the rail system that are part of the One Nation statement. For the first time in our history we will have the opportunity for genuine competition between the major ports· of our country, linked by a standard gauge rail system. Sydney; Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Fremantle are all major ports. All will be linked under this program by a standard gauge rail and all will be able to compete international trade. An additional $600m in the One Nation statement over and above current spending on roads will go towards improving roads around this country prior to June 1994. I am pleased to note that Brisbane again stands to gain from some of that funding with the accelerated development of the ring road around the City of Brisbane. Another important area mentioned in the One Nation statement is the aviation industry. Much has been said in this place about the deregulation and· reform process that this Government has embarked upon which has delivered to the public a more efficient, cheaper and better aviation industry than was the case under the two airlines policy-a two airlines pollcy that stood unchallenged by Opposition throughout its years in government. The One Nation statement, as the name implies, takes a national approach to the problems confronting Australia and to the problems confronting key industries. I wish mention two of those important areas-power and post-compulsory education and training. For the first time this country will have a national grid corporation. To lines drawn on maps by public servants in England in the last century should determine the basis upon which electricity generation and distribution should be maintained is a nonsense that has long since outlived any usefulness it may have had. As part of the One Nation statement, the Labor Government will be pursuing with the States a national grid corporation which will include the separation of the power generation functions from the distribution network. I am happy to say that it has already met with considerable success. For the first time in our history, no matter where they live, Australians will be able to access electricity supplies on a competitive basis, thus ending the existing monopolies that have brought with them inefficiencies that inevitably occur in public monopolies of this sort. In the area of education I am particularly pleased with the Government's commitment to improving funding and services for training throughout the country. Quite frankly, techfor nical and further education, TAPE, has not performed for the good of this nation as best it can or as much as this nation requires. The One Nation statement provides a commitment to funding of unprecedented proportions for the TAPE sector, a commitment by a Labor government to ensure that training is elevated to a level in line with the tertiary funding which has been under Commonwealth jurisdiction for some time now. It is long overdue. It is a matter of some regret that the States have adopted in some cases a fairly parochial and unrealistic view of this question. It is high time that the State governments, including my own, considered the benefits to the people they serve-Australian citizens all of them-and ensured that the announcements the in the One Nation statement to improve TAPE flow through to where it matters: to the people who need the training, the young people who have left school and, increasingly importantly, those people who are re-entering the work force or who, having lost a job, are to retraining for other occupations. That sort of retraining and re-entry opportunity can be facilitated only by the injection of funds and development that the One Nation statement suggest that the offers to TAPE. The sooner the States recognise that and support the Commonwealth Government's initiative, the better. I must add that I have been very pleased to note in the past couple of days the public statements of my own union, the Queensland Teachers Union, in supporting the Commonwealth Government in this matter and urging the Queensland Government to come on board. I congratulate my colleagues in the Queensland Teachers Union, who have adopted a very progressive and positive attitude in this matter. There is a range of issues in the One Nation statement that provides assistance to business and individuals. I wish to mention, in summary form, only a small number of those. There are dramatic changes to the depreciation schedules applying to companies, which will provide an incentive and assistance to companies seeking to invest further in capital acquisitions. There are special depreciation provisions for the tourist industry, an initiative that will benefit my State of Queensland probably more than any other. So it should. Queensland is the best State in which to live, and it is no wonder that people want to visit Queensland for their holidays. I am very pleased to see these incentives provided to the tourist industry, which I am sure will be grasped by that industry in my State; Importantly, there is the creation of pooled development funds for small business. This is a critical point. I wish I had more time to about the need for funds of the small business sector. I congratulate the Government on that initiative. The sooner those funds are set up and the sooner small business is able to access them, the better. It isa long overdue initiative. There is a range of initiatives for families and for individuals, such as the restructuring of the tax scales which has been referred to and the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy, which provides all Australians with some hope of a decent retirement. All those things will assist individuals: the people of my electorate, the people throughout all of our electorates. They are important initiatives which this Government can be justly proud oL I am pleased to support the Prime Minister's statement and endorse the comments which other members on this side have made.",58
210,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"From listening to what the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) had to say in supporting the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and in his reference to small business needing a boost, I think he has really lost touch with the situation. There is absolutely nothing in the One Nation statement that will give anything positive or any hope to small business; large business or the almost one million unemployed. All I can say to the honourable member for Brisbane is that those people will have to wait until we come to power to be given any hope. Today's economic figures are further testimony to the fraudulent claims by the honourable member for Brisbane. In fact, today's national accounts figures confirm that the figures put forward by the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement were drawn up on the back of an envelope. He relies very heavily on the assumption that this nation's growth rate will be 4.7 per cent. Today's figures indicate that the growth rate for the coming 12 months is nowhere near 4.7 per cent. It is not even going in that direction. It is interesting that the Prime Minister said . at Question Time today that things are looking good, that we have a 3 per cent talk growth rate in wages and a 2 per cent growth rate in productivity. I would have thought that, with productivity growth running behind the increase in wage rates, we would be becoming less competitive internationally rather than more competitive. I would not take any comfort from those figures if I were the Prime. Minister. He said our imports are increasing but, more importantly, our exports are growing. Only last week the Australian beef producers indicated that they would have to put a voluntary restraint on beef entering the American market. Beef forms a very important part of our export sector, accounting for $2m to $3m annually. I cannot see how we will have growth in our exports in the next six to. nine months while we have in some cases to restrict our exports, beef being one very good example. The Prime Minister has led this great nation down the path of financial ruin. The One Nation statement is recognised by 1\11 Australians for what it is: a flimsy effort to disguise the mistakes and inefficiencies of almost a decade of Labor Party rule. In recognition that the February economic statement solved none of Australia's problems, the Prime Minister snubbed Caucus, and the Cabinet for that matter, by appearing on the nine network's Sunday program to dump traditional Labor Party policy. I refer to one part of the program which dealt with pay television. The policy bombshell announced on the Sunday program by the Prime Minister told us all that he was uncomfortable about pay television being delivered exclusively by satellite, yet the Government has already signed a contract with Optus Communications, giving the second carrier an exclusive right to deliver pay television services by satellite for several years. The deal was stitched up to sweeten the $800m purchase of a Government-owned satellite company, Aussat, by Optus late last year. In other words, we really cannot trust the Government's words or its actions. I believe the pay television debate has overlooked a significant section of the community: those residents living in regional and rural Australia. Given that the satellite is the most likely to transmit pay television as it is the most accessible service to date, there will be many regional communities outside the proposed satellite footprint. Authorities from Optus Communications say that the high performance beam would cover about 90 per cent of households from Townsville along the eastern seaboard to Adelaide, and about 200 kilometres inland, including an area around Perth. What of the remaining 10 per cent of households predominantly situated in rural and regional Australia? What is the Government doing to ensure that all Australians have access to pay television, should they wish to subscribe? I put a question on notice to this effect to the relevant Minister. I very much look forward to his response because it is a very important part of this whole debate. Unfortunately that 10 per cent of households-those residents living in regional and rural Australia-draw the short stJ;aw time and again when it comes to the provision of services such as pay television. What did the One Nation statement do to promote regional and rural development? It did absolutely nothing. Regional and rural communities must function with inadequate communication, education, health and transport services. The employment crisis in the bush is worsening as the Labor Government pursues its policies of eliminating farmers and, by so doing, many rural communities. Welfare measures for rural communities are totally inadequate. The anti-dumping legislation which this Government has promoted is totally ineffective. The industrial relations policy on the other side of the House does not put any incentive back into the workplace-in fact, it is not even on the Government's agenda. The Labor Government offers rural and regional Australians no reprieve from the hardships they are currently suffering. The One Nation statement paid little attention to rural and regional Australia. On the other hand, a coalition government would inject in excess of $10m into rural and remote health care. We would ensure that health services in rural and remote Australia are far more service diverse and accessible. Very importantly, women and children living in rural areas are particularly disadvantaged by the lack of health services. Upon coming to government, the coalition will fund the provision and staffing of mobile breast cancer screening units to visit rural and remote areas around Australia. Some units are located along the c.oastal strip, but none are currently located in rural and regional Australia outside the major metropolitan areas. The mobile units would be equipped with devices to measure bone density in order to identify and arrest the crippling bone thinning disease, osteoporosis, which is recognised as a major problem· in postmenopausal women. What did the One Nation statement have to say about rural health? Neither of these potentially life saving screening options would otherwise be readily available to women in isolated communities. In further recognition of the needs of rural residents, the coalition will actively campaign to encourage more doctors to practice in isolated areas. There is presently a surplus of doctors practising in the major cities, while country areas are crying out for better representation. We will address this discrepanpaying cy by offering isolated practitioners differential Medicare rebates. This will be considered in consultation with the medical profession. The coalition will establish a remote area nursing training scheme to provide support for the valuable work carried out by remote area nurses. We will allow retail phannaCies to act as agents for Medicare, thus significantly improving access to Medicare services for those living in regional and rural communities. What has the Government done about giving people more access to Medicare agencies? It has closed at least 13 Medicare offices, mainly in country areas, thereby forcing many rural residents to claim by mail and wait, often for many weeks, for the rebate to be paid. The coalition parties will ensure that and remote Australians have equitable access to health care services. In contrast, the Prime Minister's One Nation statement-the vision that he has for Australia for the rest of this decade-made no mention of that. There was also no mention of zone tax rebates. A coalition government would provide financial incentives once again to attract people beyond the urban sprawl. Taxation zone rebates will be increased by 25 per cent and the boundaries to which they apply will be revised so as to be of value to rural Australians. Current zone tax rebate provisions are worthless to regional and remote communities. Zone allowances provide a tax rebate for rural residents who are disadvantaged by high costs of living and the lack of amenities and services. Today's Courier-Mail shows that residents living in far north and north-west Queensland are paying an average 0(20 per cent more for groceries than Brisbane consumers. It is a shame that the honourable member for Brisbane is not still in the chamber. The headline of the Courier-Mail today states, 'Big grocery mark-up hits country families'. I would like to record in Hansard a couple of the comments made in that headline article. It states: In central-west Queensland, where unemployment is at the highest level-13.3 percent-shoppers are 15 percent more for basic groceries. The Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association executive director, Mr Ian Baldock, said last night freight costs contributed significantly to shelf prices in many areas. ""When you get further north and west there is a much higher freight cost. These cost disadvantages, coupled with the isolation factor and a lack of services and amenities, lend weight to the argument that zone tax rebates must be revised. Single residents living in remote townships throughout Australia-such as Bourke in western New South Wales, Leonora in Western Australia, and Woomera in South Australia-are eligible for a mere $45 tax rebate. per year. In comparison, a single person living in Darwin will receive a rebate of $270 per year. Quite clearly, there is an anomaly. One area is a capital city-and I do rural not say that people in Darwin should not receive a zone tax rebate-with international jet routes, while the others are remote isolated townships. The coalition parties are committed to revising out-of-date zonal boundaries and increasing allowances to those communities where the need is greatest. It is suggested in the Courier-Mail article that freight costs contribute significantly to the shelf prices in many areas. I know this to be the case. Where does the Government's One Nation statement address the problems of increased costs in regional and rural communities? It does not address them. On the other hand, the coalition will abolish one of the major reasons for those increased costs: fuel excise, which is paid on petroleum, diesel and avgas. We will ensure that businesses pay 26c per litre less for their fuel. This is a major cost and a major reason why the prices of basic groceries are higher outside the urban areas, as the article in today's Courier Mail suggests. This significant reduction in fuel costs, coupled with the abolition of wholesale sales tax on vehicles and spare parts, will ensure that freight rates across Australia are markedly cheaper. In fact, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, petroleum products excise, customs duties and the training guarantee levy will ensure that businesses in regional and rural Australia are put on the most competitive footing than at any time in our nation's history. The coalition parties are committed to providing cheaper goods and services to regional Australia through a more equitable taxation system. By contrast, the Labor Government proposes no such reform, ensuring that the gap between metropolitan and rural Australia widens, thereby forcing people from the land and from rural communities. This .is very strongly supported by the headline article in today's Courier-Mail. The Prime Minister's One Nation statement was a miserable failure. He has failed to avert the unemployment crisis; he has failed to address the iniquitous tax regime which exists today; he has failed to implement industrial relations reform which will put incentive back into the workplace; and he has failed to solve the country's debt crisis. Most importantly, he has failed each and every Australian.",60
211,Mr MARTIN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Macarthur-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade) (6.09 p.m.)-Contrary to the views being expressed by those honourable members opposite, the Government is of the view that the One Nation statement has made a considerable contribution to alleviating the economic difficulties facing this nation at the present time. In my contribution tonight I wish to make some general comments, but I also wish to refer specifically to the Illawarra region-that great industrial heartland of Australia which I have the honour to represent. It is important that we understand something of the economic environment of the Illawarra, so that we can appreciate that there were some benefits for our region in the One Nation statement. But from that understanding we can also make a special plea for additional assistance for a very depressed part of Australia, which I hope is going to be forthcoming in the Budget. It is an unfortunate fact that in 1983 some 23,000 people were employed directly in the steel industry in the Illawarra. That figure is now 7,800. It is an unfortunate fact that some 3,500 coal mining jobs have also been lost in that period since 1983, all in the name of economic restructuring. Much of it came about because of the steel industry plan. But rather than be critical of that, had it not been for the steel industry plan which this Government put in place, I would not be here speaking about a steel industry in the Illawarra or in Australia, because there simply would not be one. The difficulty associated with restructuring-and BHP's decision to put large sums of money into bringing into the steel industry much needed capital expenditureunfortunately has meant that quite a number of people have been displaced when they still have a great deal to offer the work force. Unfortunately, what is required in the lllawarra is new industry to soak up this large pool of skilled unemployed which presently exists in our local area. What also needs to be pointed out to people in the Illawarra, and indeed to this Government, is that, whilst unemployment statistics indicate that the unemployment level in respect of our region is unacceptably high and something desperately needs to be done, it is not in the realm of some of the figures that have 'been bandied about, particularly by Opposition spokesmen such as Liberal Senator Michael Baume. I quickly refer to one or two examples. In the Wollongong statistical district as at April 1992 the unemployment rate for those 15 years and over is 14.2 per cent. Yes, the rate is higher than the national average, but it is nowhere near the 20 per cent that Senator Baume and some others have been quoting in recent times. The underlying fact is that the trend is an improvement in those regional unemployment statistics. In fact, in January 1992, it was 16.9 per cent; February 1992, 17.9 per cent; March 1992, 15.4 per cent; and, as I have said, at April of this year, 14.2 per cent. So the underlying trend is somewhat improving, but we cannot be complacent. We cannot simply say that that is good enough and what we have done to date is good enough; it is not. Many of us have been speaking out and making suggestions as to how improvements may be made. It is in that respect that the One Nation statement makes a contribution to the local area. In respect of the taxation and small business measures that were announced in the One Nation statement, let me say that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), got it all wrong. There were three very important initiatives in the One Nation statement relevant to small business. Small business is a major employer within the Illawarra region, just as it is right around Australia. In the capital gains concessions, the development investment allowances and, of course, in the accelerated depreciation allowances, clearly some needs have been addressed by the Government, particularly in response to small business associations. Many of those people in small business in the Illawarra, with whom I converse regularly so that I do get an appreciation and an understanding of their concerns, believe that the Government has tackled one of the most important issues associated with small business. They are not satisfied, but then again people never are. They would like it to go a step further. But at least the Government has taken some courageous decisions so that those in the small business sector can feel secure in the knowledge that they will be able to make some real gains. When we couple the underlying trends associated with the present interest rate regimes-where we have seen bill rates at the lowest that they have been for many years and where we have at last seen some competition entered into with the banks so that business interest rates. that are on are very competitive-with the underlying rates of inflation of about 1.6 per cent at the present time, we can see that the macroeconomic environment has been set for a sustained econoinic recovery, particularly in an industrial area such as the Illawarra. We now need confidence as well. I am suggesting to those people of the Illawarra, as I have said in the last several months, that they embrace these changes that have been brought about; embrace the fact that interest rates are now competitive; embrace the fact that we have a very good inflation rate; and embrace the fact that the Government has put in place incentive for business and start to employ people again. We have a thriving tourism industry in the Illawarra region; we have a thriving commercial sector in the Illawarra region. Now let us see the business people embrace a little bit of confidence and start to employ people once again. The One Nation statement was also good news for the families of the IIlawarra. On 2 April, in line with the commitment given by this Government and to particularly target assistance to those most in need, the Government brought forward a one-off family allowance payment. In terms of those ·13,000odd families in my present electorate, that was translated into a $3.579m pay-out on that date to assist with things like clothing and shoes and to make contributions to school fees and the like for families most in needthe battlers of the Illawarra. When we take it across the entire IlIawarra region, in the City of Wollongong, the municipality of Shellharbour and so on, we find that in excess of $5m was expended through the Government in that particular relief package for those most in need during the difficult economic circumstances. As I say, that was something which could then be expended in the region, expended to the tune of $5m-plus, again bringing some relief to those small businesses which were looking for that confidence boost. In the One Nation statement we also saw a commitment by this Government to education and training opportunities. How often have we heard people say that the future of our great offer nation lies in our children? How often have we heard people stand up in this place and call for more money to be expended in the realms of TAFE education, university education and so on? In fact, in this One Nation statement we saw an additional $720m for TAFE places; we saw the creation of an extra 9,000 first year apprenticeship places; we saw an extra 10,000 places in the Australian traineeship scheme; and we saw incentives for employers to retain some 7,000 apprentices presently at risk of retrenchment. If that is not a commitment of a Labor government to an area which is in need, I do not know what is. I think that in a region like ours we could expect our fair share of that particular cake which was unveiled in the One Nation statement. The local members who represent the Illawarra area have been arguing strongly to ensure that that happens. We have seen it translated into more money for Skillshare projects and the apprentices that are at risk. Apprentices have come to see me because unfortunately they found themselves not able to sustain employment because of economic circumstances in Wollongong; yet they have been found other opportunities because the Government put in place that support mechanism. ' At this juncture, let me inject one note of disquiet about the One Nation statement. I go particularly to the question of infrastructure. Some two years ago this Government created, in the Illawarra, the Illawarra Regional Consultative Council. That Council was a body drawn from the local community, levels of government, the trade union movement, employers and community representatives, to put together a regional development strategy. The document which was produced is the Illawarra Regional Development Strategy. Out of that document came a series of proposals to get the Illawarra moving. I am sad to report to the House that, tunately, we have not at this. stage been successful in convincing the Government, indeed even part of its infrastructure project, that some of those proposals need funding. I therefore tonight make a plea to this Government, during the Budget process which is under 'way at the present time, to go back and look at what that document contains. It contains not a wish list, but real projectsthings like a dry dock and shipbuilding facility at Port Kembla, which is estimated to provide employment for over 2,000 people. I had the opportunity to lead a delegaUon of the principals to speak to some Cabinet Ministers some weeks ago. Everyone is enthusiastic about it; but we need more than enthusiasm. We need the commitment of funds so that a major feasibility study can be done. The relocation of the Navy's hydrographic unit from North - Sydney is on the cards at the moment. Wollongong has put in a bid. Two hundred jobs could be created and a new building could be constructed to again give some impetus to the building industry in the Illawarra. We need that. I have been fighting a battle on that with my ministerial colleagues which has not been lost, on which, I hope, they will see some reason. Another project is the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link. If ever there was a project which could link into the Government's proposals for rail to get from' the southern line to the port of Port Kembla to open up the opportunities for our port and the city of Wollongong to expand, thi- is it. In the past, it has been based on an assessment that some 19 million tonnes per arinum of coal from the western coalfields would be needed to make it economically viable. That is not so. Only about 9 million tonnes per annum was needed to make that line viable. In excess of 11 million tonnes is carried on the railway lines at the moment where they go from the western coalfields into Sydney and down the Illawarra line to the Port Kembla coal loader. I make the plea: overturn the decision that was made by the Greiner Government in coming to power to stop the MaldonDumbarton rail link. Our Government must give a commitment to look at this matter unforagain and to ensure that funding is made available so that the rail link can be completed. This rail link is not only for the haulage of coal, but also for the carriage of rural produce which comes from south western New South Wales and which would come through and be exported through the port of Port Kembla. Caloola Pass, a major road link which my colleague'the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has often spoken about in this place, again is necessary- The feasibility study, at a cost of $70,000, has just been handed to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). I understand that it indicates it is a goer. It needs to be more than a goer. It needs to be funded by this Government and it needs to be funded now. I am aware that, under the proposals for next year, we are going to untie a lot of the grants for road funding to the States. Before we do that, I would like to see an allocation of those funds to this road project to give job opportunities in the construction phase and, importantly, ongoing economic benefit. It is not simply a matter of building something for a short term gain; it is to build up the economic infrastructure of the Illawarra. Finally, a major project with which I have been very closely associated in recent times, has been the development of a telecommunications industry in association with the University of Wollongong, particularly its Campus East proposal. The proposal for funding through cooperative research centres is one way to go. I hope the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) sees his way clear to support an. application which is going forward. What we need to see are projects such as this that will have spin offs for the region, major advantages to our region, exports and jobs created locally, which will have a great contribution to our economic well-being. It is more than anecdotal evidence that the Illawarra's economy is improving, but it still needs that assistance which I have outlined. As far as I can see, as part of this Budget process which is under way now within our Goverilment, all of these projects which have been tested through time and are supported even by the State governments and the Illawarra Economic Development Council need to be supported with government funding. We in the Illawarra make this cry for assistance. We recognise that we are the important industrial heart of Australia. We realise that we make a contribution to Australia's economic well-being. We realise that we have received a great deal over the years. But, at present, we ask again for the Government to look seriously at our particular needs, our regional unemployment needs and to do something positive. The One Nation statement in its entirety is an excellent document. We need, however, to see some regional offshoots from that and we need to see them come forward in the Budget. I certainly commend the document as it has been put together. In terms of macro and national effects, it is outstanding. But I again repeat that regional initiatives are also (TIme expired)",63
212,Mr CHARLES,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"La Trobe) (6.24 p.m.)Honest to goodness, that was a preselection speech, was it not? It was a pork-barrelling set of words put together in an effort to retain the seat of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) in New South Wales. The honourable member for Macarthur just gave it all to us, did he not? It seems to me that that really is the essence of the One Nation statement. It is one massive pork-barrelling exercise by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is in desperate trouble to try to win the support of the Australian people. Last week in this place we saw a great number of important Bills-Bills which affect literally hundreds of thousands· of Australians-rammed through this House under guillotine without the opportunity for proper debate or proper consideration, with many thousands of pages of tax legislation unanalysed and unknown as to their consequences. Today we give the honourable member for Macarthur the opportunity to have a preselection speech and today we debate the antiquities. One Nation is an ancient document and a failed policy paper. If there was ever a statement that was made to represent the aspirations of one job for one man, it was the One Nation statement for the Prime Minister. The pork-barrelling exercise has spread itself right across Australia. In my electorate of La Trobe we did not get much. We got a few hundred thousand dollars for an upgrade of a rail station that was burned down over 10 years ago. Is it not pathetic? But then it is held by a Liberal member of parliament, is it not? Today in Question Time, the Prime Minister said that the Opposition failed to raise any substantive issues. In the few minutes that I have available to me, I would like to raise a couple of substantive issues tonight. There is one thing that is glaringly absent from the One Nation statement; that is, any statement at all about labour market reform. It seems to me that, if there is one issue which commands the attention of the Australian public, the electorate, all those working men and women and those who, unfortunately, do not have needed. jobs, it is labour market reform in the Australian context. I refer honourable members to the recent OECD economic survey. In respect of the industrial relations system, the survey said: The need to eliminate restrictive work practices been particularly pressing. The complexity of Australia's industrial relations system has often been singled out as the principal obstacle to restructuring of the economy and more rapid productivity growth. Oh boy, that is a fair statement! What we need to get on with in this place and what we need to consider, which One Nation does not consider, is a change to our antiquated, archaic, out of date and obtrusive industrial relations system which operates to perpetuate the myth of the club. It is, I suppose, an indictment of the Prime Minister that he did not include a statement by Bill Kelty in One Nation as to what Bill Kelty saw as the needs of the ACTU in driving government policy in the future, as it has driven government policy since 1983. I will change topics slightly. Today our Prime Minister addressed a conference entitled 'Youth Training Employment Forum' held by the Rotary Club in Canberra. The Prime Minister's address was concerned with the One Nation concept of funding, which we desperately need to increase our skills training regime in Australia. The One Nation statement proposed that the Government put funds into our nation's TAFE colleges through the States, but that the States continue to have management, direction and control of their State TAFE systems. Today the Prime Minister has confused that statement by saying that he thinks perhaps it is time the Federal Government took over the TAFE system holus-bolus. He says: One option which has many attractions is for the Commonwealth to go further and assume full responsibility not only for the funding but also for the administration of TAFE. I ask: does the Prime Minister support TAFE, the States controlling TAFE or the Commonwealth controlling TAFE? If it is the Commonwealth, where does he get the power to do that? It seems to me that the Prime Minister is confused. On the Sunday program, the Prime Minister proposed that the Federal Government creata separate system of Federal TAFE colleges around our country to compete with State funded TAFE colleges and to give them a bit has of comeuppance. I wonder how on earth he intends to fund that-perhaps out of One Nation-or with what mechanisms he intends faster to create a separate system. Does the Prime Minister also intend to set up a separate system of primary and secondary schools throughout the country that will compete with government schools and the private school system? Perhaps. In his speech to the youth forum today he further confused us by saying that perhaps what we should do is fund industry to deliver some Commonwealth developed training programs for our youth. The Prime Minister has confused the TAFE issue for the State training boards, the State governments, the whole training bureaucracy and the TAFE students, so much so that those who need and deserve training in this great country will be deprived of it because the Government has absolutely no concept of the direction in which it is going. The One Nation statement made a proposal, but since that time the Prime Minister has thrown down so many red herrings that we have no concept of what direction the Government is heading in. One Nation is one statement for one job for one man. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. \",66

Wilson, I. B. C. Campbell, G. * denotes teller Question so resolved in the negative. NA (No.3) 1992 Second Reading [COGNATE BILLS: NA (APPLICATION) LEVY BILL 1992 NA (RENEWAL) LEVY BILL 1992] Debate resumed from 27 May, on motion by MrHand: That the Bill be now read a second time.",69
220,Mr SPEAKER,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992 concurrently with the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill 1992 and· the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Bill 1992. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",71
221,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on the second reading of the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1992 and cognate Bills. These Bills are to establish a comprehensive regime to regulate the conduct of migration agents. For the purposes of this Bill, a migration agent is defined as a person who will provide migration assistance. Migration assistance is defined to mean the use, or purported use, of knowledge or experience in migration procedure to assist, in specified ways, an applicant for a visa or an entry permit or a person seeking refugee status. The definition covers assistance with preparing an application, advising the applicant about the application, preparing for proceedings in relation to the application, and representing the applicant in such proceedings. It also, I understand, runs to proceedings relating to review of migration procedures and the access to the Immigration Review Tribunal. It will be a criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of $5,000, to practise as a migration agent without being registered. The Bill provides for certain exemptions. This includes lawyers providing immigration legal assistance, which has three elements to it: the preparation for court proceedings; representing or otherwise acting for the applicant in court proceedings; and providing general legal advice to an applicant which is unrelated to the preparation of an application and unrelated to proceedings before the Immigration Internal Review Office or the Immigration Review Tribunal. The Bill, through this definition, recognises the traditional function of lawyers in representing clients before the courts and providing legal advice. Barristers called upon to provide legal advice to a solicitor representing an entrance applicant regarded in this context as giving immigration legal assistance. I might say that it is pertinent to observe what the explanatory memorandums had to say about this and also what the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) had to say in his second reading speech. There is a schema in place which is intended to ensure that the legal profession can continue to function in the traditional areas in which lawyers would offer advice, appear before courts and assist in proceedings before courts. But if they are to operate as migration agents, assisting with applications, preparing applications and lodging applications, or appear in proceedings before tribunals, then of course they are intended to be treated as agents under this legislation with the same consequences that flow for others. It is important to understand that distinction, and it is important to understand it is clear, because the Minister has gone out of his way to put it clearly, as his understanding of this legislation, that that is the tinction. So if there is any thought that there is ambiguity-and I have seen some legal opinions that suggest that some ambiguity can be construed from this-let it be clearly understood that the opinion of the Minister in his second reading speech is shared by the Opposition. It is our view that members of the legal profession ought still be able to proceed to offer advice, to take proceedings in the courts and to appear in the courts without having to register, but in the other areas of activity they should register as migration agents if they intend to practise. Parliamentarians are also exempt, unless they are foolish enough to charge a fee. I cannot imagine parliamentarians doing that. Mr Hand-We would hope not.",71
222,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I am glad the Minister acknowledges that. I suppose there could be circumstances in which members of parliament who are legal practitioners could be continuing to practise and could register as agents if they were intending to charge fees for that purpose, but I see such a possibility as rather tenuous. If people were intending to are do that, it is a matter that parliament might have to look at in other contexts, to consider possible conflicts of interest and the like. Officials acting in the course of duties are exempt, and I understand that also includes the staff and officers of members of parliament. Any other public officials, provided the advice that they offer is in the course of their duties, and persons who do not charge fees-provided that the immigration assistance is given as an employee of a voluntary organisation or as a voluntary worker for another person or organisation, or in the course of an association with a business or profession-are separately covered. My understanding is that people working in that sort of voluntary organisation would have to register but would be exempt from any fees under the legislation as proposed. Apart from these exemptions, the offence provisions will compel all who practise as migration agents to register, and it will be a that significant criminal offence for a migration agent to charge fees without being registered. There is an exemption provided for lawyers dis- who may charge for giving immigration legal assistance as defined and as mentioned earlier. The maximum penalty for an offence of charging fees associated with being a migration agent will be 10 years imprisonment or $60,000, or both. I should say they are maximum penalties and should be seen as such. But it is a severe penalty for this offence, and it reflects the fact that it is directed to those agents who practise for profit and who can make very large profits through some very unscrupulous and unsavoury practices in exploiting very vulnerable people. These are matters that I know are of concern to all members of Parliament. The Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will be required to keep a register of migration agents, which will show the name, address, contact, date of registration, date of last renewal if any, particulars of any suspension of an agent's registration, and any cautions that may have been given to such a person. An individual must apply to the Migration Agents Registration Board to be registered as an agent, although nonnally the Secretary to the Department can deal with applications. There are certain triggers which arise when certain matters require applications to be referred to the Migration Agents Registration Board. The Board will consist of a Chainnan, who I understand will be the Secretary to the Department, a member of the Immigration Review Tribunal, and three ordinary members-one being a lawyer, one with associations with ethnic communities and one being a registered agent. These appointments will be subject to the usual requirements of disclosure of interests. The Board will deal with registration of applications, monitor the conduct of the registered agents in their provision of migration assistance, investigate complaints, take appropriate disciplinary action, refer appropriate cases to professional associations for possible disciplinary action-where, for instance, lawyers might be concerned-infonn prosecuting authorities about apparent offences, and monitor and otherwise advise the Minister on the adequacy of any code of conduct. The Minister may also direct the Board to conduct investigations. The Board. is to give registration applications to the Secretary, who must publish a notice of it in the Gazette, together with a statement that within the next six weeks any person may lodge with the Secretary an objection to the registration of the applicant. Subject to certain factors which I will mention, the Secretary can deal with the application. Applicants who have been convicted of criminal offences, who have been bankrupts, who are presently the subject of criminal proceedings, investigation or inquiry, who do not hold the prescribed qualification or who do not have substantial experience in giving migration assistance over the previous two years, will have their applications referred back to the Board. I understand that the code of conduct that I referred to earlier will be prescribed by regulations at another time. I will deal with that shortly because there are some matters I want to refer to arising out of the code of conduct. But it should be noted that the code of conduct has not yet been prescribed; nor have the qualifications of migration agents. There is provision made for prescribed qualifications. I understand that all legal qualifications will be accepted as appropriate qualifications, and others who have had experience in advising on migration matters are also accepted as having appropriate qualifications; but obviously the detailed provisions here will be looked at when the regulations are presented. At that time, of course, disallowance is one possibility that is available to us if the undertakings that have been given in this area have not been fully satisfied. I raise this issue in relation to the code of conduct in particular because I understand it may be in that area that certain procedures might be outlined in relation to the way in which applications will disclose, or possibly disclose, fees that may be charged by agents. I understand that this matter is being examined afresh because I raised the issue. I simply say that, in relation to the code of conduct which deals with that, obviously we would want to be satisfied regarding that outstanding issue before we could give any undertaking that the code will be dealt with without threat of disallowance. I would like to make some comments about the legislation. The Minister observed earlier, when some other matters were before the House, that this legislation has been a long time corning. I would agree with that. The problems in this area were raised in 1985 by the Minister himself in a speech of which I have reminded him on other occasions. The Minister was then a backbencher. He called for a code of conduct for migration agents and tighter control of their practices, and he revealed circumstances in which peopleMr Hand-I got a death threat for my trouble.",72
223,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"The seriousness of these matters and their sensitivity is something that we well understand. The point the Minister made then was appropriate and proper but, as I say, that was back in 1985. Alot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. As recently as 18 months ago the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations raised these questions. In its report, brought down September 1990, the Committee criticised the Government for failing to effectively address problems which had surfaced in relation to migration agents. The Committee recommended that the Government address the issue and, if necessary, refer it back to the CommitGod'. tee for investigation and report. I note that no reference was made back to the Committee. In a sense I am disappointed at that because it would have given honourable members on· both sides of the House an opportunity to contribute constructively to the development of this legislation. While we do not intend to demur in relation to it, given the opportunity to deal with the legislation ourselves we might well have done so in a less formal way. Although we are setting up, in terms of way the Government is trying to structure it, an organisation which is not going to be unduly top heavy with a significant support structure of its own, nevertheless there are costs associated with any regulatory procedure. When we institute new regulatory arrangements those costs in themselves and the bodies that we establish can sometimes assume a life and importance of their own which is costly to taxpayers when there may well have been other ways of dealing with it. As far as I know, in no public way have those other opportunities that might have been taken up by the Government been considered or addressed. MrHand-Oh! . Mr RUDDOCK-I make that point because the Minister has the propensity in these matters to want to hold all the information and all the decision making and then put down from on high his outcome. Mr Hand-That's not true.",73
224,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,It is in relation to this matter. Mr Hand-I have consulted with these people more than any other Minister since Federation.,74
225,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"The Minister offered, when this matter was raised before, to consult with me. This legislation was produced to me two or three days before it was presented in in this Parliament. That was the extent of the consultation. It certainly was not raised with the Migration Regulations Committee. Mr Hand-My God.",74
226,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"The Minister says, 'My I suspect it says more about some of his colleagues and his trust in them. Mr Hand:-No. It says you were busy doing the refugee reference. You spent 18 months on that because you are so slow. You know the trouble with that Committee and the workload.",74
227,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I know that the Committee would be well intentioned and would offer every assistance that it could to the Minister, in the cooperative and helpful way that it does. I make the point that it was this the Government that in 1989 removed from the Migration Act the only provisions for registratjon that were in place. I know that that was some five years after a change of government. So the prospect of those provisions being made operative was something that the Minister's Government could have pursued, but it took another view. The Minister's predecessor argued very strongly that there should be no system of registration. The Minister's predecessor put in place consumer protection provisions which would provide-as I was assured at that time in the negotiations, as we tried to take a constructive and cooperative approach to migration law reform-a satisfactory remedy for those who were being abused in this area. Because of the way in which people could take cash, not give receipts and not leave a trail of evidence, the provisions that have been put in place for consumer protection have been essentially nugatory. I suspect they have provided no remedy at all. If the Minister wishes to correct me and disclose where people have been able to recover moneys under those provisions, I would be interested to hear it. The amendments, which did not deal with issues relating to advertising and did not deal effectively with the issues of agency and relationship-certainly, they were not underpinned with appropriate penaltieshave fallen into disuse and have been totally ineffective. I have made it clear that we will not oppose this legislation. However, it ought to be understood that the Government· has not, in our view, established that this is the most appropriate regime to deal with what we all agree are the real evils in relation to the present arrangements. It is my Party's view that the regime is very legalistic in its form. It imposes another regulatory system and adds to the plethora of similar bodies which cut across a whole range of human activity. Mr Hand-How do you stop the bandits? We have tried the soft glove.",74
228,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"We may well have been able to do it by providing penalty provisions without necessarily a schema of registration. There were no penalty provisions in the Act after 1989. I understand that in this legislation there is a sunset clause and there are provisions for· a review after two years. It seems to me that that is a matter that, having been foreshadowed, will give us an opportunity to see how the schema that is being put in place works. That has been one of the reasons that I have been able to get for the Government the support of my colleagues for this legislation. We will want to look at the matter closely. We will want to see how it operates. We will want to look at whether or not· the penalty provisions in existing statutes and the common law that prescribe certain behaviour and provide provision for prosecution for those who do not comply do, in fact, provide an appropriate regime for control of unscrupulous operators. If it becomes a cumbersome and expensive scheme in the way in which it is proposed, we will take the opportunity of that review and the sunset clause that is provided to look at the matter again. I have already said that the Migration Agents Association has expressed concern about aspects of the draft code, particularly in relation to the requirement to publish agents' fees on application forms. I hope the Minister will resolve that. I note that the legislation has been strongly opposed by the Law Council of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Law Society of New South Wales, and other legal professional bodies, for numerous reasons. Some of these include the argument that it is not appropriate for the proposed scheme for registration of migration agents to apply to barristers and solicitors since it is unnecessary duplication having regard to the strict regulation of the legal profession which already exists and the fact that complaints against solicitors are investigated and, where appropriate, disciplinary action may be brought. We considered this objection but came to the view that complaints are broadly based and any scheme to operate effectively in relation to agents needs to cover all the people who are offering immigration advice and the unreasonable conduct of migration agents catalogued by the Minister and known to many members and senators is not confined to those without legal qualifications. Complaints have been lodged to disciplinary bodies, I understand, about some members of the legal profession whose conduct has been notorious. But as far as I am aware-and occasionally I see reports of the disciplinary bodies-no practitioner that I have seen has been subject to disciplinary action in relation to the conduct of migration matters. There is an argument that annual registration fees are excessive and that lawyers are already paying fees. There is also an argument by the Victorian body, the Victorian Law Institute, that it is moving for the accreditation of immigration law specialists. I have to say that I regard those particular moves on the part of the Victorian Law Institute as a welcome advance. I think specialisation by the legal profession is helpful and appropriate. However, in relation to the legal profession it is important that, if it is offering immigration advice as distinct from immigration legal advice, it is required to submit to the same regime. It has been said that the distinction between lawyers who give immigration legal advice and those who give immigration advice is not workable. Our view is to the contrary; we think the distinction is clear. I have dealt with that already. I have also dealt with the question of all lawyers having their qualifications recognised. I do want to raise another important matter with the Minister. I know that his officers have been looking at it. As the schema that we have before us is one that is being implemented in law, I hope that, between now and when the legislation is finally concluded in the Senate, the Minister will look at the question of the way in which the fee structure is being pursued. It has been seriously put by members from rural constituencies, in particular, that members of the public will be disadvantaged when they cannot seek advice on immigration matters, as distinct from legal advice on immigration matters, in country towns where there might be only one solicitor, very few other people, no migration agents, nobody with experience in these matters, whom they could readily get to, and where a solicitor would have to pay $1,000 to register in order to offer advice on one or two cases a year. I do not find persuasive the arguments that have been put to me as to why it is difficult to make some exemptions. It seems to me that it ought to be possible to make a system work where the fee for a person in a remote area who is dealing with fewer than 10 cases might be, say, $100 instead of $1,000. With the fee being set at $1,000, those people probably will not register anyway. It should be made clear that if the matters are small, a fee of less than $100 only can be charged. Those agents could be put on an obligation to disclose their fees and to deal with only a specific number of applications. We would then be in a position where those people would be allowed to selfassess. If it were seen later that they charged fees in excess of the amount that is prescribed or they put in more than, say, 10 applications a year, they could then be charged the full with a penalty, in much the same way as happens in the tax Act. It seems to me that that is the sort of scheme we may well be able to develop. I hope that the Minister might tum his mind to it because it may minimise some of the objections that have been raised by the legal professional bodies. We offer those comments in a constructive way in the hope that the Minister may pick them up between now and when this matter is dealt with in the Senate. I do make the point that we have come to the view that this legislation should be supported. We support the view that lawyers should not be exempt if they are acting on immigration matters generally, giving immigration advice as distinct from legal advice. We see this as much· the same as the scheme that now operates for those who register as tax agents. Members of the legal profession are no doubt familiar with the requirement to register as tax agents if they are submitting tax returns. The only distinction I make is that in that area the registration fee is very much lower than is proposed here. I suspect this may be one of the reasons why the profession is taking such a keen interest in this matter. I note that the Bill is seen to be neutral in revenue terms. Revenue of $1m has been assumed. It has been suggested that the small surplus that might present from these charges could be directed towards grants for community migration services, such as those run by the Refugee Council of Australia and other organisations. Some of those voluntary organisations may be better placed to offer advice to the more necessitous and impecunious. This legislation has been a long time coming. We are concerned with the way in which some of the most vulnerable people have been exploited. I look at the situation involving the students who are here from China at the time of the Tiananmen Square event; I look at those who came afterwards as students; and I look at the nature of the advertisements that have appeared in many Chinese language newspapers and the way in which people have been encouraged in the expectation that they might be assisted to fee lodge applications for which they very often have no entitlement. They have often had to pay significant amounts of money merely to achieve the lodging of an application which has not helped them in any way at all. This is a matter where those who are offering advice need to have some ethical standards. They need to appreciate that they are dealing with people who are in a very vulnerable position. While I would not deny people the right to charge a proper fee for a service properly rendered, it is not a situation in which people ought to be ripped off unmercifully in the way in which they have. We are certainly pleased to see at this time, albeit late, legislation which will address these questions. I hope that when we have had the opportunity to review the application of this legislation, we will see that it has been effective. Mr Hand-I will send you a letter.",75
229,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,I appreciate the genuineness with which the Minister offers advice to assist me in government in relation to the way in which these matters are dealt with. I will value that advice and counsel from the Minister in the same way that I know he would value mine.,77
230,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I support the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3), the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Bill. I am very pleased to hear from the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) that the Opposition will be supporting these Bills. Essentially the measures outlined aim to ensure that people seeking professional advice and assistance on immigration matters are not ripped off by unscrupulous migration agents. I remind the honourable member for Dundas that the purpose of these Bills relates to standards. The legislation follows consultation with the community and representatives of the migration agent industry, and will contribute to a higher standard of practice and advice being given to so many migrants within our areas. Migration agents who have been cheating people by abusing the system must be apprehended. These Bills will ensure that this will take place. At this stage I would like to pause to quote from the book Multicultural Australia: The Cluillenges of Change, which states: The challenges for our immigration policy are to balance the need for compassionate and humanitarian responses to international crises (and the natural desire of families to be reunited), a vision for the development of Australiaeconomically, socially and culturally. The directions that have been set for immigration by the government will ensure that the programme will balance our economic needs and reality with our humanitarian and compassionate obligations. It will ensure that immigration is central in our planning and remains within the national interest. It is a programme that will take us into the twenty-first century. The measures outlined in these Bills are very much in keeping with that statement. The very nature of our immigration policies has meant that culturally we are a very diverse society. We must, therefore, protect our society against charlatans and unprincipled - gration agents whose main aim, it appears, IS to tum our multicultural communities to their own financial advantage. Unfortunately, as we move increasingly towards a deregulated society, the migration agent industry is not suitable to selfregulation. It must be regulated by our Government. This is because there is no clearly. defined group of organisations or individuals which can be identified as migration agents. For example, some migration agents, as indicated by the honourable member for Dundas, are also solicitors. The industry has never been regulated and the behaviour of migration agents has never been monitored. Consequently, a large number of people in our now vastly multicultural society are at risk of being cheated by these unethical agents. Unlike most industries that provide a service to people, there is no body that people can complain to about the actions of migration agents other than to us-their local members. In order to protect the conscientious and honest agents-and I admit that those people are out there in the community-the regulation of this industry is vital. I have been intent on this Government establishing regulations such as the ones these Bills will put in place for many years. In my maiden speech in May 1990 I vowed to 'vigorously pursue this matter', as I found the actions of many migration agents 'repugnant'. My electorate is essentially multicultural and with is, I believe, an excellent example of how multiculturalism can work in Australia. I am sure that most of us in this chamber tonight would have come across a constituent who had been ripped off by a migration agent. In my opinion, too many constituents in my electorate are taken advantage of by unscrupulous agents who have charged prices ranging from $500 to $5,000 to fill in a fonn or to make representations to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Tribunal. Affairs. Consequently, I welcome this legislation with open anns as it is a move towards a system which decreases the chance of my constituents being taken advantage of by ripoff artists posing as migration agents. The measures for regulating migration agents contained in these Bills which are before the House this evening were anagents nounced by our Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in December last year. Those measures considered. include: the establishment of a regulatory framework requiring the registration of agents which would be supported by a series of regulations penalties; the development of a code conduct; and the creation of a registration board to consider reported breaches of the code. This registration board is to be chaired by an officer from the Department of migration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It is to include representatives of industry, the legal profession and ethnic application. community organisations, and the principal member of the Immigration Review Tribunal. This Bill also ensures that it will be criminal offence to practise as a migration agent without being registered. A migration agent is defined as a person who uses knowledge of, or skill in, migration law and procedure to assist in the making of an plication for a visa or entry pennit or for refugee status. It extends to advice and assisand tance relating to adverse decisions on plications, whether in a court bodies. As I have already stated, solicitors and barristers will not need to register in respect of their activities before the courts or if are providing general legal migration advice unrelated to the completion and lodgement applications. However, registration will required in relation to the making of visa entry applications under the Migration Act. Migration agents will be required to register on a yeady basis, pay a yearly registration and comply with ethical and professional standards set out in the code of conduct. Decisions by the Registration Board to reject an application by a migration agent will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals It is an advantage that the Migration Agents Registration Board be composed of represen.tatives from the industry and ethnic community groups in order to provide the necessary checks and balances on the registration board's decisions and integrity. In keeping with the acknowledgment that many migration are doing an effective job, those agents who are currently practising can continue to practise while their applications are being One of the most positive aspects of these is that agents will have to declare of their fees. The code of conduct aims to prevent agents from charging unreasonable fees for their services. I believe this would effectively put a stop to migration agents Imcharging exorbitant prices for migration advice. It has been known for agents to the charge up to $7,000 for just assisting with an This is the first time that a comprehensive registration scheme for migration agents has a been introduced, and it is commendable that Australia will be the first country to do this. These regulations and the proposed registration system have been widely discussed with migration agents, the legal profesapsion, the Department of Immigration, and ethnic community groups to ensure that they the code of conduct are fair to all and, apmost importantly, that they will operate or before review effectively. The basic objective of the code of conduct must be: on all occasions a migration agent must act in the interests of his or her client. they That is a simple but necessary statement, given the complaints that most of us have of listened to at some time or another in our be capacities as representatives of our comor munities. The code, I am pleased to see, aims to establish a proper standard for the conduct of business as a migration agent. It must also fee aim to set out the minimum attributes and abilities that a person must demonstrate in order to perfonn as a registered migration agent. The new regulations which are before this House tonight are aimed at agents who stand to make very large financial gains from unscrupulous practices. Many agents have themselves attempted to develop standards of conduct, introduce training cOUrses to ensure that migration agents are properly qualified, and introduce some regulation into the industry. Many of the people who seek the assistance of migration agents in Australia are extremely vulnerable. At times this may be due to a lack of proficiency in the English language; but I believe it is also due to a fear of authority and, certainly, the lack of financial resources. Although most agents are-as I have admitted-honest and provide a valuable service, there is that minority which gives the industry a very bad name. By imposing a registration board and making it compulsory for agents to be registered in order to practice, the Government will not be imposing barriers to entry to the industry or making the industry non-competitive. Rather, by picking the bad apples out of the crop, constituents would be protected and a higher level of professionalism would be achieved within the industry. Migration agents do need some regulation in order to protect those seeking advice on immigration matters, and proof of qualifications should be mandatory before agents are allowed to practice. The regulations contained in these Bills will ensure that both concerns are addressed. I am sUre that' the vast majority of members of parliament are aware of the reasons why oUr country needs these regulations so vitally. For myself, I see what unscrupulous agents do to. my constituents day in and day out and it leaves me very angry. In the past, migration agents have called my electorate office to ask me to make representations on behalf of a client. However, the agents then charge their client for organising my· representations and for attending the interview with them. It is for this reason that I am loath to deal with migration agents in my office, as it is every constituent's free right to come to me for help. They should never be charged for this by an agent. I am also aware of reports of agents lodging late forms with DILGEA on behalf of clients, which has resulted in the disadvantaging of the applicant. I am also aware of them submitting completely incorrect applications for the type of decision required in relation to the client, and even encoUraging clients to lodge applications when there is little or no prospect of success. Although it is illegal, I am also aware of migration agents who have claimed that they can obtain a favourable decision on an immigration application and/or speed up the immigration decision making process. Everyone has someone in the know-or so they say. A number of. cases in which migration agents have done the wrong thing by my constituents come to mind. I will mention just a few in the course of this debate, although I could go on with case after case history. The first case to which I refer concerns one of my constituents who came to me for advice after paying a migration agent to help him with his wife's migration to Australia. At that time it was a very clear-cut case, but the migration agent did not submit my constituent's extended eligibility temporary entry permit application fonn to DILGEA for nearly six months, although he had ,already taken the money and said that he would do so; as a result my constituent and his wife were certainly disadvantaged and placed in a predicament. Although the migration agent received $800 to lodge the application on behalf of my constituent and his wife, the processing of the application was a lot further behind than my constituent thought. His wife, who had diabetes, fell pregnant and the concern was raised that they would not be able to afford the doctor and the hospital bills without Medicare. If the agent had lodged the fonn when he was requested to do so-he had, after all, been paid to do so-my constituent's wife would have been eligible for Medicare at that time. In the second case, a constituent came to me after paying a local solicitor over $5,000. I have all of these cases documented. The solicitor was also acting as a migration agent. He was to prepare an application for resident status in Australia and submit it to the Department on his client's behalf. Unfortunately for my constituent, he was not advised that his case was bound to fail because it simply did not meet our immigration laws. Although that solicitor must have known this, he did not advise my constituent of this very pertinent fact and he obviously had no difficulty in taking my constituent's money for what we all knew to be an unwinnable case. The third case relates to a migration agent who wrote to me on behalf of a constituent requesting that I make representations to DILGEA and write a letter of support, because the person he was representing was my constituent. The agent even included a draft letter and requested that I just retype and sign it. Meanwhile, when I had this investigated, I found the agent was again charging my constituent. However, as I have informed honourable members, my office has a policy of not interviewing constituents who are paying migration agents to make appointments for them to see me. I believe it is unethical on my part to become involved with migration agents in this way. It is certainly unfair to my constituents, who are paying agents, which often they can ill-afford to do, when they can come to my office to see me, as is the right of every constituent, without fear and without fee. Some migration agents have become notorious for their unethical practices. Only as recently as 14 April of this year the ABC program The Investigators put to air a show about unscrupulous migration agents. One particular agency named by that program, the International Immigration Agency, IIA, in Sydney was placing advertisements in Hungarian newspapers promising easy access to Australia for a price, of course. This resulted in Hungarians parting with hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars before they realised they were being ripped off. The Investigators personnel said that in the process of putting the program together they discovered that other migration agents were profiteering from those eager to get into Australia. Many people are looking for a better life in Australia and, often out of desperation or ignorance, they employ the services of immigration agents within our country, hoping that they will be able to help secure them residency within Australia. As a result of the lack of policing of these agents, the door has been left wide open for what I believe are very dishonest operators. This legislation is aimed at changing that situation. The IIA, claiming to be an Australian Government registered immigration agency, has duped scores of Hungarians. Unemployment has skyrocketed in Hungary and increasing numbers are seeking to immigrate to Australia. These people are being told that the Australian Government is accepting refugees into the country. The type of misleading information being distributed it around another country outside Australia by that group calling itself IIA is not only cheating but also financially hurting some of the people of the country· of Hungary. It is also giving Australia and our Department of Immigration a very bad name overseas. As indicated in that program, most of the Hungarians had to pay the equivalent of A$67 to receive the information sent to them. That is equivalent to nearly two weeks of their wages in that country. They were then told that they would be instantly eligible for unemployment benefit once they arrived in Australia and that the benefit was five times what the Hungarian people could earn in their own country. Those Hungarian people were also told that once in Australia they could get easy access to housing, schooling and even subsidised air fares with the help of that agency organisation. For their $67, the Hungarians also received information that was freely available to them from our Australian Embassy. Some people have paid their life savings to immigration agents and have had their cases destroyed as a result of misrepresentation to the Department by the agents. With an increasingly troubled international state of affairs and more and more people looking to migrate to Australia, the need for regulations and registration of the immigration agent industry is of paramount importance. I believe that the regulations and amendments contained in the Bills before the House are a continuation of the conscientious efforts of this Government and this Minister to create immigration laws which are fair, equitable and, most importantly, beneficial to all Australians and which open up our society to the advantages that an effective immigration system can offer to the people of Australia. I have great pride in supporting the Bills before the House.",77
231,Mr RIGGALL,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"MCMIllan) . . rise tonight to support the debate on the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3), the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill and .the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) LevyBill and perhaps add a little to it from the point of view of a member from a rural sector. Like the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), I have also had great problems with immigration agents within my electorate. It saddens me when people as a last resort walk in my door and talk about the problems they have had. Some of the cases are quite hopeless. One particular lad was an illegal immigrant. He overstayed his visitors visa by some four years. He was quite outside any proper system which would allow him to stay in Australia. Yet an immigration agent had charged him something like $1,000 for advice to see his Federal member. That is just outrageous. I add that the immigration agent was a legally trained gentleman from Sydney. I am just appalled that somebody would go to those lengths to take advantage of people who are so vulnerable in their desperation to stay in this country. Many of them try to do the right thing, but they do not understand our system-for people who do not have a great command of English, it is hard to understand. Perhaps the thing that appals me most is that people seem to take particular delight in taking down those of their own ethnic origin. I find that an appalling indictment on the morality of pe6ple who, having gained entry to this country, become parasites on their fellow countrymen who wish to take up residence in Australia. So I commend the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for what he has attempted to do in this Bill, which I think is long overdue. I support him in the general thrust of the Bill. However, coming from a country electorate, I want to raise the possibility of the safety net to clean out those people who are rorting the system being too tight. I take the case, which has already been raised, of legal practitioners helping to fill in (9.16 p.m.)-I forms. If they have not paid the registration fee-up to $1,000 for a firm and perhaps $500 for a partner of that firm-they could be up for a $5,000 fine for failing to register as agents. If they go one step further and inadvertently charge a fee for their time, they could be up for a fine of $60,000. I am sure the Minister does not mean to catch in his safety net people who are acting in good faith, who perhaps are clients of the practitioner in a legal sense but come to him for advice on immigration because they live in a small country town .and that is the only contact that they have with a person who is trained to a sufficient degree to help them with or give them the confidence to deal with their immigration forms. Not only does it pertain to the legally trained people, the lawyers and barristers, within the country community, but there is also a case where accountants and probably other tertiary trained people could be caught up in this net. It would be a tragedy to have a situation where somebody talks to his accountant in good faith; the accountant acts in good faith; and the accountant suddenly finds that he is ultra vires because he is not a registered agent and is giving people advice. It would cost the accountant $5,000, or a potential fine of $60,000, if he charged for that service. Admittedly, that would probably happen only in extreme cases, but if it happened only once that would be a tragedy. It would also be a tragedy if the people who are vulnerable in this respect-people who are not in a position to take out the $500 or $1,000 because they see only two, three, or five people a year, or maybe five people in two or three years, who are seeking assistance in this area-people who are community-minded, have a community responsibility and a community obligation, could no longer offer that service in a country town. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to how one can overcome that problem. Becoming an immigration agent in many cases involves only helping somebody with the English required to fill in the form and letting that person know what the prescribed fee is once the form is filled in. would be a tragedy if those people legally could not offer their clients a service that otherwise they would be able to give. While I have suggested that this pertains to lawyers and accountants, I am quite sure that people in several other occupations who are in a fee charging position within the community could also be caught up in this net, as they are the contact that people with limited English may have to go to for advice and assistance. With the current lack of legislation, it is perfectly legal to do so. The difficulty always with these things lies in determining, once one makes exemptions, how far those exemptions go. I understand that, and I believe that the Minister in his integrity will have a look at this point of view and cover it. I implore him to do so because it becomes quite a problem when the fee is set so high and people in country areas with such goodwill are not able to pass on that community service without the fear of legislation. I support the general thrust of the legislation because of the unfortunate and terrible actions that have taken place when people who see themselves as some sorts of geniuses in immigration have proved to be little more than people who fill in forms. Those who rort the system need to be weeded out of the system. But the safety net that has been introduced may very well knock out community services or community minded people from the role that they now play of genuinely helping those whose understanding of English is not as great as ours.",81
232,Mr FERGUSON,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I wish briefly to support the legislation along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the previous speaker from the Government side, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), as you both have electorates which are fairly similar in a socio-economic sense and, more particularly, very heavily populated by people born in non-English speaking countries, especially nations with particular political problems, communal violence and sectarian differences that lead to heavy pressure on our migration system. We have been pleased in the last year or so It to press the Government in relation to these matters. Whilst I would support the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in congratulating the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) for recognising this problem so early-I think it was said back in 1985 that he had the prescience to understand this fundamental problem in the systemI perhaps would emphasise more than the honourable member for Dundas the novelty of this move; Australia is not the only country that would be subject to this kind of social problem of people trying to exploit those that are very desperate to move to another nation. One has only to look at the southern states in the United States, Mexico and Central America to see a clear indication of a society that would have a very similar, if not worse, problem. So, as a backbencher, I join the honourable member for Dundas in congratulating the Minister on recognising this. As I say, I would more clearly emphasise the novelty and the fact that Australia has moved, despite the delays, before many other nations. When we talk about these delays, I guess we have to recognise that, if the Government had announced one week that next week or next month it was going to move in on the legal profession and elements of it in this field, all hell would have broken loose about the rights of all people to have their day in court and our interference with people's innate rights. They were some of the issues that had to be worked through. We equally have in the same field the question of community migrant advisory groups that perhaps would have concerns about whether some of the elements of this legislation could conceivably tie them up. Equally, they might be concerned, if things were not worked through in a proper sense by consultation, that civil liberties would be infringed and people's rights decreased. Quite clearly, the problems that these agents cause society, and more particularly the people desperate enough to go to them, are diverse. As has been mentioned by many previous speakers, they range from putting in applications long after they are due, and thereby denying people their rights to go within the legal system, to a total contribution of writing a five-page precis on the problems of the minorities in Iran. They might be able to write two pages on the problems of the Mujahideen with the Iranian regime or another page or two on the fact that Sikhs have a bad deal in the Punjab. Supposedly, for being able to read the Europa World Year Book and a few other political commentaries, they are to be paid 5,000 bucks or a similar amount for filling out a few forms and for suggesting to people that they undertake incorrect applications which they are not even qualified for. That kind of problem is very widespread and diverse. It takes many different forms. As the honourable member for Prospect mentioned, it is also characterised by some people feeling that members of parliament should write out pro forma letters from a draft supplied to them and very willingly send them off without question so that these people can be paid hundreds, maybe thousands, of dollars for the ability to send their client, as a constituent, to the member. They are some of the problems that have been faced in the migration field. The fundamental issue is whether there should be self-regulation of the industry or whether the Government should intervene to make sure that things do happen. It would be nice if we could count on elements in this industry to police themselves. There are a number of problems with this. It has been stated earlier-and it is quite clearly correctthat it is a very fragmented industry. It is indicated that some accountants engage in it as a sideline and that lawyers are involved. Other people drift into it because they are married to a person from a particular nationality and have built up a great affinity with that community. Others might have had some kind of social commitment to political issues and drifted into the field to help out that other community. Others, quite clearly, are in the industry to rip off those undergoing the process as expertly as they can. What we have is a very fragmented industry. It has no focal point and no organisation that the Department or the Minister could really go to and say, 'Well, there are a few difficulties. Can you iron them out for yourselves?'. It is too diverse for that. It has failed to get its act together. It has not shown any ability to have grave concern about the problems that have given it such a bad name in Australian society. That is the first situation. In agreeing to this legislation, the honourable member for Dundas put some of the objections of the legal profession on the agenda. He noted that a large number of State organisations had indicated that they were not totally happy with this legislation, that supposedly they would prefer to look after themselves and that we could trust them to undertake that responsibility for Australian society. He also said that he felt the question of the fees level might 'be one of the reasons for opposition'. That is possible, but perhaps a greater measure of concern would arise from their wish to police their own industry for the sake of self-protection. I note the New South Wales Law Reform Commission's document Scrutiny of the Legal Profession-Complaints against Lawyers of May 1992. Some people might think that that is a bit of a home-town jury, but it did come up with quite a few interesting points. On page 19 it states that 1,245 complaints had been rendered in the context of what it said on page 106, namely: . . . the prevalence of complaints amounting to allegations of unsatisfactory conduct. Despite that prevalence, and despite the fact that there were 1,245 complaints, only one per cent of them managed to hit the deck to the point of being referred to the standards board. In a review of the Law Society Council it noted: There is something more than a mere paper review, but the complainant is not given the parallel opportunity to provide fresh evidence to the Panel. The Commission went on to speak about trust accounts and the ability of the law organisations in New South Wales to police that aspect. At page 96 at 4.17 it said: Where the action was taken following information provided by a complainant, the complainant is not among those who are informed that a trust account inspection or a financial investigation has been ordered or is under way, arid the complainant is not entitled to receive a copy of the report. That was typical of the kinds of problems the Commission saw in the New South Wales legal fraternity's ability to police and control itself and to rid itself of problems. The Law Reform Commission said at page 103: The Law Society's apparent view that 'minor matters' of unsatisfactory professional conduct should, in effect, be ignored if the client is satisfied by the outcome must be treated with some caution. I think the concern of these legal organisations might have a little bit more to do with running a protection racket for themselves, ensuring a minimum of public inspection and a minimum of scrutiny of the more unscrupulous operators in the field. It is a diverse industry without a particular focus, an industry where the lawyers are prevalent and have shown no ability to police themselves. I know that there has been quite an advance on this in Victoria, but in other States it probably has not reached that stage. In the legislation we see the setting up of a requirement for registration, and we see a board created to consider those cases where the Secretary feels that matters are not up to scratch. It is a board that is broadly representative of the interests that should be considered in the industry. Those include the lawyers themselves and the ethnic community, which, of course, has a deep interest in protecting its members. The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) quite correctly pointed out that, just as Australians exploit Australians, ethnic groups do the same thing to each other. There is concern by many ethnic groups, and it has been brought to the Minister's attention. He has consulted with them about it. They are very worried about the extent of this problem. They are part of the scene. Others concerned include the migration agents themselves, the Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Immigration Review Tribunal's principal person. On the board there is a broad representation of those who have a major and legitimate interest in the proper operation in the field. I support the legislation. I do not see the need to repeat verbatim the various clauses. It deals with the problem that members who represent·electorates containing large migrant communities recognise and see every day. A case that is typical. of the thin end of the difficulty involves a practitioner who charged $2,000 up front and a further $1,350 to members of the Korean community whom he visited and spoke to at church services. The total contribution of this person, who went to many people of various Protestant denominations in the Korean community, was to write a two-page letter to the Department saying that Koreans were hard workers, they were industrious people, they really do a lot of great things for Australia and we should have a special program for them. That was the total contribution for $3,350 from each Korean person, who got the benefit of a 20minute spiel at the church and a later letter simply asking that person to tell him how well he or she had worked in Australian society and whether he or she had set up a business. It was virtually a class action rather than a specific case for each person. That is typical of the broad problem. I congratulate the Government on this legislation.",82
233,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"In rising to speak to the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) and cognate Bills, I suggest that the handling of migration cases is probably one of the more difficult and more emotional matters for which any of us is responsible. It is always hard advising people, often unfamiliar with our customs, our country and our language, towards the best step by which they can help either themselves or their friends and relatives. When it is done for fees, there are obviously additional problems and matters which members on both sides of the House have faced over the years with varying equanimity and a variable degree of positive result. I know that in this field the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) approaches the subject with a sympathetic heart, but I confess that I think he has also approached it with far too many amendments to legislation, so that there is total uncertainly in the community as to just what the status of our migration legislation is, and more so the regulations made under the legislation. The result is that people inevitably turn to others for advice in order to determine what the hell they can do, or in what way they might be able to accommodate the law to their particular circumstances. Mr Hand-We all tum for advice.",84
234,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I would be quite happy to give the Minister advice. Were he to accept it, he might be a lot better off than he is at the moment. In the conduct of matters pertaining to migration agents there are lots of areas where all of us feel that there have been problems and there needs to be concern for the futrlre. I begin by stating that as the positive, because there are other aspects of legislation with which I do have concern, and I want to address them. The nature of our migration pattern and the ways in which numbers have been elevated beyond the economic and social benefits to our community are matters of great concern to me. I have been one of those who championed a migration flow into this country over the years. I think migrants have contributed an enormous amount to Australia. We have been so fortunate that we have had people who have come to this country and enriched it. I was quite fascinated to see some of those remarks of Sir Arvi Parbo. We have this flag which has come to mean so much to those newcomers to our country. People need to realise that it means so much more to those newcomers than the flags of communism, oppression and repression that so many of them left in order to become Australians. We also have the responsibility of Australian citizenship, the administration of which is another one of the areas that worry me. I think it has been denigrated instead of elevated. After all, citizenship is the highest honour a country can confer on a newcomer. I would like to see it treated more seriously. That is for another time and another debate. All these matters are relevant, because we are not just saying to migrants who are in Australia, 'We want to welcome you here'; we are really saying to them, 'You are going to be tomorrow's Australians. Your children are going to be Australians. You are going to contribute to the enrichment of our culture. You are going to make a contribution to the future which will ensure that in the twentyfirst century Australians are, once more, going to see rising living standards and will be able to make a contribution in the region of which we are a part and, hopefully, in the wider world'. It is not a narrow subject; it is a very wide subject and one that embraces very significant responsibilities when we select newcomers to Australia. The third matter is how we approach this legislation, which requires the registration of migration agents. I am one of those who has been against the idea of regulating every facet the of Australian society. I do not think people behave better because we prescribe this, that or the other thing. We 'cannot prescribe honesty. I notice that there is to be a code of conduct. We have seen how Senator Richardson treated the code of conduct for Ministers. Are we going to expect licensed migrant agents to be any more liable to comply than one of the most senior members of the Labor Ministry? It is not irrelevant to suggest that if we cannot expect it of people who exercise that sort of responsibility, and they have been dismissed, how is this sort of a pecuniary fine suddenly going to be able to impose the disciplines that all of us would see migration agents as following? How are we going to ensure that it takes place? I start off being a bit cynical about the pluses of the legislation. I respect the Minister's sincerity and I understand the reason why the legislation is here. I know my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) supports the Minister, but just bringing in another Bill does not mean that people will behave themselves. I think that is a fairly significant concern. Fourthly, let us look at the legislation see whether it is the right way to go. I have started by talking about the vulnerability of migrants. That is what worries me. All of us haye contact with people who really do not know our system, our laws or our language. Last week I was advising a person on a probate matter. It is extraordinarily difficult even to understand the problem in the first place. In this instance I was dealing with a widow, which made it twice as hard because she was highly emotional and her English was not particularly good. I found just trying to understand the problem difficult. I know that those who are out to make a dollar are likely to manipulate people even greater degree. Looking at how we going to overcome this problem of responproblem. sibility, and accepting that there is a code conduct, I seriously wonder whether it would not have been better to set up some sort fund to which people practising in the would contribute, so that if they way blemish the copybook, there is some money available. I know that does not pensate, but it means that at least there is a o pool of money from which legal appeals can be run. I quite seriously say to the House that, instead of just prescribing' penalties, I think there is an advantage in setting up some of obligatory contribution to a pool of money which would be available to help are aggrieved. People might need to resort to that to pay lawyers to get legal counsel. In some way, it gives them a protection. Unfortunately, in most of the professions it been necessary to set up these funds, reply. whatever they are called in their various dimensions, to try to provide the capaCity for the person who is being affected to seek recourse. I would have preferred it if a fiduciary fund, or something like that, had been set up. I think that could have had some significant advantage. I do not like penalties. The trouble with penalties is that they always come after event, and the peron has been hurt before anyone knows about it. If the person has hurt, I would like to be able to say, 'You have been hurt. Here is a way and might be able to get recourse'. An example of the trouble with this is the Chinese migrants. They were taken to the cleaners. They lost their significant savings-not just their savings but their family savings. They can say, 'We have lost all our money', but there needs to be another way in which they can get other advice. Hopefully that other advice would be better. I am not happy about offences and penalties. I would far prefer to see a fiduciary fund which gives them a chance to get recourse at the end of the deal. Let us look at the people who are going to be granted exemptions. The problem in the bush is a bit different from the problem in the to an city. I know the honourable member for are Dundas has referred to this. It is a real People with knowledge of the of migration law-as I suggested, the Minister has been changing the regulations so freof quently that one has to be pretty well fullarea bottled to know what happened today, let do in any alone what happened yesterdayMr Hand-At the suggestion of your comCommittee, I might add-a lot of it.",85
235,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"My participation in that Committee is to try to ensure that the Department for which the Minister is temporarily responsible acts a jolly sight better than it has in the past. It is true that there are sort some very fine public servants in that Department, but it has not impressed me in its those who disclosure of information. Mr Hand interjecting",86
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,The Minister will have a chance to,86
237,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I think the Minister has identified one of the problems: we have to start looking at the way in which the Department itself is operating. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us throughout Question Time today that the Minister is running the Department. If the Minister is running the Department, he is doing a pretty the lousy job of it. I think there are enormous problems, such as disclosure of information. been Having said that, there are some wonderful public servants in the Department and some in which you of them do a great job. There are difficulties in the bush. I am delighted to know the honourable member for Dundas has addressed and identified them. 1 trust the Minister will take on board the fact that often there are difficulties in making people available to give adequate advice. The legislation says that anybody who accepts a fee is going to be penalised if he is not registered. There are problems about the fee which concern me. For example, thinking particularly of bush Australia, a whole range of people-a clergyman, a psychologist, a medical practitioner, or just a family friend-are not there to take fees for that, but they might take fees for another related matter. For example, if a medical practitioner is treating a migrant and that migrant wants to bring in his family, and during the consultation the migrant says, '1 do not know anyone in our community, 1 want a bit of help. Can you give me a bit of advice on that?', a fee is charged for another matter. 1 hope that will not mean that that medical practitioner, clergyman, or whoever, is going to be charged. Secondly, there is a problem if expenses are entailed-as there are in lodging applications for appeals, for example-and money is passed over. Quite often there are necessary . fees, even some unrelated to government charges: for example, accommodation or fares to travel to the capital of a country where that person is required to lodge his application. There are two circumstances: firstly, a person providing a service unrelated to migration but giving migration advice should be excluded from the fee; and, secondly, a fee which is not a fee but an offset against disbursements quite properly given to the person to try to help that person-it might be to enable a relativ.e to travel from one end of the country to the other, to - he capital, because that is where the consul is, to lodge his migration application-should be excluded. 1 hope all those people are excluded. I am not too happy about the way in which lawyers are excluded only in matters relating to applications to courts and matters before the courts. 1 know the objections in the legal profession have been referred to by the honourable member for Dundas. Quite often lawyers and accountants have people who go to see them-as we do as members of parliament-and want to talk in a general way about, amongst other things, immigration matters. 1 know that the Minister is trying to lift the standards, that the code of conduct is related to it and that there is a plus in it, but 1 had rather hoped that people who have a professional qualification would respect that professional qualification. If we are to have migration agents from outside the professions, 1 can accept their registration a lot easier than I can those from people who are in the professions and who have a particular professional responsibility. I am not sure that they should not all be included, but 1 understand, nevertheless, why they are here. But, as 1I have said, if there were a fiduciary fund to which they contributed, 1 would be much happier with that than I am with this registration fee. So 1I have a few worries about that nature of the exemption. I am appalled that, apparently, there are some parliamentarians who charge fees. That is an inevitable implication in the fonn of this exemption which refers to 'parliamentarians (unless they charge fees)'. As far as I am concerned, parliamentarians have a responsibility to advise the community. It is part of the charge that we have as elected representatives of the people. 1 wondered whether it was just another one of these sources of personal guilt of which we have seen a number on the Labor side in recent times. 1 wondered whether those opposite were saying, 'Some of our guys have found times a bit tough'. After all, the way they have treated the Remuneration Tribunal, it is understandable that they are not finding it easy to make ends meet. 1 can well understand that there may well be members of the Labor Party who feel it necessary therefore to accept fees. But 1 think that is still wrong. As far as I am concerned, it would be far better .if those members of the Labor Party who might see it necessary to get some added lurks and perks did not charge fees for those duties which 1 believe they should exercise totally gratis as elected members. Again, let me come back to that distinction. If any constituent comes to us and wants us to act on his behalf and if disbursements are involved, of course it is proper for us to accept and handle that transfer of money. Many of us find it necessary to do so. We try to do it at arm's length. Many of us would be better off if we did not do it, and I guess many of us would prefer not to. But I can tell honourable members that in the bush it is jolly hard not to do so. Again, we do not have an office of the immigration Department just down the road. The honourable member  honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) know that people have to go a considerable distance to get to the local office. ",86
238,Mr SINCLAIR,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"Yes, there is the cost of couriers; there are all sorts of things. If people say to us, 'Is this going to be an expense to you' and they want to give us a disbursement, that should not make us 'parliamentarians charging fees'. I hope that is not what is meant. I know that the Minister will say, 'That is not intended', but I can tell him that it should not be that we cannot receive funds passing through our office for purposes for which we would prefer not to receive the moneys but only to help the person who is properly giving us money for whatever the purpose may be. But I quite seriously say that no parliamentarian should receive any fee for any service rendered. If he does, he deserves to have that particular matter identified and held against him at the next election. I am not against the others, but I do worry about those who voluntarily provide the service. I notice that the Government is going to monitor the level of revenue raised with a view to ensuring that future levels do not significantly differ from the total cost of the scheme. As I have said, I would prefer to have a fiduciary fund. Whatever we do, the administration costs seem to explode. For that reason, I have always felt that we get too many people that have to be paid, and I do not know that we will necessarily get service from them. There is, too, the professional standard, an ethical standard, that is to be prescribed in the code of conduct. I am told that the board will have powers to monitor and investigate the conduct of migration agents and may caution, suspend or deregister an agent. All of us, sadly, have met a number of these people who really have not complied with what I regard as a reasonable role. I understand why the Minister has introduced the legislation for that reason-to control their malpractices. I regret that it should be necessary. I believe that those who have acted in this way are really probably in a position where they should not now be receiving a licence, and I hope that the introduction of the legislation does mean that in future those malpractices will not occur. Having said that, I strongly say to the Minister that, if there were a fiduciary fund to which all should contribute, I would be a lot happier because that might give some recourse to the aggrieved migrant. Sadly, for many of these people these are life and death matters; they are extraordinarily emotional. We Australians find it hard to understand these matters. I do not know that just penalising a migration agent after the event is sufficient. Many of those who are aggrieved will still feel very lonely, lost and disappointed in Australia-and I do not think that is fair.",88
239,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I am happy to welcome this Migration Amendment Bill (No.3). I do not always agree with the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), especially nowadays, but on this issue I do agree with him. We have had a lot of cooperation between the committee andMr Hand-It is great to have you on our team, Andrew; that is all I can say.",88
240,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I was just making the point that this is very positive and welcome legislation. It is in some ways overdue, but the Minister is to be congratulated for bringing it in because in the past there have been all sorts of excuses offered against the idea of having this sort of legislation. Some years ago with previous Ministers we tried to bring in some legislation relating to agents. It did not work very well and became somewhat hopeless in its execution. This is much tougher legislation and I support it. I will give an example of what the legislation is trying to deal with. I had a case recently of a family from Syria who had been in Australia for some time on visitors visas visit their relatives. They wanted quite desperately, obviously because of the situation in Syria, to stay in Australia. They were approached by a Lebanese 'immigration agent' who charged them about $5,000 for services which he told them-mind you, these people did not speak good English-was necessary for his work which was to ensure that they stayed in Australia. This gentleman did not even apply under any normal immigration category for these people, but simply applied under the onshore refugee program. In applying under that program, he did not even make the most elementary effort to explain to them what was happening. They assumed that he had everything under control. The application for refugee status was signed by these people. Much later when they were arrested and asked to leave Australia, I had a look at the application. The situation was that this agent had not even bothered to put in any kind of refugee claim. He had put in the form but, in answer to every question where it started with, 'Do you claim', rather than saying yes, he had said no. All he had done essentially was to tick the no boxes, put in the form and hope that, with the long delay in processing these applications-which by the way we are now shortening-he would as a consequence be able to keep these people here. Indeed, he succeeded up to a point because they remained here as illegals for about seven or eight months before they were picked up. They did not know what had happened to them and were totally amazed when the immigration authorities came to them. They had assumed that, by paying this money following the lies that had been told to them by this so-called migration agent, they had achieved permanent residence and were able to stay in Australia. Not only had they not achieved permanent residence; they had not even achieved the first step in the refugee determination process. It is because of extreme cases of this kind, of which unfortunately there are many in some communities, that we have had to introduce the migration agents registration Bills and the Migration Agents Registration to Board. I believe that is important because it is clear that we need criteria to weed out unscrupulous activists, people who are in it simply for the money and who lie and cheat and misrepresent situations in relation to what is possible in immigration and what they actually achieve for the applicants. In that sort of context, it is important that this legislation pass and be implemented vigorously. There are some positive aspects of the legislation that I would like to highlight. The first is that private practitioners who charge money for immigration advice must be registered. People working for voluntary organisations and organisations that assist people must also be registered. That means that not only will the people who charge money have to be qualified; so too will the people who, with the best of intentions, may be so unqualified that they give people a misleading impression that they have done them a favour in terms of the Migration Act and immigration applications when they are not actually qualified at all. The fact that even people working for voluntary organisations are going to have to be registered is a very positive development. It means that the quality of people-these people, as I say, have considerable goodwill-who are serving the voluntary organisations will be sustained through this legislation. I think this is the first time we have attempted something like this and it is very important that it succeed. I would like to reply to a couple of the matters raised by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I am not aware of any parliamentarian who charges fees for immigration actions. Certainly the implication that he made, rather gratuitously, about Labor people is resented. As far as I know, parliamentarians are very reputable and work hard for their constituents in these matters. As a number of earlier speakers, including the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), mentioned, a problem occurred in the past-it will hopefully be cleared up now-when immigration agents came, either formally or informally, to members of parliament and requested their assistance. Sometimes agents have charged people for no other act than introducing them to a member of parliament. That, of course, is a rather despicable practice and needs to be ended. I hope that this matter will be taken up. Obviously parliamentarians and agents will have their roles more clearly defined. One of the most important aspects of legislation is the code of conduct. Some questions about the code of conduct came in discussion of this legislation. I think important for people to recognise that if agents are reported as having breached code of conduct then the Migration Agents Registration Board will be in an important position; it will be able to take action in relation to them. Hopefully, people representing themselves as reputable agents who try to get around the law, charge exorbitant fees or attack vulnerable people by representing them that they can actually get through the immigration law, when in fact it is much more difficult, will be caught up under the code of conduct. The system obviously is new. It deserves be given a go. I believe it has a lot of positive features which can be put to trial. I think there is a provision for reviewing lation in a couple of years time. If we find then that it has not worked properly or that some aspects need to be ironed out, we can review it. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) inner emphasised in his speech the importance penalties for people who misrepresent selves as immigration agents. I think that should be emphasised in the ethnic media once this legislation is passed. It should be made very clear to people that, if they money without authority and without the registration that is required, they will subject to heavy penalties. I think that should help to eradicate the phenomenon referred to at the beginning of my speech: people in particular communities preying the vulnerability of individuals who desperate enough to do anything to stay Australia and who, in those circumstances, pay lots of money to some unscrupulous agents. One aspect which has not been tackled in the legislation was raised by the right honourable member for New England. It concerns the question of what happens to the innocent victims of such unscrupulous immigration agents. I do not know whether the legislation provides for it, but some provision should be made for a reconsideration of the the cases of the victims of unscrupulous immigration agents so that they do not face up penalties within the Migration Act if they it is innocently-and they can establish that innocence-paid money to or went to persons the whom they believed to be agents and who ripped them off in that particular way. Going back to the example that I began with, I was particularly concerned to find that members of this particular family were totally distraught about the fact that they were unable to to stay in Australia even though they had paid moneys to someone they thought was a legitimate agent to help them achieve what they thought was a legitimate goal. With the code of conduct, we should clean up most of these practices of migration agents. We should penalise those who are working to against those practices. We should at least show some compassion in reconsidering the cases of the innocent victims of those the legisunscrupulous people.",88
241,Mr MACK,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"North Sydney) (10.08 p.m.)Most honourable members are aware of the endless procession of people going through city electorate offices, particularly those of who are, as the Minister for Immigration, themLocal Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) said, the most vulnerable in the community. Most often they have poor English; often they have a fear of authority; and often charge they have meagre finances-although not always. Many honourable members have seen be the rip-offs whereby people have lost thousands of dollars when their situation was that I hopeless from the beginning. I think all of us realise that over the last on few years there has been quite a dramatic feel growth industry in incompetent and in unscrupulous people preying on potential migrants. It is not just a local phenomenon; it is a worldwide phenomenon. Increasing numbers of refugees all around the world provide an unlimited potential. I think it is a regular occurrence now to read in the media about various scams and rip-offs in different countries. I think recently two Americans in California opened an office for six months in Poland, issued false documents and took thousands of dollars before they got out. No country in the world seems to be safe from it. I think we even have immigration scams in places as remote as the Marshall Islands. At worse, this so-called industry is malignant and heartless; at best, even when there is a genuine attempt to help people, we can say that the Department of Immigration has failed to provide enough services. In between, of course, there are many grey areas and even the most well meaning of agents can lead people on, especially when their fees are on a time basis. No one genuinely would want to admit that any case was hopeless. If, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said, members of parliament were paid fees for it, the Minister would get a lot more letters than he gets at the moment. Frankly, I believe that the work of assisting immigrants is not suitable to the free enterprise system at all. Whenever a seller or provider of services is in a position to create a demand and the profit motive is at work, it is inevitable that there will be a huge expansion of services and massive costs incurred, as we have seen in the medical and pharmaceutical professions. This is particularly so when dealing with people who have language difficulties. They are often at times prepared to bend the truth because they see that their personal survival is at stake. So I think it is less suitable in this area. I think the legislation is certainly conscienthe tious and very well meaning. Hopefully it will solve some problems. But I think it is really heading in the same direction as the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has proceeded for some years, a direction which has led us into what many people would see as an almost impenetrable labyrinth of bureaucracy, as we have at the moment. I certainly do not agree with the President of the New South Wales Law Society, who says: In many respects the Minister appears to be contemplating remedial measures which will be enormously more horrific than the evils with which they are intended to deal. It is a classic example of reaching for a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. I certainly do not agree with the objections set out by the New South Wales Law Society in its submission, which, frankly, I think is a lot of self-serving pap. I do agree that the setting up of a registration board-plus an appeals mechanism, plus all the bureaucracy that will go with it-will further complicate the whole immigration procedure. I do not see any reason why we cannot legislate for the code of conduct and do everything possible to eliminate what is in fact a parasitic profession. The normal legal processes are not affected by this legislation; they can continue. But I do not believe we should be entrenching an activity when in my experience over two years, which I guess is not all that extensive, I have not seen a single redeeming feature in the whole function of immigration agents. I think the services of the Department should be improved to provide the services that people really need. Finally, even though I know the Minister is well meaning when he says the procedure will be revenue neutral, I do not believe there is any conceivable way that that will occur. We will get a dramatic increase in costs to the migrants themselves and we will get a dramatic increase in costs to the public.",90
242,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (10.13 p.m.)-in reply-Because of time of evening, I will be brief. I wish first of all to express my appreciation to honourable members on both sides of the House, and to those who sit in the middle also, for their contributions. Mr Mack-All sides.",91
243,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"I thank all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate. As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said, the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3), the Migration Agents Registration (Application) Levy Bill and the Migration Agents Registration (Renewal) Levy Bill have been a while coming. I represent an electorate which deals with a large number of migrant cases, probably as many as if not more than most-certainly the most in Victoria, I guess-and I have had a lot to do with people who have suffered at the hands of migration agents. I hope these crooks will be squeezed out of the system by this legislation. Earlier someone said that one cannot legislate skulduggery completely out of our society. That is true. But I think we can try. I take on board the thrust of what was said by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) on their views about regulation or this type of approach. Nonetheless, in the absence of some other method, or system, I have to say that I think this is the best approach at this point time. However, although those honourable members came at it from slightly different directions, if their suggestions could be worked up into a proposition which had meat, at the end of two years when this legislation is to be reviewed alternative propositions could be considered. As I will not be here, I have no objection to that. However, that is the challenge, if you like-reviewing the process at the end of two years. It is a challenge for this House and the chamber across the way. If this system needs refining, honourable members ought to get to work as individuals or through the committee of which the honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) are members and monitor the operation of this legislation during the two years so that at the end of that periodMr Ruddock-Is that a reference?",91
244,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"It is not a reference; it is a challenge to the honourable member for Dundas, as a member of this House, to monitor something that I know he believes in and has believed in for some time, that is, to ensure that people do not get ripped off. It is a challenge to the honourable member' to monitor it. After 12 or 18 months he may put it to the Minister of the day-who will probably be on this side of the House, so the honourable 'member will still be able to put it as a shadow Minister. He may put it that this ought to be a reference to the committee of which the honourable member for Dundas is the Deputy Chairman so that it can be looked at and worked on before the end of the two years. It is a challenge to the House. I hope that this legislation will go a long way towards preventing some of the people who operate in this field from practising. We all know that some of those people have ripped large sums of money out of the pockets of the poor, and the rich. They have bled people, young and old, over the years. Hopefully this legislation will stop that, or go a long way towards stopping it. As the right honourable member for New England said, one cannot legislate honesty. That is true. But we can, as sure as hell, make in a bit of a dive at trying to harness the crooks who exist in our society to pull them into gear. A couple of honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Dundas and the right honourable member for New England, talked about the question of rural practitioners. Mr Riggall-And the honourable member for MCMillan.",92
245,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION,"The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) mentioned it as well, as I think did members on my own side. Between now and the time that this legislation goes to the Senate I am prepared to look at the matters raised in regard to people practising in rural areas. I offer no solution at this point, because the issue, as anyone who examines it will see, is not an easy one to deal with. I give an undertaking to seriously examine it. I would also like to place on record my thanks for the. cooperation of the Caucus committee that helped me with this. Despite the support that the honourable member for Calwell started off with, about how he sometimes supports me, we are on the same team and I am grateful for his support. I am also grateful to the officers of the Department. I do not think it is realised how difficult this piece of legislation was to draft or how difficult it was in tenus of drafting instructions to the draftsman. Nor is the enonnous amount of consultation that officers of the Department had with various people who work in this particular field-the legal profession, agents and other community groups who wanted to provide input to this legislationrecognised. A lot of work has been done, and that is why I am confident that the legislation will work. There has been a long period of consultation and discussion, working through the hooks in the proposal and ironing out the wrinkles, and coming up with this legislation, which I am sure will work. My thanks to all members who have been involved in the debate, and I also express my appreciation of the support of the Opposition for the legislation through its shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas.",92

Education: Scholarship Scheme",93
248,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"O'Connor) (10.21 p.m.)Tonight there are two students in the gallery who are visiting the Parliament from my electorate. They are the thirty-first and thirtysecond students to participate in my annual scholarship scheme which has been operating since 1983. The two girls are Rachel O'Malley from the Stella Maris Presentation College in Geraldton and Katherine Burnett from the Central Midlands Senior High School in Moora. I take this opportunity to thank Ansett Airlines of Australia for its assistance in transporting the students to Canberra. As my guests they are here to learn at first hand the operations of this Parliament and to visit some of the points of interest in Canberra. Part of this arrangement is that my guests prepare a speech for me to deliver to the Parliament. I will now proceed to do just that. Katherine writes that the town of Moorasituated approximately 188 kilometres northeast of Perth-has a population of 1,750 people while the surrounding shire has a population of 3,200. Moora was gazetted on 12 April 1895, became a road board on 11 December 1908, and a shire from 1 July 1961. Around the year 1900 the town consisted of a galvanised iron hotel, a small store-post office, a police station and a courthouse which also served as a school for 10 students. Now considerably larger it has many additional services, including local businesses, emergency services, numerous sporting associations and educational facilities ranging from pre-school through to tertiary entrance subjects. Community-based projects, such as the frail aged lodge, mean that many elderly residents who, having worked to ensure the town would flourish and prosper, are cared for adequately in a homely atmosphere. The construction of the community recreational centre has given the district an establishment to cover a wide variety of sports and benefited the town and surrounding areas. The opening of the Central Midlands Senior High School in 1975 means that years 11 and 12 courses can now be studied in Moora, instead of these students having to attend schools in Perth. Notwithstanding that Central Midlands is the smallest senior high school in Western Australia, it is also the only such school between Perth and Geraldton, and thus services a very large area. St James Residential College, catering for 30 residents, is a short distance from the school and provides accommodation for' students from outlying regions up to a distance of 150 kilometres. As well as providing the basic TEE and non-TEE subjects, Central Midlands provides one of the few equine management courses available in country schools, and the chance for students to learn drama, compete in drama festivals and, this year, take part in the Rock Eisteddfod. Central Midlands boasts a 33 per cent entrance to university by graduating students and a general high level of academic achievement. The school is also proud of its sporting achievements with successes at the annual country week competitions in athletics and swimming. Moora and the Central Midlands Senior High School have progressed from humble beginnings and have prospered and grown, making them both highly beneficial to the district and its residents. Rachel writes that the coastal city of Geraldton, 420 kilometres north of Perth, with a population of 21,500, is the heart of a busy farming, fishing, commercial, light industrial, sporting and cultural area. Established in 1850 when the first pastoral leases were occupied and developed, the settlers soon exposed the area's agricultural potential and mineral wealth, including lead, copper and coal, although these minerals are now depleted. These findings led to the growth and population which accelerated clearing of arable land for agricultural purposes. The area has assumed new prominence with the opening of the Dongara natural gas field and the exploration of mineral sands at Eneabba. The agricultural industry is evident in the area with wheat and lupin crops together with pastures for the grazing of fat lambs and wool production. The Central West Coast, which is known as the mid-west, is one of the major production areas of rock lobster fishing in Australiaand, dare I say it, the world. The product is exported to the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and Europe. The growth of the fishing industry in the region has brought about the establishment of many support industries, resulting in employment opportunities and economic prosperity for the region generally. Geraldton's inviting beaches are visited by windsurfers from all over the world who come for the famous winds and waves. Stella Maris Presentation College is a Catholic girls day-boarding secondary school with 390 students. Established in 1891 by the Irish Presentation Sisters, last year the school celebrated its centenary year. Stella Maris is involved in many active projects for the community, including fundraising activities for overseas missions and various door knock appeals. The school is host to exchange students from overseas. Extra-curricula involvement includes athletics, swimming, netball, hockey, tennis, art exhibitions, junior city council-of which Rachel is the deputy mayor-and theatre productions. The school also participates in maths, science, literary and public speaking competitions, gaining commended results.",93
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Macedonia,95
250,Dr BOB WOODS,ADJOURNMENT,"It is my purpose to speak tonight in no uncertain terms against the recent proposal by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) that Australia recognise an independent state under the name of Macedonia. My position on this matter is absolutely clear: Australia should·not recognise any state with the name of Macedonia. It is my strong personal belief that this ALP proposal is severely flawed in several respects. First, recognition of the former Yugoslav republic as Macedonia would reveal an ignorance and an insensitivity on the part of Australia of the history of the region. Secondly, it is contrary to Australia's foreign policy to foster potential destabilisation or to undermine international friends of long standing. Recognition of the former Yugoslav republic as Macedonia would do just those things. From an historical perspective, the clear of the matter is that there already exists a Macedonia, and that Macedonia is Greek. Macedonia has been the name of northern Greece for more than 3,000 years. It currently has a population of 2.8 millioil of whom per cent of all inhabitants identify themselves as ethnically Greek. There are 60,000 arfanning chaeological finds, not to mention biblical references, that confirm that the ancient Macedonians were Greek in language, culture and religion. Indeed, the mythical home of the Greece. Greek gods themselves was set in Macedonia. Let me be absolutely direct: when we speak of Macedonia, we are speaking about what has always been Greek, what is Greek and does what should, by rights, remain Greek. Who then are the people now calling themselves Macedonians? Simply put, they are a small group of the specifically Slav Macedonian population in the former Yugosformer lav republic which is hijacking the name and long history of Greek Macedonia. It must be noted that this process was partially set in train by the infamous communist despot Tito. In order to forge Yugoslavia at the end of World War II, Tito did a number of deals. What emerged was the Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Macedonia, whose hand-picked communist leaders set about the task of promoting a Slav Macedonia nationality in order to preserve their dictator's balance of power and to eventually create a so-called greater Macedonian state. Indeed, until 1944 there are no statistics, no history books and no ethnographic maps to identify the specific nationality which we now call Slav Macedonia. It should also be made clear that the first Slavs arrived in the region some 1,500 years after the Greek word Macedonia came into usage and some 1,000 after Alexander the Great. In contemporary parlance, and with all due respect for my colleagues from that beautiful State, who would accept the notion of Australia renaming Tasmania as New Zealand and then beginning to appropriate the real New Zealand's history as its own? No-one would condone such a hijacking of historical heritage. Let us not forget that Tito picked the name Macedonia for his buffer republic with a fact sinister aim in mind-to lay the groundwork for future territorial claims to parts of Greece bearing the same name. This is a fact confirmed by any number of sources, including US Government reports of the time. It is 98.5 disturbing that now a very small group of Slavic Macedonians are now once again that expansionist flame. The Prime Minister of Greece described the proposals as a time bomb and an insurmountable obstacle between relations of the new state and Therefore, it is clear that history argues against the recognition·of a state appropriating the name Macedonia. More importantly, so contemporary political reality. Specifically, Greece-our ally of long standing and a nation with whom we have enjoyed decades of close cultural and political ties-perceives the use of that name by the people in the Yugoslav republic as provocative. The lessons of the turbulent region have taught Greece the importance of caution in these matters. Greece does not make its stand unilaterally. The honourable member for Stirling and his colleagues should know that the EEC meeting recently preserved the name Macedonia if the recognition of the republic were under a different name. The EC sees that not only Greece but others in the Balkan region have real interests in ensuring that one problem does not supplant another; that is, destabilised relations between countries in the region. By granting recognition to a state called Macedonia, Australia would be unfortunately and unwisely distancing itself from this thoughtful and measured international approach. What we should be doing, of course, is acknowledging the reality that Yugoslavia is no more, going ahead with the process of recognising its former republics as separate and independent entities, and also bearing in mind the constraints of the region's realities. In this respect I am proud of my own dual record as a strong and early supporter of Croatian and Slovenian independence and an advocate of an international peace process in former Yugoslavia. Indeed, the Government in Skopje has a right to be recognised as the Government of an independent state. It has fulfilled the international criteria. However, Skopje has wrongly taken for itself what does not belong to it: the distinct and highly cherished historical legacy of Greek Macedonia, including its traditional name. Recognition of an independent state bearing the name Macedonia would make Australia a g1.lilty party in that process, and that would highly regrettable. In the name of historical fair justice and regional stability, Australia should follow the lead of the EC and not grant recognition until the matter of the name is adequately resolved. Our interests lie with keeping the record straight and not throwing petrol on fires abroad. Australia and the international community must not accept the destabilisation of the region which will take place if the international community endorses the expansionist propaganda cultivated by a communist regime over 40 years. It is clear that the recognition of Skopje using the name Macedonia will be followed by a resurgence of this propaganda, which is expansionist and mainly directed against Greek Macedonia. I urge this House to reject this proposal emanating from the Labor Party. Insurance",95
251,Mr SNOW,ADJOURNMENT,"Eden-Monaro) (10.31 p.m.)In 1972 Mr Jeff Gates and a number of other people, including members of his family, bought insurance policies on the grounds that they would yield approximately $92,000. Mr Gates bought the policies assuming that they were legitimate and that he would be able to recover the amount in the event of accident in particular. One or two of the policies were life policies and Mr Gates had them converted at a later date. The policies Mr Gates bought from CML in 1972 each had sums assured of $5,000. In 1975 he bought another life policy which was connected to the education of his children in the sum of approximately $20,000. He then had three policies. In 1977 he took out another two policies, one for life of $20,000 and one for personal sickness and accident of $5,000. All of the polices were altered by agreement with the firm so that he was eligible for disability and other benefits. One of the policies relating to personal sickness and accident was different from the others, but the total value was, on his calculation, approximately $100,000 and, on the calculation of the insurance firm, approximately $92,000. However, when he went to claim on the policies for a back injury be which has been substantiated by medical evidence, he was told that he would need to return to work before he would receive payment. This was wrong advice. In fact, he would have breached his contract had he returned to work, and the insurance company would not have had to payout. Legal action was then taken. As a result of the legal action Mr Gates and his associate were awarded approximately $60,000, $30,000 short of the total amount due. Mr Gates has continued to take legal action since that date, and I believe he has been unfairly treated by lawyers who have represented him and by the insurance firm. For instance, if he had been able to recover the full amounts, he would have been at least $541,000 better off, taking into account interest on the cashing of the policies; loss from the forced sale of a restaurant plus 15 per cent interest or, natively, loss of income amounting to $450,000; his loss of opportunity to earn moneys from building-his own professioncalculated at $30,000 for 12 years, amounting to $360,000; loss of rents from his villas of $10,000 per annum or, alternatively, loss of the sale value, amounting to $100,000; loss of opportunity to earn moneys from a horsedrawn carriage licence, amounting to $60,000; loss of plant and equipment amounting to $10,000; and interest paid on borrowed moneys amounting to $20,000. The subtotal of those amounts to be divided between Mr Gates and Ms K. Linegar would have amounted to just over $1.5m. Other damages amounted to approximately $1.8m. An enormous amount was lost because of the fraudulent action, he believes, taken originally in 1972 and the subsequent inability of people to represent him properly. It is a dreadful event in anyone's life when that person cannot claim a full amount that is due under his or her insurance policies. Mr Gates has given me full evidence on the matter. (Time expired) Overseas Aid",96
252,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Last month in this Parliament House the Australian Council for Overseas Aid launched an alternative aid plan entitled Aid for a Change. Aid for a Change sets out to illustrate how Australian overseas aid could be reshaped to give greater priority than is currently the case to tackling poverty and to promoting sustainable human development. It also sets out to show how the quality of Australian aid could be improved by 1995. A local Australian Volunteers Abroad worker, Ms Ann Cooper, came to my electorate office in Toowoomba to outline the salient features of that plan, and I undertook, if the occasion arose, to read into Hansard the salient features of the Aid for a Change project. Aid for a Change illustrates how Australian overseas aid could be reshaped to give greater priority to tackling poverty and promoting sustainable human development, as I said earlier. The organisation says that Australian aid must have a stronger focus on poverty alleviation and ecologically sustainable alter- development. The Council estimates that projects which directly targeted the poor were only about 37 per cent of the 1990-91 Government aid expenditure. The rest of the programs promoted economic growth without attention to whether the poor would benefit from that growth and, in the Council's view, this clearly needs to be changed. The development program has called for greater attention to what it calls social priority areas, including primary health care, basic education, family planning, rural water supply, income generating opportunities for the poor, and the like. Aid for a Change places strong emphasis on three specific initiatives. The first, entitled Promise the children, is an Australian contribution to achieving the goals of the World Summit for Children. The second is entitled Environment and refers to assistance to meet people's needs without placing undue pressure on already threatened environments. The final program is entitled Women: the key to development, and involves aid to enhance the contribution of women to the economic, social and cultural life of their countries and to address the many inequalities which they face. The main elements of the plan include a stronger focus on poorer countries, especially in Africa, where aid should increase from the current 3.5 per cent to 10 per cent by 199495; much greater emphasis on human development through social priority areas, such as primary health care, basic literacy and education, family planning and rural water supply, and income creation opportunities for the poor; a redirection of aid to Papua New Guinea so that it benefits the rural majority through assistance for literacy, employment, social development, health and environmental protection; in the Pacific, a strong focus on protecting natural resources which villages depend upon for their livelihoods, and assisting rural development; increased assistance to the poorest countries in South East Asia, including Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos; and a new regional program for South East Asia to include health and HIV AIDS initiatives, environmental projects, population and demographic research programs, and assistance to regional human rights and women's organisations. I for one-I have to say that the Opposition in general does not agree with the specific detail of what has been put forward-endorse much of the thrust of what is contained in this very good plan which the Council has put forward.",97
253,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (10.41 p.m.)Tonight I would like to speak about something that has become part of Aussie folklore and something that has been ridiculed and derided by those on the other side of the House over the last few months. I want to talk about mates and what mates stands for. The word 'mates' is an Australian idiom that indicates friendship: friendship built up over times of war, times of sport, and during the Great Depression when mates had to carry their swag, jump the rattler and go from town to town looking for jobs. People are mates when it comes to playing on the football field or on the cricket field. It refers to friendships that go back to when people were mates at school. It is something that we in the Labor Party hold dear. We are proud of this terminology. Mates and mateship go back to when people joined the Party and worked together to try to improve other people's lots. They tried to improve welfare and the situation for pensioners and those people less fortunate than themselves. Great people like Henry Lawson often wrote proudly about mateship. We can be very proud of mateship. I am very disappointed that the term mates, which we are so proud of, is ridiculed by the Opposition. This ridicule comes from the same people who want to tum their backs on Australian slang and the Australian way of life and bow to the British Establishment and go back to the old traditional ways. It is really a psychological difference. The Aussie way is different. It was exhibited by the mateship at the shearer's camp in 1891. There was mateship in all of those early tough battles that the trade union movement fought; there was mateship on the sporting field; mateship in New Guinea; and mateship in the desert during World War II. When the Opposition comes into this House and ridicules the term mates, it is ridiculing a part of Aussie folklore. It is ironic that those opposite are the throwbacks to the British traditionalists. Nothing has really changed in that regard. I remember my grandfather telling me when I was a boy about the way in which Menzies was more Mates interested in Britain than Australia during the war and how he left us defenceless. When we talk about history-and we have debates in this House about the war; about the truth-the Opposition does not like it. When we get up and talk about standing up for the rights of workers, the Opposition does not like it. The Opposition is about division-divide and rule. That is the difference between us and them. That is why those opposite do not understand the meaning of the word mate. That is why they do not like the term matebecause it is Australian terminology. It is not British; one will not find the term mate in the British Establishment or in the private schools in England. But one will find it on the sporting fields in Australia, in the pubs and right across the Australian way of life. When one looks at the policies of the Opposition,. one can understand why it does not like terms such as mate.",98
254,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT,They hate mates.,98
255,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"Exactly; they hate the average Aussie worker. They hate anyone who is proud to stand up and say, 'We're different, we're separate and we're Australian'. It is iroriic that one of the leading conservative organisations in Queensland today-the United Graziers Association-has criticised me and said that I am guilty of discrimination for standing up and saying that Aussie shearers should be employed instead of people from other countries who break awards. That is the sort of attitude it has. It is un-Australian. Honourable members on the other side of the House posture with flags-some of them are not even the right colour and some of them are made in Taiwan. But when it comes to sticking up for Aussie principles and when it comes to sticking up for mateship-which is about giving people a fair go-where do we find them? Where do we find them with regard to Tasmania? We find them siding with APPM, trying to destroy award conditions. Where do we find them when it comes to sticking up for the shearers and fighting for award conditions? We find them out there wanting to support scabs and break down conditions. We will look at what those opposite say about employment. I quoted last week from Natasha Bita's article. It says that the Fightback package: . . . bans employers from paying a wage rate of unemployment benefit received by the job applicant. That is what those opposite are about. They want to create a Burnie over all the rural areas of Australia. They want to do an LA wherever they can. As they have said, they want to put troops on the waterfront. That is why they do not understand what the term mate means; and they never will. It is not part of their vocabulary. When it comes to grovelling to the British and the inbred members of the aristocracy, that is different, they are happy to do that. But when it comes to looking at mateship and understanding about a fair go for our pensioners and the disabled, those opposite do not understand it. They want to put a tax on food and clothes and they want to tax services. They want to tax everything that the Aussie battler has to have as the necessities of life. Fightback! - Tourism Industry",98
256,Mrs BAILEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to talk initially about an Aussie word that the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) did not mention. That is the expression 'fair go'. That is exactly what the honourable member for Hinkler will learn about from what I am going to say now. The Fightback plan is all about giving people a fair go. Tonight I want to talk about how the Fightback plan will actually give my constituents in MCEwen a fair go. I will speak about the advantages that will come from the tourism industry. I have spoken in this House on many occasions about the unemployment crisis that we are facing. The honourable member for Hinkler is leaving the chamber; he knows that people are not getting a fair go. Young Australians, in particular, certainly do not get a fair go under this Government. One industry with enormous potential which can play a vital role in reducing youth unemployment and giving them a fair go is the tourism industry. It is already Australia's fastest growing industry. In less than 10 years, the number of tourists arriving in Australia has trebled. The industry is now the largest private sector employer and the biggest earner below the of foreign exchange for the nation. Tourism has a very important role to play in my electorate of MCEwen, particularly in rural towns which are facing such enormous hardships during this depression and where youth unemployment is as high as 40 per cent or 50 per cent. They are certainly not getting a fair go. Tourism helps to promote local production and stimulates demand in the local economy, thus creating employment. All benefits which can help communities to weather the downturn in farmers' incomes and commodity prices are to be encouraged. There is an enormous potential for tourism to expand in my electorate of MCEwen, which takes in some of the most beautiful areas of Victoria. But much of the industry has been held back by this Labor Government's policies. It has not had a fair go. The tourism industry in MCEwen has not been able to realise its full potential because this Government maintains a restrictive international aviation policy that limits the number of tourists entering the country. It has failed to address the urgent need for labour market reform in the tourism industry, and it retains a cumbersome taxation system, which has inhibited investment and incentive, and inadequate infrastt:ucture. Given the industry's undisputed potential and the important role it plays, it is a matter of urgency that these problems be resolved. The coalition recognises this and realises that tourism can be a major force in the resurrection of the Australian economy. If these problems I have just mentioned and, in particular, the inequities of our labour market \ \ Tuesday, 2 June 1992 refonn and taxation systems are resolved, people will then get a fair go. The policies contained in Fightback will achieve this and enable the industry to grow. Most importantly, they will lead the way in job creation for young Australians. Under the coalition, the days of crippling penalty rates and unrealistic award conditions-which are among the greatest constraints on the tourism industry-will go. Instead, the coalition will encourage voluntary agreements .and contracts based on productivity, rewards and incentives for excellence, for the mutual benefit of employer and employee. This will benefit the thousands of small business operators who are the backbone of the tourism industry in Australia and especially in MCEwen. Studies have shown that the tourism industry paid about $1 billion in sales tax in 1990-91, whilst Australian industry paid about $5.9m in payroll tax. The abolition of sales tax and payroll tax alone would provide massive relief for tourism operators and enable them to hire more people and give them a fair go. Under a coalition government, tourism operators will no longer pay fuel tax, payroll tax, training guarantee levy or superannuation levy and they will get a refund for any GST they pay on business inputs. In other words, we will remove all those taxes which presently impede not just growth, but also the very viability of business, especially tourism businesses. Personal income tax amounting to a record $13 billion will give Australians more money in their pockets for holidays and will certainly give them a fair go. (Time expired) Political Parties: Queensland",99
257,Mr LAVARCH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, you and honourable members will be very familiar with the fable of Trojan horse. That particular fable, of course, in many ways symbolises the process by which deception can be used in' order to penetrate the ranks of one's enemies. In Queensland, the fable of the Trojan horse has come in many ways to be symbolic with the actions of Liberal and National Party members who over recent years have had a REPRESENTATIVES 3401 very great fondness for moving freely from one side to another. The most commonly understood example of this phenomenon was Messrs Lane and Austin, Liberal Party State Ministers, who, after the 1983 State election, actually left the Liberal Party and joined the National Party under Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen so that the National Party had a clear majority in its own right. Lane and Austin found themselves in some strife after that particular adventure, not related to that move, but they were not the only ones. At that time it was very· popular for members of the Liberal Party to leave the Liberal Party and end up as State National Party MPs. Included in those ranks were Mrs Beryce Nelson, who was a Liberal Party MP for the State seat of Aspley, and Mr Gilbert Alison, who was the Liberal Party member for Maryborough, both of whom ended up in the National Party. But after the 1989 State election, when the National Party lost office, the pendulum swung a lot. Now we have the opposite phenomenon occurring.·· We have former Nationals now joining the Liberal Party in this same sort of Trojan horse approach. Tonight I want to talk about the most bizarre example of this particular phenomenon, and that is in the fonn of one Peter Slipper. Peter Slipper joined the Federal Parliament in 1984. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) would know him well. He joined the House in 1984, elected as a National Party MP for the seat of Fisher. Mr Slipper came through the National Party with excellent credentials. He did his time with the Young National Party movement, served as a campaign director, got his chance and won the seat of Fisher in 1984. But he was not just the ordinary run-of the-mill National Party backbencher. This the particular gentlemen was right at the forefront of the old 'Joh for PM' campaign. I know honourable members who were here at the time will remember it well. He was one of those who were strident in support of the National Party. He felt that the Liberal Party was made up of a group of wimps and that it would not get there-John Howard would not win the 1987 election. According to Mr Slipper, the only way for Australia to be delivered from the socialist evil was for Joh to run for Prime Minister. Of course, Mr Slipper, along with a few other Nationals, very enthusiastically left the coalition and formed the so-called Joh Nationals. They attacked viciously, among other' things, the idea that Australia one day might have a consumption tax or anything like that. The rage at the time was the Joh flat tax; and Mr Slipper, of course, was a very strong supporter of that. Come the 1987 election and misfortune approached Mr Slipper; he lost that particular poll. After he sought preselection for the National Party in the seat of Groom, when Mr MCVeigh retired. That seat was obviously won at that time by Mr Taylor. He then sought preselection for the National Party in the seat of Wide Bay. He opposed John Stone and tried to get National Party preselection in' the seat of Fairfax. On each of the four occasions on which he tried to get National Party preselection, he failed. The next time. I ran across Mr Slipper was on election day for the State election in 1989. He was handing out how-to-vote cards for the National Party at one of the polling booths in the electorate and I exchanged pleasantries with him. That was in December 1989. The next time. I heard of him was in early January 1990, about two or three weeks after the State poll. Lo and behold, a little piece appeared in the Courier-Mail saying that one Peter Neil Slipper had joined the Liberal Party. We could not believe it. The Liberal Party is so bereft of talent in the Fisher area that Mr . Slipper now reappears as the Liberal Party candidate for Fisher-the Joh National, the flat tax National, the person who was against the consumption tax, is now the declared Liberal Party candidate in the seat of Fisher. I will declare my interest or people will think that I might be against Mr Slipper because he is running against me. Due to the redistribution I will be running in the seat of Dickson, so I will not actually be confronting Mr Slipper. Mr Slipper may even be successful, given the figures on the redistribution, but coming back in here will be the classic example of a Trojan horse, the Joh National who-forgive my cynicism-has apparently had the road to Damascus conversion and will reappear, possibly in this House, as a Liberal Party coalitionist MP. I warn the Liberal Party members who are here, and those who recall Mr Slipper, to be very, very careful and not take things at face value. Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories",100
258,Mr RIGGALL,ADJOURNMENT,"MCMillan) (10.56 p.m.)Tonight I rise to bring to the notice of the House that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) that, has probably taken off on her trip to Rio where she is going to represent Australia in this world forum on the environment. I think we should look at her record. The record over the last few days has shown that she does not do her homework. That has been well documented. It is a tragedy that this Minister, who holds an important portfolio, is found to be incompetent. Let us look back a bit further at her credentials in relation to the greenhouse effect. I refer to the Channel 9 Sunday program of about four weeks ago, on which it was reported quite clearly that she did not understand the argument about greenhouse. She kept saying, 'What if; what if the scientists are wrong?'. She did not give a balanced opinion, but a 'what if' opinion. I was led to wonder about this Minister, who has taken a biased opinion, who has been driven by the environmental movement and who really does not understand all the arguments on greenhouse and that the umpire is still out. I repeat: the umpire is still out. At this stage, the scientific evidence, including the latest satellite data, in relation to greenhouse right across the world shows no evidence that the oceans are warming, none whatsoever. Greenhouse is driven by computer models, not necessarily by facts. There is great dispute in the scientific world. However, this Minister is to go and represent us at Rio. God knows what she will say! God knows what she will do there! God knows how she will misrepresent the Australian position! I bring to light two things. In my electorate I happen to have perhaps the greatest brown coal deposit in the world. In fact, it represents 28 per cent of Australia's total energy reserve and it is currently used to generate power. Victoria's economy is very much reliant on that power generation. It has one problem. It is too wet; the water content is too high. But great advances in technology mean that it is possible to dry up that coal. I bring it to the notice of the House that such advances are going ahead. The 10 or 15 per cent levy to be applied under a coal tax or a greenhouse tax that the Minister may try to bring in, may not be acceptable to the industry in Victoria and Australia. I warn honourable members of that. The other point that I would like to raise very quickly is my disturbing discovery when I was in Kakadu recently-this pristine World Heritage area-that there were several hundred wild horses roaming through the area and having a great impact on the environment. It seems to me that the Minister totally ignores this. Why does she totally ignore the fact that these exotic animals are roaming through Kakadu when they ought to be mustered and taken out of there because of the damage to the natural environment and the impact on the native animals? Why does she insist on leaving them there? I call on the Minister quite seriously in this regard. Is she interested in the environment or is she interested in a quasi political point of view that will bow to the pressures of the time? Surprise, surprise, the pressure of the time in Kakadu is that the local indigenous people have an affinity with the horses from their days as stockmen. They like to see the horses there, despite the fact that they are having this dramatic impact on the environment. This is a Minister with duplicity and a misunderstanding of the environment, a Minister that will make decisions for political expediency; not one who is fair dinkum in her portfolio. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.01 p.m. NA Mr Cobb to move That this House: (1) notes with pleasure the recent visit to Australia of the Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate; (2) recognises that Tibet, including those areas incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Quinghai, is an occupied country under established principles of international law; and (3) supports the UN Resolution 1723 of 1963 calling for the cessation of practices which deprive the Tibetan people of their freedoms, including their right to self-determination.

Navigation Act-Navigation (Orders) Regulations-Orders-1992-No. 7 - Marine, Part 34. Public Service Act-Determinations-1992Nos 18, 32, 47, 48, 49, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 64, 65. The following answers to questions were circulated: Aboriginal Legal Affairs: Mount Isa (Question No. 1064) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 10 September 1991: How many Aboriginal legal officers were employed at Mt Isa in each financial year since 1989-90 and what sum was each paid in each year. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has advised me that two legal officers (lawyers) were employed by the Aboriginal Legal Service in Mount Isa in both the 1989/90 and 1990/91 financial years. The total amount paid in salary to the two legal officers was $90,000 in 1989/90 and $92,040 in 1990/91. The amount allocated for salaries was paid as retainer to the principal solicitor who in tum retained a junior solicitor. The Legal Service itself has no record of the private contractual arrangements entered into between the principal solicitor and his associate. Sacred Sex (Question No. 1383) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 4 March 1992: (1) Did the ABC invest in the production of the film Sacred Sex; if so, (a) what sum and (b) why. (2) Did the film have an Australian connection; if so, what was it. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether the film was assessed as having artistic merit; if so, (a) in what respect and (b) by whom was it assessed. (4) Is the Minister also able to say whether there is a connection between the film and the Rajneesh religious group; if so, (a) were those involved in recommending investment aware of that connection, (b) when did they become aware of the connection and (c) why did they recommend investment if they were so aware.",101
259,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the folNA lowing answer to the honourable member's question, based in part· on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: (1) Advice from the ABC, and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories is that in 1990 the Australian Film Finance Corporation (AFFC) invested $205,474 in a one hour television documentary to be called Sacred Sex. The producers, Triple Image Films, found that they had enough material to make a longer R-rated film for cinema release. This film contains a large amount of material which will not be shown on television. No funds were invested by the AFFC or the ABC in th"" making of the cinema version. (a) The ABC prepurchased the documentary for $60,000 on the proviso that it would be suitable for transmission in an appropriate timeslot. (b) It was considered that the proposal outlined a program which would reach acceptable television standards and would deal seriously with issues of interest to a large number of ordinary Australians. (2) The film was produced by an Australian production company and received tOBA accreditation. The original script contained considerable Australian material, which was subsequently filmed but edited from the final production. (3) (a) The television version of Sacred Sex was assessed as a documentary by the ABC's Documentary Department. (b) The final television program (as distinct from the longer cinema version) was assessed and passed by the ABC's assessors as being suitable for transmission in prime time with an AO warning. (4) The producer of the program was a former member of the Rajneesh. The ABC was given a verbal assurance that she had severed her connection with the sect several years before production commenced and that she was no longer a member of the group. Road Accidents Involving Motorcycles (Question No. 1438) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 25 March 1992: (1) What percentage of crashes involving a motorcycle in Australia also involve another form of vehicle. (2) How many of the crashes referred to in part (1) occurred in daylight. (3) In how many of the crashes referred to in part (2) did the motorcycle not have a light on. (4) In how many of the crashes referred to in part (3) did the motorcycle and the other vehicle approach each other on a parallel path. (5) In how many of the crashes referred to in part (4) did the driver of the other vehicle claim not to have seen the motorcycle. (6) In how many of the crashes referred to in part (5) was the vision of the other driver not obscured by some physical object. (7) In how many of the crashes referred to in part (6) did the motorcycle approach the other vehicle within the driver's (a) central field of vision and (b) rear vision. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Of 322 fatal accidents involving motorcycles in 1988 (which is the most recent year for which nationally consistent data are currently available), 184 involved another form of vehicle. This represents some 57% of fatal motorcycle crashes. (2) Of the 184 crashes referred to in part (1), 119 occurred in daylight. (3) Of the 119 crashes referred to in part (2), the motorcycle headlight was: - on in 15 cases - off in 56 cases - unknown in 48 cases (4) In 72 of the 104 crashes referred to in part (3) in which the motorcycle light was not known to be on, the vehicles approached each other on a parallel path. (5) The driver of the other vehicle claimed not to have seen the motorcycle in 16 of the crashes referred to in part (4). (6) There is no record of a physical obstruction in any of the crashes referred to in part (5). (7) Of the 16 crashes referred to in part (5) cross referenced in part (6), it is estimated from vehicle motions that the motorcycle approached the other vehicle within the driver's central field of vision in 11 cases, and within the rear field of vision in 5 cases. The 16 cases referred to in part (7) include 8 cases where the motorcycle's headlight was definitely off, and 8 cases where it was not known whether or not the headlight was on. This means that a minimum of 8 crashes, or 2.5 % of total motorcycle crashes comply with the conditions specified in the questions. A maximum of 16 crashes, or 5% of total crashes may have fitted the conditions. The best estimate is about 4.4 % - this is reached by assuming that the cases in which it was not known whether the motorcycle light was on were distributed similarly to the known cases. If this series of questions is intended to determine the number of accidents that may be prevented by the introduction of ADR 19/01, then it should be noted that there are several questionable assumptions inherent in its structure. Consideration only of crashes fulfilling the above conditions is likely to underestimate the number of crashes that may be affected by this measure. For example it cannot be assumed that conspicuity could only be a factor in cases in which the driver actually stated that he failed to see the motorcyclist; a driver may have seen the rider too late to avoid a crash, or may have failed to see but not reported the fact. The questions falsely assume that only accidents involving vehicles travelling on a parallel path are relevant when considering motorcycle conspicuity. The presumption is that lights only improve visibility when they appear within the driver's central field of vision - This is not so. There is evidence that lights can also be effective in peripheral vision. It also assumes that drivers do not tum their heads or move their eyes when approaching an intersection. This would be a practice which could not be long sustained under real ""driving conditions. If only the absence of adjacent crashes was corrected for, the figure arrived at using the same structure as the above question is around 7 %. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Employment Goals (Question No. 1494) Mr Langmore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Minister's Department giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any departmental activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Economic recovery and reduction of unemployment are closely related to Australia's role in the world economy and Australia's ability to trade internationally. Improvement of Australia's international trade and economic performance is a major objective of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The honourable member will be aware that the Department does not have direct policy responsibility for all the means of macroeconomic management, even though some of these are linked to the Department's portfolio. The Department develops policy options and strategies at multilateral, regional, and bilateral levels to improve Australia's international trade environment and performance. These are important parts of our overall economic strategy. As the Prime Minister pointed out in the One Nation statement, trade policies provide critical support to our domestic efforts to become more competitive internationally. In particular, reflecting Government priorities, the Department has sought to expand and preserve Australia's export markets. Our approach to the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks is aimed at encouraging trade liberalisation and structural adjustment on a global scale, as the means to boost economic growth more generally. Increased trading opportunities will in turn lead to growth in employment. The Department also recognises that Australia's economic future is increasingly bound up with the Asia-Pacific region. A major element of the Government's Asian strategy is APEC, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation process. APEC provides a framework for closer cooperation and consultation between the economies of the region. Australia's continuing commitment to APEC gives due recognition to the new realities of our trading environment. The activities of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau provide a further means of advancing Australia's commercial relations, to the mutual benefit of both Australia and developing countries. At the level of corporate planning, the amalgamation of the previous Department of Foreign Affairs with the Department of Trade, has given Australia's foreign policy a sharper economic focus. The incorporation of the Government's trade promotion agency, Austrade, in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio has also enhanced the service that the Department provides to Australian companies exporting overseas. The basic rationale for these policies is Australia's economic recovery and the creation of more jobs. Australia's trade policy objectives are not ends in themselves. They are all designed to improve Australia's trading position and to create jobs and prosperity for all Australians. (b) The Department seeks to achieve the objective of advancing Australia's economic well-being through: participating in multilateral negotiations to promote a fair international trading system defending and increasing Australia's access to overseas markets by means of official representations providing advice and support to other parts of the Australian Government on sectoral and other policy issues liaising with Australian industry and advisory groups on trade and foreign affairs issues providing to Government and industry comprehensive analyses of international trade, economic, and political developments and their implications for Australia disseminating information on Australia and Australian Government policy overseas encouraging the development of Asia-Pacific regional cooperation to further Australian interests implementing aid programs in individual countries, and supporting regional and multilateral development institutions, in order to promote mutual .prosperity for Australia and developing-country partners. (c) The Department's activities are fully consistent with the Government's objectives, as set out in the One Nation statement, to achieve full economic recovery and to reduce unemployment. While there are aspects of the Department's activities which are not expressly designed to maximise short term employment growth in Australia, these activities are not inconsistent with the economic objective of building a stronger Australia. In coordinating Australia's bilateral relations with other countries for example, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade protects and promotes Australia's political and strategic, economic and other interests, placing particular emphasis on Australia's economic and trading needs. Statutory Authorities: Employment Goals (Question No. 1507) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 28 April 1992: Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the (a) Indicative Planning Council and (b) National Health and Medical Research Council giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, in each case, (i) how is pre-eminence being given, (ii) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (iii) are there any organisational activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth.",104
260,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) & (ii) The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry (IPC) is the Commonwealth Government's peak advisory body on the housing industry outlook. In addition to providing advice to the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the housing industry, the IPC is responsible for providing information to other policy making bodies (eg State and Local governments) and the industry itself on: factors affecting current and prospective industry activity levels including the demand for and supply of dwellings in the short term and the longer-term; issues relevant to development of the housing industry and the efficient supply of new dwellings. Under its charter, the IPC has the role of initiating studies and making policy recommendations that address supply side issues that impact on the housing industry. In particular, the IPC analyses issues concerning the adequacy of supply of residential land, trades labour and materials for the dwelling construction industry in various parts of the country. The IPC is not responsible for advice on issues concerned with demand management in the housing sector apart from analysing longer term underlying demand based on demographic projections. The state of the housing sector is directly influenced by the labour market situation. As well, the housing industry is a leading indicator of general economic conditions and the employment prospects in the country. The housing industry is a significant employer of both skilled trades labour and unskilled labour (on-site as well as off-site). In addition to its direct employment effects, the housing sector indirectly contributes to employment in related supplying industries such as furnishings and white goods. It is well recognised, as a rule of thumb, that for every job directly created in the housing industry, there is an additional job created indirectly in related sectors. Through the information provided in its reports, the IPC facilitates predictability and stability in the level of dwelling construction activity over the short to medium term. This would be conducive to stable and sustained levels of employment in the dwelling construction sector and in related sectors. (iii) No. (b) (i) & (ii) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) under its charter is responsible to inquire into and to advise and make recommendations to the Commonwealth, the States and Territories and the Australian community on matters relating to improvement of health, the prevention of disease, health care, medical care, dental care, health research and medical research and ethical issues relating to health. The NHMRC in its Strategy for the Triennium 1991-1993 identifies issues that will receive particular attention during the triennium, including inequalities of health status; improved understanding of chronic conditions - both causality and means of influencing outcomes; ageing; environmental health; research; definition of the relationbudget ships between the different service providers and between providers and consumers of health services. It is clear that an effective public health and health care system is an important part of the nation's infrastructure to which the NHMRC contributes. The NHMRC in fact has contributed much to direct employment in the health and medical research sector, with approximately 80% of its ($105 million in 1992) expended on researcher salaries. The NHMRC has proposals to enhance the research base in Australia by expanding not only its career structure for the most productive researchers, but also by expanding its postgraduate and postdoctoral training schemes, to enable young graduates to pursue a career in health and medical research. (iii) No.",107
