GBOOM' (Darling-Bowns-Minister for Works' and Railwaysand Acting Attorney-General) [1.1.0]-(B y leave) -1 mpveeThat the House of Representatives of tha Commonwealth of' Australia' expresses its Borrow at the loss which has Befallen theBritish'. Empire, in general; and. the* Union of South Africa inparticular, by the death, of the Bight Honourable the. Prime. Minister, of the Union, General Louis Botha, patriot, soldier, etatesman, and empire-builder, and extends its sympathy to the people of the sister Dominion. A feeling of sincere and profound sorrow will prevail throughout the Empire today upon the news of . the (passing away of the great Prime Minister of the South African Union. In no portion of: the Empire will that feeling be more deeply experienced than in the Commonwealth of Australia. We are conscious that the Empire has sustained an irreparable loss in the death of one Who will ever be honored as patriot, stia.tesm.ani, soldier, and nation-builder. His persona] characteristics endeared him to his own people j his courage, determination, high principle, and magnetic personality, inspiring confidence, marked him out early as a leader of men. His manly, courageous bearing, hiB noble sense of chivalry, commanded admiration and respect from his foes. Our hearts go out in sympathy to the people of the sister Dominion. For them, he has. truly been a nation-builder. In a country which suffered through the devastations of war, he stood steadily for unity and peace; and in the government iof mixed traces, :for toleration and forgiveness. :He strove'to mould the life of his country on sound national and democratic lines. It is gratifying that he lived to see the high national status that the Dominions had achieved at the close of the war, and that his signature, on behalf of the Union, was on what is probably the most important document in history. His great services to the Empire are not yet full y realized. The mind goes back to that evening at Pretoria when the Peace Treaty of Vereeniging was sighed. A f t e r thÂ© signature, Lord Kitchener rose and .held out his hand, saying to General Botha, "" We are good 'friends now."" That hand-clasp meant much to the British Empire, It was the beginning of the drawing-together df the races in feelings of true.friendship, and real union. 'General Botha full y appreciated the principles of equity, justice, and freedom upon which the Empire was based. His advocacy of its cause and his personal leadership in'the recent'war have been an inspiration to all portions df 'the .King's Dominions. A-s *Prime Minister of a great Dominion - of 'that Empire, he has shown himself to beiihe-soul of honour. 'To-day we mourn 'our 'loss, - and desire to place our appreciation of'his life work permanently upon the records of this House. A personality 'conspicuous among the 'great personalities of 'our 'time has passed away. The abiding 'influence of his. character and work twill .remain. May we say of him, as the.'said of the late Cecil [Rhodes, "" The heart in irev.erence bows to :the silent prayer that what was greatest and noblest in Louis Botha may remain .a living - influence in '.the country he loved so w e l l , "" .and we imay sincerely add, '.'.and in the (Empire vwhich he fought so - bravely and unselfishly to preserve."" .i Mr TUiBOR (Y a r r a ) [:11.6] - ; I secondthe motion. Unhappily, during the last >f ew months death has visited the homes of :many of those who are near-and dear to us. We all/read last night-with feelings - of profound regret of .the death of the Prime .Minister .of the sister Dominion-of South - Africa,-General .Louis Botha, - and the - news must have come as a shock to the people of the :Empire. Doubtless in South Africa , as in Australia and other parts of the Empire, ithe extraordinary strain .imposed 'upon ""its statesmen by reason of .the ^abnormal : position - with which they have :had to deal, 'has led to a deterioration of their fibre, and made them less able to with stand successfully many of the ills that, beset us. We sincerely sympathize, quite irrespective of party, - with those - who have thus been bereaved.. We are all familiar with' the life of General Botha. It is not many years .since be took part in a war which .many believed to be wrong, while others considered it to be justifiable, but he showed on emerging from it . that he was prepared to do everything with in his power to .bury the ill-feeling that r-bad been created by that unfortunate conflict. In company with the people of the sister Dominion, South A f r i c a , we .mourn his .loss .today. Question unanimously resolved ;in .the affirmative, honourable'members standing in their places. Motion (by Mr GROOM) - agreed to, Tliat . Mr - Speaker be.requested to. convey .the foregoing resolution, rand a copy of the speeches delivered thereon, - to Mrs Botha - and 'to 'the 'Government of the '-Union-of 'South Africa. [ SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr GROOM) agreed to-Tliat the.'House, :at its raising, .adjourn .until Wednesday, 10th September next. PRIVILEGE. SUSPENSION OF THE Honorable ""MEMMEB FOR BARRIER. Mr 'BRENNAN (Batman) [11.10] I rise to a-question, of privilege.having reference .to an incident which .occurred-yesterday in Committee. of the whole, .when the ionorable member for ""Barrier (Mr . Considine) was named and later - on was suspended from the service of the"" House.'I propose to .record in a motion, which I intend to >submit, mydisapprobation .and that, I trust, of other . honourable - members, of the action of the Chairman of Committees .(Mr Chanter) in naming the honourable member in the circumstances. It will be .remembered by those who were present that, while the honourable member for Barrier was speaking, a number of very unfriendly interjections were made. . Mr FOWLER - I rise to a point of order. I desire .to know, Mr Speaker, whether .the honourable member will be in order in proposing, under cover of privilege, a. motion having no personal'relation to himself. - Mr SPEAKER (Hon. W . Elliot Johnson) - I understand that the incident to which the honourable member desires to draw attention occurred in Committee. The honourable member will not be in order in dealing with such a matter at the present time. Proceedings in Committee are dealt with in Committee, and cannot be Tevived in the House. Action taken by the Chairman, endorsed by vote of the Coinmittee, and again by the House, could not be made at any time the subject of a question of privilege.",20
2,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"On the point of order, sir, it will be remembered that the Chairman of Committees having called upon the honourable member for Barrier to withdraw the statement made by him , the circumstances under which that request was made were not, and could not, at the time, be made the subject of debate. The Chairman of Committees declined to hear honourable members on the question. The honourable member for Barrier having been named, that fact was reported to the House, and he was thereupon suspended from its service. I submit, with great respect to you, sir, that the action of the Chairman of Committees must in some way be cognisable by the House. I do not know how it would be possible to take action in regard to it other than by dealing with it as a matter of privilege. If honourable members think, as I do, that the action of the Chairman of Committees was a flagrant abuse of his position and power, and showed, as I think it did, partisanship and a tyrannous spirit, them surely it is open to an honourable member to bring before you and the House in some way",22
3,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Shoul d not have been taken on the report?,22
4,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"No . No debate was permissible at that stage or up to the point at which the honourable member for Barrier was suspended and practically ejected from the House. The facts and circumstances which move me to make this charge againist the Chairman of Committees were not, as I have said, brought before the House, or debated, nor were they debatable up to the time of the honourable member's suspension. If the Chairman of Committees was permitted to show this discriminating tyrannous spirit, and if we cannot at the time take exception, to such conduct",22
5,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,I rise to a point of order,22
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is already a point of order before the Chair.,22
7,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Surely I have a right to speak. I understand the natural desire of honourable members opposite to cloak this matter, but we must have power to refer to it by virtue of some standing order. I put it as a point of order, Mr . Speaker, that this course of conduct having been pursued by the Chairman of Gonimtittees, and not having been debatable - by the Committee or, later, in the House itself, u n t i l the honourable member had been suspended from its service, it follows that now, on the re-assembling of the House, with you in the chair, it is open to any honourable member to say that the Chairman of Committees not only abused his position, but invaded the rights of honourable members.",22
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As already stated by me, the proceedings of a Committee of the whole are governed by the Committee, and questions arising out of such proceedings cannot be dealt with by the House except upon report. If any question of order concerning proceedings in Committee was involved, it should have been raised at the time in Committee. No question of privilege can arise out of action taken 'by the Chairmani of Committees in . carrying out the Standing Orders. The Committee of the whole, having carried a certain resolution, thereby endorsed the action of the Chairman. The Chairman reported the matter to the House, which in turn endorsed the action of the Committee. These proceedings, having been taken, in accordance with the Standing action Orders, cannot afterwards be made the subject of a question of privilege. Whether the Chairman was right or wrong is a question which cannot now be debated, since the Committee first, and the House afterwards, decided the matter by a vote which cannot be reflected on unless on a motion for its rescission in the regular way as provided for in the Standing Orders. A question of order can only arise at the time of the occurrence to which it relates.",22
9,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"This is a point of order, and I submit-:",22
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memand ber cannot, again traverse the question. He has raised his point of order, and have given my ruling. There the matter terjection or otherwise. must end, unless my ruling is challenged order concludesin the proper way provided by the Standing Orders.",22
11,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"On a point of order. Yesterday was the thir d occasion which the honourable member for Barsuspended rier has been suspended, and, therereport fore, his suspension on this occasion for one month. But I suggest that Standing Orders were framed on the Presiding Officer. understanding that the sessions of this House would be annual. In view of the fact that owing to the war the session has extended, and apparently ' will tend, throughout the whole life of the Parliament, I ask whether there is any possibility of leniency being honourable member?",23
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Unfortunately , no discretion is allowed to the Chair in this matter; the Standing Orders are specific and mandatory. For the information of honourable members, I quote standing order 59Whenever any member shall have been by the Speaker or by the Chairman of Comout mittees, immediately after the commission the offence of disregarding the authority Chair, or of abusing the rules of the House, persistently and wilfully obstructing business of the House, or of disorderly conduct, or otherwise disregarding the authority of the Chair, then, if the offence has been committed by such member in the House, the Speaker shall forthwi+h put the question, on made, no amendments, adjournment, or debate being allowed, "" That such honourable member be suspended from the service of the House and, if the offence has been committed Committee of the whole House, the Chairman shall, on a motion being made, put the same question in a similar way, and, be carried, shall forthwith suspend the proceedings of the Coinmittee and report the stances to the House,- and the Speaker shall thereupon put the same question, without amendment, adjournment, or debate, as if the offence had been committed in the House - If any member be suspended under this order, his suspension on the first occasion shall be for the remainder of that day's sitting; on the second occasion for one week; and the third or any subsequent occcasion for month.",23
13,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,That was the Chairman's object.,23
14,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The honourable member He has no right to say that.,23
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memon the ber for Batman (Mr Brennan) is quite as out of order in interrupting the Speaker tical when he is on his feet, or i I upon another honourable member by in The standing Nothing herein shall be taken to deprive the House of the power of proceeding against any member according to ancient usages. on The honourable member for Barrier was by order of the House, on a from the Committee which had is voted for his suspension, and no power to the extend leniency to him is given to the But if the honourable member is desirous of making an apology and putting himself right with the House, he may do so at any time, and it will exthen be within the power of the House, if it so desires, to rescind its motion of suspension and allow him to return to the shown to the service of the House. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",23
16,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I rise to make' a personal explanation. Last evening I thought it necessary to call attention to certain remarks which had been made by the honourable member for Denison (Mr . named Laird Smith). I wish to briefly point how, in respect of two particulars, he of has, I think, grossly misrepresented me. of the Speaking, on the third reading of the by Immigration Bill-last evening,-the honour the able member saidThe honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. Finlayson) has asked me for a copy of my remarks before I have had an opportunity of the motion being seeing the proofs. That is quite incorrect, and the honourable "" ; member's subsequent statements_ Show in a that he himself recognised that he had not stated the facts, because when I interif the motion jected he repliedThis is the note I received from the Acting circumPrincipal Parliamentary Reporter :"" Mr Finlayson asks me for an uncorrected proof of your speech. May I give it to him?"" itself. I made no request that the honourable gentleman should allow, me to see a copy of his speech to the exclusion of his own on perusal of it . I have received an .unone corrected copy of the honourable member's speech, and the portion to which I take particular-exception isThe honourable member for Brisbane was honest when he said, "" We will fight this Bill."" said, in effect, "" We will allow consumptives to come in here. We will allow those who live prostitution of others to enter, as well anarchists and others, because we want to use this Bill on the public platform for polipurposes."" Is that the type of politics we n reflecting want in this country? What. I did-say. is summed up i u three shorf paragraphs of my speech. I quote from an uncorrected proof of HansardTlie Honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Mkxwell), whose opinion is always listened'to with respect, said that this Bill would apply only to persons entering Australia, and that, it was our bounden duty to prevent the influx of undesirable persons. To that extent T am entirely in sympathy with his attitude. Eater I said I have no objection to a very, severe tighten' ing. of the immigration laws, in order to secure - that criminals, those who,live on the. prostitution of others, diseased and insane persons, and persons who are likely to become-a-charge on public charity shall not be allowed to enter Australia. We cannot be too careful about keeping, the race pure. We have,established a reputation throughout the world because of the White Australia policy, which is only adeduration of our desire to keep, the Australian race as cleanandhigh as possible-. To that extent every-strengthening: of the immigration law, must secure unlimited support. I ' suggest' that those three extracts from my speech are a flat contradiction of the statement .and suggestions made by the Honourable member for Denison. I desire only to add"" that; as-the honourable-gentle* man himself saw his error, and later, by personal explanation, apologized-, and also interviewedme privately; giving me the assurance that his remarks"" were not in tended to have any personal application to myself, I place in contrast his statement and mine, and inform him that I accept his apology and. assurance: PUBLIC SERVICE-: CLEANERS..",23
17,Mr TUDORU,Unknown,"Oh the 20th December, 1918, when the Public Service Bill was before the House, I raised a question as to the'position of certain persons who had been temporarily employed in. the Public Service, and were exempt from the provisions-of the-Act. On. page -9991 of Hansard,.! am reported^The provisionin: clause 3j in regard to appointments without examination to^the General Division, must, surely refer-to persons who are temporarily employed in the Service.",24
18,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes . It refers to their appointment to permanent positions: "" Sir. GROOM:-There are certain classesof work, such'ascleaning and washing, to which it'is not considered desirable to apply the-competitive examination' test , and it is left to the Commissioner to specify the classes.. Has-effect, to-that, promise been given by the Public Service Commissioner -? There are persons.who have given satisfaction in the Service, and must either be made permanent or leave the Service. An y honor* able member who has been in control of the Customs Department knows that it is necessary to have, for certain work, men who are ab3olutely reliable, and the service j of certain individuals has been extended for - a period longer-than is usual in the case of the ordinary temporary employee. Can> the Acting'Leader of the-House see his way clearto make representations to the'Public Service Commissioner in regard : to this matter ?",24
19,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have not had time to look into this-matter very closely, because the honourable.member gave me only brief notice of his intention, to raise it . But I remember distinctly the: object of the amendment. I . stated at the timeThe second amendment of the principal Act for which this Bill, provides deals with, certain positions in the Public Service, ih respect of which it is not considered desirable to have competitive - examinations! It is hardly fair, for instance, that cleaners, who have been, in the temporary service for some time, audi have given' satisfaction, should be required to. undergo an examination:in order, to.become permanent officers in. the General. Division. It is proposed to specify certain classes of these servants, and to enable them to be appointed without being, submitted, to a competitive, examination: The-honourable member'desires to know to what extent that policy, has.been complied with. I shall""make:inquirieSj.and let.the honourable member: know the' result; AUSTRALIA. HOUSE. Mr ELEMING : - Will the Minister for Home and. Territories furnish the House with, a statement showing the individual salaries' paid in Australia House, London, and the total cost of the upkeep of that establishment?",24
20,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,That question should be addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Australia House is. not controlled by my Department. ADMIRAL VISCOUNT JELLICOE'S . . REPORT..,24
21,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Yesterday t i e - Acting Minister' fortheNavystated that the report of* Admiral Viscount 1 : Jellicoe: on the' f u t u r e naval' policy of. Australia will, probably not, i h its entirety, be made'public, because*some 1 portions, dealing with future naval policy, are secret. W it h that I entirely cancur; but as Admiral Viscount Jellicoe visited and inspected the Randwick Wireless Works, formerly owned by .the late Father Shaw, I ask the - Acting Minister for the Navy - whether that portion of the Admiral's report is secret, and, if not, whether it can be laid upon: the table .of the.House?  of Admiral Viscount - Jellicoe is being considered by the .Cabinet, I shall bring forward the honourable member's - request. A number of documents connected with the report, and relating to the wireless - works at Randwick, and confirmations or variations of A d j r i i r al Henderson's naval scheme, which is well known to the public, .are not-secret. Therefore Lsee no reason why, though we may not be able to publish the :report in .its entirety, extracts from it should not be made available. I will represent the honourable member's request to Cabinet. NA .REPRESENTATION.",24
22,Mr TUDOR,PROPORTIONAL,"Has the Minister for ""'Home - and Territories seen a paragraph - which appeared in last night's Herald in preference to a meeting .of the Proportional - Representation League ' in Melbourne, at - which it ""was stated that the League had a copy, or knew the contents, of the .Proportional Representation Bill which the ""Minister intends to introduce to Parliament? Is that statement correct? Pf so, would it not be better for - Parliament to be made aware of the contents of the Bill ibefore they are disclosed to'outsiders'? "" Mr BOVD - I rise to a point of 'order. I 'think you, sir, - have ruled previously .'that questions founded on 'newspaper ex-tracts 'are not in order.",25
23,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL, In the hum of subdued conversation. I did not understand the 'honourable member for Yarra to be speci'fically - referring to a - newspaper paragraoh. I understood him to say that a certain report had come to his knowledge.,25
24,Mr GLYNN,PROPORTIONAL,"I have had the misforttune not to see 'the paragraph to which the honourable member refers, 'therefore : I cannot say whether or not it is correct.",25
25,Mr TUDOR,PROPORTIONAL,Did the Minister allow an outside body to get a copy of the R i,25
26,Mr GLYNN,PROPORTIONAL,No outside body has a copy of the Bill .,25
27,Mr TUDOR,PROPORTIONAL,"Does any outside body know the Minister's ideas .in regard to the matter ? Mr Glynn , - I should 'like to lhave my ideas impregnated in the usual way.",25
28,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,"I .find that .the .honourable member for Henty (Mr Boyd), was quite .right in saying that .the .question which has just been replied .to .had .reference to a paragraph which ap.peared in a .newspaper. .1 .would :reniind honourable .members .that it is not strictly .in order to ask questions founded .on - newspaper .reports .unless the .member-.asking any such question is .prepared '.to personally accept responsibility for ,the accuracy of the newspaper report. PERSONA LEXPLANATION .",25
29,Mr BAMFORD,PROPORTIONAL,"I desire tounakera personal explanation. A few-days.ago . I .asked 'the .Minister representing the M in ister for Defence a .question in regard ito - the - wives of - soldiers who have 'been married .in England. I inquired whether any special privileges had been granted-to .them in .regard to .their passage to Aust r a l i a , and also 'whether any concessions - had 'been .made to the sisters-in-law .of .soldiers who-had married overseas. F r o m the answer which I received the impression may be given that I am in favour of .these sisters-in-law receiving special treat.ment. I am asked "" Why not ?"" I do not desire to incur the hostility of quite a.number-of unmarried ladies .in the Commonwealth. There are.a.few in my own electorate,,and it is just possible that the impression may get abroad that I asked the question, to which I allude, because I am .in favour .of special concessions being .granted to the sisters-in-law of soldiers - That is not so. We are told that in Melbourne and suburbs-alone there are 20,00iÂ» eligible unmarried women in excess of the number df unmarried eligible men, whilst for - the Commonwealth there is an excess of more than 100,000 unmarried .eligible women. 1 did not .ask the question with a view to increasing the immigration of unmarried women. MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.",25
30,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,"I - ask the Acting 'Leader of the 'House (Mr '-Groom) l l ? whether he has made himself 'familiar, in a general way, with the results of the municipal which took place in Victoria yesterday, and which he will find recorded upon the back page of some of our morning newspapers. If he has done so, and if he has marked the success of the Labour party at those elections, will he accept that as a broad hint to the Government",25
31,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL," Order ! Questions, as I have pointed out several times, founded on newspaper reports, are irregular, and it is quite clear that questions arising out of the Victorian municipal elections have nothing whatever to do with any Commonwealth Parliament departmental . administration.",26
32,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,I was just coming to the point.,26
33,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,"I . hope that the House will assist the Chair in seeing that its rules are observed. Most of the questions asked without notice have dealt with matters which are not of such urgency as to warrant the taking up of time in asking or answering them without notice. Questions which are not urgent should be placed upon the business paper. The honourable member's question, however, has nothing whatever to do with the business of the House, and relates to matters outside the cognisance of Ministers.",26
34,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,I rise to a point of order. I submit that it is not within your province as Speaker to interrupt me in the middle of a question by anticipating what I am about to say.,26
35,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,"Order! The honourable member is reflecting upon the Chair, and he must not do that.",26
36,Mr BHENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,I submit that should be permitted to finish my question which related to profiteering.,26
37,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,The honourable member is not permitted to finish his question. The Speaker is the sole judee of whether or not a question is allowable.,26
38,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,You have not heard my question.,26
39,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,"It must be quite clear to honourable members, other than the honourable member himself, that his question had nothing whatever to do with departmental administration.",26
40,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,You did not hear it .,26
41,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,It had nothing to do with the administration of any Department over which any of the Ministers elections exercise control.,26
42,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,That is not correct.,26
43,Mr SPEAKER,PROPORTIONAL,Order ! The honourable member asked a question about newspaper reports of municipal election results. He cannot do that. AUSTRALIANIMPERIAL . FORCE. GRAVES IN FRANCE-CONDITION S ON A TROOPSHIP.,26
44,Mr FLEMING,PROPORTIONAL,I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence whether it is a fact that it is proposed to put the inscriptions on the graves of our men who have fallen in France in L at in ?,26
45,Mr WISE,PROPORTIONAL,"I have not heard what is the intention, but I will make inquiries into the matter.",26
46,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPORTIONAL,I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence,26
47,Mr BRENNAN,PROPORTIONAL,"Well , your question is out of order - It is irrelevant.",26
48,Mr FINLAYSON,PROPORTIONAL,"Certain disquieting reports are in circulation to the effect that an Australian troopship, owing to very faulty conditions, has been obliged to put back to Durban, and in view of the declared policy of the Government that complaints of this character should cease, will a strict investigation be ordered into the conditions which obtained on this vessel immediately upon her arrival here, and before the officers and soldiers on board have time to disperse?",26
49,Mr WISE,PROPORTIONAL,I am quite satisfied that such an inquiry will be made. AGENTS - GENERA L.,26
50,Mr WEST,PROPORTIONAL,Will the Acting Leader of the House state whether the Government 1 are prepared to assist the States to cut down their expenditure by centralizing the various State agencies in London? I understand that more than half of the Agents-General of the States are on the eve of returning to Australia.,26
51,Mr GROOM,PROPORTIONAL,This Government will always be willing to assist the States to economize in any way. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.  Treasurer whether he will make it possible for the committees of hospitals to pay the full amount of the old-age pension to pensioners during their treatment in those institutions ?  gaged in the unpleasant task of making two ends meet. I notice that the honor terdaydesired to get an increase in the amount of the old-age pensions. All these matters are receiving consideration. FINANCIAL POSITION.,26
52,Mr RODGERS,PROPORTIONAL,"Will the Acting Treasurer, during the proposed adjournment of this House, see that the financial position of Australia, and the necessity for curtailing our public expenditure, is brought prominently under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes).  entire financial position of the Commonwealth will be brought under the notice of the Prime Minister immediately upon"" his return. POSTAL INSTITUTE .",27
53,Mr BAMEORD,PROPORTIONAL,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. What purpose or purposes is or are attained by the establishment of what is termed a "" Postal Institute"" ? 2. Does such an institute fulfil any educational function, or is it merely intended as a resting place for postal employees? 3. If of an educational nature, will the Postmaster-General submit a copy of the curriculum to honourable members? 4. If of an educational character, are periodical examinations held; and, if so, at what intervals? 5. If examinations are held, what, if any, reward is given to those who successfully pass the examination? 6. If there is to be a reward, is it to motion, an increase of salary, or otherwise? '",27
54,Mr WEBSTER,PROPORTIONAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Mainly educational; incidentally recreative. 2. There aro already twelve classes well attended, and nine others in contemplation. 3. I will supply honourable members with the curriculum, and would esteem it a favour if they would inspect the institute at work. 4. Annual examinations will be held, and certificates awarded. 5. As promotion goes by merit, he who is the best qualified will advance; hence he who shows best results at work and study will, obvioxisly, receive his reward. 6. See answer to No. 5. REPATRIATION : SUBSIDY TO STATES.",27
55,Mr LISTER,PROPORTIONAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon noticeHaving in mind the ever-increasing number of returned soldiers awaiting employment, will the Government place such sum of money on the Estimates, to be given to the States by way of subsidy, as will enable such States to provide work, such as re-afforestation, under favourable conditions and at a fair wage to those men desirous of taking up work in the country ?  wealth has already undertaken - to advance to the States funds to enable them to proceed with re-afforestation, providing returned soldiers are employed on the work. Seventy-five per cent, of the money advanced is by way of loan, and the remaining 25 per cent, as a g if t , in consideration of the inefficiency of the men in this class of employment. In addition to this, the Commonwealth provides each man sent to employment with the necessary personal equipment, and also pays the cost of his transport to the place of employment. New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, and Tasmania have taken advantage of this offer, but there is a manifest disinclination on the part of the men to accept this class of employment. The Commonwealth has also arranged to advance to the States from Â£30,000,000 to Â£40,000,000 to enable them to make land available for soldier-settlement, and for the construction of necessary public works, such as railways, bridges, & c , for their successful be pro- occupation, returned soldiers to be given preference of employment. The funds are advanced at the rate at which it cost the Commonwealth to borrow, less a rebate of Â£25,000 interest on each Â£1,000,000 borrowed, in respect of the States making advances to the soldiers at cheap rates of interest. It is anticipated that the works covered by these proposals will soon be in hand, and, in consequence, additional avenues of employment will be available for returned men. In addition, ' the Commonwealth has offered to loam to the States at favourable rates of interest, to be in turn .advanced to local government bodies, funds to enable the latter to proceed with local government works, provided returned soldiers are employed as far as possible in the undertakings. 'So - far no 'definite proposals have been received from' any was .of the 'States except Queensland -4 NA TO PUBLICSERVANTS .",27
56,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the Premier .the State of Victoria intends to Bill to grant increases of salaries and bonuses to public servants receiving under Â£504 per annum ? 2.

62,Dr MALONEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Melbourne') [11.48-]; - I welcome the introduction of a Customs Bill , or anything pertaining, to the Tariff. The introduction of a new Tariff is a long-deferred promise, but I recognise that the delay has been caused by the exigencies of war time. Still , as I suggested earlier in the' session, the Government could have, by a single clause, given complete protection - to Australia by a measure adopting' inglobo - the whole of the Tariff of thetwo most up-to-date nations im the world so far as fiscal matters are concerned I refer to the United States of Americaand Japan-. When the Tariffis brought, on I shall be as limited in my remarks.as my duty will-permit me to be,, because: it is the desire of the House to >push this matter, along, at every opportunity and Haver it completed bef ore the next election. I shall endeavour-now to'sounds a note which. I hope will find an echo, in the breasts of many Honourable members.. So far as I know, it is a new proposal! I do not think it has ever been mentioned in any Parliament in the world'. Honourable members will agree that the crystallized thought of the greatest statesmen nowadays tends to the .conclusion, that, in order to eliminate the curse of murder which men call war; secret"" treaties should be abolished. There is nothing so' irritating throughout thelength' and breadth of Australia as the greatly increasedprices of goods' and commodities, generally referred to as profiteering. The proposal Lwish to put' before the Minister (Mr Greene), and' the that,, if : it is> right; to abolish secret treaties' in order to eliminate war; it. is r i g h t to abolish the secrecy of the Customs-House, so that citizens may know the value - upon i which, the importers pay duty on goods-brought into this country. Pianos at one time were landed in Australia for. something like Â£ 1 7 . Mr MASSYGREENE:-Some I think; for less than that.",29
63,Dr MALONEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The one I havei n m y mindwas sold t'o the public for Â£ 4 5 . If anyone for a fee of sixpence-could-go toi the Customs Department: and see: the landed price - of pianos, the - people would begiven a certain amount, ofprotection against, retailers, who charge - them profits amounting, to 200, or 300, and even as much as 400, per cent. ' Alternatively,the Commomoealth of Australia Gazette could be-made-a much.more useful, document, than it. is to-day. It isi very rarely that any one reads it , and I never, yet met. a. man whoread it from cover to cover. If he did, I would take it. as a symptomof lunacy on. his part. We would liketo know the, cost of many goods-on which import duty is paid, and that knowledge would cause the Australian public to keep a keen eye. upon retail prices when they went above-, afigure that would allow a just profit to be made. The Government of the day might then feel called on to v issue a. proclamation according to law, enacting that for. the welfare of the. public only a certain. rate of profit should be allowed:. What would happen if the Government,, by, proclamation, determined that the piano I . mentioned, should not. be sold at a net profit of more, than 50per cent. over, landed cost? This would immediately stop all that inters change of commodities between indivit duals which does.not bring the. articleany nearer to. the consumer. I believe that wheat bast been sold more than once, in wholesale.transactions, and. we have, been told', that certain: imports have changed hands no less than eleven, times-,, the sell? . in g price to. the public, being increased with every sale.

It indicates to. me that the article should be a Government monopoly: That is. the. only means of - fixing a Trust or. Combine, which has. its headquarters outside the. confines of our territory. 5 Every one to whom I have madethis suggestion endorses my belief that' to give publicity to the. landed, cost., of articles in Australia would be a great preventive, of unjust increases in prices . W h at is* the use. even of 1,000 per cent, dutyin> the instance! have given ? What hope have we, with our higher ideals and higher wages and improved factory conditions, of competing against an industry of the kind to which I have referred? Every one recognises that no country in the world has increased the wages to its workers to the extent to which Japan has done lately. The advance has been really phenomenal, and the employees in many of the Japanese trades and callings are receiving more now per day than they received for a whole week's work when I visited Japan. In those times male country workers could be obtained for about 50s. pei year, and females for about 30s. per year.",29
64,Mr BAMFORD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,That is' not continue.,30
65,Dr MALONEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I am glad my honourable friend agrees with me. I look upon Japan as possibly the first co-operative Commonwealth the world will see. I do not know any other country which has so many nationalized industries. It is th<>. only country that has beaten the American Tobacco Combine, and it did so by using its Customs Department. Japan offered the American Combine on two occasions to purchase their business and pay for their good-will. The Combine refused, knowing that in America they were backed up by a ll the other Combines. They had brought the Japanese palate to like the cigarettes which they were supplying, and they were very haughty and amused at the idea of Japan taking their business from them, seeing that in the meantime they had conquered England. The Japanese Government imposed a duty of 50 per cent. The Combine still laughed. Next year the duty was in creased to 100 per cent. When it reached 150 per cent, the Combine approached the Japanese Government with a request that they should enter into negotiations. The Government refused, reminding them that they had previously made two fair offers which had been turned down. Next year the duty rose to 250 per cent. meant that cigars landed in Japan at Â£10 per 1,000 f!o.b. would cost the Combine Â£ 3 5 , as against a cost to the Japanese Government of Â£ 1 0 plus landing charges ancl freightage. Even the American Combine could not stand that. When they found that the Japanese Government would not purchase their business, they gave up Japan and had all the rest of the world at their feet. The Japanese Government then obtained all their buildings and machinery, which it would not pay them to remove, for a mere song. Japan was not content with that, because I find from Kelly's Customs Tariffs of the World that the duty in Japan on all tobaccos, other than chewing tobacco and snuff, is 355 per cent. Oigarettes manufactured by cheap. Japanese labour, and equal to any made anywhere else in the world, can be bought there at the rate of twenty-five for 2d.",30
66,Mr MAXWELL,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Have you any idea of the purchasing power of wages in Japan' and Australia?,30
67,Dr MALONEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"No . Since I visited going to Japan, the wages paid in some trades there have increased to the extent of 500 per cent. In one case there has been an increase of 800 per cent.",30
68,Mr FLEMING,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,How long is it since the honourable member visited Japan?,30
69,Dr MALONEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I think it was in 1905, and on my return I published my impressions in a little booklet entitled Flashlights from Japan, which was edited by ""Telemachus""- Mr Frank Myers. As Japan was able to combat successf u l l y one of the strongest Combines in the world, we also should be able to defeat the Trusts and Rings. I am reiterating what is really an old suggestion-on my part. . I commenced my political career by advocating the nationalization of "" lights, smokes, and drinks."" France has made Â£1,000,000 out of the nationalization of matches alone, and the movement has met with the satisfaction of the French people. A point that I wish to stress is that we should do away with the secrecy of the Customs House. Let the citizens of Australia know what is the bedrock price at which goods consumed by them are i m ported. If that were done, a succeeding, Government might see, in its wisdom, a chance to prevent the exploitation of the people in so far as imported commodities This, were concerned. It would be easy for the Department to garner the details relating to a particular industry, showing what would be a fair value to fix for its products. Then, by means of a referendum, the people might be asked to determine what would be a fair selling price, making due allowance for a reasonable profit The Minister should be able to do something to put down the infernal profiteering that: is going on. There are many difficultiesi n dealing with theprofileer; hut I thinkthere is a wayout. If the Government think there is not, then they should tell the people, and let them appoint others who will find ameans of dealing'with such individuals - the payment of"" duty rightly chargeable",30
70,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Denison) [12.2-]. - I recognise that this is largely a machinery Bill, designed to provide By Statute law for much that is now dealt with hy regulations; In these circumstances, I shall delay the House for only a few minutes. I rise particularly to draw attention to a clause in the Bill, whichprovides* that the value of goods on which duty shall he collected shall be thef a i r 'market valuei n the country of origin. This provision, is likely to have a bad effect on the commercial world of Australia. It is calculated topenalizemen who are and have always been anxiousto do the right thing-in connection with the importation of goods.. I learn that the practiceforwhichi this> clause provides has given rise to< a great, deal of friction, between importers and. the Department, of Trade-and? Customs-j. and that, many importers have beeni inconvenienced, and, in somei n stances, quiteunintentionally, no doubt; penalized, by the Department. I understand that dutymay be collected either on the f.o.b. invoice value plus10 per cent., or on the fair market value of'the goods concerned.' ih the country of origin. T would point out, however, that an im1 porter might purchase goods at a certain pirice, andfin<Â£it impossible, for some time to secure their shipment to Australia. In the meantime the value, of.'such, goods.. recently ih the country of origin might, conIt siderably increase, with the result that, underthis Bill, he would, be-., charged' duty on the higher price, est degree. and not on the f.o.b. value. man might have entered into a contract, as an indentor,, for the supply of such for duty shall be the value at the port . goods at a certain price, and in this he would' be very seriously inconvenienced. 10 per cent.

I ask the Minister (Mr Greene) to try to devise some otheT means of getting; at the dumper. I have the utmost contemptfor any manwho tries toevade to him,' and would make such an evasion a penal offence. But I would urge that it should be sufficient to. provide for duty being collected on the. invoice value Â£o.b. plus 10 per cent. It should be possible for the Department in. some other way to deal with the unscrupulous trader,.whom nobody desir.eSi to protect. : Mr EINLAYSON. (Brisbane) [12.8] Whilei n Brisbane-, last week I had an in terview with the Chamber of Commerce, and had brought under my notice very pointedly the matterto which reference 1 has just been made by the honourable memberforDenison (Mr Laird Smith)-. I "" have beer* waitingthis opportunity to point out what I think is the grossinjus>ticedone tothetradingcommunity of Australia by section15'4 of the principal Act, as proposed to be amended' by this Bill. Whereas the genuine invoice valueplus10per. cent: has-, hitherto been accepted as the correct value, for duty-and every effort is' made by the Department to insure that the invoice value so declared is correct-it is now proposed to adopt a new system whereby the value for duty. will be the value, at the time of shipment, provided that it is not less than the invoice value ",31
71,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"This Bill does not provide, for. any change ih the existing law asr laid down by the High Court. ' simply expresses the same law, but in clear, definite terms. We are not altering the law in that regard in the slightSuch. a.

72,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"In a-recenfe case the High 1 they Court determinedthat the departmental, 1 practice of charging the duty on the value"" and and we-are now putting-in this Bill in able clear unmistakable terms what we believe first the law is-, and has been, in accordance 1 - witht the practice of the-Department from"" 1 j tKe very beginning.",31
73,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"This Bill embodies the H i gh Court's interpretation of section 154 of the principal Act . If that section is capable of such an interpretation, then I think it should be amended. Those who know anything of business, must be well aware that orders are booked in other countries months, and* in some cases years, ahead of the date of shipment to Australia. Recently shipping conditions have been abnormal,' and goods have been piled up in Great Britain , America, and other countries awaiting opportunities for shipment to Australia, According to the Minister's statement it is now proposed to make it quite clear in this Bil l that duty is to be levied on the value of all goods at the time of shipment. Let us consider for a moment what might be the position in regard to a contract entered into by an engineering firm: Obviously months, or even: a year or two, might elapse before the goods forming the subject of that contract could be delivered. . Mr BOYD - The honourable member is not quite righ t in his statement that the value of the goods for the assessment of duty is to be the market value at the time of shipment. I would remind him of the provision that the value is not to be "" in any case less than the actual money price shown in the genuine invoice.""",32
74,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I have already mentioned that. The Customs Department takes good care that the higher value shall always be the value for duty. That, I think, is perfectly fair. I am pointing out, however, that after goods have been ordered at a price agreed upon the value of those goods might rise very considerably owing to current shipping delays before they could be shipped to Australia. In such a case the purchaser would be penalized to the extent of the additional duty payable on the increased price.",32
75,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,But he would pass on the increased amount of duty.,32
76,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"He could not do so, since he might be under contract to supply the goods at a certain price.",32

Why so much concern .for the city profiteer ?",32
80,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,But the point is that any artificial interference with trade between Australia and [other countries must divert trade from the Commonwealth.,32
81,Mr MAXWELL,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Thes e people will make contracts with due regard to this law.,32
82,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,They would have to provide in such contracts that any in creased duties should .be payable by the purchaser.,32
83,Mr GREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"As long as it was set out in the agreement that the duty collected should be part of the contract price, there would be no trouble.",32
84,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The r e are no fewer than three honourable members try ing to advise' me.,32
85,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,In any event the importers will pass on'the increased duty.,32
86,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"That has nothing whatever to do with the question. If any passing on is going to be done, it will apply not only to the duty but to everything else. The question of profiteering does not affect this matter in the slightest degree. The provision to which I object simply means that in placing orders and incurring liabilities abroad, the trading community of Australia, and the general public in proportion, are going to be penalized because of artificial increases and changes that may take place in the price of goods as between the date of purchase and the date of shipment. If conditions were normal, and shipping was available without serious interruption, the risk would be comparatively small.",32
87,Mr GREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The shipping space offering for goods coming to Australia is in excess of the cargo offering. One half of our ships coming out to Australia are in ballast.,32
88,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,That is not the # information which the public have.,32
89,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"It is correct. Nine thousand-ton ships carrying our troops from Great Britain come out almost entirely in ballast, axe Mr Laird SMITH - That is only from the Old Country. Mr FINLAYSON , - Yes ; and not from America. I am credibly informed. that thousands of tons of goods for Australia are awaiting shipment in Great Britain.",32
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"That was true, but it is requires. not true of the position today.",33
91,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Eve n if that be so, it is true that the shipping for the carriage of goods to Australia from other countries, particularly America, wholly insufficient.",33
92,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"""We are overcoming difficulties im regard to inward shipping, but we have a difficulty in getting sufficient outward tonnage.",33
93,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"If shipping were at its pre-war standard, we should have no difficulty.",33
94,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"So far as the importavantage tion of goods is concerned, shipping is practically normal today.",33
95,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"In any case, I openly admit that if shipping were mal the risk under this Bill would not so bad. But I do not think that the policy that is .proposed is honest and per. After all, we must rely to a very large extent upon firms in this country anticipating a demand for goods, and placing their orders in' other countries such a period in advance of local requiremanufacturers ments as to insure that we shall have trade flowing backwards"" and forwards. abroad ? Under this Bill they will be compelled to take a risk between the time the goods stance. are purchased - abroad and the time of their shipment. That, I think, is unfair, and harasses and interrupts legitimate trade.",33
96,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,But that cuts both' ways.,33
97,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The Bill distinctly states, that the value cannot below the invoice price. The Customs Department always proceeds on the as-sumption that anybody having business relations with it is a would be robber, is trying to cheat the revenue of the country.",33
98,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,It is a fairly good basis for our transactions.,33
99,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I have to 'admit converted that it is the only basis, because there some people who think it no crime to rob the Government, and who will resort all sorts of devious devices in order to fraud the revenue.",33
100,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The best way to protect the honest traders is to treat all traders as robbers. [457]- 2,33
101,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The main difficulty that the traders have is in learning exactly what the Customs Department,33
102,Mr GREEITE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,We are introducing this Bill so that there may be nodoubt as to available what we require.,33

104,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"We hope so. .. Mr FINLAYSON - My own experience, when I was in business, was that it was very difficult to ascertain what the Customs Department required. I was desirous of doing the right thing. I had no wish to take adof the Department, but I was always treated as if I had some ulterior motive and was seeking to rob the Government. However, the Customs Denorpartment take every precaution to probe tect the revenue, because even the most reputable firms are likely to make promistakes, but this proposed alteration, whether or not it be to meet an interpretation of the law by the High Court, is causing considerable perturbation in the at minds of importers in this country and and exporters abroad.",33

110,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I know the Minister did; and those bodies were not in the least by the discussions. are It is represented to me that this provision, would not only cause unfair interto ference w.lth the men who are seeking deto do business with other countries, but is already having the effect, which will be increasingly felt, of diverting trade from Australia, because, obviously, there is no security.

For that reason anything that can be done to promote trade between Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States of Americawill bealtogether to our advantage.

For instance, if a man bought a ton of iron at Â£20, and before the iron arrived in Australia, the price at the port of shipment had risen to Â£ 3 0 , the Department added Â£ 1 0 to the price shown on the in voice, making the invoice value >the normal price - at the port of. shipment when the goods arrived in Australia. A deputation to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) pointed out that the Act provided that duty should be payable on the invoice value. The Department replied, in effect, "" We are entitled to get duty on the full value of the goods. When prices begin to fall, the importer will get the benefit of a refund, because the goods will be priced at Â£ 3 0 in the invoice; but if the price at the port of shipment at the time when the goods arrive has fallen to Â£ 2 0 , only on that value will duty be collected."" That promise ""was made by the M in ister",34
123,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,When ?,35
124,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,When was the promise made? Mr - GREENE - I confess that I was not listening to the honourable member.,35
125,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Then I will call attention to the state of the House. formed.],35
126,Mr SPEAKER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES," Before the honourable member for Henty proceeds, may I once more direct attention to a point to which I have frequently referred, namely, that upon the motion for the second reading of Bills there is a general disposition on the parb of honourable members to discuss the clauses of the measures. So far I have not interrupted honourable members, but unquestionably 'that 'tendency obtains at the present time. I would remind the House that the clauses of a Bill should be discussed in Committee-and only its.general* principles should be debated upon the motion for its second .reading.",35
127,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The principle - which - was observed in .the Customs Department of - charging d u t y upon the full value of - goods as set out in the original invoice, ,pl.U3 any increase which - may 'have iaken plane in the'country of shipment,toperated until .a deputation waited upon the ' M i nisterial head of that ^Department - An interjection by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) prompted me - to .ask .the Minister - when the 'Department promised that, when prices began to - fall, duty would not be charged >6n - the invoiced prices of goods, if those prices were higher than the value of the ..goods - at the time at their port of. ishipmen.t. I Â»do >not know the precise date upon - which that promise was made, but .1 do know that .the Customs Department is acting on that principle today.",35
128,Mr RICHAB DFOSTEB,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,I know that it is not.,35
129,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,I know that it is. If the honourable member challenges my statement. I will produce an invoice. I would like this point to be cleared up now. Has .the Department charged duty upon a less value than has been set out in any invoice which has been presented to it? Mr GREENE ; - I cannot answer that question off-hand.,35
130,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"As a matter of fact, I know that it has done so in numerous cases. It followed that course in pursuance of the promise which was .made, and I say that it is a perfectly equitable .course. But under this Bill , now that prices are falling, an attempt is to be made to catch the advantage both ways. '1 he Department .got the advantage when the rise took place, but now, when it has [Quorum to make concessions on a falling market, ' it says, "" No. 'We wish to collect duty upon the invoice value ""- a course which is absolutely dishonest.",35
131,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Upon which invoice? Sometimes there are two invoices.,35
132,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Upon the value set out in the genuine invoice. I have no objection to the Department collecting duty upon the full value of any arbicle. Bub by mainbaining bhese prices when the market is' falling, the Government aredeliberabely keeping up the cost to the consumer and thus encouraging that ""profiteering of which we hear so much from the Opposition. Everybody knows that the merchant does not pay the duty l i e merely passej it on, with a percentage >of profit added to it . That is business. By adopting the course that is proposed in this Bill , prices will be artificially - raised and the consumer will have to pay. While the - country is seething with agitat i o n against profiteering, bhis measure isoeks to perpetuate that evil by reason of - the'attitude of ""ithe Customs ^Department. There is another principle involved in the Bill which I do not regard as a fair one. It seeks to clothe the Government Â»ith power to prevent any duty being collected upon goods imported for the purposes of trade, so long as that trade is managed by the Commonwealth. In other words, if we take over the sugar industry or any other industry, and control it as a Commonwealth concern",35
133,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,To which clause is the honourable member referring? I Mr BOYD - To sub-clause 2 of clause 10 of the Bill.,36
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The honourable member is barking up the wrong tree. The object of that clause is the exact opposite of what he. alleges.,36
135,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,-Sectio n 131 of the principal Act saysNo goods the property of the Commonwealth shall be liable to any duty of Customs.,36
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"And clause 10 of the Bill says that that section shall not apply. The effect of the clause, therefore, is to do exactly what the honourable member wants.",36
137,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I accept the assurance of the Minister. I see that I was mistaken. There is one other objection which I have to offer to the Bill, namely, that it aims at gradually depriving this Parliament of power to determine anything except vague general legislation. Clause 4 seeks to repeal section SO of the principal Act. Now, schedule 2 of the principal Act prescribes the fee3 which shall be chargeable against warehouses. Under this Bil l that power will be placed in the hands of the Minister.",36
138,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,He is responsible to the House.,36
139,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The honourable member apparently forgets that under the War Precautions Act very large powers were vested in the hands of Ministers, and, as a result, a number of honourable members got doses of something which they did not like. That is why I am prepared-to kick. So long as I am a member of this Parliament I shall protest against the Government taking unto themselves powers which properly belong to this Parliament. The longer this process continues, the more incompetent will honourable members become to enact legislation in the interests of this country. Apparently the only'voice ' we Shall have in these matters will be in our power to take exception to regulations when they are laid upon the table of the House. If no exception be taken, those regulations will have the force of law within a period of fourteen days.",36
140,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,We cannot take exception to regulations.,36
141,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Then why are there notices of motion on the business-paper disagreeing with regulations which have been made under an Act of Parliament.,36
142,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,No regulation has ever been discussed in this Chamber since the inception of the Commonwealth.,36
143,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The honourable member's first statement .was that we could not take exception to them. Yet honourable members are prepared .to give this'power to the Government. Mr RioHARD POSTER.:-The Bill does the very opposite.,36
144,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I repeat . that regulations which are framed by Ministers under an Act of Parliament have to be laid on the table of the House, and if no' exception be taken to them within a prescribed period, they have the force of law. I need scarcely remind honourable members that regulations framed under the War Precautions Act have been presented to Parliament, and honourable mem. - bers have tabled motions disagreeing with them. But by means of certain standing orders, the Government have effectually prevented those motions from being discussed.",36
145,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,I understand that in another place honourable members have been more successful.,36
146,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"What has that to do with us ? I cannot be bluffed like that. When once effect has been given to regulations, this House is impotent to alter them. That applies to this Bill and to nearly every Act of Parliament providing for the payment of fees. The Minister should make up his mind, as to the different fees his officers should receive, and incorporate them in a schedule to the Bill, and not leave them to be prescribed in an indefinite way. I shall always protest against the gradual taking away of the power of honourable members and placing it in the hands of Ministers- a course of procedure which simply compels those of us who are not in the Ministry to become useless excrescences on the legislative machine.",36
147,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Maribyrnong) [12.46]. - I cannot endorse the sentiment expressed by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), that every encouragement should be given to the establishment of trade between Australia and America and 'Canada, and other places bordering on the Pacific Ocean, because thearrangement of a reciprocal agreement with those countries, even with other Dominions of the Empire, would mean that there would be very littl e for Australian - workmen to do. country stands out particularly as a very serious competitor with Australia. I hope the day will come when, actuated by the best of good sense, we shall give the Minister for Trade and Customs the statutory power to say that goods shall not be permitted to enter Australia unless they are manufactured under conditions similar to those prevailinghere. A good deal has been said about the effect that the shipping disabilities have had in increasing the cost of imported goods, but the Minister (Mr Greene) has shown us that, so far as shipping between Great Britain and Australia is concerned, conditions are now almost normal. In fact, he has explained that some of our vessels which are bringing back troops are arriving in ballast. Since the war began, one country which has been able to control the seas and its own mercantile marine has been in a position to land goods in Australia at a cost with which Australian manufacturers have not been able to compete. The trade which this country is doing with Australia has so increased that persons who were fiscal atheists are now awaking to the fact that if Australia is to be in a position to pay its enormous debt, every effort must be made to find employment for its people. country is to be in a position to hold out a welcoming hand to immigrants, its in dustries must be stimulated.",37
148,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,How does this Bill affect the matter?,37
149,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"This is a Bill places in the hands of the Minister f Trade and Customs certain administrative powers, making it possible for him to tect the industries of Australia, or leave ' them practically at the mercy of other countries. We ought to insert a insisting that goods shall not be allowed to come into Australia unless they are cers manufactured under conditions similar those applying here. W it h such a provision we would not be subjected to the very undesirable competition which we now suffeT.",37
150,Mr MCDONALD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Why admit the goods at all?,37
151,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"That is what I say. One need not nowadays speak with bated breath of Japan. . That country has landed millions of pounds'. worth of goods in Australia during the war; and, be it said to their lasting disgrace, since One the war broke out and our trading con. nexion with Germany ceased, many people who call themselves Australians 'have taken themselves to this Eastern country, and filled it with orders for goods for Australia. The goods supplied to those orders are now coming here. When the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs, he found that all kinds of faked invoices were being foisted on the Customs Department.",37
152,Mr MCDONALD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,That practice has been going on for many years.,37
153,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The honourable member for Y a r r a and other Ministers who followed him,- and probably, also, preced- ' ing Ministers, sought to defeat this practice by sending to Germany, Great B r i tain, and, I believe, America, certain men who were splendidly qualified for the duties they were called upon to perform, namely, to examine the invoices of goods being shipped to Australia. I heard it said by the late Senator MCGregor that, owing to the undervaluation of invoices, Australia was losing Â£1,000,000 per annum.",37
154,Mr MCDONALD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"There was the Reid case. If this Mr Fenton - Yes , we have had some disgraceful exhibitions of undervaluations. Our Customs Department, under State management or under Federal administration, has been "" r o o k e d "" time after time. In this respect conditions which have improved in recent years, and I beo r lieve that Australia is now enjoying the receipt of Customs duties on goods valued proat their proper invoice value at the port of shipment. But when I look at the latest figures supplied by Mr EInibbs, and see clause what an immense quantity of goods is coming in , I realise that our Customs offihave their hands fair l y full . D u r in g to the first nine months of the financial year .191.8-19, .textile .goods, not includingapparel, ""were .imported to .the vialue pf .JE21,.0OO,OOO, as - against Â£dl,000,,<000 for ,a - done 'so I do aaot similar period in 1917-18.

An honest man may - object to this scrutiny of his books, but the Customs Department has come to the conclusion, from what has happened'in the past, that every man doing business with it must be - deemed to be a .rogue. I would like the Minister (Mr Greene) to .state whether the same investigations take place in - Japan ; whether our officers are privileged to enter a Japanese merchant's warehouse and ascertain the value of his goods prior to exportation.",37
155,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,We do the best we can to arrive at the value of goods in Japan.,38
156,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Fro m what I know of the habits of the .Japanese, I 'am doubtful whether our Australian Customs officers wise .permitted'ito enter a Japanese ware-house in order to secure the information .they .can obtain in Great Britain.

That judgment came tas a surprise to the trade. It was severely technical, and having regard to the case 'umider consideration, it was, in a way,' cruel. It disturbed the commercial in-terests in Australia considerably in 'every State, and naturally so.",38
158,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The practice was always the same.,39
159,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"It was not. The case was the typical one, and had reference to the importation of a shipment of linoleums.. It affected ^several houses im the Commonwealth in 'this - way.: The firm purchased linoleums - and wanted them. immediately, because the market mas bare here. They could not /get them lor months, because there was no shipping. In some, instances that I know personally they not only purchased the linoleums, but they solid them here right out. After a. good many 'months' delay, the linoleums came along. They were delivered and paid for, and then the Customs stepped in and said the invoice was not correct, as it did not represent the value of the goods at the time of shipment. Neither did it , but it followed the practice that had always been observed, and *the case was an exceedingly hard one, because these men, in good faith and in the course of honest trading, had received the goods, distributed them, and obtained the money for them, 'and then the Customs Department claimed duty on a higher price.",39
160,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"How .long after they had imported, them?",39
161,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"It must have been at least a month after, because - they would not have been paid for in.less than a month, even hy cash 'buyers. , ! I admit 'that it ""was - a war conditiom, but ' I - claim the attention of the Minister ""while I deal with the question of values. T shall show that these traders here were not only doing the thoroughly honest thing, but they were adopting a practice that l a d been observed for a generation :back.",39
162,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The .practice in Goode's case had been in force for many months. Mr jRICHARD F . OSTE - E - TI admit that - war scon'ditions made all .'the difference.

163,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Not for many years, because I had it out with the Customs Department, and they could not set up a proper moral defence. Mr LECKIE:-Apparently , if you touch one Customs Minister, you touch the lot.",39
164,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Yes ; if ordinary traders could only trade .under the conditions obtaining in the Customs Department, they could do mighty well, because the Department .goes always on the principle of "" heads I win, tails you lose.""",39
165,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,No chance!,39
166,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"It is admittedly so, and possibly there has been justification, because there are fraudulent persons; but it should also fee remembered that special penalties are very properly provided against fraud. The .Department .established values in a very im- moral way, as I .shall show. At the time the linoleums were shipped, the market at Home was bare. There are certain makers of linoleums who are well known, and their makes are - standard makes. They had m:o stocks, and, therefore, to - ascertain values at .Home at the .time of this 'shipment, you had .to go to the place where the few linoleums that were in existence would command, almost any price that the holders liked to ask for them. Is that a fair .or decent standard of value? I say it i's not, and I appeal to the .honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), who would do .all he could - to help Customsduties upwards, to say whether it is. It is not a fair moral .standard .of value, .and trade could jiever be conducted .under such conditions. .My honourable friends opposite .are .always talking .about profiteering, and the oppression .of the consumer. This practice does .not give them .a fair deal, because it is .they, and - not ithe importer, who must pay .the extra amount, '.except .in this unfortunate instance, where the .importer had followed the practice of a generation back, and thus landed himself in a position where he could not recover what - was claimed from him after the goods 'had been paid for. Although tihe High Court judgment has been - given,'the ifirjm internd, - whatever .it - costs - them, to take .the-case ito ithe P.rivy Council. I understand there are certain limitations, and that they have to obtain permission to go to the Privy Council'. They ought to' have permission. It cannot on any moral grounds, or o n . any grounds of equity, be withheld from them. If this practice is to be established, it is going to prevent in trade what is known as forward buying, because that will be made impossible.",39
167,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Not in peace times.,40
168,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Le t me elaborate that. The Minister for Trade and Customs does not like mv calling this a new practice, and he would certainly object to my calling it an immoral practice, but if it is recognised, what object is there in a man buying forward ? Buying forward is a common and very legitimate practice in business.",40
169,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The buyer takes the risk on that buying.,40
170,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Of course, and if his risk comes off right, his enterprise is all in the interests of the consumer, because he wil l bring much cheaper stuff to this country. The practice in trade is for a certain percentage to be put on the goods. If a man, instead of getting the benefit of forward buying, must pay Customs duty on the price current at the date of shipment, the consumers wil l not get the advantage from his enterprise which they would otherwise get. Take, for example, cottons. It is a common thing for the manufacturer to look ahead for one, two or even three years.",40
171,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Are you referring to cotton piece goods? Mr RICHARD . FOSTER - I am talking about the raw material. Australian importer sees that a rise is coming along, and these men know pretty well what the world's markets are, he steps in and buys forward, not for immediate delivery, but for a long time ahead. I admit that so far as the Customs are concerned, he would not have serious difficulty in the case of cottons, because there is not much of a duty.",40
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Cotto n piece goods fro m the United Kingdom are free.,40
173,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Yes , my argument is a b it at fault , and I must take another material with cotton in it .",40
174,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Tweeds , which may have 95 per cent, cotton in them, are charged as woollens.",40
175,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Tak e that material as a basis. The practice will interfere with a man who wishes to buy forward. Again, in the matter of. declaring values, the Customs officer may aver a certain value, and under this Bill that averment will be taken as pritnd facie evidence of the value.",40
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The honourable member is getting on to quite a different subject.,40
177,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"It is d if ferent, but it very often has the same effect on the importer.",40
178,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,In normal times there will be no difference.,40
179,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I admit that. Some members have referred to the Chambers of Commerce. These bodies in all the States got a scare about this Bill , but in South Australia the Collector was able to remove a great deal of the feeling of unrest, because the Chamber of Commerce there had. not seen the Bill , and were proceeding under a misapprehension. The member for Kooyong is perfectlyright in saying that in normal times the practice wil l not make much difference in the case of cottons, particularly with regard to the United Kingdom, because there is a fairly level and even standard ofbusiness there, and it is pretty honest too. But there are other parts of the world which proceed on different principles.",40
180,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Exactly .,40
181,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I admit that, in making that statement, I am giving my case away. But , after all , I am only asking for a f a ir thing. Honourable members are aware that there are other conditions where the declaration If an of values for export are, I shall not say false, but compared with the principle set out in clause 11 of this Bill , are on a false basis. EveryÂ« one knows that the United States, for instance, exports its surpluses at prices much lower than those ruling for home consumption.",40
182,Sir ROBERT BEST,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,That is very rough on the people at home.,40
183,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"And rough on our fiscal policy here. I understand that in' Canada, New Zealand, and South A f r i c a, the principle for. which this Bill provides is recognised, and it means that in respect of imports from the United States duty will have to be paid, not on the prices for export, but on the home values. That will be a distinct advantage to Australian industries. It will mean a li t t le more protection for them, and an extra preference to Great Britain.",40
184,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,It will make the preference to Britai n effective.,41
185,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Yes ; and even better than it appears to be.,41

189,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"There may be such people. The Minister must admit that the Adelaide case to which I have referred was an exceedingly hard one, and I think that a refund should be made to the firm in question ",41

195,Mr FALKINER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"But I object to the provision that the decision of the Minister shall be final and conclusive. These arbitrary powers should not be vested in the Minister or the permanent head, save where there has been some violation of alaw of the Commonwealth.",41
196,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"South Sydney) [2.37] I cannot agree with the conclusion ar--rived at by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster), whospoke of a shipment of goods which were sold before arrival here, and who considered it to be a great hardship that the - importers were called upon to pay an in creased rate of duty because the value of such goods in the country of origin had increased between the date of their purchase and the time of shipment. The honourable member urged that, in the in terests of consumers, the excess duty so - I collected should be refunded to the i m porters. If he could guarantee that the consumers would be benefited in the shape of reduced. prices to the extent of the ' money so refunded, there might be some reason in his argument. It seems to me, however, that an importer who purchased in a low market would take advantage of We have the any subsequent increase in values, and would sell, at the higher rate, so that the general public would receive no benefit if a refund such as the honourable member suggests were made.",41
197,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"My reply to that is that the particular goods to .which I have referred were sold at a rate corresponding with the price at which they were purchased, and that the importers hours had to bear the loss of the increased duty",41
198,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Thes e people take risks, he may, and the Government should not be exthe expected to guarantee them against loss when they buy six or twelve months ahead the decision of their requirements. W it h the general principles of the Bill ComI largely agree, but I regret that the for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) has not availed himself of this - opportunity to take more power to conat trol exports. Yesterday, I asked him a change. question relating to the high cost of. boots - and leather, - but he denied that there any increase in prices. In today's newsime papers, .there - appears a report of an i quiry in which it is shown that the prices of military and other boots have consider50 per cent. ably increased, and that these increases. .are likely to go on. By means of this Bill the Minister could take power to protect sheets. the .users of boots - and leather just as he is taking .power to protect the Customs revenue. He could provide for the regulation of the export of leather and raw hides. Mr .RODGERS - The honourable member would protect Australian industries, 'in addition would reduce the value of the raw material to the producers - well.",41
199,Mr FALKINER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,The producers of the hides apparently should not get anything lor them.,42

T t is not my desire-that the producers of hides, .or any other Taw material, - should not get a f a ir price, 'but we ought to have some regard for the consumers. agents are - touring - the 'Commonwealth buying - up all the leather and hides they can secure.

202,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I want a fair thing for the people of this country, and the people will insist upon getting it . The price of boots has gone up to the extent of 50 per cent., or more. Even children's boots have increased i h price to - the extent of 100 per cent. There is a screw loose somewhere, and the Minister, by means of this Bill , should try to tighten it up.

210,Mr RILEY,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"That will ndt keep iour manufacturing industries going. Boot manufacturers have.'been making goods of a very .high quality, but because America is prepared to pay ,a big price for the best - hides, the boot making industry must be shut down.

Mr ELEMHMh (Robertson) [2.48] The honourable, member for South Sydney { Mr Riley) has-tried to 'impress upon the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) the desirability of prohibiting to a certain extent the export of our raw products. the necessity for ' that course arises from the fact that the have toi pay more for their goods, and will soon be causing a disturbance. The man in Australia who has most reason, to rise'ini his wnath is the producer on the land. The honourable member referred to the income tax which some landholders' are paying. Under the present system of taxation aman-- who is raising stockmight easily, and very often does;, pay substantial tax, althoughhis operations for the year, have shown a loss. Very frequently he' pays taxation on the natural' increase of his flocks and herds upon which he never realizes: Under our absurd method of taxation a-man is charged-taxation on what the Department' calls the average value of his stock, but in many cases that stock dies before the grower has an opportunity of turnin g it into cash.",42
211,Mr FALKINER,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"The man on the land is the only person in the community who, when he is obliged to keep his stock until it has depreciated' with age, is notallowed to writei t down.",43
212,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Is there no remedy?.,43
213,Mr FLEMING,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"None . For years when I was in the Parliament of N South Wales I fought the Income Tax Commissioneron this matter. Finally, I received) an assurance in writin g from the Commissioner that natural increase would not be taxedu n t i l it had arrived at the age of maturity, which, in the case ofi sheep, was fixed, at twelve months. But that promise has never been carried out.; taxation, is stillcollected on. unrealized natural increase. To my certain knowledgemen in .

The grower pays his taxation on the natural increase, although he may never get a penny from it 1 intend on another occasion) to suggest what I considerafair system of taxation for the man on the land . We are told 1 1 that' this measurewill stimulate primary industries, and that it is necessary, to do that'- in' order to meet Australia's enormousdebt. What are the industries that He says that will enable us to bear the burden of debt? According to the Commonwealth consumers 7ear-Booh - the added valueof manufacturesi n 1916 was Â£67,000-000, and the total actual return, from primary production was Â£201,000,000-exactl y threetimes the return of the value ofmanufactures. Yet .we are told that the primary industries are to'be kept in check by not beingallowed, to export their products at the world's value. Our national debt will 1 be a considerableburdenon. Australia, and howare we to meet it unless we enincome courage wealth production? Can we encourage wealth, production under the pre-sent iniquitous system of taxation, and if effect is given to the ideas that have been enunciated by the honourable member for South Sydney and. others on the Opposition side?",43
215,Mr F,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"AXKINER - Why complain? If they had not those ideas they wouldown our stations..' Mir. FLEMING - Unles s something is done to alleviate the position of the man ohthe land, primary production will' not increase at anything like the rate it should do. In addition to the taxation which he has to pay he must lock up in his business a far greater amount of capital, in proportion to his production than e w any other class of trader. The manufacturer has a. turnover annually of the greater part of his capital. Every bank in Australia i's anxious to. get commercial business, but very few are willing to extend their - operations in. connection with land propositions. The reason is plain. Whilst the commercial man. has a. quick and frequent turnover of his capital, the man on the land, especially if he owns freehold, has the far greater part. ofi. his capital locked up. - Mr FALKINER.:-And the manuiEacturer often* is merely aleaseholder.",43
216,Mr FLEMING,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"-The primary producer also is a leaseholder at times. The p r i m a r y producer on freehold"" land is the best asset* that' this country has, because he has a--greater-inducement to improve hisholdingthan' has any leaseholder. But underthepresent' system the freeholders with) large, capital locked up aregetting a smaller return for their capital than are any other men in Australia. The consequence is that they are becoming tired of "" carrying the baby,"" and many of them are trying to sell out. That is a very serious state of affairs, having regard to the present financial position of Australia. Frequently these men must continue buying land in order to save their stock, or to cut down the managerial and overhead expenses of their blocks. They have about reached their limit , and unless some rejief is afforded there - will be no necessity to place any restriction on the export of primary products, because there will be a very much reduced quantity available for export. I desire to suggest to the Minister seems to in e a very proper extension the trade of this country. At present are practically ignorant of what the British Empire as an Empire can do. various Dominions are all at a loss know what position they bear in relation to each other. This country would do. well to establish a Board of inquiry and adjustment to ascertain exactly what commodities Australia can produce to greater advantage than any other part of the British - Dominions. If every other Dominion throughout the Empire did the same, and a free interchange of goods be the tween the various parts of the British Empire were arranged, we should then in something like a sound position to frame a Tariff.",43
217,Mr RODGERS,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Hav e we not a Board of Trade ?,44
218,Mr FLEMING,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"I am told that the Board of Trade is trying to carry out policy to a certain extent, but it is whelmed with a multiplicity of activities, and there is no body whose specific duty it is to ascertain what we can produce more advantage than any other part of I the Empire, and vice versa. The has arrived, as the. result of the recent world-wide upheaval, when if we are to maintain our leadership in the tradeof the world, we must find out exactly where'' we stand, instead of continuing to beat the air as 'we have' been doing for many years. I wish to impress upon the Minister the desirability of promoting commercial relations with Canada. In that Dominion there is a marvellous ignorance of the production of Australia.' There are great opportunities for reciprocal trade between Canada and the Commonwealth, but there is nobody in authority there to in struct the Canadian people regarding the openings for trade wibh us.",44
219,Mr MCDONALD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,We are very little better off in England.,44
220,Mr FLEMING,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"That is true. I suggest to the Minister that ib is advisable bo esbablish in Canada a Trade Commissioner who would be able to advise the people of the Dominion of whab trade can be done between them and us to our mutual advantage. I assure him that many of the leading men of Canada hold the idea that the British Dominionsshould trade amongst themselves to the what best advantage, thab we should know more of of each obher, and work together more we than we have done' in the pasb bo promobe the stability of the Empire. As a prir The niary producer I say that Australia to stands to benefit by that movement as much as, if not more than, any other part of the Empire. We are the mosb happilycircumstanced country in the world for primary production except for the lack of sympathy on the part of the Government. There is no question that the city interests overshadow us here to a larger extent than - they dq in most of the Dominions. Yet same problem confronts them all. But in Australia we have presented to us the be finest opportunity which could be presented to a country of primary production, such as this undoubtedly is. Under our present system we .are breeding the best men who have ever been seen in the fighting line. Yet we have been told that we must divert population from the lines this of natural production into the channels overof manufacture. When I hear speeches such as were delivered by the honourable member for South Sydney, and realise to where they would lead us, and when know how the country interests time are suffering at the present moment, I cannot too strongly endeavour to convince the Government that if the existing d r if t be allowed to continue, we shall have very little chance indeed of progressing along that upward road which we have hitherto travelled. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4:Section 80 of the principal Act is repealed and the .following section inserted in its stead :"" 80.

221,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Henty) [8.3] - I would like the Minister to tell the Committee exactly what he wants in the matter of the fees to he charged under this Bill, and to ask him to include them in schedule 2 of the principal Act.",45
222,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Richmond-Minister foT Trade and Customs) [3.4J - It has been found in - practice that it would be to the benefit of the commercial community, as well as of the Customs Department, if we had something upon which we could come and go with a little more freedom than we can under schedule 2 of the principal Act. For instance, it has been found that, if through any inadvertence on behalf of a licensee, the licence-fees are not paid on the prescribed date, and in the prescribed way, we have no option but to cancel the whole of the securities and to enter into a new agreement. In this clause we are merely seeking to do what we have alrbady done under our Excise Act.",45

224,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Yes ; and we left the matter to be prescribed by regulation. The Department has no intention of doing anything which will be detrimental to the interests of the commercial community. We merely want a little more liberty than we have under existing circumstances, and we also desire to bring the provisions of this measure into line with legislation which we have recently enacted. Clause agreed to. Clauses 5 to 8 agreed to. Clause 9Section 119 of the principal - Act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead :"" 119.

At an earlier stage in the discussion of this measure I outlined the reasons which have prompted me to submit the amendment. I will not repeat those reasons now, but i will content myself with saying that I object to the arbitrary powers which this clause proposes to vest in Ministers.",45
226,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Yarra) [3.8] - I understand that the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) objects to the decision of the Minister being final. In my opinion' it is better for the commercial community that that should be the posi-. tion. Otherwise a man may have his whole business hung up until he can resort to litigation and obtain a decision from a Law Court. The practice proposed in the clause is that which is al- % ready in existence, and, in my opinion, it is a good one.",45
227,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.9] - I do not think it would be found practicable to do what the honourable member for Hume (Mr Falkiner) suggests. In any case,, it . would depend upon the Minister whether a clearance was ultimately given. If he decided that no clearance should be granted until some requirement had been complied with, under this amendment the owners would probably be obliged to have recourse to legal proceedings before a determination could be arrived at. In this clause we simply declare what is the practice which obtains today. Whilst provisions of the Customs Act. may have been respected, there may, nevertheless, be harbour dues, or some law in connection "" with the States which has not been comtice. plied with. Mr FALKTNER:-I h that case the Minister can refuse a clearance.",45
228,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"It is not the practice to refuse the clearance of a vessel unless' there is some requirement of the law which has still to be complied with. The clause is perfectly safe in its present and I cannot accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. Mr BOYD' (Henty) [3.12] - I moveister That sub-clause 3 be left out. The Minister' already has. authority practically to do what he likes in the matter of clearance, and. under this provision he seeks to take to himself power to say that irrespective of whether he does right or wrong, no action shall lie against him. That seems to me to the an extraordinary power. For the Government to say that if they do a private citizen an injury, that citizen shall have no Tedress - Mr ErjsMiN.G.:-Some officials, are. afraid that they may make mistakes.

' Fair market value * in this section means the sum of the following :(a) the price for which ' any cash purchaser could at the time of shipment purchase for home consumption such goods in the principal markets of the country whence the goods were exported, but not being in any case less than the actual money price shown in the genuine invoice . . . .",46
235,Mr FINLAYSON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Brisbane) [8.26]. - I wish' to place before the Committee certain communications I have received from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce expressing their views upon this clause. I may say that they also express my own views upon the matter. On the 11th August I received the following telegram : Wired Minister Customs following. Please support. Customs Act Amendment Bill. This Chamber strongly objects to new clause declaring duty must be paid on home consumption value at date of shipment, making it impossible to know landed cost of goods in some cases for year. Enormous details required will prevent manufacturers selling to Australia choosing'easier markets. No necessity now as shipments will' be prompt and markets not likely to rise. On the following day I received another telegram, as follows:- ' - Further to our telegram yesterday: Brisbane Chamber emphatically protests against Customs having two separate bases of charging duty, also object to indefinite basis which leaves landed cost unknown before sale. These telegrams were succeeded by a covering letter, as follows: I enclose copies of telegrams sent to you on the llfch and 12th inst., which I now confirm. I have also sent similar telegrams to the Chambers of Commerce in Sydney, Melbourne, [458] NOBS. and Adelaide, and Messrs. Mackay, Bayley, Corser, and Groom, asking them to support' the action of this Chamber, because the view my Council take of the matter is that the basis of duty should be definitely fixed, and that the importer should not be put to the risk of being made to pay further duties, which, in most cases, are levied by the Department after the goods have been sold and paid for,- consequently the importer has to bear the loss without any possibility of redress. As I consider that t'he new arrangement provided for in this clause is unnecessary and will act detrimentally to the interests of Australia in its trade relations with other countries, I shall vote against it .",47
236,Mr BOYD,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Henty) [ 3 . 2 8 ] - I mloveThat the words "" but not being in any case less than the actual money price shown in the genuine invoice,"" lines 11-13, be left out. If this amendment is agreed to it will mean that the Customs Department will be obliged to resort to the practice followed since the war began. The Customs Act already gives the Department the power to' ascertain at the port of shipment the price of any goods for which invoices are presented. If the price at the port of shipment is found to be higher than the value shown on the invoice, duty can be charged on that higher price. On the other hand, if a reduction 'has been brought about in t'he price of the goods by the collapse of the war-the goods may have been held up in . dock in Great Britain for a considerable time - the Department, with a knowledge of the value at the port of shipment at the time the goods were entered for clearance, merely charges duty on that value. .The Customs Department promised the importers that this system would be continued, and if the promise is not redeemed, it will amount to an attempt on the part of the Department to keep up prioes, and so in directly swell the cry of profiteering. If this clause is levelled against Japan, why should not the Minister (Mr Greene) in for m honourable members? Surely the time has gone when we must hesitate to open our mouths in regard to Japan. The Parliament of that country does not scruple to express its views concerning other nations. Is not our trade our own business?  Japan's Navy is bigger than ours. Mr BOY p - T r u e ; and. if there was the slightest fear of our being compelled to match our Navy against that of Japan, in.a matter of'trade, we might be justified in speaking'-with bated breath. But the war is over, and 'Australia is still part and parcel of. the ""Empire. In time war the Britishi and Australian Navies one. Remembering that, therefore, it ' particular clause. will not be argued that the Japanese Navy is a match for pur ships. _ I should .be .called .upon, to defend our country, I think Australians would .be capable of doing so. That argument, however, is .not .appropriate to this.discussought an-explanation of this, clause. sion. .On a matter of trade solely, there is any risk in regard to .Japan, there is urgent reason why this clause should be passed, why does not the M i ister supply the whole of the facts ?",47
237,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Richmond-Ministe for Trade .and Customs) [3.33] - I regret that T cannot accept the amendment. Although this clause will . assist us rially., in dealing with difficulties enced by the Department regarding Japanesetrade, it will also apply a number of other countries which are porting to us lines of.goods for which there is no consumption value within countries. There are numerous items ported to Australia which have been raade-'especially for the'Australian trade. . Mr BOYD - In .which case you accept the invoice value.",48
238,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Exactly ; and that what is implied here. We take the genuine invoice value; we say, "" But i shall not be less than that .

I have personally consulted Customs officials, and have I if ask .honourable members to imagine that if the pen which I hold in my hand was made in Japan, or in some.other foreign n - country. I want it to be understood that it is an article which is not used in the r country of its-manufacture. It would be competent for the'foreign manufacturer to assess its home consumption value afc 3d., matefor the reason, that it has no home conexperisumption value whatever. I had hoped that the Minister (Mr Greene) would to quite offer some obvious way out of our exdifficulty, but he. has failed to do so; and .1 .certainly can .see no soluthose tion. ..We are told that a similar .exprovision is to ' be found within every Customs Act throughout, the world, and that it is the only effective .safeguard against dumping. We have, therefore, no . alternative. We are up against a is stone wall. The Minister assures the Committ.ee that we are putting altogether t a wrong interpretation on the Bill , and 'that when we reach normal conditions in regard to shipping, and other matters, - the purchaser will be able to ship at once, in and.the clause will not apply, except when dumping is indulged in .

241,Mr FENTON,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"If that is the difficulty, I see the necessity for still further safeguards, and an amendment should be moved, if not at this stage, certainly comlater, to protect us much more strictly than.we'are protected by this clause.

250,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Y a r r a ) [3.46] - I favour strengtheningthe Customs Act so as to make-it-impossible for persons who enCustoms deavour to defraud' the Customs .to do so. I wish to put every person on a fair so footing, so that all, may pay 20s. in the Â£ 1 , and L believe' that 95 per cent, of the traders desire that. It is to protect bhat 95 per cenb. against the unscrupu5 per cent, that we should make the they Act as sbrong as possible. Some of them have no objection to putting in a home value wherethere is none. In-1904 or-1905, when we were fixing the duty on stripper harvesters, the. Masseypeople made it appear, that they - be were selling in the United States at an ill of entirely different price from what they were prepared to export their goods to counAustralia for. They wanted to have the duty fixed on what they alleged to be our the market"" price there. Another phase of the question is that plenty of firms factories ""inone country and a sellingbranch in another country. They member have what: are known as house-to-house th transfers. They sell their goods without anyprofit in tae-. country of export, and our make the whole of their profit here.",49
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,Many companies have a manufacturing establishment and a sellwe ing-company. That is what Singers-do.,49
252,Mr TUDOR,INCREMENTSAND BONUSES,"Yes . The International Harvester Company may have a manufacturing company in America and a. sellinghouse here. It may cost them Â£40 to manufacture ' their harvesters. may decide to make no profit thereand fix the price at Â£ 4 0 , so as to get the advantage of the ad valorem duty here, letting their Australian houses make the whole of the profit. If , on the other hand, it is advantageous to them to reverse the procedure for income tax purposes, they will make the whole of their profits there and none here. That is what the Customs Department has continually to watch. This clause is much shorter than the section which is being struck out of the original Act, and which was framed, I think, by Charles Cameron Kingston. It ran154. When any duty is imposed according to value(a) The value shall be taken to be the fair' market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence the same were exported in the usual and ordinary commercial acceptation of the term, and free on board at the port of export in such country and a further addition of 10 per cent, on such market value. (6) The value shall be verified at the time of entry by the production of the genuine invoice, and by a declaration signed by the owner in the presence of the Collector. (c) The invoice shall be stamped by the Collector with the Customs stamp, and shall be produced to the officer prior to the delivery of the goods for home consumption or for warehousing. [d) If the non-production of the genuine invoice shall be accounted for to the satisfaction of the Collector, proof of its contents by a copy or otherwise may be received in lieu of its production. There 'were a great number of cases under that section. This bound volume of Acts has no fewer than three foot-notes that section, showing that cases have already' been decided upon it, and there is an eternal fight between the Customs officials and importers as to the true value on which duty should be paid. I would go much further than the Minister. I would compel every importer to lodge with the Customs Department duplicate invoice, so that if a dispute arose at any time, a copy of the genuine invoice would be available to the Department, and there would be no fear of its destruction by fire. On one occasion, while I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs, it was proposed to make a raid on certain premises at 10 a.m. next day. Only four persons were aware of that intention; but a few hours before the time fixed for the raid a fire took place. It might have been purely acci2fr. Tudor. dental, but it was a curious circumstance. Cases have occurred where the Department has asked permission to examine the books of a firm. A Customs official has visited the firm's premises, perhaps on a Saturday morning, and has been told, "" We are about to close, up. Y o u had better come round on Monday morning, and we will fixup the matter with you."" Before Monday there has been a fire. I would strengthen the hands of the Department in the interests of the great majority of traders, who are endeavouring to do the fair thing. I do not think the clause, as it stands, will lead to any inflation of prices. If , because of it , one-tenth of the goods coming in were given an inflated value, I am convinced that the price of the remaining 90 per cent, would go up in proportion. I shall support this clause as it stands. My only regret is that the Minister is not prepared to make it even stronger.

I move That the following words be added to paragraph o:- "" such value to be made public by the Comptroller-General."" I move .this amendment with the object of enabling the public to ascertain what is really paid by importers for goods which they bring into this country. The time has arrived when there should be no further secrecy in this regard, in view of the extortionate prices which' the consumers are now being charged - During the debate on this Bill, a good deal has been said as to the need for protecting importers against the payment of increased duty as the result of an increase in the price of goods in the country of origin between the date of purchase and the time of shipment. Nothing has been said, however, as to the need of protecting the public from the high charges imposed upon them by importers and others. In view of what is happening, and the clamour on the part of the people gene rally for an investigation as to the reasons for the increased cost of living, it is time for this Parliament to take action. We have here an opportunity to do something in thedesired direction. If this amendment be agreed to, the public will be able to know exactly what these goods cost to land, and to compare those costs with the prices which they have to pay. They will thus be in a position to determine whether or not the retail prices are exorbitant. We have in the community today men who contend that prices are not excessive-that there is no profiteering going on-bu t that the increased prices ruling here for various goods are due to the increases paid for them in the country of origin. If that is so, let us clear the public mind of any suspicion that profiteering is going on. No one objects to any man getting a fair return on his caoital, however it may be employed; but the Labour party urge that no man should be so protected as to be able, with impunity, to make exorbitant charges. At present we have no means of ascertaining what prices are paid by those who import goods, and I think it is reasonable that the Committee should say that, in view of what is taking .place, the Comptroller-General should make public what is the declared value of goods upon which duty is imposed.

256,Mr SPENCE,PROSECUTIONS UNDER WAR,"Darwin) [ 4 . 3 ] - I wish to direct the attention of the Government to a matter that is in course of development in Australia today, and which, I th'iuk, they should look into. In their desire to establish new industries in Australia;, the Government made some concession; in the shape, I think, of a reduction of' duty, to a company known as the 1 Australasian Films Company, undertook to enter upon the production of picture-"" films in Australia. As honourable members are"" aware; the industry has attained immense dimensions in the ; United - States of America. In Australia, with facilities in the shape of the best possible climate for photography and the possession of plenty of artistic talent, it washoped: that the company would begin the business of picture-film production. T. regret that they-have not. done so, and I wish to direct the attention! of the Government to. the fact that there appears toibe a. move on foot to form nothing less than a Trust, which, will Have oomplete control of ""the Australian picture-theatres and the films screened in them. I find tKat' the Australasian, Films Company aTe' practically agentsf or big pictureproduction companies in the United The States of America. They are distributers of films, and make profits from that business; but at the present time the proprietors of picture-theatres may obtain their films direct-from, the producers if they, please. I have, here a copy of an agreement that is: being submitted to picture-show proprietors, with, a view to forming anassociation, first, in New vessels South Wales-the head-quarters, of the Australasian Films Company-and , later, in the other States. One of ' the conditions proposed is that picture-show men joining the association undertake to take their films from the Australasian Films 1 Company. T shall supply the Minister who has control of the business with a copy of the agreement I have here, but I may quote""from one article of the agreement to give honourable members some idea of what is proposed. I find this condition proposedThe company agrees to hire to the exhibitor the motion-picture film service, more particularly describedin the second schedule hereof for a period of consecutive weeks, commencing on the day of One thousand nine hundred and week. The nineteen, and terminating on the day. of ' One thousand nine hundred and , and all such films as shall bo selected by the company from the product of the following manufacturers, or all such other films as the company may from' time to time own or. control Then follows a long list of companies and names' of recognisedpicture-film artists. Mr JOWETT:-The honourable member should read the list.",52
257,Mr SPENCE,PROSECUTIONS UNDER WAR,"The l is f includes the who Selznick Select pictures, and artists' who are named; the' Metro pictures, with another list of artists; the Goldwyn pictures; Jewel productions-, including the artists Dorothy Phillips and Mrs. Charlie Chaplin; the Sessue Pxayakawa films; the Apollo pictures; Vitagraph Blue Ribbon Features; the' Pathe films; and All StarsSeries, the chief stars in cluding a number of the Higher-priced artists,- such asCharlie Chaplin, M a r y Pickford' and'so-on. There is-nothing'in the agreement r e f e r r i ng to-any Austral i a n pictures'. I am informed on reliable authority that the Australasian Films Company, have an understanding with producers in America to for m what practically will be a Trustin this business, and that they are not to be engaged in the production of pictures in Australia. I will read to the House a paragraph which was published in a Sydney newspaper in order to bluff .the public and keen quiet certain people who arÂ© desirous of producing films in. Australia. AUSTRALIAN .PICTURE PRODUCTION. Sydney Firm's Venture The directors of Australasian Films Limited and Union Theatres Limited have issued instructions for a proportion offchepictures released, and shown by them to be manufactured in Australia, with purely Australian talent where possible. .The company owns, perhaps, the finest studio in the Southern Hemisphere. It is at Rushcutter's Bay, and its cost is said to be Â£10,000. In this studio every possible facility for producing pictures is installed. In addition, a large agricultural holding has been secured at Bindanoon, as well as depots at Black Heath, on the Blue Mountains; and at Wagga, in the Riverina District. The company proposes to produce pictures of purely Australian interest, on a scale hitherto not attempted locally. The full resources of the companies' organization will be placed at the disposal of the scheme Australian producers will be employed if available, and the scenarios will be written by Australians around stories of Australian romanpe .and history. ' .The intention .of the directors at present is to turn out six pictures a year, the first of which will be put in hand almost' immediately. It is not the intention of Australian Filni3 Limited to import either producers or actors, as every effort will .be-made, to use Australian talent throughout the. companies' productions. That statement reads very well, hut the places at Bindanoon and Black Heath, to which reference is made, are merely little week-end huts owned by two of the directors. The firm does own a place at Rushcutter.'s Bay, and the statement about the intention to produce pictures in Australia is only intended to bluff certain people who. are manifesting opposition to the Combine and threatening an exposure .of its operations. The land at Wagga is not intended to be used for picture purposes, but merely came' into the possession of the firm through a lawsuit. intention on.the part of the Australasian Films Limited to produce pictures locally. Such a venture would be less profitable and more risky than their present business of conducting an agency for American firms. This announcement is designed to fool the public and stave off any action that may be taken. - Some men in Australia had the courage to commence the production of moving .pictures in the - Commonwealth. One producer is likely to go right out of the business because of the opposition of Australasian .Films Ltd. The author of the Sentimental Bloke has written a very fine scenario' of that book, 'but the company which is prepared to produce the film is - blocked by the Picture Combine. E n couragement should be given by the Government to local producers. I understand that Australasian Films Limited made a definite promise to the Prime Minister"" (Mr Hughes) that they would encourage local talent, but they are ignoring that - promise when they are attempting, by the formation of a Combine, to prevent the establishment of the film-producing industry in Australia. For that industry Australia possesses every advantage. The climatic conditions are excellent for photography, and w.e have .amongst our people some of. the best histrionic talent in the world. As this is - a matter of very great importance, I ask the Acting - Leader of the .Government (Mr Groom) to make careful in quiry into it . I do not know whether it can be dealt with under the In dustries Preservation Act. Honourable members are aware no doubt that at the present time there is an association of picture show managers, but what I am condemning is the attempt of the Combine to force all these people to take their supplies only from the Australasian Films Limited, which is merely the agent of foreign picture-making - firms. The Government should place a check upon any Combine or Trust if it is legally possible to do so, and should insist that if Australasian Films Limited intends to do anything for local products, some evidence of that intention should be given. I ask the Government to seriously consider the. matter in order that every facility - may be given to those who have the courage to engage in the manuf acture of films within the Commonwealth. 4 There is no",52
258,Mr BRENNAN,PROSECUTIONS UNDER WAR,"Batman) [ 4 . 1 6 ] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Government 'a complaint that has been made to me this afternoon by public servants engaged in the Defence Department. I have been informed that officers of the Defence Department who have been on active service abroad have been notified that they are granted leave of absence for the whole of tomorrow on full pay, for the purpose of participating in the welcome home to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes). Certain of those returned soldiers have represented to me, very naturally, that they regard this permission as being objectionable to them, and as constituting a precedent"" in the Service which is to be deplored. Those of us who have even meagre information are aware of the somewhat ostentatious effort that is being made by the Prime Minister to court the support of the returned soldiers by all sorts of absurd ' and extravagant promises, to which no sane person imagines that he intends or hopes to give effect. This deliberate division of the Public Service into civil and military parties respectively in order to serve political ends cannot be too strongly deprecated. Our soldiers are essentially citizen soldiers, and we have always been told that it is the desire of. the Government and the people .that when they had finished their service abroad they should be re-assimilated by the community and their soldier character shed in the discharge of their civil duties. That is an object which all wise people will keep in view! My particular object in speaking is to voice the feeling of returned soldiers who have expressed to me the view that it is repugnant to them to be asked to leave their work in order to perform functions in which they have no desire to take part, and that in their absence their work should be done by their fellow officers, to whom the concession of leave is not granted. We cannot too strongly reprobate this form of political favouritism, because the granting of leave is a sort of bribe to these men, for whom we all'have every respect, to give their support to the Prime Minister and his policy. I do not think that such a thing has ever been attempted, or even heard of, - before in connection with the administration of the Public Service. I mean the offering of special advantages to one branch of the Service in order that they might manifest their sympathy with the head of the Government. I hope it - will not be persisted in , but that if the matter has ceeded too far to be withdrawn, such a course will not be followed again.",53
259,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTIONS UNDER WAR,"Darling Downs-Min - war, ister for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [4.21] - The matter mentioned by the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Spence) comes within the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Customs, which deals with inquiries into the operations of Trusts and Combines. It is open for anybody who feels aggrieved to make' a complaint to the Comptroller-General, setting out in writin g the ground of complaint. The matter can then be in vestigated by him. I suggest that this proceeding be adopted in the case referred to. It is much to be regretted that the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) has made a complaint this afternoon. His remarks show how utterly he has failed to comprehend the circumstances under which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is returning to Australia. Our soldiers have been abroad fighting for the preservation of the Empire, the freedom of nations, and the destruction of military autocracy. The war having ended, it was necessary to secure in the Peace Treaty the f r u it s of victory obtained by those brave heroes on the battlefields of Europe. It is admitted by all who are impartial judges of the events of the past few months that the Prime M in ister has done magnificent work at the great councils of the nations, which drafted the Peace Treaty.",54
260,Mr BBENNAST,PROSECUTIONS UNDER WAR,That is absolutely denied.,54
261,Mr GROOM,PROSECUTIONS UNDER WAR,"The honourable member utterly fails to understand that thousands of OUT soldiers who went across the seas to fight for the liberty. of this country desire to pay some-tribute to the man who has done his best - to consummate their work. The leave granted to the men is not for political purposes at all, but purely to give them an opportunity which they desire, and which is granted .at their-; own request, to pay a tribute in a-., non-political way to. the Prime M in ister. It is much to be regrettedthat at this time the honourable mempro- ber cannot allow his feelings of - pre- judice to abate in order that the nation (may express, in a whole-hearted manner, . its gratification at - the conclusion of ""the and its appreciation of the menwho fought so courageously and successfullyi n that conflict.
