That includes items It does trouble the opposition that so much these arrangements when perhaps, with a little government, better programs could have been sourced from Australian manufacturers or Australian does require examination. We appreciate that the arrangements for the national government. They involve the arrangements put in place by the New South SOCOG itself. The federal government's particularly as its legislation is Much of the material that is going to perhaps have been supplied for a reasonable which I do not imagine the Attorney-General I would be grateful for a response if he is Nonetheless, it is an issue which leads us, necessary to the running of the Olympics, to raise range of material being brought in and out would have strictly thought necessary. There are some technical provisions in relation required as the goods come into Australia to Olympics. The bill provides Customs with the goods.

The bill will reduce the administrative being temporarily imported into Australia for MAIN COMMITTEE 9701 Sydney Cultural Olympics and a number of events is that no duty is payable on these goods on the end of the year 2000.

This committee is a good example of where Party, the National Party and the Democrats a common goal in mind, with everybody taking the issues in great discussions.

NA 9708 Consumer demand has contributed to this rapid stop shop and being able to get a very large chains would argue, and I think quite rightly, consumer wants. If it is being done in a way that if the consumer thinks that is great. The concern point such that they can use their market power given and then, ultimately, at a price which market failure. I do not think we have irregularities. The strong argument put to us was for a said, that superficially looks attractive. But it is a different matter, particularly if you the majors to 75 per cent of the market overall. 25 per cent each. Or you could say that one then you open it up for having four major stores is required. It also brings in train the problem what that market share is at anyone time.

Some of a state would not seem to be a big deal as at that little region on its own, that one competition could disappear. If the change to do that in the last couple of years, I am situation that occurred in Cooma and Batemans Woolworths stores in both of those towns.

So the major that they have been providing a product that the is fair competition, then that is probably good that we had was that if the chains get to a to dictate to the consumer what they will be is not competitive, then that is when you have got to that point, even though there are some market cap. Once again, as the member for Hunter when you start to look at how you implement that go along the line that was put forward of capping That is saying you can have three majors at should not have any more than 25 per cent, and at 25 per cent each, which goes against what of how you achieve that and how you defme where Woolworths, for instance, would have a third of their stores. Woolworths is owned by individual Australians. You would probably probably see a rapid growth in the shares of have about 14 or 16 per cent of the market. They to grow rapidly.

The subject matter that was investigated committee has had to sit in judgment about behaviour of companies within the retail sector, are made in the context of the pressure that competition and whether it is a perception that because people genuinely believe that that is they have a basis in fact. The difficulty in this inquiry was that we do not have complete investigatory powers actually see what is going on. I suppose in reality to do that and whether that is not more appropriately the committee had to decide. The committee many of these accusations and investigate them about people's perceptions of the reasons for the retail sector and whether the reasons for should be seen as fair competition. There is an expression used in the report beneficial or socially detrimental. That is legislators to achieve. It is also a fine line committee believes that the recommendations if adopted by government, will shift the balance greater confidence to go about competing in Regrettably, a problem that we had was that, retail sector, because the major protagonists in the grocery part of that sector-supermarkets that aspect.

The many accusations that are made about the and often it is difficult to know whether these people feel from the very harsh environment of these things are happening and they are offered the reason that they cannot succeed, or whether had a tight time schedule in which to report. We to subpoena books and go through accounts to we could, but whether we have the expertise done by other bodies was something that believes that bodies like the ACCC should take in a most rigorous way to try to find out more the behaviour of some of the bigger players in that behaviour are, in fact, going beyond what about deciding whether things are either socially a fine line; it is a very fine balance for us as for those who are the regulators. On balance, the that have been made arising from this inquiry, towards the smaller players and give them the market, because that is what it is all about. whilst the terms of reference talked about the that came forward to give evidence were involved and the like-we tended to concentrate on day, because we did that, we have not missed what I believe that the recommendations we have made a subset but to the wider retail sector in to to. It is, in part, driven by what it is perceived people say that that change is being driven by the admitted that they were delving into practices I can think of the evidence given by recommend should be read by all members, as 1, but in marketing 301. This was straight-out this was the way in which they thought their they were going to make sure that they offered in that manner. I do not wish to dwell too much I believe that they need to understand that the which they approached things represented a real they were pushing the envelope towards what NA Wednesday, I September 1999 they believed consumers should do, rather consumers operated. The interesting point about Coca-Cola as of their distribution. They have many thousands other manufacturers that they dealt through might only have in the order of six to seven that was very important: we really need to get to the retailers. At the core of this inquiry sector within the supermarket sector reduces that there would not be sufficient critical mass that the retailers depend on could go about their theme throughout most of the inquiry. To protect that market share, those who sector suggested a cap. The report goes into decided that that form of cap was impractical; other suggestions-especially, the strengthening retailers the opportunity to bring forward representative basis. If the amendments to the should not only be taken up by the ACCC on for damages for those third parties. The committee realised that the ACCC process process. We acknowledged, through our calls that it was also a costly process which dissuaded action. In calling for an industry ombudsman, we of a nature that could be better dealt with that if it were put in the hands of a body that could be clarity about what is actually happening on which some of the players behave could . The other aspect that is very important-and tabling statement----concems the changes that market. The present Trade Practices Act talks either a national level or a state and territory 100 years of federation, as we go to the next geopolitical boundaries of the colonies believe that the best way in which the ACCC gone too far would be if the ACCC were empowered a regional base. We think that could improve strengthening oligopolies or monopolies. The other thing that should be said is that called phenomenon of creeping acquisitions. companies might buy up, on a one-by-one basis, sorts of purchases should be reported to the of the view that the ACCC should look at those that might have a demonstrable effect on the MAIN COMMITTEE 9711 than sitting back and analysing the way in which a manufacturer was that they have kept control of customers.

In fact, that probably was the central spoke on behalf of the independent supermarket detail about the many reasons why the committee and why, therefore, the committee looked at of the Trade Practices Act-to give smaller accusations that the ACCC might take up on a Trade Practices Act are made, the accusations a representative basis; the ACCC should call could be a rather lengthy, time consuming for representative action through to damages, some of the smaller players from taking that understood that in many cases the complaints were quickly by an independent arbiter.

Mr Neville-Like Bi-Lo, or something like that.",170
20,Mr JENKINS,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The honourable member's interjection, on board. Bi-Lo is an interesting example because of the Coles Myer group. They have two brands, in the supermarket area. Coles runs as Coles, different part of the market. It was surprising actually understand that. The other important part of the industry performance for like customers. There is some have access to product on the same terms as manufacturers believe that, except for discounts terms for like customers, sufficient anecdotal believe that there is a need to put this in a which the committee believes should be mandatory, Trade Practices Act about unconscionable conduct. accusations of many of the below the line trading players believe that they do not get access to. Another important point to stress is the need smaller players in the retail sector and the Practices Act. A lot of those players act without to do. I acknowledge the comments made earlier because they are concerned about what repercussions form of legal action. But I think we have to action because they do not know what is required. MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,l September 1999 that are a result of creeping acquisitions, are doing by developing greenfield sites. was to increase the limit for transactions sections of the Trade Practices Act dealing with the limit on transactions be increased from to us, that would give greater scope for looking sections.

It is suggested in the recommendations that that we have highlighted. Of course, we do because the ACCC should consult widely with those of conduct. But one of the important things is truth in branding of companies. We believe part of a wider umbrella organisation, the wider the trading signage and advertising, et cetera, whilst not totally welcome, I take not many people understand that it is a part for want of a better expression, operating but they also have Bi-Lo which is going for a to find the number of people who did not code of conduct is the like terms for like belief by the smaller players that they do not the bigger players.

The final thing I would like to say is that change. That great change will be about not in which that retail sector interfaces with in the use of electronic commerce.

The Committee is therefore into the dispensing of pharmaceutical This goes to the issue of phannacies being supennarkets. As has been said by earlier speakers, quite a deal of concern. It looks to the question the dispensing of medicines and advice to clients in their circumstances is an issue which That practice occurs in some places overseas, it is a good idea. I think it does underestimate phannacists and phannacies within a community. and country towns as well as in metropolitan for those who require basic advice and assistance medications available now, there is a need utilised. I think a much greater role can be developed role they perfonn as part of general health I know from discussions I have had with representatives from some of the facilities I have visited-for is great scope to develop the role of the greater level of health care within our community. These days, when we look so much more dealing with them after the event, when we look that can be given at an earlier stage rather something that can be developed further down developed by government in any way that is of is keen to work down that track and to see a I think it is something which would be difficult I think it does lead to the potential for an question of service delivery, and that Overall, though, as I said earlier I think a report with a range of unanimous recommendations I am sure the chair of the committee and other these recommendations forth to the relevant support of the opposition in seeking that sort To those who would say that the report could that that is always a legitimate comment with detail, as has occurred on this occasion. Now recommendations which I think we all agree the retailing sector, we have to give those a chance to implement them and give the industry hopefully, lead to a situation where some of rightly over the last few years in particular MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 September 1999 about was covered in some detail by the member speech. Recommendation 8 states: chains take note of widespread community and the role played by pharmacists is unique, as it relates of the view that expansion by the major chains products should be discouraged. set up within supennarkets and as part of this raises a range of issues which cause of whether the major role of phannacies in as to the appropriate medications required can be handled within a supennarket scenario. although I am not at all convinced that in fact and undennine the actual professional role of As has been said in many regional centres areas, phannacies are often the first port of call on medical matters and, with the range of for professional advice with respect to what is for phannacists into the future as to what care development within our community.

Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. 9721 will not be the concerns that they have been in Main Committee adjourned at 12.17 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Customs Service: Corruption Perception Index (Question No. 565) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 30 March 1999: (1) In undertaking nonnal value investigations overseas, what specific steps does the Australian Customs Service (ACS) take, in addition to examining so-called audited accounts, to check the veracity of an exporter's claims. (2) Do the steps referred to in part (1) include reference to third parties or independent and credible trade and industry sources; if not, why not; of so, will the Minister provide specific examples. (3) Does the ACS recognise the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and its purpose to provide data on perceptions of corruption within countries by national surveys. (4) Does the ACS make allowances and adjustments to quantify the reliability of audited accounts supplied by exporters from countries which suffer from crony capitalism or corruption. (5) Is it a fact that (a) Indonesia scored sixth lowest of the 100 countries ranked on the 1998 Corruption Perception Index and (b) Australian paper producers contend that it has a high level of cOJ'!1lption; if so, has the ACS allowed for possible corruption in Indonesia during its recent inquiries concerning Indonesia; if so, how; if not, why not. (6) Does the ACS apply regulations to the conduct of its officers undertaking overseas investigations. (7) Are ACS officers cautioned about the essential need to remain at arm's length from former colleagues who may represent the interests of foreign exporters from time to time as consultants or lobbyists. (8) Does the ACS permit its officers to rely upon the statements of former colleagues in the circumstances referred to in part (7). (9) Does the ACS impose phecks and balances to detect undue influence in the circumstances referred to in part (7); if so, what are they; if why not. NA (10) Is it a fact that the public file report of the ACS officer who conducted the overseas inquiries in Indonesia for the inquiry into dumping of coated papers contains comments and words of appreciation for a former ACS officer who is now a consultant; if so, how does the ACS explain the comments. Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In addition to a company's audited accounts Customs relies upon verification against management accounts, source documents, ie invoices, payment advices etc, and other internal company records. (2) Where necessary Customs may resort to information provided by other sources as a means to check the veracity of the exporters claims or in circumstances where the exporter declines or is unable to provide certain information. (3) Customs is aware of the Corruption Perception Index as a result of a submission by Australian Paper in the context of the revocation inquiry involving A4 copy paper from Indonesia. (4) No. Australia's legislation and the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement only recognise adjustments to prices where it affects price comparability. Further, Australia's legislation and the WTO AntiDumping Agreement require the use of the exporter's records where they are kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the exporting country (5) (a) Australian Paper provided Customs with a submission in the context of the revocation inquiry involving A4 copy paper from Indonesia. Its submission referred to the 1998 Corruption Perception Index and stated that Indonesia scored the sixth lowest of 100 countries. (b) Yes, Australian Paper has made this claim in the context of the revocation inquiry involving A4 copy paper from Indonesia. Customs addressed the issue of possible corruption in Indonesia through a thorough examination and verification of the exporter's accounts. (6) There are no regulations specific to undertaknot, ing overseas investigations. Customs officers are bound by the APS Code of Conduct as detailed in the Public Service Regulations (AmendmentInterim Refonns) 1998. Regulations 5-The APS Values and Regulation 7-The APS Code of Conduct are particularly relevant. (7) As for (6). (8) No, findings are based upon evidence. (9) The result of overseas investigations ""the nonnal value report"" is subject of scrutiny and assessment by other officers including senior officers to ensure that the recommendations are supported by the facts. (10) The report referred to contains the following statement ""Tjiwi Kimia, together with their consultant, cooperated fully with Customs and met most requests for copies of documents etc."" All nonnal value reports contain a section on Cooperation and Confidentiality. The visiting officers are required to give an assessment of the level of cooperation provided by the exporter. The assessment may have implications for how the information collected is judged and the level of any measures that may be imposed. Australian Customs Service: Overseas Currency Fluctuations (Question No. 566) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, upon notice, on 30 March 1999: (1) How does the Australian Customs Service (ACS) detennine nonnalcy in its consideration of nonnal values in overseas investigations when the country in question is markedly disturbed by economic, political or social crises with resultant impact on local markets from lack of demand and excess manufacturing capacity. (2) Is it a fact that in Indonesia (a) exchange rates fluctuate by as much as 26 per cent in a day and regularly move more than 10 per cent in either direction in a week, (b) volatile currency movements cause the currency to decline to a small percentage of its original value, (c) inflation rates reach as much as 8 per cent in a month and then tum negative, (d) interest rates reach 50 per cent per annum, (e) the banking system is collapsing with 60 to 80 per cent ofJoans non-perfonning, (f) many of the country's enterprises are technically insolvent and (g) the currency is artificially supported by substantial foreign aid including significant funding by the International Monetary Fund. (3) Does the ACS use weighted averages in the circumstances referred to in part (1); if so, is approach adequate in the circumstances referred to in part (2). (4) Do the circumstances referred to in part (2) warrant the use of a surrogate country to establish nonnal values; if not, why not. Mr Williams-The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) 'Nonnalcy' is not a term used in the relevant legislation or international agreements and therefore is not a consideration in determining nonnal values. Where there is a situation in the market of the exporting country which renders domestic sales as unsuitable Australia's legislation and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Anti-Dumping Agreement provide alternative methods for the determination of nonnal value; namely, sales to third countries or costs plus profit. (2) (a) to (d) The questions are imprecise, as they do not provide a reference period; (e) there is a high percentage of non-performing loans within the banking sector; (f) and (g) comments were included in a report which was considered by Customs. (3) Depending on the particular circumstances of an investigation weighted averages may be the most appropriate means to detennine nonnal values. (4) The circumstances referred to in part (2), per se, do not authorise recourse to surrogate information. The Minister could only contemplate the use of surrogate information if satisfied that sufficient information had not been provided or was not available to enable nonnal values to be determined by reference to either third country sales or costs plus profit. Sydney Olympic Games: Hospitality Boxes and Tickets (Question No. 681) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, upon notice, on 2 June 1999: (1) Has the Government out laid Commonwealth funds for a luxury ""skybox"" at Stadium Australia and a box at the Superdrome where basketball will be staged; if so, (a) further to the answer to question No. 515 (Hansard, l3 May 1996, page 4456), does the sum of $850,000 referred to in part (a) of the answer include the boxes at Stadium Australia and the Superdrome; if not, what is the additional cost of the boxes, (b) is the Government's use of the boxes confined to the Olympic Games and (c) what criteria apply to use of the boxes by the Prime Minister and other Ministers.

(3) Have the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade finalised criteria for the distribution of tickets available to the Government for use at the Sydney Olympic Games; if so, what are the criteria Miss Jackie KeUy-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The New South Wales Minister for the Olympics, the Hon Michael Knight MP, encouraged the Commonwealth to take a box at the SuperDome. The Memorandum of Understanding signed on 23 December 1998, which governs the provision of assistance by the Commonwealth to New South Wales for the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), provides for a total payment direct to SOCOG of $1.21 million for the purchase of tickets for the Olympic Games by the Commonwealth ($850,000) and the use of a 20 seat box at Stadium Australia ($240,000) and an 18 seat box at the SuperDome ($120,000). The Commonwealth so far has been invoiced only for the box at Stadium Australia.

(4) Has the subject recognition of Taiwan been considered at any meeting of the South Pacific Forum since his predecessor's answer to question No. 23 (Hansard, 21 August 1990, page 1210). Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As at 20 August 1999, Taiwan had diplomatic relations with 28 countries. As at that date all countries listed below recognised Taiwan as the ""Republic of China"": Republic of Malawi; Kingdom of Swaziland; Republic of Senegal: Burkina Faso; The Republic of Gambia; The Republic of Liberia; Sao Tome and Principe; The Republic of Chad; The Holy See; Belize; The Republic of Costa Rica; The Republic of EI Salvador; The Republic of Guatemala; The Republic of Honduras; The Republic of Nicaragua; The Republic of Panama; The Republic of Paraguay; Dominican Republic; Commonwealth of Dominica; Grenada; Republic of Haiti; Saint Christopher-Nevis; St Vincent and the Grenadines; The Republic of Nauru; Tuvalu; Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands; Macedonia. According to Appendix 3-Table 3 of the 1998-99 Yearbook of International Organisations, Vol 2, Taiwan was in 1998 a member of 932 non-governmental organisations and 10 intergovernmental. The yearbook identified those latter organisations as: Afro-Asian Rural Reconstruction Organisation; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC); Asian Productivity Organisation; International Cotton Advisory Committee; International Institute of NA Evidence and procedure in a federation International commercial law for business Reform of civil procedure: essays on access to justice Taiwan Refrigeration; International Office of Epizootics; International Seed Testing Association; Intanational Sericultural Commission; Pacific Basin Economic Council; World Trade Organisation (·application pending). Taiwan participates in intergovernmental and non-governmental international organisations under several different names. These include ""Taiwan"", ""Taiwan, China"", ""Taiwan, Republic-China"". Taiwan participates in APEC and the Olympic Games under the name ""Chinese Taipei"". Taiwan has applied for WTO membership under the name, ""The Customs Territory of Taiwan, P'enghu, Kinmen, and Matsu"".

24,Mr TUCKEY,TITLE,"The answer to the honourable significant member's question is as follows: (1) Since the signing of the National Forest Policy Statement in 1992, most States have m-e the progress in implementing arrangements to prOVIde in the form of 'rights to harvest' for investors in timber plantations. The Commonwealth the States and industry under the joint strategy, titled Plantations for Au-is:-The 2020 Vision, have also recently COmmttted towar- a series of actions which are expected to prOVide ex-s-es clearer access to rights to harvest. Following is a summary of current Sta!e measures for rights to harvest, prepared from informathat a tion available to my department: NSW The Timber Plantations (Harvest Guarantee) Act 1995 (The Harvest Guarantee Act) provides for accreditation of plantations by the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning, on a voluntary Accredited plantations are exempt fr-m certain provisions of the Environmental Planrung and Assessment Act 1979, the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, the Heritage Act 1977 and the Local Government Act 1973. The Harvest Guarantee Act also provides for protection of the environment and provides for compensation in circumstances where harvesting must be suspended to protect wildlife values. Victoria Under the Planning and Environment Ac- 1987 and in conjunction with Local Planning pohcy frameworks, timber production is an ""as-ofright"" activity in the system of rural zones introduced in 1997, subject to compliance with the State Code of Forest Practice. Local councils may require a permit for plantations above 40 hectares. Where a permit is not required, the developer must lodge a Plantation Development Notice advising location, extent, species, year of planting and expected year of harvest. A harvesting plan must be lodged prior to harvesting. Western Australia Specific legislation into joint venture arrangements entered into by the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) provides harvest security for these growers. South Australia Under the Planning Act, local government has the right to determine land use. Environmental Management guidelines have been developed for plantation forestry by Primary Industries South Australia. Plantation forestry an ""as of right use"" in SA. Tasmania The Forest Practices Act 1985 provides !or ""-vate !imber Reserves"". Harvesting activity In Private TImber Reserves must be conducted in accordance with the Forest Practices Code which is legally enforceable through the Forest hactices Board. No rights to harvest exist for plantations, which are not on Private Timber Reserves. The Forest Practices Code covers harvesting in plantations and native forest operations across all tenures and is legally enforceable through the Forest Practices Board. (2) and (3) (a) At the most recent meeting of the Ministerial Council on Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Ministers discussed the key priorities for further implementation of the Plantations 2020 - ision. One such priority was the need for legislatIve or regulatory changes at State level to simplify the planning approval procedures associated with establishing and harvesting plantations (including ""right to harvest"" and legislative arrangements to clarify ownership arrangements to recognise the rights of both tree growers and landholders). With regard to separation of ownership of trees from the land on which they grow, there is some form of legal mechanism available in all States. (3) (b) Details oflegal mechanisms in States are available from respective state government agencies responsible for forestry. (4) No. (5) Yes. Planning for Plantations and Farm Forestry-Dec 1997, is a report commissioned by my department to e-amine the planning frameworks and planning reqUIrements for local government in potential plantation regions and recommend a number of measures to address plantation planning issues. A Plan to achieve the Plantations 2020 VisionMarch 1997, is a consultancy report prepared by the Centre for International Economics for the Standing Committee on Forests to report on how the industry's target of trebling Australia's plantations might be accomplished. Telstra: Perth International Telecommunications Centre (Question No. 842) relation . Mr Edwards asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 August 1999: Is the Perth International Telecommunications Centre site at Landsdale, WA., large enough to provide full protection for the sensitivity of Telstra's radio frequency and communication is not network; if so, is a buffer zone required. Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: It is well known that there are a number of sources of interference to the operations at LandsdalelGnangara located outside of the site. These sources of interference can be accounted for and managed so long as the rural (or an equivalent) zoning of the land surrounding LansdalelGnangara is retained. A ""buffer zone"" is not required. Telstra: Perth International Telecommunications Centre (Question No. 843) Mr Edwards asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 11 August 1999: Does Telstra consider there to be a difference between a buffer zone and a requirement for land surrounding its Perth International Telecommunications Centre, Landsdale site in WA to have restrictions on development; if so, what are the restrictions. Mr MCGauran-The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The term ""buffer zone"" generally describes an area of land surrounding a noxious or industrial land use in which no sensitive uses that would be affected by that industrial use can occur. The term is not applicable to Landsdale/Gnangara which is not an industrial use. Telstra does not ask for any additional restrictions on development over the land surrounding LandsdaleiGnangara, it simply advocates that due to a number of factors, including environmental, the existing rural zone should be retained, or if the zoning is to change, that a appropriate zone be adopted. Special Air Services: Medical Classifications (Question No. 844) Mr Edwards asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 August 1999: How many members of the Special Air Services had their medical classification downgraded from ""Forward Everywhere"" to ""Medically Unfit"" as a result of operational activity, in each year from 1979 until 1998. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: To provide a complete response to the honourable member's question would require considerable time and resources, given the examination of thousands of individual paper records involved, and has been estimated to cost approximately $81;000 by my department. In the interests of efficient use of departmental resources, I am not prepared to authorise the time and effort required to provide the information. Passports: Australia Post Interviews (Question No. 852) Ms Jann MCFarlane asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 August 1999: (1) Further to his answer to questi-n No. 789 (Hansard, 10 August 1999, page 6438), are Australia Post employees authorised to conduct passport interviews; if so which employees. (2) Has there been a change in policy since 1996 regarding who can conduct the interviews; if so, when did his department change its policy. (3) Is training given to Australia Post personnel in regard to the issuing of passports; if so, (a) what training is given and (b) is it (i) conducted by Passports Australia personnel on a one on one basis with Australia Post employees, (ii) conducted by Australia Post personnel on a one on one basis with Australia Post employees or (iii) in the form of a training video. (4) Does Passports Australia conduct a regular review process to ensure that passport interviews are conducted in line with Passports Australia's policy. (5) When passport renewal forms are lodged at a Post Office does Passports Australia require the person renewing the passport to attend an interview: if so, what mechanism does Passports similar Australia have to ensure that the interview is conducted in line with its guidelines. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade signed an agreement with Australia Post on 27 June 1995 under which Australia Post performs certain functions as Agent for the department. These functions include providing a high quality interview service by trained and qualified personnel at the majority of its outlets. The Contract states that interviews must be conducted by responsible and mature permanent staff of Australia Post, or its subcontractors as approved by the department, who are Australian citizens or permanent residents of Australia. (2) The Contract came into effect on 1 July 1995 and is due to expire on 30 June 2000. There has been no change to the Contract regarding who can conduct interviews. (3) Australia Post trains interview staff in respect of the passport functions they are required to perform. The department has developed training materials jointly with Australia Post and has provided a procedural Manual for interview staff. Training is provided by means of individual study of videos, computer-based presentations and workbooks. Training and testing is monitored centrally by Australia Post. The department also supports Australia Post's interview staff through provision of a 1800 telephone help line. All training and reference material was recently updated and re-issued following introduction of new passport application forms and interview processes. (4) On successful completion of training, interview staff are issued with an interviewer PIN to identify which applications they have processed. Regional passport offices identify and record interview errors, by PIN and type, on a central database. Consolidated error reports are produced each month and discussed in the monthly meetings between each State passport manager and his/her Australia Post State liaison officer. Departmental and Australia Post managers also discuss the reports to identify and address problem areas. Interviewers whose performance falls below the specified error-free rate may have their PIN number withdrawn. (5) PC7 passport renewal forms must be lodged in person. A streamlined interview is conducted to confirm the identity of the person lodging the form. The department monitors the quality of Australia Post interviews through the monthly error reports, liaison between State passport managers and Australia Post liaison officers and between the department and Australia Post. Any complaints directed to passport offices or the department about Australia Post interviews are addressed in the liaison between departmental and Australia Post managers. Australia Post has advised that clients can also have complaints about interviews investigated through the Australia Post Client Inquiry Line, 131118.",191
