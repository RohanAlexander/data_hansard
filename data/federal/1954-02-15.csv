5,Mr SPEAKER,SPEECH OF HER MAJESTY," I have to report that the House this day attended Her Majesty the Queen in the Senate chamber, where Her Majesty was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of the Parliament, of which I have received a copy. As honourable members have copies of the Speech, I shall not formally read it to the House. It will be included in Hansard for record purposes. The Speech read as follows:NA THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: The first section of the Constitution of the Connnonwealth of Australia provides that the legislative power of the Connnonwealth shall be vested in "" a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives '"". f t is therefore a joy for mc, today, to address you not as a Queen from far away, but as your Queen and a part of your Parliament. In a real sense, you are here as my colleagues, friends, and advisers. When I add to this consideration the fact that I am tin? first ruling Sovereign to visit Australia, it is clear that the events of today make a piece of history which fills me with deep pride and the moat heartfelt pleasure, and which I am confident will serve to strengthen in your own hearts and minds a feeling of comradeship with the Crown and that sense of duty shared which we must all have as we confront our common tasks. f am proud also, speaking as the granddaughter of K i ng George V. and the daughter of K i ng George VI . , to recall two earlier in the history, the short history, of the Commonwealth of Australia. The first was . the opening of the First Parliament of the new Commonwealth of Australia in 1001 by my grandfather, then the Duke of Cornwall and York. The second was the opening of this building in 1927 by my father, then the Duke of York. Thus the history of Australia as a nation has a special family significance for me. It is, I think, fitting that I should, speaking to you today. recall to mind those elements uf unity which combine in the fabric of the British Commonwealth. The great institutions of Parliamentary sovereignty, JI. democratically controlled Executive, the just and impartial administration of the law; these exist and flourish in each of the great realms which call me Queen. They have, in this century, survived great trials of war and economic hardship. And they have done so, I am proud to say, because of the great qualities of my peoples, qualities which bave shown themselves through labours manfully performed, duties courageously done by men and women, sorrows sustained, and happiness earned. In the result, as 1 acknowledge the wonderful welcome of my Australian people, 1 do so in a country whose growth and progress are manifest, a country of freedom, eloquent of that true democracy which dignifies and expresses the individual human being. Already, in my journeys through the Commonwealth, I have been made even moro vividly conscious of the true brotherhood of my peoples, even prouder of their services to civilization, and more richly confident of their future destiny. I would like also to take this opportunity to say to my Australian people, through you ladies and gentlemen of the Australian Parliament, how grateful I was, and nm, for their loyal support and encouragement on the occasion of my Coronation. My husband and T can never forget your affection on that great day, an affection which you have expressed with such marvellous warmth in your own land since our arrival. Moved by these feelings, it is my resolve that, under God, I shall not only rule, but serve. This is not only the tradition of my family; it describes, I believe, the modern character of the British Crown. In this uneasy world of conflicts open or hidden, my peoples in Australia and throughout the British Commonwealth want peace in its fullest and richest sense; that peace, based upon freedom and justice, which must some day be the unquestioned inheritance of nil mankind. To play their part in the achievement and preservation of peace, my Australian Ministers will continue the closest co-operation with my Governments in the other Commonwealth nations. Only last month my Finance Ministers conferred in Sydney with the frankness and friendliness which always mark discussions between the Commonwealth countries. This was one of a long and continuing series of such conferences. Their immediate objecevents tive is to strengthen the British Commonwealth; but their ultimate benefit will flow to other nations and to the great world community of people everywhere. Pursuant to the terms of the Constitution, a general election for the House of Representatives must be held at the end of this Session of Parliament. My Ministers w i ll submit to Parliament the financial and other measures which must precede that election.  Mr Speaker, and Members of the House of Kepresentatives. Tn the earnest hope that Divine Providence may guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth of Australia, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. A DDBESS-TN-REPI.T. Motion (by MB . MENZIES) agreed toThat a Committee consisting of the Right Honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt 1 and the Mover be appointed to prepare nu Address-in-Reply to the Speech delivered by Her Majesty the Queen to both Houses of the Parliament, unci that the Committee do report this day. Mr MENZIES, for the committee pointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the Speech of Her Majesty the Queen, presented the proposed Address, which was read by the Clerk.",12
6,Mr MENZIES,MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND MEMBERS OF,"Kooyong - P r i m e Minister) | 5.3] - I move That the following Address-in-Reply to the speech of Her Majesty the Queen be agreed lo:MOST GHACIOUB SOVEKEIGN: We. Your Majesty's loyal subjects, the Members of the House of Kepresentatives of the (.'oinmoiiwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to thank Your Majesty for I he gracious speeeh which you have been pleased to address to Parliament on this, your lirst visit to our country. The presence in Australia of Your Majesty and of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has brought unbounded pleasure to the Australian people. We, tlieir representatives in this House, invoke (io.iI's choicest blessing iip<ni your life and reign and are grateful for this opportunity to rcaflirm our loyalty and devotion to the Crown and I'eiMm of Your 'Ma jesty. t do not propose to make a long speech. This is the Queen's day and I shall trespass on it as briefly as possible, but I think one or two things ought to be said. Of all those who have sat in the Parliament of the Australian nation, we who are here now have attained the most unique privilege. For the first time in our history our sovereign is with us in person. For the first time in our history our sovereign has come to her Australian Parliament. In the Speech which she addressed to us this afternoon, Her Majesty reminded us fhat, under the very terms of our Constitution, she is a part of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I arn sure that, with this very happy reminder still in our ears, we all appreciate that our Parliament has now found its full and complete expression. Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives have met today, not only according to the printed word of our Constitution, but also in a rich, magnificent and human way. The Address-in-Reply is, in normal practice, the signal for political debate. To-day, it is the signal for the greatest, most moving and enduring unanimity that this Parliament has ever seen. By our Address, we recognize our homage and the duty of our allegiance, but we desire to express much more than thatapour love, our pride and our thankfulness to God that, whatever troubles may beset the world, and however man may be set against man in unhappy parts of the world, we of the great British family are privileged to Hve in unity under a young and lovely Queen, a great Queen today but one who is bound to be greater and greater as the years move on. She has, [ believe, helped us to understand more perfectly that humility and pride can co-exist, and that under a Queen like her, subjecthood is no mark of inferiority but is in itself a title of honour. Whatever party wo belong to in this place nnd however violently we may differ ;ibont policy or administration, we are today, on this unforgettable occasion, all the Queen's men. proud to be the members of her Parliament, and determined so to order our affairs and discharge our responsibilities that our Queen, of whom we are so proud, will always, in her turn, he proud of us. Br. EVATT (Barton-Leade r of the Opposition) |5.7""| - On behalf of Her Majesty's Opposition, I second the motion. This is indeed a unique occasion. The Sovereign herself has opened the Parliament. It was tliought at. one time that that was constitutionally impossible, but this Parliament unanimously passed a special measure to enable it to be done nnd also to enable all other functions of the Governor General to be performed by Her Majesty during the period of her Royal visit. But that, important though it is, is merely the constitutional aspect. T'he supremely important aspect of today's proceedings is not the Speech nor what it contains, but the fact that Her Majesty has made it At last, the Queen has been with ns in the Parliament and The has addressed us as Her Majesty t.he Queen of Australia. Her direct participation in the constitutional processes of this National Parliament must recall, as indeed the Speech does, the close association of the Royal Family with Australia. That personal link is greatly valued by all the people of this country, especially by those who served in the great wars. Most, of us remember vividly the visit to Australia by the Queen's parents during the early part of their married life. It is implicit in what the Queen herself has said and it is true to say that the memory of the Queen's father, K in g George VI . , is revered by the people of Australia. Hi s name will go down in history as that of a Sovereign who, during the most critical period of the history of the British nation and perhaps of the world, inspired the British and allied peoples by his long sustained fortitude and courage and by his wise and effective contribution to leadership. As yet, too little is known of his calm and helpful counsel during some of the great emergencies that confronted the leaders of Great B r it a in and Australia during the last world war. May I also pay tribute to the great national service rendered to Australia the Queen's mother. The value of what she did, even more, what she was, both during the King's reign and since, will never be forgotten. She and K in George were eagerly looking forward visiting Australia again, until the King's illness made that impossible. I express the hope that the Queen Mother will be able to re-visit us at no distant date. W i th these illustrious examples before her, Queen Elizabeth's self-dedication her Coronation broadcast expressed felicitous terms the new conception of the democratic British monarchy, and of the special link that binds the Sovereign her people. Her Majesty said- I have in sincerity pledged myself to service as so many of you are pledged to mine. Throughout all my life, and with all my heart, era. I shall strive to be worthy of your trust. In this resolve I have my husband to support me. He shares all my ideals and all my affection for you. The simplicity, nay, the ennobling granshall deur, of this solemn declaration of trusteeship, in which we find a solemn declaration of the new function of Crown, uplifted the hearts of all; not those in Australia, Great Britain and throughout the British Commonwealth, but also those in lands remote-in tries extending far beyond the confines the British Commonwealth. To-day, thereMajesty fore, we do right to join together to pay tribute to our Sovereign. She has than fulfilled the most ardent tions of her people. With her young Dr Evatt. children so far away, the inevitable strain of the royal visit is increased, but that is why the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are finding special joy and comfort in the spontaneous welcome that they are receiving everywhere, especially from the children of Australia. That rapturous welcome would never be given to a stranger, however powerful or illustrious he or she may be. It goes to the Queen from the hearts of all and transcends all local differences and disputes. It shows again that there are things that unite the people, and that they are more important than the things that divide them. The reign of the young Queen is still in its very early stages, but already men and women everywhere look forward to a new era of peace and justice throughout the world. The extension and application by of scientific knowledge is now covering a field that is almost infinite in area. The question is whether these miraculous developments of science can be harnessed g and directed to serve the welfare of human to kind everywhere. The answer to the question depends mainly upon the resolve of the young men and women of this nation and others, and it is to this younger generation that Her Majesty and her husband belong. The prize that could be in won by this young generation is no less in than a new way of life where order, decency, kindness and compassion' will be the guiding rule of all nations, and from to which there will be banished tyranny, cruelty and the spectres of war and want. your If that prize could be won there would be another, and a far greater, Elizabethan Every member of this Parliament is privileged to acclaim Her Majesty's presence here today. It is something we never forget. It is quite wrong, royal as the Prime Minister has properly stressed, to regard the visit to the Parthe liament of Her Majesty as being only only ceremonial or formal. It is both, of course, but, in addition, it is also just as personal as the returning home of a loved counmember of a family. So our prayer of today is for the happiness of Her and her husband. The prayer is simple and, I think, is best expressed in more one of the verses of the National Anthem expectawhich I heard sung very beautifully in Sydney at one of the wonderful children's demonstrations in honour of the Queen only a few days ago. I shall conclude my remarks by reading that verse. It isThy choicest gifts in store, On her bo pleased to pour, Long may sho reign. May she defend our laws, And ever give us cause To sing with heart and voice, God save the Queen. Question resolved in the amrmative.

PREFERENCE) AMENDMENT (NO . 1 ) . ] (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1953 ba amended as sixteenth day of February, One thousand nine hundred reckoned according to standard time in the Australian in accordance with the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Tariff Rates on Goods Tariff Item. the Produce or Manufacture of New Zealand. The Customs Tarifl Proposals which I have just introduced cover amendments tota) the Customs Tariff 1933-1953; (b) the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) 1934-1952; and (c) the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 19331953. These proposed amendments are, in the main, based upon recommendations made by the Tariff Board in comparatively recent reports. I shall, at a later stage, take the opportunity to table the relevant Tariff Board reports. The new duties will operate as from 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. A "" Summary of Alterations "", which has been circulated to honourable members, sets out in concise form the proposed variations. The major changes relate to cotton sheetings, paper and paper products, and motor vehicle gear box assemblies and differential assemblies and parts thereof. Other proposed amendments relate to pillow cases and sheets, metal working lathes, inserted type machine tools, tool tips composed of cemented carbides, files ancl rasps, thermostats, hypodermic needles and bequeathed articles. The Customs Tariff ('Canadian Preference) Proposals and the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Proposals are complementary to the variations made by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 and 2. It is proposed that the duties on cotton sheetings of the type ordinarily used in the manufacture of bed sheets and pillow cases be increased to 4d. per lb. plus 15 per cent, ad valorem when admissible under the British preferential tariff. The ""most-favourednation tariff"" rates have been varied to rates ranging from 5d. to S^d. plus 15 per cent, ad valorem, according to whether the sheeting is in an unbleached, bleached, dyed or coloured condition. This action is based on the findings of the Tariff Board, which conducted a comprehensive inquiry into the protective needs of the Australian industry. The value of this industry in the overall economy of the Commonwealth will, I feel sure, be readily appreciated by honourable members. ii -[2 ] The fixed rate duties on wrapping papers and paper boards have been increased consequent upon adoption by the Government of recommendations by the Tariff Board. The Australian industry has, for some time past, been experiencing difficulty in competing with overseas suppliers principally because the existing fixed rate duties, which are hased on pre-war values, have lost much of their protective incidence and also because of a substantial fall in overseas selling prices. The proposed duties will be again reviewed by the Tariff Board in two years' time. It is proposed to increase the duties on motor vehicle transmission gear box assemblies, differential assemblies, driving axle assemblies, and parts of such assemblies, irrespective of whether the assemblies and parts are imported separately or otherwise. This will not, however, apply to the assemblies and parts imported with or for use with tractors. This action is also consequent upon the adoption by the Government of recommendations of the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board has also recommended that increased protection be accorded on hypodermic needles and on thermostats of the type ordinarily used with electrically operated domestic appliances. The proposals before the committee give effect to those recommendations. An opportunity will be provided, at a later stage, for honourable members to debate these proposals. Progress reported.

At present, copies of the three first mentioned reports only are available for circulation to honourable members.
