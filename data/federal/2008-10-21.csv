1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. NA,17
2,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister will be late to question time today as she is returning from an event in Melbourne. Until her return, the Minister for Employment Participation will answer questions on her behalf. NA Banking",17
3,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Did the Reserve Bank recommend to the government that the deposit guarantee be unlimited?,17
4,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has been out there today hyperventilating like a kid on red cordial. I say to the Leader of the Opposition in very clear cut terms: the government, in taking the decision that it announced on Sunday a week ago, did so on the advice of the Secretary of the Treasury that this was the position of the regulators, including the Reserve Bank. That is why the government acted. The government stands by its position and the decision taken. I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to this statement, which was made by the Reserve Bank governor today, in which he said that the announcements by the government Sunday a week ago were ‘sensible and the RBA supported them'. The Reserve Bank governor has blown the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition right out of the water. Banking",17
5,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the implementation of the deposits guarantee?,17
6,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. The government is committed to protecting depositors in these uncertain times. The announcement by the Prime Minister the Sunday before last was a very important announcement in terms of not just confidence in banking but also confidence in the wider financial system. That is why we announced a comprehensive guarantee, because you have to move with speed and comprehensively. This was supported by the Treasury and by the RBA, and it was fully supported by APRA. It was fully supported by all of our regulators. At the time of the announcement, we indicated that we would be consulting with industry as well as with our international counterparts on the details of the guarantee. We have been doing that. I would just like to quote from a speech that I gave in the House last Wednesday. It was the second reading speech that I gave on the bill that was introduced. These comments seem to have been missed by the opposition in the debate and discussion that has been going on since then. This is what I said in the second reading speech: The government is consulting on the interaction between this guarantee on eligible wholesale borrowing and the guarantee on deposits. If desirable, the government will proceed with measures to clarify the intersection of these guarantees and facilitate their operation. … … … The government will ensure that the short-term money market remains viable and that the deposit guarantee does not provide disincentives for market participants from operating in this market. That is what I said to the House last Wednesday. The regulators are consulting with industry, as they should, to ensure that the guarantee of deposits and wholesale borrowings does not adversely affect the efficient operation of the short-term money market. As members will be aware, the deposit guarantee and the term funding guarantee applies to Australian owned banks, Australian ADI subsidiaries of foreign banks, credit unions and building societies. The deposit guarantee applies to deposits in any currency and will extend to an Australian ADI's branch operations in another jurisdiction. We are working with our international counterparts to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for foreign bank branches operating in Australia. None of these are new issues, but they are ones that the government has been well aware of and has been addressing in consultation both domestically and abroad. They are important issues, so it is very important to get them right. Treasury expects to have concluded consultations shortly and to have finalised the details of the package shortly. Banking",17
7,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister speak directly to the Reserve Bank governor concerning the deposit guarantee prior to his announcement on 12 October?,18
8,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the midst of a cabinet meeting, which was a meeting of the strategic planning and budget committee of the cabinet, and with members of that committee present or online, at the conclusion of a cussion of a range of options before the ernment, I explicitly put this question Secretary of the Treasury: ‘Is the position being recommended here that of the regulators?' He answered, ‘It was, and the Reserve Bank.' Mr Robert-Where does the buck stop?",18
9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The buck will stop for the member for Fadden outside. He is warned. Economy Mrs D'ATH (2.07 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the government's response to the global financial crisis?,18
10,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has acted responsibly both on the question of guarantees to bank depositors in Australia and guarantees for the term funding arrangements of our banks operating internationally to secure lines of credit for the Australian private sector and on what has been necessary to do for the fiscal stimulus of this economy, despite the best efforts of those opposite to talk this economy down throughout the course of this year.",18
11,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
12,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I seem to remember that earlier this year the member for North Sydney was doing precisely that, followed by others in their public remarks. I say to those opposite that, at difficult and delicate times like this in the global economy and the Australian economy, confidence is important, dealing effectively with the challenges we face is important and acting responsibly in accordance with the advice the government has received is the right course of action rather than short-term politics. The Federal Reserve chairman in the United States, Chairman Bernanke, referring disto the United States economy overnight, said gov- ‘We are in a very serious slowdown in the to the economy which has very serious consequences for the public.' Furthermore, Chairman Bernanke went on to call for a fiscal that includes policy response, saying: With the economy likely to be weak for several quarters, and with some risk of a protracted slowdown, consideration of a fiscal package by the Congress at this juncture seems appropriate. That is what we see in governments around the world at present. Given the challenges which have occurred coming off the back of the global financial crisis and the impact which it has had on credit markets, stock markets and the real economy, growth and jobs, we have seen governments elsewhere around the world now debating what to do in terms of the fiscal policy stimulus-that is, to provide the economy and growth in jobs with a further level of support. Last Tuesday this government acted with its statement on this matter: the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. Given recent developments not just in the United States but elsewhere in the global economy, and the wash-through effect which this has over time on growth and jobs in this economy, this has been a responsible course of action. I also again emphasise recent statements coming out of the People's Republic of China about growth there slowing somewhat and the need therefore for the government to boost consumption and to support job creation. Again, I refer to the statement of the governor of the Chinese central bank on 15 October to that effect. That is why this government, mindful of what is coming down the railway tracks towards the global economy, of which we are a part, over the 12 months coming, has acted sternly and decisively on the Economic Security Strategy we have put forward to the Australian people and which has received little more than backbiting comment from those opposite as opposed to full-hearted support. In fact, the measures we have taken are of direct support not only to long-term growth and jobs in the economy but also to pensioners, carers and seniors, families, first home buyers and those needing additional trading places. Of course, we look forward in December to the acceleration of our nationbuilding agenda. The need for this package has been reinforced by observations that we have seen in recent times by the economic commentators and also by decisions by our own central bank. I draw the attention of honourable members to the decision not long ago to reduce interest rates by 100 basis points. All these measures are necessaryfiscal policy and monetary policy moving in the same direction-in order to ensure that this country has the greatest chance possible to continue to maintain positive growth into the future and to continue to generate jobs growth into the future as well. We have been able to act because this government is in a strong budget position. Information overnight demonstrates the strength of our position relative to a number of our peers around the world, where you see various governments in considerable difficulty on the budget front. This is why the government, in its May budget, brought about a significant budget surplus to provide us with a buffer for growth for the future, and the time to use and draw down on that budget surplus has arrived. I also say to the country and to the House how important it is to have made provision for that budget surplus earlier this year. We can deliver this $10.4 billion stimulus package to the economy while continuing to provide a budget outcome for Australia which remains comfortably in surplus. This represents decisive action on the part of the government in dealing with the challenges Australia now facesMr Turnbull-It's hype!",18
13,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"challenges which do not, may I say to the honourable gentleman who will ask the next question, add up to hype as he says. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the superannuation policyholders around Australia do not regard the global financial crisis as hype. The pensioners of Australia do not regard the global financial crisis as hype. Those millions of Australians who have investments directly and indirectly on Australian stock markets do not regard the global financial crisis as hype. Those concerned about the impact of the global financial crisis on long-term growth and jobs growth in this country do not regard it as hype. I believe the use of that term by the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates just how far out of touch he has come with the real concerns of Australians facing the uncertainties which come to this country off the back of this global financial crisis. Banking",19
14,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to his answer to my previous question, in which he told the House that the strategic policy and budget committee of the cabinet made its decision on the deposit guarantee measures and then sought a second-hand view of the position from the Reserve Bank via the Treasury secretary, Dr Henry. How does he reconcile that with his statement on 12 October where he says, ‘The measures I have announced today are based on the advice of Australia's economic regulators'?",20
15,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the Leader of the Opposition needs to acquaint himself with the truth, which for him increasingly has all the characteristics of a foreign country. What I said before was that, when the options were put before the cabinet committee to which I have just referred, I then spoke to the Secretary to the Treasury and asked, ‘Is this the recommendation of the regulators?' to which he said yes. It was on that basis that the government acted. I refer the honourable gentleman-in his hyperventilating state, chucking cartwheels around the House, as he has taken far too great an intake of seriously deep red cordial this morning-to a statement made by the Reserve Bank governor less than a couple of hours ago that the decisions announced by the government then ‘were sensible and the Reserve Bank of Australia supported them'. What we have here is the classic exercise of the Leader of the Opposition again walking both sides of the street. On one hand he says he supports the measures; on the other hand, he says, ‘We're not so sure that we support the measures.' I assume the position of the Liberal Party now is that the bank guarantee that they support is their $100,000 limit which they put out there. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition: how many and what percentage of Australian depositors would that have left high and dry? This government has acted responsibly and has acted in response to the advice provided to us through the Secretary of Treasury from the regulators, including the Reserve Bank. That is a responsible course of action. If the honourable gentleman and his party were at all serious about the question of financial guarantees, why is it that in the five years since the HIH crisis-with which the honourable gentleman may have some passing familiarity, with which the member for North Sydney, as the relevant minister, may have some familiarity, and the relevant minister for financial regulation-no action has ever been taken on a financial claims scheme, not one step of action? It was an event which occurred five years ago, when we saw the intersection of a number of institutions, including HIH, FAI and an institution called Goldman. The council of economic regulators provided you with specific advice in order to act in 2005, and the election was held at the end of 2007. We acted on the basis of that advice early in our term, and that is why this government has taken the right course of action, consistent with the regulators. The bleating on the part of those opposite now, having had five years to act on this measure, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisy which resides on the benches opposite. Economy",20
16,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Minister, how is the government's economic security strategy addressing the challenges presented by the global financial crisis? Are recent criticisms of the government's strategy accurate?",20
17,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fowler for her question. We have seen in recent times unprecedented turmoil on global financial markets and, as a result of that moil, the Australian economy faces significant threats. The Australian economy is in good shape. It is strong, but it is not immune from the threats that flow from the unprecedented turmoil on global financial markets. In response, the government has taken decisive action to guarantee bank deposits, to guarantee the wholesale borrowing by Australian banks and to inject $10 billion as a stimulus into the Australian economy. All of these actions aggregated together, along with the fall in the value of the Australian dollar and the decline in interest rates in recent times, will ensure that we keep growth and economic activity ticking along and will help to ensure that we protect Australia as much as possible from the adverse effects of the global financial crisis. It is true that the government strategy has been criticised, sadly. Unfortunately, it has been criticised by people who claim to support it; namely, the opposition. After initially saying they supported fully and absolutely the government's strategy, the opposition have spent the last week walking away from that position, sniping at specific parts of the package and saying they would have done it all differently, without of course specifying how they might have done it differentlyjust that no, no, they would have done it all differently. Just a few days ago the Leader of the Opposition was alleging that the government was hyping up the international crisis. A few weeks ago he was saying that this was the gravest economic crisis globally in any of our lifetimes. Just a few days ago he was attacking the government for not foreseeing the global financial crisis when, a few weeks ago, he was suggesting that nobody could have foreseen the crisis. The Leader of the Opposition is not short of an opinion on these issues. He is not short of an opinion on most issues. In fact, if you wait for a week on any issue you will get all tur- the available opinions on that issue across the spectrum from him. He will contradict himself several times in an effort to walk both sides of the street and to insert himself into the day's story, whatever ‘today's' story might be. But there is one remarkable fact in the opposition's response to the government's strategy on these unprecedented circumstances. There is one part of the government's strategy, one aspect of the position outlined by the Prime Minister, on which the opposition has been remarkably quiet, and that is the government's intention to address the issue of excessive executive salaries, especially in the financial services sector. Apart from the odd platitude on the part of the Leader of the Opposition about leaving it up to shareholders, he has said very little about this aspect of the government's strategy. I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition would have so little to say about the government's intentions to pursue reform of excessive executive salaries. I think I know the answer. He is worried that we might make it retrospective. He might have to sell a few Picassos or something. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the government is approaching this, along with other issues, in complete seriousness. Indeed, the Prime Minister has advocated in the international forums that are pertinent to this a change to the international rules covering the capital adequacy ratios that apply to banks and financial institutions to take into account the perverse incentives that currently exist for executives in major institutions to take short-term excessive risk and be rewarded excessively for taking that risk. I look forward with great anticipation to a robust contribution from the opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition, on this issue. With any luck they might adopt a single policy and stick to it. Banking",21
18,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. In the interests of clarifying the confusion of his previous answers, will the Prime Minister say simply and clearly whether the Reserve Bank recommended to the government that the deposit guarantee be unlimited-yes or no?",22
19,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not propose adding to the earlier questions put to me. I put it in these terms again for the benefit of the honourable member: (1) this country, if we stand back from it all, was faced with being buffeted by a significant global financial storm; (2) the relevant strategic and budget committee of the cabinet met across an entire weekend; (3) the options put before us had been the subject of discussions between the financial regulators; (4) at the time that the options which were then adopted were being considered by that committee of the government, the question was explicitly put to the Secretary to the Treasury, ‘Is this the advice of the financial regulators, including the Reserve Bank?' to which the answer was unequivocally, ‘Yes.' That is why the government acted. The credibility of the entire position being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is again blown completely out of the water today by the Reserve Bank governor, who says the actions by the government were sensible and the Reserve Bank of Australia supported them. The only one it seems who does not support them is the Leader of the Opposition. I presume the Leader of the Opposition is therefore wedded to his policy of $100,000 as being the appropriate limit. The Leader of the Opposition should reflect long and hard as to who would be excluded by that particular number, as well as reflecting long and hard on why in the five years after HIH no action was taken on the part of those opposite. I say to the honourable member, as he seeks again to make short-term political capital out of the long-term national economic interests of this country, that it is far better that we have people engaged in this debate in a calm and responsible manner, because the entire country, the stability of the financial system of this country and the appropriate stimulus needed for the long-term growth of this economy is of great importance to working households. I conclude my answer by saying this: none of this is hype; it is reality. We are dealing with reality here. Those opposite seem to think that those holding superannuation regard the global financial crisis as hype. That demonstrates definitively that the Leader of the Opposition has got so far out of touch on these matters, as he was last time when he said that an interest rate rise of 25 basis points, households having suffered seven interest rate rises in a row up until then, was nothing to get worried about. This demonstrates a Leader of the Opposition grossly out of touch with the real concerns out there across Australian households, as he seeks to come in here and make a short-term political point in order to advance his interests in securing a headline in tomorrow's newspapers. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that his responsibility as a political leader in this country should be to put our national economic interests first. Instead, he puts his short-term personal political interests first. It is clear for all to see. This government stands by the action it took Sunday a week ago. It is the responsible course of action. I conclude by saying this to the honourable member: could he reflect also on the impact of the government's decision on the actual interest rates charged by the banks concerned. Since the action taken by the government both on this deposit guarantee and on the guarantee forMr Dutton interjecting",22
20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Dickson will withdraw. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I withdraw.",23
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What households across Australia are concerned about is the availability of credit and the cost of credit. The NAB came out in recent days saying: While our current cost of funds remain at a historical high, policy measures announced by the Australian Government earlier this month have started to have a positive impact on the credit market. We welcome this new development and anticipate that we will see some relief in the significantly higher premium we are currently paying for wholesale funds. There were similar remarks by the ANZ. I say to those opposite that the real concerns out there are (1) the stability of the financial system, (2) making sure that there is sufficient credit to flow by way of loans to businesses and small businesses and (3) to ensure that you provide sufficient support for this financial system in a time of global financial stress to enable our major commercial banks to provide maximum pass-through of official reductions in interest rates onto households. Those are the concerns which galvanise this side of the House-the concerns of superannuants, the concerns of households dealing with mortgages and interest rates and the concerns of pensioners trying to survive in the current climate. Those opposite are interested instead in short-term political points, and I think they stand condemned for it. NA",23
22,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Partly prompted by the exuberance and transgression of standing order 65(b) by the present member for Cowan, I inform the House that we have in the gallery today a former member for Cowan and former minister of the Western Australian government, Graeme Edwards. On behalf of the House, I extend to him a warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Trade with China",23
23,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade. Can the minister outline the importance of the Australia-China relationship and the future of Australia's trade relationship with China?,23
24,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I know the keen interest that he takes in the relationship between Australia and China, in particular the trade relationship. China is Australia's largest trading partner, and two-way trade with that country is $58 billion. So far as the relationship is concerned, this government on coming to office reappraised the approach in terms of China and decided it needed a new focus and a new vigour. The previous government had entered into discussions around a free trade agreement, but these talks had been stalled for some three years. The unfreezing of the discussions with China was fortuitous and timely because the fact is that the global financial crisis has impacted on economic growth around the world. China is no exception, but the reality is that, whilst there will be an impact on China's growth rate, China will still have a robust and strongly growing economy. The IMF has said that from 11.9 per cent growth over the last calendar year, it expects China's growth to be 9.7 per cent this year. So it is slowing, but it is still very strong. fact China will continue to be one of the fastest-growing countries in the world. It is important to also understand the composition of and contributions to China's growth. It is mostly domestically driven. In 2007 only two per cent of that close to 12 per cent was as a result of net exports. In the first nine months of this year, net exports have contributed only 1.2 per cent to China's economic growth. So China still remains terribly important in terms of our trade equation, and that is why following the initiative of the Prime Minister in engaging his counterpart in unfreezing the free trade talks and the discussions that have flowed from that-two more rounds of discussions; another one next month-we are pleased to say that we are well on track to progressing that FTA. Also, we are pleased to be hosting here tomorrow the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, a very significant body in terms of the economic growth and the future development and infrastructure spend in China. The chairman, Zhang Ping, and I will be conducting more discussions on mutual cooperation, how we can advance the trade relationship and how we can together face the challenge of the global financial crisis that is confronting both economies. I am confident that we can build on this very strong relationship, but it does require engagement at the political level. This is something that Australia has engaged in in great detail, from the Prime Minister down. Many of the ministers have made visits to China. We have received many delegations from China. So I am confident this relationship will stand us in good stead. Whilst I am on my feet I might also indicate that the significance of the continuing growth, albeit slowed, in the Asian region is another significant reason the recently concluded FTA with the ASEAN region will also In hold Australia in good stead. We do not know what is around the corner in terms of the impact, but I can say that we have significant cushions. Our trading relationship is an important part of that cushioning effect, and we will do what is necessary to advance the trading interests between us and China and between us and the ASEAN region. Banking",23
25,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's previous answers to my questions today and to his press conference on 12 October where he said in relation to the bank deposit guarantees: The measures I've announced today are based on the advice of Australia's economic regulators. The measures I've announced today have been the product of extensive deliberation between myself, the Treasurer and other Ministers who are members of the Strategic Policy and Budget Committee of the Cabinet. Given the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is a member of that committee in his own right and given he was acting Treasurer over that weekend, how does the Prime Minister reconcile his statement and his answers today with the finance minister's repeated comments this morning on Sky News Agenda that he was ‘not aware of the specific advice that is supposed to have been given to us by the RBA governor'?",24
26,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, the Leader of the Opposition should acquaint himself with an ancient proposition called truth. I know that is something which is increasingly foreign to his vocabulary and foreign to his behaviour. The minister for finance this morning was referring to the absence of advice before the committee that there was anything wrong with this course of action, and it is absolutely clear-cut from his statements that that is the case. Those opposite again are clutching at straws, hyperventilating on this particular matter, when out there in mainstream Australia people are dealing with the challenges of financial stability, dealing with the challenges of what happens with their mortgages, dealing with the challenges of what happens with employment and jobs. All we have from the alternative government here is an exercise in short-term partisan politics. I say to those opposite they should get real with the economic interests of this country, get behind the government's package of support for the economy, not by half measures but by full measures, and get behind the proper measures taken by this government in response to the advice of the regulators on this guarantee and the guarantee for wholesale term funding arrangements for the banks necessary to maintain financial stability in this country. And I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: that is the deepest and most fundamental concern of every household in Australia. Afghanistan",24
27,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the minister update the House on progress in Afghanistan and recent successes achieved by the Australian troops?,25
28,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson both for her question and for her ongoing and long standing interest in the work of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The last few weeks have brought increasing public discussion and, indeed, debate about the international community's progress, or lack of progress, in our Afghanistan project. In particular, both local and international media seized on the comments of British commander Brigadier Carlton-Smith, who reportedly said that the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan was not winnable. While I certainly share Brigadier Carlton-Smith's frustration, I do not and the government does not share his level of pessimism. It is absolutely true that the progress of the global partners in Afghanistan is at best very, very slow-and it will remain slow while ever we lack properly coordinated and resourced political, civil and military plans. Those who say that the project in Afghanistan will not be successful by military means alone are absolutely right. That is why the government, in addition to calling for more troops, has been pushing for greater coordination and resourcing; more resources for the UN's special envoy; more training and capacity building in the Afghan national security forces; a smarter counternarcotics strategy; more economic aid and more aid workers; a greater focus on governance, including the creation and bedding down of a justice system; and, of course, a much bigger effort in addressing those very large challenges we have in Pakistan and the implications for those challenges in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, our troops in Afghanistan continue to do real and meaningful work in Oruzgan province and, indeed, beyond Oruzgan province. Our special forces are having real, strategic effect-disrupting the insurgents, destroying IED manufacturing facilities and eliminating or capturing key Taliban leaders. Indeed, since August alone our special forces have captured or eliminated four key senior Taliban leaders in Oruzgan province including, importantly, Mullah Bari Ghul, the shadow governor of the province, and Mullah Akhtar Mohammed, the well-known extremist Taliban commander. The removal of these senior Taliban leaders has significant impact on the effectiveness of the insurgents more generally. On the reconstruction side, our Reconstruction Task Force continues to build and rebuild important economic and social infrastructure. Ongoing projects include further improvements to the hospital in Tarin Kowt, the expansion of the Afghan Health Development Service Training Centre, and the rebuilding of the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development headquarters and the high school and primary schools in Tarin Kowt. Completed projects include the Sorkh Morgab Basic Health Centre and the Tarin Kowt women's hospital wing which the governor of the Oruzgan province very recently officially opened. Of course, in the meantime our trades training school is ensuring that build indigenous capacity so that these reconstruction efforts in the future can be undertaken by local Afghanis. Some of our reconstruction work also has important strategic effects, like the patrol base at Kudus, which has allowed our troops to dominate an area of strategic importance some 20 kilometres from our base in Tarin Kowt, or the replacement of the Highway 1 bridges, a key logistical thoroughfare which has restored the coalition line of supplies and, critically, allowed for the successful construction of the Kajaki dam project. Importantly, it is worth noting that our Combat Team Dagger was the only organisation available to do this work successfully. Why? Because they are the only reconstruction team that comes with their own very effective security-underlining the important work our infantry troops are also doing in Afghanistan. Today I can announce that today we enter a new phase in our work in Afghanistan: replacing Reconstruction Task Force 4 will be Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force 1. Importantly, their work will be in building the capacity of the Afghan National Army. Our troops will embed themselves with Afghani battalions, sharing their skills, edge and know-how within the fledgling Afghani army. Building the capacity of the Afghan National Army is critical to better gress in Afghanistan. Too often our special forces and other forces are successful in securing ground only to lose that ground after we withdraw because of the inability of the Afghani security forces to hold that ground, to hold our gains. The 38 international partners in the Afghanistan project continue to face enormous challenges, but if properly resourced and if coordinated political, civil and military plans are embraced, I am absolutely confident that we can achieve relative peace and security we for the people of Afghanistan and, importantly, deny extremists a safe haven and a base from which to pursue their global ideological agenda. I am sure all members of the House will join with me in paying tribute to and thanking the men and women of the Australian Defence Force for the wonderful work they are doing in Afghanistan. Banking",25
29,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Governor of the Reserve Bank recommended that the government's unlimited deposit guarantee-barely a week old-be changed so that it has a specific dollar cap?,26
30,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Treasurer said when he introduced the relevant legislation in parliament last Wednesday: The government is consulting on the interaction between this guaranteethat is, that on depositson eligible wholesale borrowing and the guarantee on deposits. If desirable, the government will proceed with measures to clarify the intersection of these guarantees and facilitate their operation. Mr Hockey-No, that's not the question!",26
31,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am coming to what the knowlhonourable gentleman has asked. This was clearly outlined by the Treasurer in his introduction of the legislation last Wednesday. pro- Therefore, from the government's point of view, the guarantee in terms of deposits remains absolute. The question at issue is whether deposits above $1 million and beyond should have an insurance premium attached to them consistent with the insurance premiums which are relevant to term wholesale deposits, which applied to the term wholesale lending arrangements of the major commercial banks. That is entirely consistent with what the government said, through the Treasurer, in his statement to parliament last Wednesday. I would say this to the honourable gentleman: the guarantee, as it applies to all deposits, is absolute.  street now?",26
32,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I will walk one side of the street and take decisive action against the member for Sturt!,27
33,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question at issue is when, as the Treasurer foreshadowed last Wednesday, at the intersection of these two regimes, you have competitive neutrality between those two regimes for the most significant depositors-that is, north of $1 million, beyond $1 million. If you are holding a deposit in a bank of less than $1 million, which most people in this country do, that is at 99.5 per cent of depositors. And I say to the honourable gentleman: the government's guarantee for depositors remains absolute. What we are talking about, as the Treasurer foreshadowed last Wednesday, is the intersection of the two regimes at the most upper end, and that is the subject the discussion occurring between the regulators and the banks as we speak. Despite multiple questions from those opposite over the course of recent days, for the government in parliament to go to the detail of those commercial negotiations is not the responsible course of action until they are resolved. Once they are resolved, that will be put fully and formally and finally into the public domain. That is the right and responsible course of action. What is the alternative course of action for those opposite, who advocated a $100,000 limit? For the benefit of the honourable member, who has not bothered to tell the public this, if Liberal Party policy was implemented, 40 per cent of this nation's total deposits would not be covered. That is Liberal Party policy. This government took a different view that all deposits of all APRAregulated institutions in banks, building societies and credit unions should be covered. The question at issue for those who have deposits at the extreme upper end of the spectrum-north of $1 million-is whether an insurance premium should be attached to it. That is what is at issue here. But 99.5 per cent of deposits are less than $1 million. What those opposite were saying, with their $100,000 guarantee, is that 40 per cent of this nation's deposits would get zero guarantees. That is Liberal policy; that is what they wanted to do. We have a completely different approach. Our approach was not only advised to us by the Secretary to the Treasury but also advised to us by the Secretary to the Treasury based on the consultation and advice that he had in turn received from the economic regulators. This is a clear-cut course of action for the future. Those opposite simply want to make cheap, short-term political points. I would say to the member for Wentworth, of who regards this as an entire hype, to use his own terms, that the interests of working families, the interests of households, lie in responsible action by a government responding to the advice provided to it by the regulators to act appropriately to maintain the stability of our financial system to make it possible for our banks to open up lending again to the small businesses of Australia and to provide our banks with the greatest opportunity to provide maximum pass-through for the interest rate burden being faced by those struggling households out there-an interest rate burden compounded by the 10 interest rate rises in a row brought about under their regime when they were in office and, I have got to say, an interest rate regime which the honourable gentleman opposite regarded as a mere trifling matter when he derided a 25 basis point increase. This demonstrates more broadly how out of touch the member for Wentworth has become: regarding the global financial crisis hype and regarding all these matters of the stability of the financial system as hype, regarding the security of depositors-not just 60 per cent of deposits but the entire scheme-as necessary to the future. That is not hype either. We have acted responsibly and we stand behind the actions we have taken. Rights of Women",27
34,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney-General update the House on what the government is doing to protect and promote the rights of women, including on the international stage?",28
35,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I know she has a deep commitment to removing discrimination against women. The Rudd government is strongly committed to the protection and promotion of women's rights, both domestically and internationally. In fact, August this year marked the 25th anniversary of Australia's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, commonly known as CEDAW. In those 25 years much has been done. In particular, CEDAW provided the basis for very significant reforms, including the Sex Discrimination Act, which in 1984, some 24 years ago, made discrimination against women illegal. But it is time to do more and the Rudd government is taking another important step for the rights of Australian women. Last week, in response to a national interest analysis which I tabled, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that Australia accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. I, along with the Minister for the Status of Women, have conducted wide-ranging consultations with as state and territory governments and nongovernment organisations on the issue of and Australia becoming a party to this important protocol. The responses we have received as a result of the consultations have been uniformly and overwhelmingly positive. It is high time that Australia stood up on our international human rights responsibilities. It is quite hypocritical for us to expect of other nations standards that we are not ourselves prepared to meet. Regrettably, discrimination against women in our region of the world is rife, whether in the areas of employment, educational opportunity, maternity services, social rights or, in the worse-case scenarios, of which we are well aware, the prevalence of sexual trafficking in our region. We cannot call on others to rectify those measures unless we are prepared ourselves to set an example. It is therefore our hope that, before the end of this year, the Rudd government will be able to lodge our instrument of accession to this very important protocol. Regrettably, however, the government has not been supported in this initiative by those opposite. While in government, those opposite ignored this and other important human rights instruments and effectively turned their back on the international community. Now they have submitted a dissenting report to the committee recommendation to sign up to this important protocol. It appears that the opposition still maintains its historical opposition to international human rights and, in particular and most regrettably, the rights of women. I ask those opposite to join with the government in taking this step for Australian women and for the strength of our regional and international human rights obligations. Banking",28
36,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of any advice from the Reserve Bank governor to the secretary of his department, Dr Ken Henry, that the government should limit the deposit guarantee?",29
37,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. As I said earlier at the press conference, and I will inform the House, the secretary of my department and the Governor of the Reserve Bank have been in discussions about the comprehensive guarantee and the level above which a fee may be charged-an insurance premium, if you like. They have been in those discussions consistent with the answer that I gave in the House last Wednesday. Of course, the shadow Treasurer did not listen to the answer last Wednesday, so she was unaware that the government then was looking at finetuning the scheme, as we should, and that is what the Treasury and the Reserve Bank are discussing as we speak and it is what the Treasury and the Reserve Bank are discussing with industry. When those consultations have finished, we will make our announcement. Cluster Munitions",29
38,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the Australian government doing to help eliminate cluster munitions?,29
39,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. In May this year, Australia joined 111 states at the Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions to negotiate a legally binding convention to prohibit cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. Australia joined this process because we very strongly believed that, having seen the devastation caused by landmines throughout the world, the time had come for the international community to address the terrible, indiscriminate effects of cluster munitions. Australia, both in the months leading up to the convention in Dublin and also at the convention itself, worked very hard to achieve a treaty that not only achieved very important humanitarian objectives but also safeguarded Australia's national and national security interests. I think it is well recognised that the new convention on cluster munitions is a significant humanitarian achievement. It prohibits cluster munitions that randomly scatter tens or hundreds of so-called submunitions that have no self-destruct capability or capacity and which pose a long-term threat to innocent civilians for years to come after hostilities have ceased. It does not, for example, apply to modern precision guided weapons with self-destruct capabilities such as the SMArt 155 anti-tank munition, which was recently acquired by the ADF. Importantly, the convention also contains provisions to assist the victims of cluster munitions, their families and also their communities by including provisions which go to the clearance of land to make land free from cluster munitions. The convention ensures that cooperation between nations through peacekeeping and other joint operations with nation-states who do not become a party to the treaty is able to continue. This so-called interoperability is very important to Australia's long-term strategic, security, defence and peacekeeping arrangements. The government has conducted a thorough policy, legal and technical review of the convention, and I am very pleased to advise the House that Australia will sign the convention. Australia will be among the first nations to sign the convention when the treaty opens for signing in Oslo in early December this year. I think that that action by the government and by our nation is consistent with the proud record that Australia has in this area. Australia, for example, was an original signatory to the mine ban convention in 1997. Australia has been a long standing supporter of mine action, committing $75 million over the period 2005 to 2010 to remove mines and assist victims, and this is built on the $100 million which was made available by Australia in the decade leading up to 2005. In the last financial year, 2007-08, we have provided nearly $19 million for mine action projects in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Iraq. Early today I was very pleased to meet with the former member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, who is in the gallery today, and with other representatives of the Australian Network to Ban Landmines to do a number of things: to advise the network on the government's decision to commit to signing the treaty in December this year, to compliment the network on the good work that they do and also to underline Australia's ongoing commitment to mine action. I am also pleased to indicate to the mine network and to advise the House that Australia today will make a further contribution of half a million dollars to the United Nations Mine Action Service, UNMAS, for humanitarian clearance of cluster munitions in Lebanon. This builds on the $2.5 million which Australia has already contributed to UNMAS doing the United Nations vital humanitarian work in this very important area. Banking",29
40,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's revelation in his earlier answers that, in the course of the weekend of 11 and 12 October, he did not speak directly to any of the regulators upon whose advice he has earlier claimed to have relied. How does he reconcile that lack of direct communication with his statement to the National Press Club on 15 October: ‘They are measures which have been implemented in the closest possible coordination with our financial and economic regulators'?",30
41,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The council of economic regulators includes the Treasury. On these matters that you have just referred to in your question, the form of communication between the government and the other regulators was through the medium of the Secretary of the Treasury, as is entirely normal. Mr Hockey-Normal?",30
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Furthermore, are those opposite, including the member for North Sydney, saying that they do not trust the word of the Secretary of the Treasury? Mr Hockey interjecting",30
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney!,30
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, this is a very important question. Are those opposite saying they do not trust the words of the Secretary of the Treasury? We on this side of the House do. The government has great trust in the Secretary of the Treasury-it is a high public office of the Commonwealth. If I as Prime Minister turn around to the Secretary of the Treasury and say, ‘Is this course of action'Mr Hockey interjecting",30
45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, one person's voice? Mr Hockey-Yes.",30
46,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So the member for North Sydney says the Secretary of the Treasury's position on this is only one voice and not to be trusted by the government. That is an extraordinary position on the part of those opposite. Can I say that the attitude of those opposite is also consistent with the previous government's treatment of the Secretary of the Treasury. If those opposite perused the public reporting on this matter, when the current Secretary of the Treasury was serving the previous government and dared to give a public speech which went to the question of whether the Treasury was being properly consulted on such questions as water and climate change, how did the previous government deal with the then and current Secretary of the Treasury? Do you know what happened? His salary bonus was chopped because he dared to speak out. That is what happened. That is the contempt with which that government treated that high office of the Commonwealth. When I as the Prime Minister turn to the Secretary of the Treasury and ask this formal question-‘Is this the advice of the regulators including the Reserve Bank?'-and the answer is yes, I trust that advice. I assume that the member for Wentworth backs up the Manager of Opposition Business when he says, ‘That's just one voice'-one voice in the wilderness. It just happens to be the Secretary of the Treasury. Our view is quite the reverse. I say to the member for Wentworth: you have a statement to us by the Secretary of the Treasury about the position of the regulators-that is point 1. But if there is any on this matter it is an open and shut case when you have a statement today by the Governor of the Reserve Bank which says that the government's actions were sensible and the Reserve Bank of Australia supported them. You have a clear-cut statement by the Reserve Bank governor that the bank supported the government's actions consistent with the statement to the ministers in that committee about the attitude of the regulators to the action taken. The government's course of action has been responsible, and again the member for Wentworth, the member for North Sydney, in a most irresponsible injection now about the Secretary of the Treasury, and the memberMr Hockey interjecting",30
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney!,31
48,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would have thought the member for North Sydney in particular would be sensible and sensitive to the advice from regulatory institutions given his particular experience of being the regulator when HIH went bust. I seem to remember that the member in question,31
49,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,31
50,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite regard this as not relevant to the current debate. The recommendations which came to the previous government for a financial claims scheme came out of the HIH royal commission. An entire company goes under, the member for North Sydney was the minister for financial regulation at the time, and a certain other member of this parliament seemed to have a material engagement in those matters at the time. I will leave that to one side. But can I say to those others opposite: if we have a clear statement to us by the Secretary of the Treasury that this is the position of the regulators, and if the Governor of the Reserve Bank then confirms that is the doubt case, then this is an open and shut case. Those opposite are simply clutching at straws; again trying to make a cheap political point. The government stands by the Secretary of the Treasury. He is a first-class officer of the Commonwealth. The government stands by the integrity of the Reserve Bank, of APRA, of ASIC and of the council of economic regulators. If those opposite were interested in the nation's long-term economic interests, they would do so as well. Murray-Darling River System",31
51,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts representing the Minister for Climate Change and Water. I ask the minister: what action has the government taken to protect the health of our river systems?",32
52,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise his interest in these matters. The government understands that the shortand long-term health of our river systems is a hugely critical issue and, since coming to government, Labor has set about delivering real improvements to the health of our rivers. In particular I point out to the House the $12.9 billion Water for the Future program, including $3.1 billion for environmental water chases through the Restoring the Balance in the Murray-Darling Basin program. Already a number of substantial decisions have been taken. On 15 September we commenced a tender to purchase water from willing sellers in the QueenslandOpposition members-Page 2.",32
53,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and northern New South Wales areas of the Murray-Darling Basin, part of a $400 million program to purchase water entitlements in the northern section of the basin. On 20 September the Prime Minister announced an offer to buy the water entitlements of small block irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin who agree to sell all their water entitlements to that Commonwealth. Up to $150,000 as a special payment along with transitional assistance will be made available to eligible irrigators. People can leave irrigated farming but stay on the farm and stay in their community. This measure is expected to yield up toOpposition members-Page 3.",32
54,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much for showing your ability to count, those on the opposition side. I will be coming to numbers in a minute. On 7 October the government commenced a tender to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers in the Murray-Darling Basin, providing environmental benefits to RAMSAR listed wetlands along the River Murray such as the Lower Lakes, the Coorong, the Chowilla floodplain near Renmark and the Barmah-Millewa Forest near Echuca. So the government is delivering on bringing improvements to the river systems of the Murray-Darling Basin. The question I must ask now, through you, Mr Speaker, is: what did the coalition achieve in 11 years? Now let us count what happened in 11 years. Not one single drop of water was recovered directly under the Living Murray program. I urge the opposition to pur- count that number-not one single drop of water was recovered directly under the Living Murray program. In fact the coalition woke up late to the issue of water when the former Prime Minister announced the national water plan for security 10 months before he lost office. Opposition members-Page 4.",32
55,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This plan was developed in secret by Mr Howard and the now Leader of the Opposition. There was no consultation with the cabinet. There was no consultation with Treasury. There was no consultation with the National Water Commission. There was no consultation with state or territory governments.,32
56,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, a point of order going to relevance-and I hope the minister will not lose his place by my intervention: I listened carefully to the question and I assume, as is now the practice, you have a copy. There was nothing in that question that entitled this minister to start his discourse on the opposition's policy.",32

60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I remind the member for Sturt, as I did the member for Cowan, of standing order 65(b). He manages to interrupt nearly everything that goes on in question time-not only the answers but also the questions and the Speaker. That goes for the member for Braddon as well. The minister has been relevant. The numeracy exercise that the opposition embarked upon is something that has been going on in this place for decades. It is not really very funny. It is very cute. It only proves, perhaps, that we are as numerate as our predecessors. I think it is just completely disruptive and really something that should be left in primary school.",33
61,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For those who are used to counting, may I remind the opposition that in 2001 they were in specific receipt of information from the snapshot survey by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission of the impact of environmental degradation on the Murray-Darling Basin. In 2002 they were in receipt of the report from the Australian Greenhouse Office called Living with climate change, which again showed beyond any shadow of a doubt that there were significant risks to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin, yet in all that time the opposition were not able to deliver a single drop of water to the Murray-Darling Basin. The Leader of the Opposition had two years in the water portfolio and he did not deliver any recoverable water for the Murray-Darling Basin system. The opposition had 12 years to take national leadership on water and it failed. This government in four months began to take robust and comprehensive action on bringing health back to the Murray-Darling Basin, and we continue on that course in the interests of the nation. Banking",33
62,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister was too busy to speak to the Reserve Bank governor himself on the deposit guarantee matter, if it turns out that the Reserve Bank governor did not, in fact, expressly recommend an unlimited deposit guarantee, will he dismiss the Secretary of the Treasury for misleading the cabinet? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 100 explicitly not rules out the asking of questions which are hypothetical. Mr Hockey-Hypothetical? This is serious.",33

The world currently confronts a global financial crisis. The Secretary of the Treasury is integral to this government's and the preceding government's response to international economic developments. The Secretary of the Treasury and his team have been working huge hours week in and week out, seven days a week, to ensure that Australia's response to this crisis-both in terms of the measures taken on bank guarantees and the measure taken in relation to the fiscal stimulus package-were the right ones for the nation. As Prime Minister, and as leader of the government, I use this occasion to affirm 100 per cent this government's confidence in the Secretary of the Treasury and I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to get to his feet now and do the same.",33

69,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Can the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how many schools have applied for the current round of funding for trades training centres in schools?",34
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question. I did have the opportunity with him to visit Seaton High School in his electorate. We were there for the purpose of talking about trades training and talking about upgrading the facilities that those students were learning on. Of course, trades training is important to have as a pathway in secondary schools. It is important because many students want to learn through vocational education and training pathways. It is also vital if this nation is going to lift percentage of students it retains to year 12 or equivalent. One of the most shameful legacies of the Liberal Party, after its 12 long years in government, was to leave this nation with retention rates that are low by the standards of our competitors across the world and to leave us with a situation where too many young Australians leave school, not to go into work, not to go into further training, but unfortunately to go nowhere-to go nowhere to secure a long-term future. We are determined to change that, and one of the government's programs to change it is our major investment in trades training centres in schools-a program every secondary school in the country will be able to benefit from across the program's 10 years. It is a program which will enable schools to get a grant of between $500,000 and $1½ million to engage in upgrading or building trades training facilities. Now, of course this program has already gone through its first round, and in that first gram round some $90 million was delivered to schools. A feature of that applications process was that many schools in local areas, in regional centres and in suburban areas across the country determined to come together in clusters and make joint applications, either to get a bigger facility or to get compatible facilities so that one school could specialise in one sort of trades training and a different school could specialise in a different sort of trades training, and the students from both schools could have the opportunity to move between the two schools and learn in either stream-a very practical arrangement which gives students more pathways. I am pleased to say that the second phase of our trades training program is working well. Applications closed on Friday, 17 October. This is a big round, with $310 million available for schools through this applicathe tions process. When applications closed on 17 October, we had 115 schools submit applications but, as I said, because many schools have chosen to cluster, those applications actually represent benefits to 355 schools in total. The amount that has been bid for through that application process slightly exceeds the amount available-it is $320 million in total. We have indicated to some schools that we will extend the time period for their application to allow them to confirm their bids. That small extension of time has been to 30 October. We think that this is an exciting process for the schools involved. It means that students around the country will go from learning on facilities which would have been best forgotten about in the 1950s, so old are they, and will give students the ability to learn trades skills on the equipment and in facilities which are appropriate for the 21st century. Of course, this was an area that the vious government neglected. It is part of its record of educational failure. Nothing got done to stop students around the country learning on the gether?",34

75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt is warned.,35
76,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They choose to cluster together because it is a model that they think will be more effective for their students. I know the shadow minister for education thinks he knows more than everybody else, but perhaps he might think to himself that principals in schools who make decisions to work in partnership with adjacent or neighbouring schools are making those decisions for good reasons. I know a flavour of today has been that opposition members seem to think that they know better than everybody else, including the experts, but I would say to the shadow minister for education that I think principals who are making these applications know a fair bit more. On the question, of course, of making sure that we have an education revolution, Mr preSpeaker, you have drawn the House's attention today to the question of numeracy and whether or not people are numerate and accurate. It is a pretty good question, because my attention has been drawn to a press release by the shadow minister for education, who has put the proposition that the on-costs for 116,000 computers are $3 billion to $4 billion. The shadow minister for education is so numerate that he thinks the on-cost for a computer is $34,482. It just goes to prove the proposition that, when it comes to matters dealing with numbers, when it comes to matters financial and when it comes to matters economic, the last thing you can ever afford to do is trust someone from the Liberal Party.

The question is: Isfor the advice of the opposition, that is in the present tensethe government considering a $5 million cap on these deposits as reported today? My answer was: Not to my knowledge, and you should bear in mind that these are essentially matters for the Treasurer. I waspast tense, for those in the oppositionActing Treasurer for the period when they were actually introduced, but typically when the Treasurer is in the saddleand I have not been Acting Treasurer for more than a weekI don't get directly involved in these matters on a day-today basis because they are his portfolio, not mine.

102,Mr GARRETT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Kingsford Smith Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts) (3.23 pm)-by leave-On Friday 3 October I announced the government's intenfor tion to introduce a resale royalty right by 1 July 2009. This is a landmark and genuinely historic moment for the more than 20,000 Australian visual artists. This government recognises and values the work of our artists; we are committed to enlarging the creative opportunities for artists to contribute to our economy, community and identity. The decision to introduce a resale royalty right for visual artists has been a long time coming. The introduction of a resale royalty was discussed as early as 1997 in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Industry Strategy. In 1998 the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies report Our culture, our future: report on Australian Indigenous cultural and intellectual property called for a resale royalty right to be recognised. In 2002 Rupert Myer, respected arts patron, philanthropist and the current chair of the National Gallery of Australia, in his report on the Contemporary Visual Arts and Craft Inquiry, recommended the Commonwealth government introduce a resale royalty scheme. Further, in 2003 Professor David Throsby and Virginia Hollister conducted a study for the Australia Council for the Arts which found, despite being highly trained, visual artists to be among the most poorly remunerated of all artists. Labor Party policy reflected these findings, including through the introduction of private members' bills by Senator Kate Lundy in 2004 and the member for Fraser, Bob MCMullan, in 2006. But it is not until today that the government in this House has committed to introducing stand-alone legislation to implement such a scheme. It has taken a while but we got there in the end. This government is proud of its efforts to put the arts centrestage. We have never shied away from openly advocating the critical role of the arts and artists in our society nor the significant contribution they make. At the last election we enunciated a detailed and comprehensive set of arts policies which included introducing a resale royalty scheme. These election commitments were welcomed by the sector as a firm commitment to encouraging, innervating and supporting this country's cultural life. In fact, at the time the only dissenting voice on resale royalty and supporting artists generally came from the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins. The Australian visual arts market throws up its fair share of big news and big money. Recognising there are always movements in any market, it is clear that over time we have seen a general appreciation in value of the secondary art market in Australia. However, in most of these cases, the artist will receive nothing, having sold the work for a substantially smaller figure earlier on in their career. A resale royalty right for visual artists will help redress this imbalance by entitling artists to a portion of the proceeds from the resale of their works. By enshrining in law the right of artists and their heirs to receive a benefit from the secondary sale of their work, this government is helping to build an environment where the talent and creativity of visual artists receives greater reward and recognition. In the last 20 years the value of auction art sales in Australia has climbed dramatically, including an incredible jump of nearly 70 per cent in 2007 alone. Sadly, local artists have not shared in the benefits of this frenetic activity. Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri's spectacular painting Warlugulong is a well known example of how sharply a work of art can appreciate in value. Originally sold for just $1,200 in 1977, it was resold for $36,000 in 1996 and was eventually purchased at auction last year for a staggering $2.4 millionthe highest price ever paid for a work of art by an Indigenous artist. The introduction of a resale royalty right for Australian visual artists is an important acknowledgement of the contribution artists make to our country's cultural landscape and that they deserve the opportunity to share fairly in the increasing value of their work. In Australia, regrettably, we have been slow to recognise the right of artists to derive an ongoing benefit from their work. It is the case that many visual artists subsist on meagre incomes and, whilst the ongoing connection between artists and their work is recognised in Australia and around the world through moral rights legislation, the introduction of a resale royalty right will give visual artists an economic interest in their work as well. This important right puts them on the same footing as writers and composers, who are able to earn income from their work on an ongoing basis through copyright. It is important to note that the scheme we will introduce has been informed by an extensive series of discussions and consultations with the sector which included artists, art market professionals and the auction houses. The government recognises that it is vitally important we get the balance right, and this scheme achieves that. It also achieves the certainty the sector requires for a sustainincluding able and profitable industry for both artists and sellers. It brings fairness to the visual arts sector so that artists can enjoy the fruits of their success. Under the Australian Resale Royalty Scheme, artists will receive a royalty payment of five per cent of the sale price each time their work is resold through an auction house, a commercial gallery or an art dealer for $1,000 or more. The simple five per cent flat royalty rate will make the scheme easy to understand and administer and the threshold price of $1,000 will benefit a high proportion of artists represented in the secondary market while making the scheme cost effective to manage. The Resale Royalty Scheme will cover many kinds of artworks: paintings on canvas; bark paintings; wood carvings; sculptures; textiles like batik; weavings and basketry; prints like linocuts, etchings or screen prints; and many other ways that artists work today. The scheme will also recognise joint creation of art works, a very important feature for artists who paint canvases together in Indigenous communities. It means that, if two or more artists work together to paint a canvas or to carve a sculpture, for instance, and this joint work is acknowledged, they can all share in the royalties from future resales. as single artists can pass on their right to their estate, joint artists will be able to pass on their right to their own heirs. This resale royalty right will apply to works by living artists and for a period of 70 years after an artist's death, with the right being passed on to the beneficiaries of artists' wills, including Indigenous communities and charities. This puts it in line with current copyright arrangements for other creators like authors. Through international reciprocity arrangements, Australian artists will also be able to benefit from resales of their work in other countries with a resale royalty scheme, in the European Union. At present a resale royalty right operates in over 50 countries, from European Union nations, to South American countries, like Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, and a number of African nations, including Algeria, Ivory Coast and Morocco. In the United Kingdom, the introduction of a resale royalty has been a success. In Australia, the royalty will be collected by a collecting organisation that will be responsible for keeping track of who was owed a royalty from which sale and then making the payments. That will be conducted in a cost-effective manner to maximise benefits to artists. In the last budget the government provided $1.5 million over three years to support the costs of establishing the Resale Royalty Scheme, including monitoring collection and distribution of the royalty revenue. The scheme's great virtue is that it is clear and straightforward in terms of how the right applies. The collecting organisation will have the capacity to make sure it is able to deliver a scheme which is accountable, which is well understood and which delivers to artists the benefit they deserve. The government will appoint the collecting organisation following Just a competitive tender process. We have chosen design specifications for the scheme to reflect the particular characteristics of the Australian art market. Importantly, the scheme balances two sets of interests: on the one hand, it recognises the unique characteristics of the Australian art market and provides certainty; while on the other hand, it ensures the opportunity for artists to benefit from the future success of their work. To provide certainty for the market, the resale royalty right will only apply resales where the seller has acquired the work of art after the scheme takes effect. This arrangement will allow businesses in the Australian art market to adjust to this change in their operating environment, ensuring a smooth transition to the scheme. While the right will apply to all visual artists, I make no secret of the fact that one of the government's motives in introducing this scheme was the very real benefits it will bring to Indigenous artists and their communities. I announced the government's intention to introduce a resale royalty right in ice Springs at the Papunya Tula Gallery. Australia's Indigenous arts movement is one of the most significant artistic movements of the 20th century. Contemporary Aboriginal art continues to evolve and to challenge. It is dynamic, it is diverse and it is informed by strong culture. It is this strength that underpins its success, at home and across the world. Incredibly, the Emily Kame Kngwarreye exhibition which toured Japan earlier this year even surpassed the attendance records previously held by an Andy Warhol exhibition. The government recognises the important cultural and economic contribution made by the visual arts and crafts sector, particularly to Indigenous communities. We are committed to strengthening opportunities for Indigenous visual artists practicing across Australia as well as the wider visual arts community. We have already put in place measures to strengthen Indigenous art practice by investing additional funding in Aboriginal art centres-some $7.6 million over four years. We are also determined that the Indigenous Visual Arts Commercial Code of Conduct be finalised as a priority. Additionally and critically, there will be regulatory benefits for Indigenous artists through improved transparency and record to keeping in the market. This will result in greater tracking of sales on the secondary market. This is important, because poor or sometimes a complete lack of record keeping was highlighted as a barrier to ethical commerce in the recent Senate inquiry into the Indigenous visual art sector. To give an example of how the scheme will work in practice, let us say that in July 2009, after the proposed resale royalty right legislation has come into effect, a gallery owner negotiates with an Indigenous art centre the outright purchase of a range of works. Al- One canvas is purchased for $10,000. The gallery owner then puts the work up for sale at exhibition several months later in December 2009 and the canvas is purchased by an investor for $16,000. Under the government's resale royalty right, a royalty payment to the artist of $800, less a small administration fee, is triggered as the gallery owner acquired the work following the introduction of the resale royalty right. The campaign for a resale royalty right has featured prominently in this country for decades as artists and those concerned with issues of fairness and adequate remuneration have attempted to be heard. On this basis alone, the introduction of a scheme is an incredibly significant moment for Australia's visual artists. Those creators who toil with paintbrush, clay, glasswork or photographic negative, often times for very little reward but spurred on by their ambition, will now have a fair share in any future success their work achieves. By giving artists a fair go, this government is laying the foundation for future creative success for Australia and for Australian artists. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to allow the member for Moncrieff to speak for 13½ minutes. Leave granted.",37
103,Mr GARRETT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,by leave-I move: That so much of the standing orders be pended as would prevent the member for Moncrieff speaking for a period not exceeding 13½ minutes. Question agreed to.,41
104,Mr CIOBO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate about the Rudd government's commitment to the arts and, in this particular case, the government's commitment to visual artists. The notion of introducing resale royalties in Australia has been discussed periodically for some 20 years now. I certainly look forward to the government releasing the full details of their proposal so the debate these times can be a fully informed one. I join with the minister in recognising the work of Aboriginal artists. Today the arts and cultural sectors in Australia are recognised worldwide for our exemplary Australian visual, performing and literary artists and art companies. It is estimated that cultural indusIndigenous tries contribute around 3.3 per cent of Australia's domestic production, worth almost $38 billion a year. At the 2001 census, more than 270,000 Australians were listed as being employed in cultural industries. The coalition recognises that Australian arts and culture are characterised by a rich diversity of art forms practised across the breadth of this vast country. We support the arts and are determined to ensure that all regions of Australia are able to benefit from the cultural and economic benefits of a strong and secure arts sector. Australia's Indigenous art is becoming increasingly renowned around the world for its quality and its unique style. Importantly, Indigenous art generates employment and cultural activity, as well as significant economic opportunity in Indigenous communities. Functioning art centres contribute to a healthy community as these centres play a crucial role in broader family and community social support. They are generally sus- owned and controlled by Indigenous people and facilitate the production of art by Indigenous people. In many remote communities art centres provide a major source of selfgenerated income, as well as providing an important platform for cultural maintenance and education. The Indigenous art industry includes some major success stories such as Papunya Tula artists in Kintore in Central Australia. This Aboriginal owned enterprise is built around the successful art practice of around 150 artists, attracting substantial national and international interest. From humble beginnings in the 1970s, the company is in now fully self-sufficient with a gallery in Alice Springs and generating enough profits to support specific community projects such as dialysis facilities, a community swimming pool and the construction of a new arts centre building. The coalition is committed to supporting art and culture by ensuring real economic and social benefits for the sector, its sustainability and its future needs. As the speech of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts today highlighted, once again the Rudd government is all too interested in symbolism without a care for actually delivering meaningful outcomes to Australia's visual artists. We speak today on the government's proposed resale royalty scheme for which the legislation that will govern the proposed scheme is yet to be released, even as a draft. Of course, the minister is happy to refer the House to those in the arts sector who may support the scheme on the details available thus far, but he has ignored those concerns that do exist about this proposal. The coalition is committed to better outcomes for Australia's visual artists and has a strong track record in delivering for them. In the 2006-07 budget, the then coalition government delivered a $6 million package over four years to provide meaningful targeted assistance to visual artists, regardless of whether their work reached the secondary market. This package included $500,000 per annum for a training package to help visual artists enhance their engagement with the commercial arts market and $1 million per annum to strengthen the Indigenous visual arts industry in regional and remote communities. This funding was designed to provide direct benefits to Australian artists, the port of which, of course, extended beyond just late career artists and the estates ceased artists. The coalition delivered record levels of funding to the arts sector. Funding for the Australia Council to provide arts grants at arm's length from government increased by more than 220 per cent since the last Labor budget in 1995-96. Last year, more than eight million Australians attended Australia Council cultural activities. As we all know too well, when it comes to Labor Party policy the devil is most certainly in the detail. The coalition will, of course, carefully examine the legislation that Labor puts forward on this proposal. The minister refers to the 2002 report by the current Chairman of the National Gallery of Australia, Rupert Myer. I note that this report was commissioned by the then coalition government. The Myer report noted that the effects that resale royalties would have on the Australian art market are unclear. The Myer report concluded that such a scheme may benefit artists in the following ways: by providing artists with a contingent income stream which is not currently available; by empowering artists by allowing them to enjoy a direct economic benefit from the success of the work; and by recognising the ongoing relationship between the artist and their work and the extent to which an artist's reputation is linked to the physical products of their creative labour. Following the Myer report, a discussion paper on a proposed resale royalty arrangement was released by the then Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. This report noted that it is often argued that implementing a resale royalty scheme would increase the income of contemporary visual artists. In the Australian context, and indeed in the context of the current proposal by the government, this is presented as being particularly important for supIndigenous artists. Research presented in the report suggested that, in terms of income of desupplementation, resale royalty schemes bring most benefit to successful late career artists with strong reputations whose work is regularly traded and only brings limited benefits for emerging and less successful artists. I have been made aware of concerns within the arts sector at the current right of term proposals. I am advised the experiences of similar schemes overseas have shown collecting royalties for deceased artists and their estates can be more difficult to track, creating an unnecessary administrative burden on art resellers and collecting agencies. I understand the United Kingdom scheme currently applies to living artists only. I look forward to the government's response to these concerns. The government has not yet clarified whether the royalty will apply to the hammer price achieved at auction or whether premiums and taxes applied to art resales will be included in the sale price subject to the royalty. I am advised that similar schemes in the United Kingdom and Europe apply a maximum threshold of ¼ IRU DQ\ VLQJOH work each time it is sold. The intention of this cap is to prevent high-value artworks being sold offshore. The government has not clarified why it has not adopted such a cap nor has it acknowledged the implications of such a decision. There exists some uncertainty about which transactions will be encompassed by the government's scheme. Will electronic intermediaries be treated differently from traditional resellers in determining whether a transaction is a public or a private one? Would, for example, eBay be treated as an auction house in the same way as Sotheby's or Bonhams and Goodman. The government is yet to answer these questions. Ignoring the concerns which exist in the sector will not serve the minister well. Indeed, doing so will only foster an alternative, black market for artwork sales in Australia or a resulting offshore market, both of which will disadvantage visual artists, art collectors lers alike. Certainly an alternative private art market in Australia would raise additional issues surrounding artwork title and insurance and only serve to destabilise the Australian arts sector and our national collecting institutions. I have committed to consulting widely with the industry before the coalition concludes a position on the government's proposal, and I look forward to meeting with visual artists and their representatives as well as art resellers and collectors and the intermediaries. While I await the opportunity to view to draft legislation on the government's proposed scheme, I am pleased to commit the coalition to ensuring the welfare of our visual artists, having taken all the matters I have raised today and others fully into account. NA Economy",41
105,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wentworth proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to act in an economically responsible manner, by taking major economic decisions without regard to the recommendations of key financial regulators. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",43
106,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On 29 February 2008 the Prime Minister said: Trust is the key currency of politics, and unless you can be trusted to honour that to which you've committed to do, then, I've got to say, you're not going to obtain the enduring respect of the Ausand art reseltralian people. The Australian people today are bewildered by the recent announcements of the government and the uncertainty that has been created by their bungling and mishandling of them. We have been told today, on the front page of the Australian newspaper, that the Reserve Bank has warned the government about the problems arising from an unlimited guarantee on bank deposits. We know that an unlimited guarantee is unusual. Deposit guarantees of this kind, historically-and indeed around the world-have had a cap on them. They have a cap in the United States, they have a cap in the United Kingdom and it is proposed to have a $20,000 cap here in Australia. But, apparently, on the weekend of 11 and 12 October, the strategic policy and budget committee of cabinet met and decided that there should be an unlimited deposit guarantee, and that was announced. The Prime Minister has gone to great pains to stress that this policy was taken on the advice of the Reserve Bank. He said that it was based on the advice of the bank. He said that on the day. On 15 October he said, ‘These measures have been implemented in the closest possible coordination with our financial and economic regulators.' He said that again and again in talking about the importance of acting on the advice of our regulators. On 14 October in question time he said: ... we will act in accordance with the regulator's advice in this difficult time rather than take term, populist positions in order to secure a headline. The people of Australia were given the very clear impression, the unequivocal impression, firstly that the government was in close and direct contact with the regulators, the most important of which in this context was the Reserve Bank and, secondly, that the policy, the measure, being proposed and which has now been incorporated in law through an act of parliament passed through both houses, had the support, so the Prime Minister said, of the Reserve Bank. It has become clear in the course of question time today that on that weekend there were in fact no discussions directly between ministers and the Reserve Bank of Australia. We heard the Minister for Finance and Deregulation earlier today, who is a member of the committee, saying he was not aware of the advice of the Reserve Bank. I noticed his attempt to explain himself and he quoted somewhat from his transcript with Sky News earlier today. In one section, he said: Oppositions routinely accuse governments of misleading parliament and a lot of the time it is stretching the truth to suggest that that Not being aware of what the Reserve Bank Governor is supposed to have said to the government, if anythingand it goes on to say: I note there are newspaper reports where there is no direct material from the Reserve Bank Governor. He says that he is not aware of what the Reserve Bank governor is supposed to have said. So how did the government become aware of this? How did the Prime Minister become aware of this? What the Prime Minister has said-and he said it twice in question time-is that at the end of the meeting when they had gone through the options and reached their conclusion, he put a question to short- the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr Henry. The question was: is the position being recommended here-in other words, the unlimited deposit guarantee-that of the regulators? He said that Dr Henry said: ‘It was, and that includes the Reserve Bank.' So the Prime Minister has said unequivocally twice in question time that the position being recommended was the position of the Reserve Bank and that that advice had apparently been given to the Secretary of the Treasury, who passed it on to the Prime Minister. We on this side of the House have the utmost respect for both the competence and the integrity of Dr Henry. That is why we would not throw him to the wolves and use him as a human shield in the way the Prime Minister has done. Let us be very clear about the analysis of this. If the Reserve Bank governor did not recommend an unlimited guarantee on deposits to the Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary to the Treasury could not have said that the position being recommended was that of the Reserve Bank. I think that is plain enough. If that had been the case-if he had misrepresented the position of the Reserve Bank-that would obviis the case. ously be a very serious matter. We do not imagine for one minute that Dr Henry misled the cabinet committee. We do not imagine for one minute that there was any misleading being done in the course of these events other than by the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd. The fact of the matter is that he has set out to create an impression that he is acting totally in accordance with the advice of the Reserve Bank. He hid behind the skirts of the Reserve Bank and, when the front page of the Australian revealed that that was not right, he then sought to verbal the Secretary to the Treasury. Dr Henry deserves better than that. But what has happened to him today is that he has been verballed by the Prime Minister and put in the position where, if the Governor of the Reserve Bank did not recommend an unlimited cap on deposits-and it is plain enough from his speech today that he has the gravest of reservations about an unlimited deposit guarantee; you do not need to rely on the front page of the Australian to see thatone of two outcomes must be right. Either Dr Henry misrepresented the Reserve Bank's position to the cabinet committee or the Prime Minister is misrepresenting what Dr Henry said to the cabinet committee. I can assure you that on our side of the House we have no doubt what the actual factual outcome is. There has been a betrayal of trust. Do we imagine that there are any Australians today who thought prior to question time today that the Prime Minister had made these momentous decisions without speaking directly to the regulators themselves? Only today we had the Minister for Finance and Deregulation on Sky News saying: Throughout the international financial crisis, Government has been in very regular contact, almost constant contact, with the key regulators including the Reserve Bank and we have paid a lot of attention to the advice we have received from the regulators. Yet it is plain enough that on that crucial weekend they paid no attention to the Reserve Bank other than, allegedly, at second hand via Dr Henry. I am sure that Glenn Stevens was available to take a call. I am sure Dr Laker at APRA was available to take a call. But, no, the Prime Minister was too busy to talk to them as he planned his unlimited guarantee. We have talked about in this House on many occasions the moral hazard problems of deposit guarantees, and they exist whatever the level of the guarantee. We took an unlimited guarantee on trust because we believed the government was acting on the express advice of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the agency and regulator responsible for the systemic stability of our whole financial system. If you have an unlimited guarantee, it means that a deposit of any size-it could be $100 million; it could be $1 billion-with the smallest guaranteed institution in Australia, such as a credit union, will have a higher credit rating than a deposit with any other financial institution, such as a foreign bank branch that is not covered, a large corporation or a cash management trust. It is no wonder that the announcement of this unlimited guarantee has caused so much difficulty. If we are to believe the Prime Minister that the Reserve Bank recommended an unlimited guarantee on that weekend, why is it that only a matter of days, not weeks, later the Reserve Bank governor is saying to the government: ‘You've got to change it. You've got to install a cap.' Why would you pass this bill through the House and through the Senate? It may have received royal assent the today. I am not familiar with that detail. Perhaps the Treasurer can tell us. It may now be the law of the land. Why would the government take it through both houses of parliament if it was going to turn around and amend it, if it was seriously considering doing that? The fact is that in the second reading speech the Treasurer said quite expressly and very clearly that it was proposed to review it in three years with the intent of having a cap after three years. Indeed, when the shadow Treasurer and I recommended there be a $100,000 cap because we thought $20,000 was too low, we also said it should be reviewed in three years by the Productivity Commission. We know that confidence in this economy in these difficult times is absolutely vital. Trust and confidence are co-extensive, and the public has put enormous trust in the Prime Minister. It has taken him on trust. These are extraordinary measures that he has announced. Yet what we are seeing is an indignation, a resistance-a petulance-when confronted with the most basic questions. We have a proposal to grant guarantees to the wholesale funding of banks. The Prime Minister, in the course of one of his answers, made it quite clear that he did not understand the distinction at all between deposits with banks which have priority under the Banking Act and the other sources of funding for banks, in particular their wholesale term funding. The government is proposing to offer guarantees there, and they will be the subject of a fee. This could involve the Commonwealth taking on hundreds of billions of dollars of contingent liabilities. The taxpayers of Australia could be on the hook for an enormous amount of money. Those term funding obligations do not have priority under the Banking Act-they are, if you like, right at the top of the risk profile of a bank, other than for its capital. The most protected are the deposits; after that are the other liabilities; and then there is the capital. So if a were to fail, the wholesale term funding that we are talking about providing Commonwealth guarantees for would be at far more risk than deposits. That is the scheme of the Banking Act, and has been so for many years. The government is proposing that this not be the subject of legislation, so the parliament will have no say in how those fees may be set. Of course, we saw the bizarre, if somewhat hilarious, example of the Treasurer who did not understand the difference between a BBB credit and an AA credit. When asked a very simple question by the shadow Treasurer as to whether you charge a higher fee for a BBB bank than for a AA bank, and prompted by the finance minister, ‘Just say yes,' he either didn't hear him or was too vain to accept the prompt and so gave another bumbling response. But, as I said, this momentous step is apparently not going to be the subject of legislation. Consider the absurdity of the government's position: it is proposing to have the Commonwealth take on its book hundreds of billions of dollars of contingent liabilities without legislation and yet it knows that were one of those guarantees to be called it could not be paid out without an appropriation bill being passed through the parliament. What a ridiculous- (Time expired)",43
107,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We just saw on display in the House, and the Australian people have just seen, how reckless and slippery the Leader of the Opposition is-how he will say anything and do anything for personal political power. We saw his personal alternative energy policy on display here today: he is powered by his own sense of self-satisfaction-and God forbid anyone who gets in his way. That has been the history of his political life, as those opposite will certainly learn as time goes on. Peobank ple on this side of the House are very familiar with the member for Wentworth. They know that slippery barrister talk is no substitute for a sense of public policy and it is no substitute for committed values and a commitment to the national interest; there is only commitment there to the personal interest. What we saw today is a leader of the opposition who is out of touch and out of control. Times like this do actually demand responsibility from political leaders. Yet what we saw today was an act of recklessness from a political leader who will say anything or do anything for political power. We have become reasonably familiar with that through the member for Wentworth's political career and his time outside parliament. We have also become familiar with it over the past 12 months. It was only some months ago that he was attacking the Reserve Bank and also attacking the Treasury secretary, but he has already forgotten that because he simply moves on, day after day, hoping that people will forget what he did the week before and the week before that. But to do all this at a time of international financial turmoil shows just how reckless the Leader of the Opposition is. To do this in the worse financial conditions since the Great Depression shows that he will say and do anything for political power. That proves how unfit the member for Wentworth is for the high offices of Leader of the Opposition and alternative Prime Minister of this country. Dr Henry, the Secretary to the Treasury, is one of Australia's highest and most respected public servants. In the history of this country, he is one of our most pre-eminent public servants. He has served all sides of politics. He worked with the member for Higgins, might I say, for 12 years, and that is certainly stantial achievement. He has proved he can work with both sides of politics and is therefore held in the highest regard, not just by those familiar with political life but by those out in the business community. He is also known for his commitment to a decent set of values when it comes to issues as important as conservation. So what does the Leader of the Opposition do in this House today? He irresponsibly asks the Prime Minister the question: ‘Will he sack the Secretary of the Treasury?' That is exactly what he said. He has attempted to crabwalk away from that, using slippery barrister talk in his remarks here earlierMr Morrison interjecting",46

110,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"but nothing will substitute for a full apology on the floor of this parliament from the Leader of the Opposition to Dr Henry and to the Australian people. That is what is absolutely demanded by his reckless behaviour in question time today, so the Leader of the Opposition has still got time. At some time in the next 24 hours he ought to come into this House and apologise for his behaviour in question time. This is just the latest evidence of reckless behaviour that we have seen through the past few weeks. There was the extraordinary discussion the Leader of the Opposition had on Insiders on Sunday. He went on that program and said: ‘The global financial crisis is just all being hyped up. Don't worry about it. It's no massive challenge for the globe or the country. It's all been hyped up by Kevin Rudd.' That demonstrates something very fundamental about the Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, it demonstrates how out of a subtouch he is. He does not understand the impact of that on superannuation and what that means to the lifestyles of retirees. He does not fundamentally understand the impact of that on the profitability of small business. He does not understand any of those things if he thinks that the global financial crisis is hyped up. It proves he is absolutely out of touch with what is happening to average Australian families and businesses. But, perhaps even more importantly, he has demonstrated he does not understand the magnitude of the challenge Australians are facing in the middle of this global financial crisis by coming into the House and questioning the deposit guarantee. This deposit guarantee is very important to confidence, and that is why we made it comprehensive. We made it comprehensive because there was a need to assure everyone that their deposits were safe. Of course, he made the remark before that there should be a cap-$20,000 or $100,000. A cap will not work in these circumstances, and that just proves that he does not understand what we are doing. We are in the middle of a global financial crisis and under the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition 40 per cent of the deposits in the banking system would not be covered. That is the proposition that he is putting to the Australian people. That is absolutely irresponsible, absolutely reckless and shows that he does not have an understanding of the fundamental challenge the nation faces in the circumstances that we are in. The bank guarantee is very important to confidence, very important to assure all Australians that the financial system is stable. And he comes into this House raising questions about it, quoting an inaccurate report on the front page of the Australian, irresponsibly blowing it up before he had heard from the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He was prepared to do that because he will say anything and he will do anything for his personal political power. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has stated the situation in his speech today. He has made it very, very clear that the Reserve Bank supports the position of the government. Might I just add that, as the Treasurer, I have been meeting regularly with the Council of Financial Regulatorssomething my predecessor rarely ever did. I have been meeting with them because the times have demanded it and the times have been like this all year, just as we stated in the budget. Mr Morrison interjecting",47

112,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But he simply does not understand the magnitude of the challenge. That is why he blunders in here, recklessly, with these propositions and then throws into the middle of that a proposal to the Prime Minister: ‘Would you sack the Treasury Secretary.' How irresponsible! How reckless to throw that into the middle of a situation where we do actually have a global financial crisis, where what we absolutely need is confidence across the board and where the Australian people are looking for unity. He had the gall to claim that he was looking for bipartisanship, and when we brought out our package he said he would support it. There were statements, all on the record, in the days following of bipartisan support. But they all disappeared, because it was just phoney-phoney like the rest of his approaches in this House because there are no core values. The Leader of the Opposition does not actually believe in anything other than himself. That explains his progress through the political system. It explains his attempt to join the Labor Party. It explains the fact that he led the Republican Movement and now he has become a monarchist. Can you believe that? Somebody who led the Republican Movement is now a monarchist. He has no core values, because what he is really on about is personal political power. That is all that matters to him. But what matters to us on this side of the House is the national interest. I will tell you why the guarantee is so important. What we have seen in recent days have been very substantial interest rate cuts from a number of banks who have all cited this guarantee as a very significant influence in their decision to reduce interest rates for households and businesses and the rural sector. But of course if you are so out of touch, you just think that interest rate rises were overdramatised, as the Leader of the Opposition has said on a number of occasions. He does not actually live like ordinary people live; he does not actually understand that an interest rate rise of 25 basis points or a cut of 25 basis points or a cut of 80 basis points is really important to households and really important to business. That is because, once again, he does not understand. He does not understand how important the guarantee is to bringing down rates, to putting confidence back into the system, to getting behind Australian households, to getting behind Australian businesses. Of course, all he can do is to walk into this House with more slippery barrister talk, nitpicking and so on, but no substantial policy. But on Sunday his alternative policy was on display on the Insiders. So he wants a cap of $100,000 on bank deposits. That leaves 40 per cent of all deposits out of the system. I could not think of anything more reckless than that. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition thinks he knows all. He is unconcerned. He is moving on to his next nitpick somewhere, to construct his next phoney argument to somehow resuscitate himself before his colleagues. But we take these things seriously. That was demonstrated massively this morning at his press conference when he saidMr Robb interjecting",48

The problem is he does not actually have the values, and because he does not have the values, he does not have the commitment, he does not have the dedication. Now of course he is at odds with the Governor of the Reserve Bank again. What the governor said today does not seem to matter to him. This is what the governor said today: Steps in these directions, in the context of what other countries were doing, were sensible and the RBA supported them. He somehow thinks he knows more than that. I have read the speech and it is very important. Mr Turnbull interjecting",49

That is what we thought we had when we brought the package down. It is why we gave briefings to the opposition, briefings the likes of which the previous opposition never, ever received. I received one briefing in three years from the previous government, and I venture to say that my predecessors barely got that. We will take them into our confidence but not when they are behaving as recklessly as they are now-prepared to say anything and prepared to do anything to score a political point, but it is not even for the Liberal Party; it is just all for Malcolm. All of those backbenchers over there, as they get dispirited as time goes on, will understand what Malcolm is doing up the front: he is not there representing the Liberal Party, he is not there representing them, he is there looking after himself. That is what it is all about. It is all about Malcolm. As I said in the House the other day, it reminds me of the old Mark Twain saying: ‘All you need in life is ignorance and confidence.' And the Leader of the Opposition has got plenty of both-plenty of ignorance and plenty of confidence. But he has got one choice left. He can retrieve this situation, at least for the day. He can come back into the House straight after this debate and apologise to the Secretary of the Treasury for his reckless behaviour.",49

121,Ms JULIE BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Treasurer's shallow and unconvincing performance today was only matched by the Prime Minister's shallow and unconvincing performance in question time today when the Prime Minister was so unconvincing that he objected with such outrage at every question put to him and not once did he give a direct answer to a direct question. He equivocated, he ducked, he weaved. The Australian people are none the wiser about the advice that the government received from the Reserve Bank on the question of an unlimited guarantee for bank deposits. After a series of questions today to Prime Minister and to the Treasurer, the Australian public are none the wiser about this significant issue and the specific advice given to the government by the Reserve Bank. There is a lot at stake here. There are billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds at stake here. The government has been warned of the distortions that are now occurring in the market and the Prime Minister should be very clear, very concise and honest and give the utmost clarity around the circumstances that gave rise to this unprecedented decision to provide an unlimited bank guarantee for deposits. The Prime Minister had led the Australian public to believe that this significant announcement, this announcement on an unlimited government guarantee for deposits, was on the advice-the unequivocal, express advice-of the Reserve Bank. In fact, prior to question time today, the Prime Minister has literally clothed himself in the advice of the Reserve Bank. At his press conference on Sunday, 12 October, where he announced this unlimited bank guarantee, the Prime Minister said: The measures I've announced today are based on the advice of Australia's economic regulators. He said: The measures I've announced today have been the product of extensive deliberation between myself, the Treasurer and other Ministers who are members of the Strategic Policy and Budget Committee of the Cabinet. But, on the following days, he has said it to an even greater extent. He said on the Sixty Minutes program that evening: The decision was based on the advice from our regulators. He went on to say: … our advice as the Government comes from the regulators. In question time on 13 October, in response the to a question from me about the whole bank guarantee package, the Prime Minister said: … this measure has been recommended to the government by the Australian regulators-the Reserve Bank, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Treasurer. He went on to say to the Press Club on 15 October: Again we took this decisive action in close consultation with the regulators. In his address to business last Friday, he said: This brings us to the dramatic decisions of recent days, those announced by myself on Sunday and through close collaboration again with the regulaare tors and the Treasurer on the phone from Washington, and also with the other members of the strategic policy and budget committee of the Cabinet. The judgment we took, based on the advice of the regulators … So it is fair enough that the Australian people and the coalition should take the Prime Minister on trust in relation to the probity and the integrity of this decision on an unlimited bank guarantee. We accepted the statements and the assurances that the Prime Minister and cabinet were in close and regular and, indeed, as the finance minister said today, constant contact with the regulators throughout this international financial crisis. Today, however, we read on the front page of the Australian that that is not in fact what occurred. This is what was reported in the Australian: The Government ignored the RBA's strongly voiced concerns about the impact of an unlimited guarantee scheme in its rush to announce a guarantee of all deposits in Australian deposit-taking institutions on October 12. The report went on to say: The Government faces severe embarrassment that its emergency measures are now creating new problems, given that it refused to heed RBA advice at the time. Given that that statement appeared on the front page of the Australian newspaper, you would have expected that the Prime Minister would come into this parliament and explain to the parliament the confusion that has arisen in the mind of the Australian newspaper. How could the Australian newspaper get it wrong? The Prime Minister should come in and explain to the Australian people. When parliament opened at two o'clock today, we had no statement in explanation, no clarification from the Prime Minister. Never mind that the markets are in uproar about this. Never mind that the Australian public totally confused about whether or not the Prime Minister acted on the specific advice of the Reserve Bank. We heard not a word from the Prime Minister. However, in answer to the first question today from the Leader of the Opposition during question time, the Prime Minister said for the first time that, in fact, neither he nor any member of the strategic policy unit, nor anyone present on that day, actually spoke to the Reserve Bank. This is incredible. For the first time the Australian public was told that, in fact, neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer, who was in Washington, nor the Acting Treasurer-the Minister for Finance and Deregulation-spoke to the Reserve Bank. What happened to the constant contact, daily advice and collaboration with the Reserve Bank on the very day that the government met to make one of the most significant decisions of the life of the government-in fact, probably the only decision that the government has made? They did not contact the Reserve Bank; they did not seek the advice of the Reserve Bank; they did not get any written advice; they did not pick up the phone and speak to the governor, Glenn Stevens. The Reserve Bank is the regulator responsible for the systemic stability of the financial sector. This decision goes to the very heart of the systemic stability of the financial sector. The Reserve Bank is the regulator that the government should heed on this issue above all others. And yet the very regulator whose job it is to advise the government on precisely this issue is ignored. On the one issue that they should consult the Reserve Bank on above all others, they do not-they ignore it in the rush to get the photo opportuand nity and the cameras into the cabinet room. The Prime Minister does not roll his sleeves up; he pushes them up above his elbows. He puts Ken Henry on one side and Treasury officials on the other to get the photo opportunity. They do not have the time to pick up the telephone and ask the Reserve Bank its opinion. It seems that Kevin Rudd can ring every world leader on a constant basis. How many times has he been on the phone to Dominique Strauss-Kahn over the last few weeks? How many times has he been on the phone to Gordon Brown? He is on the phone to George Bush. He is ringing up Hank Paulson. But he does not ring the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia on the day that the government makes an unprecedented decision that puts at risk billions of dollars of taxpayer funds. What happened when the Prime Minister finally admitted today that he had not spoken to the Reserve Bank governor? Once his deception to the Australian people was revealed he did what has become standard practice for this Prime Minister. He hung someone else out to dry. He placed the Secretary of the Treasury squarely in the frame. Can you believe this? The Prime Minister has now said that, after the decision was made and they had had Swanny on the phone, the only question that was asked in a cabinet meeting specifically called on a Sunday to address this question of an unlimited bank guarantee was directed at the Secretary of the Treasury. cording to the Prime Minister at 2.05 in question time today, he asked Dr Henry: ‘Is the position being recommended here that the regulators?' He answered, ‘It was, and includes the Reserve Bank.' That is the extent of the inquiry made by the Prime Minister about one of the most significant decisions that this government has made one of the most important decisions that would impact on the stability and the confidence in the financial markets. Then the Prime Minister forgot the answer that he gave, because it was asked again about this unprecedented decision that the government had made. This time, at 2.21, in answer to another question from the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister's answer was: … at the time that the options which were then adopted were being considered by that committee of the government, the question was explicitly put to the Secretary to the Treasury, ‘Is this the advice of the financial regulators, including the Reserve Bank?' to which the answer was unequivocally, ‘Yes.' That is all that Dr Henry- (Time expired)",50
122,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If there is one thing that you can always guarantee about the opposition, living in denial, is that they will without exception walk both sides of the street. They will act for themselves, in their own interests, before the interests of the Australian community. They did it when they were in government and they continue to do it now that they are in opposition. They have learnt no lessons from their defeat at the last election. It is all about them and their politics; it is never about the public good or the national interest. We had 12 long years of that. That is exactly what this trumped up matter of public importance put forward today is all about. It is a weak and directionless attempt to smear the government, but instead Ac- what it does is create fear and doubt in the community, in the markets and in the banking sector. They are a weak opposition, diof vided in their own ranks. They are out of that touch. They are out of control. They are walking both sides of the street. They say on the one hand that they support Labor's necessary and vital Economic Security Strategy, which is taking strong, clear and decisive action to fight the global financial crisis, while at the same time the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition themselves do everything they can to undermine the economic strategy that we put forward. Our Economic Security Strategy will deliver at a time of great need for ordinary Australians, pensioners and families. This is something which the opposition actually find really funny because, you see, it does not even factor in their thinking that you could possibly put forward an Economic Security Strategy that actually deals with the real economy-that is, people: families and pensioners. They are not in the game of delivering for ordinary Australians, they are not in the game of delivering for first home buyers and they are certainly not in the game of bringing on vital infrastructure spending that supports the real economy and people's jobs and livelihoods. That is left up to us. That why we have been elected and that is the job we are going to do. In comparison, this is an opposition that does not know where it stands and that walks both sides of the street on economic policy, infrastructure policy, health policy and education policy. In fact, on any policy you will find opposition members walk on both sides of the street. Except for one. In fact the only policy which this opposition very clearly still stands for unambiguously and defends every single day is Work Choices. It is the only policy that opposition members are truly committed to retaining. Suddenly they go silent, because suddenly it dawns on them that that is exactly right. The only policy they unanimously, unambiguously defend in this place day in, day out is Work Choices. When it comes to every other policy, they all have separate views-whether it is the Leader of the National Party, whether it is the Leader of the Opposition or whether it is the backbenchers sniping from the back about their own views, they are all divided except for on one policy: Work Choices. That is, tragically for all Australians, an example of how walking on both sides of the street actually does some real harm; significant harm to the confidence of our economy and the confidence ordinary people have in what we are trying to do as a nation, as a country and as a parliament-that is what it should be-not just as a government. The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, has got it horribly wrong. He has got it wrong on the economics, he has got it wrong on the action needed, and he has got it wrong on what his role is in maintaining confidence and restoring confidence in the Australian economy. Again, he is just out of touch-he only thinks of himself; he does not understand what ordinary people needand he is out of control, because he only thinks of what he needs to do to survive. He is talks the economy down when all other leaders around the world are working together. That actually should be part of the responsibility and job of the Leader of the Opposition, but he does not do that. The central theme of the contribution the Leader of the Opposition made during the MPI debate today was he is right and everyone else is wrong-he is smarter than everyone else; everyone else should just get out of the way and let him get on with the business of what he thinks is his right and duty. He has got very little right at all, and I will come back to that point in a minute. What is very clear is that we are facing a global economic slowdown and that will impact on Australia. The shadow minister thinks his only role is to flap his gums in this debate, but he offers no contribution. The only thing that he has actually got half right is that there is an economic slowdown and it will impact on Australia. I will come back to that because the Leader of the Opposition did make a specific comment on it. It is clear that we now have a recession in the US, and we also face the possibility of a recession in Europe. The global financial system is experiencing its most significant upheaval in living memory. What does the Leader of the Opposition say in his rhetoric? He says that it is all just hyped up-this is somehow a hyped-up myth; this is somehow not correct. It does not matter where you turn, you can go through a whole list of world leaders and economic experts who all agree on this. In one way or another, they all say the same thing: we are facing a global financial crisis not seen possibly in history, possibly in the last hundred years but certainly since World War II. Australia is not immune from these developments, and that is the tragedy of this. But we are in a much better position to weather the storm than most other countries. Australians actually understand this. They are a bit smarter and more sophisticated than the opposition would give them credit for. Australians do understand this. They do not expect that their leaders in this country actually them that it is all just hyped up. They do not expect that they would actually work against government efforts to deliver key public policies and an Economic Security Strategy that will help them. Our May budget forecast that problems abroad would slow the Australian economy and impact on employment, and we have taken steps which were reflected in a carefully structured, carefully measured and conservative budget where we protected the surplus. We did that, very importantly, because we suspected, while we did not know its size or the impact it would have, the crisis that was before us. That is why we have been able to do this. The good news for Australia is that we are in a better position than most other countries because over a long period of time Labor governments have better regulated this country and made those tough decisions. We are the ones who set up the superannuation structures which give Australia a unique position in the world in terms of national savings. It has always been Labor governments which have put in place the sort of governance arrangements, often argued against by the conservatives, that are now delivering that somewhat better position compared to others around the globe. Our package does a number of things. It is clear, strong, decisive action introducing a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy that will strengthen Australia's economy and will support Australian households during this global financial crisis. We needed to act. People expected us to act, and that is what we have done. But what the opposition do not understand is that people expect them to act as well-they actually expect them to act responsibly and they expect the Leader of the Opposition to act responsibly as well. He almost feigned that for a brief moment. For just a brief moment he came in and almost acted responsibly by saying that he would tell support Labor's package. But since then he has spent his time, every breath he draws, undermining it, white-anting it and destroying the confidence that the Australian public has in what their government are doing to make sure that we can weather the storm before us. We are doing that not just in terms of the $10.4 billion package; we are doing it in terms of first home buyers and we are doing it in terms of infrastructure. We have always said that we are the party of nation building, and we are true to that commitment. We are not just committing the funds and the institutions that will deliver on this but also committing to bring those forward. Just for moment let us compare that to the utter hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition. When they were in government, we saw policy made on the run on a daily basis. There was no consultation with the community or anyone else. They operated directly against departmental advice, removing anyone who disagreed with them and silencing dissent. They spent any amount of money on a political outcome rather than a judgement. There is example after example of a do anything, say anything, spend anything reckless government-they were reckless when they were in government and they continue to be in opposition. The tragedy is that their single-minded mission to destroy the surplus has been a trick. Malcolm Turnbull has become the Australian Harry Houdini. Not only does he walk both sides of the street; he actually does a bit of a sleight of hand with both hands. With the left hand he steals the surplus and with the right he steals it all over again. If he had he would try to steal the surplus three times, which would have left the Australian government and the Australian public- (Time expired)",52
123,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What we have seen over the last couple of days is the obvious fact that this government has no capacity to manage an economy. Whether they be in good times or bad, Labor inevitably fail when it comes to economic management. Like every other Labor government around Australia and like its predecessors, this Labor government cannot manage an economy in good times or in bad. Today we have seen the extraordinary situation of the Prime Minister's pathetic attempt to explain away the Reserve Bank's concerns about the government's guarantee on bank deposits. When the government announced its stimulus package they verballed the Reserve Bank. The government said they had the Reserve Bank's support for the package in its detail, including the fact that the package was uncapped. They claimed that this had the support of the Reserve Bank and the regulators, but it is apparent from what we have seen in today's Australian that that was not true. That was never true. Indeed, the Reserve Bank has made it clear that their clear advice was ignored by the government. When they made this decision, in their mad rush to announce a guarantee for all deposits in Australia on 12 October, they completely ignored the concerns of the Reserve Bank. And when this came out into the open today, did the Prime Minister take it on the chin? Did the Prime Minister acknowledge that he had misled the Australian people? After asking the people to trust him and assuring the Australian people that he wanted to take them into his confidence, we found that he had not told them the truth. He told them that the regulators approved this package when a third hand, clearly they did not. Now, when it has come into the open today, what did the Prime Minister do? He blamed the staff. He did not blame the butler this time but a person no less senior than the Secretary of the Treasury. It was the fault of the Secretary of the Treasury for misleading and giving wrong advice to the government. It was the Secretary of the Treasury who misled the government and who provided advice which was incorrect. And as the government dithered and stammered their way through question time today it has become abundantly clear that this was an attempt to blame a senior respected public servant for the fact that the spin doctors had overstated the case and made claims which simply were not true. So what we have now is the Rudd Labor government not willing to take responsibility for their own actions and seeking to defame a respected public servant and suggest that he gave them advice which few people will really believe he ever did. The reality is that he knew what the problems were. The government was determined to seek to trump the opposition. They had, after all, rejected and ridiculed the idea of caps on guarantees. A few days earlier they had rejected and ridiculed the idea of guarantees at all. But bit by bit they had been forced to follow the guidance of the Leader of the Opposition-the policy advice provided by this side of the House-and come kicking and screaming to the reality of what had to be done. Now, during the dithering and stammering from the Prime Minister today what has come out quite obviously is that the government is about to do another backflip. There will be a cap on the level of the guarantee. It may be $1 million; it may be a little more than that. Above that you will have to pay a fee if you want to have the privilege of this guarantee. That is not what the Prime Minister announced when he released this stimulus package. This has been invented since that time. It is quite clear that the public believed the government when they said that there would be a guarantee on deposits, and many people have taken their deposits out of one institution and put them into one that the government said would be guaranteed. But now there is going to be a limit on that guarantee. What sort of compensation is the government going to pay to those people who were actually foolish enough to believe them when they said the guarantee would be unlimited now that it is clear that it is not going to be guaranteed? This whole package was always very poorly designed. Labor even bungled the guarantee. Many billions of dollars are invested in funds that do not have the privilege of the access to this guarantee. The nation's biggest mortgage fund, the $2.9 billion Challenger Howard Mortgage Fund, complained today that there has been a run on their deposits because they do not have the guarantee that is available to even quite small ing societies. There are many other organisations, like the solicitors investment mortgage companies and other organisations, which provide very worthwhile financial services. They do not have this guarantee. The government bungled it. And now they have also bungled the maximum amounts that are to be guaranteed. (Time expired)",55

Their desperation today was demonstrated by what they do best-and that is, play the man. Today they played the man when the Leader of the Opposition called for the resignation of Don Henry, the Secretary of the Treasury.

What we have done responsibly, sensibly and in a considered approach is to try and deal with the financial situation as ists today and to take a pre-emptive step to try and deal with it in the future. We began this in the 2008 budget, and with the wise use of a surplus built on savings we made sensible tax cuts and considered expenditure on costed commitments.",57
134,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The time for the matter of public importance has expired. NA AMENDMENT (EMPLOYMENT SERVICES REFORM) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 September, on motion by Mr Brendan O'Connor: That this bill be now read a second time.",57
135,Dr SOUTHCOTT,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 enables the government's new employment services, which will run from 1 July next year to 1 July 2012. Some of the changes in this bill are minor, but there are major changes to the compliance framework. The Job Network was introduced by the former coalition government in 1998. Since it was brought into replace the ailing Commonwealth Employment Service, unemployment has dropped from 8.1 per cent in May 1998 to a 33-year low of 3.97 per cent in February this year. While sound economic management and an environment of economic growth certainly played a major role, ultimately the reduction in unemployment was facilitated by an employment services system that had a focus on employment and reiterated the mutual responsibility of the job seeker to actively engage with the system supporting them. By having a firm but fair compliance regime that commits job seekers to actively seeking employment and engaging in activities that can help improve emit exployment prospects, the former government discouraged welfare dependency. As I have said previously, the Liberal and National parties support some of the elements of the government's proposed new system. For example, the blending of the employment programs is something that we would have done had we been re-elected; we think it is a good idea. We think that the concept of employment brokers and the $41 million innovation fund panel are both sensible reforms to the new employment services. In the minister's foreword to the discussion paper entitled The future of employment services in Australia, the Minister for Employment Participation states: The Job Network is no longer suited to a labour market characterised by lower unemployment, widespread skill shortages and a growing tion of job seekers who are highly disadvantaged and long-term unemployed. This has been the government's rationale for some of their changes to employment services-that the Job Network ‘is no longer suited to a labour market characterised by lower unemployment'-and it is hard to think of a document which has become out of date more quickly than this one. The new universal employment services model was designed at a time when the labour market was still strong. The work on this was done in February 2008, when we had the lowest unemployment in a generation. But now, six months later, we have had speculation in the media at the weekend that an additional 200,000 Australians may lose their jobs within the next 12 months. It has taken Australia the last six years to reduce unemployment by 200,000, yet in the space of one single year that achievement is set to be undone. The Liberal and National parties cannot support the new ‘no show, no pay' system which has been proposed by the government. We believe it will undermine the successful inroads the previous government made into long-term unemployment and welfare dependency. We are also concerned about the discretion which will be given under this legislation to the departmental secretary to undermine these hard-won reforms to welfare. Since the unemployment benefit was first introduced in 1945, Australians have had an expectation that those receiving benefits would be required to look for and accept work. It was the Chifley government that first introduced laws which said that if a job seeker were not taking reasonable steps to obtain employment then they would lose their benefit for between two and 12 weeks. Since then, the notion of mutual obligation has had broad community support, and it is consistent with our own values. Unemployment benefits are designed as a temporary propormeasure to help the unemployed when they require it, but with the right to receive this assistance comes a responsibility to do the right thing and look for work. Many groups were critical of the previous Howard government's approach to welfare reform, but this approach was important in breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and reducing the numbers of long-term unemployed. Under the latest round of Welfare to Work changes, according to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations' Labour market and related payments: a monthly profile, the number of long-term unemployed fell from 205,212 people in June 2006 to 146,533 by August 2008. This represents a drop of almost 30 per cent in just over two years, which makes it more surprising that the Labor Party has decided to introduce a much softer set of sanctions for those who do not attend Work for the Dole training or even a job interview. In the future, for those on Newstart, parenting payment or youth allowance with activity requirements, Labor will introduce a ‘no show, no pay' system which involves the loss of one day's benefit for those who do not turn up. To demonstrate how much of a departure this is for Labor, we should look at what they did when they were last in office. Under Paul Keating's Working Nation, not attending a job interview would see a job seeker's payment suspended for between two and six weeks. Under Labor's proposed new change, a job seeker who does not attend a job interview will lose just one day's payment$42.98 for someone on the single rate of the Newstart allowance. It will be possible to not turn up to six job interviews in a six-month period before a Centrelink review is triggered. The Labor Party have defended the ‘no show, no pay' concept by saying it is more work-like, but see what happens at your workplace if you start regularly not turning up to work without an excuse. It is unlikely you would simply be docked a day's pay. The problem with weakening the compliance regime is that it will be much less effective in changing behaviour for the positive. It will become a toothless tiger. At present, the most common reasons for an eightweek suspension of benefits are failing to attend an interview with your employment services provider, failing to comply with an activity agreement or failing to attend Work for the Dole. These will all be treated much more leniently under Labor's proposed new scheme. Looking internationally, countries similar to ours have recognised the importance of a strong compliance regime. In their July 2008 green paper on welfare reform, the British Labour government emphasised the importance of a stronger sanctions regime and, in fact, proposed losing a week's benefit for missing a job review or appointment and escalating the sanctions for failures after that. In the United States, it was Bill Clinton who declared ‘an end to welfare as we know it' and supported welfare reform which has dramatically reduced the numbers on American social security rolls. When the former Howard government introduced the Welfare to Work reforms in 2006, they were designed to reduce welfare dependency, establishing a patent link between receiving income support and actively seeking employment or, failing this, contributing back to the society that supports you. It was recognised at the time that there were still far too many long-term unemployed who appeared destined to remain on welfare indefinitely. Providing an opportunity for job seekers to gain skills and training through a mutual obligation activity helps with their employability and reintroduces them to a work-like environment. By tackling welfare dependency head on, we can break the cycle of welfare dependency by keeping job seekers on track and job ready. Mutual obligation is crucial to help break this cycle of welfare dependency. Not only does this help reduce the cost of welfare on society as a whole but it also assists in reducing the significant human cost of welfare dependency and intergenerational unemployment. Mutual obligation activities, such as Work for the Dole, help to make job seekers job ready. These activities can provide training and skills for job seekers, boosting their confidence. However, these requirements to participate were never intended to punish job seekers who did the right thing. Job seekers were entitled to miss three appointments over a 12-month period without a valid excuse before they would incur a financial penalty. If a job seeker had a legitimate reason for missing an appointment, they would not have a participation failure recorded. They would then be referred to Centrelink, who would determine whether there were in fact any additional factors that may have prevented a job seeker from participating. The Labour market and related payments report published monthly by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations shows a strong decrease in the overall numbers of long-term unemployed. In August 2008, there was a 14.4 per cent decrease in the number of long-term unemployed job seekers in receipt of either Newstart or youth allowance over the preceding 12 months. In human terms, that is 24,574 fewer long-term unemployed in the space of one year. That is an achievement the former coalition government is happy to take credit for. In meeting the objectives of reducing welfare dependency and reducing the numbers of long-term unemployed, the employment services system was working; it was effective. The compliance system was working; it was effective. Our Welfare to Work reforms helped to discourage the long-term unemployed from languishing on the dole queue and have provided the encouragement needed to improve their situation. Labor's new changes will herald the return of the dole bludger. In striking a balance between engagement and sanction, the government have got the balance wrong. As a result, the compliance regime will be much less effective. Going into the future, we will see, sadly, increased numbers of long-term unemployed if the Labor government have their system for employment services passed by this parliament intact. This new system is farcical, providing no incentive for people to do the right thing. It will undoubtedly result in an increase in non-compliance as some people decide that losing a day's welfare$42.98 for a single person on Newstart-is worth a day at the beach or that it is financially more beneficial doing three hours work in the cash economy at the local pub or babysitting. These changes proposed by the government do not encourage people to do the right thing. People who are in receipt of welfare have an obligation to the wider community that supports them. They have a moral obligation to look for work and, if they are unable to find work, they should contribute to the society that supports them. The coalition will be opposing this bill and moving amendments during the consideration in detail stage. These amendments have been circulated in my name. By weakening the compliance regime, we are likely to see an increase in intergenerational unemployment, where children follow their parents onto the dole queue. A strong compliance regime is about tough love but it helps people get out of the poverty trap. The Rudd government need to rethink their lenient approach, which will encourage high levels of welfare dependency and sadly see the numbers of long-term unemployed continue to rise again.",57
136,Mr BUTLER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"It is a pleasure to follow a fellow South Australian member of this House. It is well known that the member for Boothby is a clever and thoughtful member of the House of Representatives. I can only conclude that he had that particular speech and contribution forced upon him because it is well known that he is capable of something much better and much more thoughtful than that backward-looking, fairly base contribution to this very complex area of public policy. It was replete with dog-whistle politic terms such as ‘dole bludger' and ‘tough love'. As a fellow South Australian I certainly expected something more thoughtful and clever than that. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 is yet another example of our fundamentally different approach to the opposition's approach to the world of work and to creating a meaningful productivity and participation agenda for the future of Australia. You see that different approach reflected in a range of policy areas that interlink. Firstly, it is reflected in the education revolution. We want to make sure that our kids grow up as well-rounded citizens and are equipped with the range of skills they are going to need for jobs in the future-maths and science skills and basic numeracy and literacy skills. You see it also in this government's realisation that it has a role in lifting labour ticipation. The need for that role is nowhere more evident than in women's labour participation, an area that stalled for years under the previous government. Under the previous government the percentage rate for participation got stuck in the high 50s. The rate was well below OECD averages, in spite of 17 years of significant economic and employment growth. The rate for women at childbearing ages was especially low by OECD standards. It was 10 per cent below the labour participation rates for women in the UK and Canada and 15 per cent below the labour participation rates for women in Scandinavia, yet nothing was done by the previous government. We know that, without family-friendly policies, the market does impose a glass ceiling on women's participation. That is why this government-interlinking with all the other different elements of our productivity and participation agenda-has begun to look at paid maternity leave options, has increased benefits for families who require child care for their under-five-year-olds while attending work, has expanded the number of childcare places and has lifted the childcare tax rebate. This government is also looking seriously, for the first time in a dozen years in this country, at the work-life balance and what government measures are needed to improve the capacity of families to balance different aspects of their lives. You see profound differences between the industrial relations policies of the government and those of the opposition. This government is committed to implementing its Forward with Fairness policy, a policy that was clearly articulated to the Australian people before the last election and that is in ab- gram. solute contrast to the position that was adopted by the opposition before the 2004 election. This, of course, is a debate for another day-a debate that we on this side of parthe House very much look forward to engaging in. You see it also in the area of vocational training. This is perhaps the greatest supplyside failure of the previous government in the labour market. It is not as if we did not see the skills shortage locomotive coming some years back. One estimate says that Australia in 2016 will be short some one-quarter of a million vocationally trained qualified workers. The previous government, instead of developing a meaningful and practical response to this challenge, engaged in petty ideological squabbles with state governments. It worried more about where young people were trained than how many were trained and with what skills. Our approach is fundamentally different to that. The 2008 budget delivered on election promises from the Labor Party last year. It is delivering $1.9 billion over five years and 630,000 new VET places for Australian people. That already very significant number was increased in last week's Economic Security Strategy to 700,000 places over five years, amounting to a commitment of over $2 billion over that time. Importantly, in that security strategy there was an injection of an extra $187 million in 2008-09, or 56,000 extra VET places, totalling 113,000 VET places funded by this year's budget. That builds on the huge demand that has already been shown to be out there in the six months since the April 2008 announcement of our Productivity Places Program. Already 50,000 Australians are enrolled in that program. A very pleasing statistic is that some 1,000 participants referred by employment service providers have already obtained jobs after graduating from the Productivity Places ProFor today's purposes, you also see the fundamental difference in the important job of helping Australians get off welfare and back to work. This is familiar territory for Labor-as the member for Boothby helpfully outlined-stretching back to the Chifley government. Mutual obligation in a meaningful sense was introduced by the Labor Party during the Hawke and Keating governments. It was the Labor Party that introduced an end to unconditional welfare entitlements. It was the Labor Party that introduced a meaningful requirement for recipients to actively seek work, enshrining it in the 1991 Social Security Act. And it was the Labor Party that developed a sophisticated mutual obligation concept that was enshrined in the 1994 Working Nation program, putting a stronger obligation on participants to accept a reasonable job offer and increasing penalties for failing to meet various obligations. In stark contrast to the case management approach of Working Nation, particularly seen in the jobs compact for the long-term unemployed, the Howard government's version of mutual obligation was harsh and ultimately counterproductive. The Howard government's approach was punitive, even where circumstances might not necessarily warrant punishment. The Howard government's approach showed a lack of balance between reward and punishment to promote participation. Ultimately, the Howard government's approach led to a displacement of the problem to the welfare sector and the charitable sector. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to the impact of the eight-week suspension of payments after three strikes. Presumably, the introduction of that measure was intended to increase compliance. If that was the case, that aspect of the Howard government's program was an abject failure. Penalties doubled from 200607 to 2007-08 across Australia. In my electorate of Port Adelaide, penalties more than tripled, the most obvious evidence of nonget compliance with the system. Compliance plummeted after the introduction of a onesize-fits-all suspension system by the previous government. Suspension saw the recipient not only lose money but also disengage from the participation system. There was, bizarrely, no participation obligation during the period of suspension. In the minister's employment services review, the government received countless submissions detailing the arbitrary impact of the previous government system. The previous government's focus on compliance without support ignored the characteristics of job seekers today, and this was a feature of many submissions to the employment services review, and I would like to draw the House's attention to a couple of those. The Australian Council of Social Services drew the government's attention to these facts: - Although the skills required by employers have risen, most jobless people on working age income support payments have a Year 12 education or less. - A growing proportion has not experienced stable employment for a year or more. For example, over 150,000 people have received Newstart Allowance for more than two years. That is why our government matches a new compliance system with a meaningful approach to vocational training, particularly for the long-term unemployed. The Brotherhood of St Laurence said: Demand for low-skilled labour has declined both in Australia and overseas. This is evident from the data that shows that nearly three-quarters of new jobs in the period 1990–2003 were taken up by university graduates. Only one in eight of the jobs went to job seekers without post-school qualifications … Again this stresses the degree to which the characteristics or the demographics of employment services recipients have changed in recent years. The impact on those who had payments suspended was also a feature of a number of submissions received by the government. The National Welfare Rights Network told us: The relationship between this penaltythe eight-week suspensionand major dislocation, including homelessness, relationship breakdown, increased mental stress, illness, violence and crime is both categorical direct. Homelessness Australia reported on some research undertaken by the University of New South Wales which found: … 30 per cent of people who underwent an 8 week “breach” lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing. The legacy of the Howard government in getting people back to work is best reflected in the statistics for the long-term unemployed. As we know, there was over the last 10 or so years very significant employment growth in the Australian economy on the back of the resources boom. But, if we look at the figures for those who were unemployed for more than five years, we see that between 1999 and today-the peak period of the resources boom-those numbers have increased from 74,000 back in 1999 to over 110,000 today, or, more relevantly perhaps, from one in 10 persons unemployed for over five years in 1999 to almost one in four now. It is not as if the previous government was not warned about the consequences of the compliance system it introduced. The former shadow minister, Senator Wong, now responsible for other policy areas, made a number of speeches predicting that exactly what has come to pass would come to pass. I have read those speeches, and I pay tribute to her for keeping these issues in the public domain and ensuring that, on coming to government, the Labor Party undertook the employment services review and is now seeking to introduce the reforms that it is. Australia's unemployed and the Australian economy more generally need a new approach, and that is what we are getting from Minister O'Connor: a new, $3.9 billion employment services program to start on 1 July next year-a system that will be responsive to today's circumstances of lower unemand ployment, very deep skill shortages and a pool of unemployed characterised by disadvantage and high needs such as we have not seen many years. After an intensive period of consultation with the community, the government is introducing a new compliance regime, a regime that is set out in this bill. The regime will apply to all job seekers with participation requirements in receipt of Newstart and youth allowance, parenting payment and special benefit including parents. The new compliance regime restores balance to the system. It remains based squarely on the philosophy of mutual obligation, a concept supported by the Labor Party for many years, but it is a system recognising two realities. Firstly, it recognises that individual circumstances in this area do vary; and, secondly, it keeps front of mind that the goal of the system is to increase participation, not punish for punishment's sake. In contrast to the previous government's one-size-fits-all approach in this area this bill calibrates the system's response to, firstly, the seriousness of the offence and, secondly, the willingness of the person to return to activity or participation immediately. This bill retains the eight-week suspension for refusing a suitable job offer or for a series of missed appointments or activities but it recognises a series of lesser offences not recognised in the previous regime with a much more immediate and much better calibrated response. The first one is the no-show no-pay failure, which treats the recipient effectively as if they were employed. If you miss a day's activity, for example, Work for the Dole, then you lose a day's pay. This is an immediate penalty in contrast to the delayed response in the old regime. Secondly, there is a similar system in missing appointments such as with employment service providers. For those whose payments are suspended for eight weeks due to a serious failure, incentives are built into encourage redemption and improvement in their behaviour. To avoid the nation's government continuing to simply shift cases of severe disadvantage to our already overstretched charity sector, more meaningful financial hardship provisions are built into this bill. While retaining the concept of mutual obligation at the core of our social security system, this bill introduces a 21st-century compliance regime to complement the training and participation opportunities presented through the Productivity Places Program. The current compliance system introduced by the previous government is broken. The statistics bear that out. This bill presents the solution and I commend the bill to the House.",60
137,Mr TUCKEY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (5.16 pm)The member for Port Adelaide chose to commence his presentation to this parliament with some derogatory comments about the previous speaker. Might I say, from one who has been here a long time, when you learn to make a speech without reading every word of it you will have the opportunity to give advice to others. It seems to be now a pattern within this parliament that even every answer to a question is pre-scripted and some of the jokes that are included are as flat as the floor in this parliament. The reality isMr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",64
138,Mr TUCKEY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"The parliamentary secretary interjects that it is the status of the questions. I am a great watcher of questions and when I hear question after question after question asked for a simple response of factual matters which the minister concerned should know and understand as part of his job and there is total obfuscation one can only put one reason on that: either they are ashamed of the figures and the reaction thereto or in fact they do not know-they did not ask. In fact, it is the case with this particular measure, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008, that after months of doing nothing the Rudd government is starting to do a few things. I think Australia would be better off if it stopped doing anything, if it went back to doing nothing. The evidence is that its recent and dramatic responses, while seeming okay in principle, have holes all over them, which of course are being demonstrated by forensic questions from the opposition. Here again we have an initiative based primarily on fixing something that ain't broke. The old system addressing unemployment, which was totally bureaucratic, was clearly not working and there were one million people out of work. The economic circumstances inherited by the Howard government were such that there was no work for them. When one sets out to address unemployment issues and the administration thereof, the first thing is to get your economy right so that people have a choice of jobs and no reason to be unemployed. It is a fact that at this time that circumstance still applies, certainly in my electorate. While I understand the need for skilled operators in many areas, take the case of Cooperative Bulk Handling in my electorate, which regularly takes on seasonal workers for the receival of grain at their numerous loading points, the ‘bins' as we know them. They take people who are not experienced in that work. The training is provided by the employer and probably takes a few hoursthey learn to operate certain equipment and away they go. It used to be part-time work for university students, who do not seem to be available or interested these days. But as I found out in talking to the executive of Cooperative Bulk Handling the other day, they are still desperately looking for people who will turn up. I had a similar call from a hotelier known to me. From my recollection he wanted people to turn up to service his bedrooms and to work behind the bar. I know that there is a bureaucracy now that demands the right to give all these people a certificate-to do what? Make a bed as they should be doing at home? Or, for instance, to work behind the bar? On my experience of 30 years the people attended and said, ‘I've never done this job before,' and you would say, ‘Okay'-and this was the simple response under the award at that time-‘you have the opportunity to work for x weeks as green labour', which paid a salary three-quarters, I think it was, the full salary. Of course, let me remind the previous speaker-if he were around to listen-that when he talks about female participation, when I entered the hotel industry in 1956 in Western Australia women got paid the same wage as men. That was a unique circumstance at the time. We never, ever wanted to discriminate between one and the other because we made our judgements on their skills at doing the job. They usually learnt their job in a week or so and as soon as they showed some competence they went up onto full pay or the otherwise prevailing limit-but anybody who took the limit was clearly unsuitable. There are now all these jobs that you have to get a certificate for when the training period can be a matter of hours. The ‘skills' in those days required people to be capable of adding up because the cash registers that were available were the press-down type. Today, as anyone would experience going into a hotel and asking how much the round of drinks delivered cost, the bar operative has to go back and press the relevant buttons on the till to find out how much they are going to charge you. If you are drinking with a group and you spend a fair bit of time there, you walk out with a pocketful of small change because they cannot even work out how to handle that at the same time. That is when they have a certificate, so what is the good of that? What have we achieved with this argument of skills when skills are something that can be successfully achieved on the job? All of the people who worked for me behind the bar frequently had no secondary education to speak of at all-but they could add up. They did so in their head and were able to present a customer with a round of drinks of any variety and tell them how much on the spot. When they got back to the till, they knew how to handle that. Here we are with all these job opportuniof ties and we have the member for Port Adelaide telling us how sympathetic we have to be for people who presently have been unable to find the jobs that are offering. If this legislation passes, we are going to weaken the penalties that apply to people who do not try to get or do not want a job. Much employment is very simple and, while one can constantly talk up skills, one of the major demands I know of is for semiskilled people or people who are prepared to learn basic tasks associated with many opportunities in employment. These days even someone who would apply to one of my farmers wanting machinery operators-people to drive headers and that-can be trained very quickly because things are computerised. The other day it was brought to my attention by an employer, who was desperate for staff and willing to train them on the job, that a person turned up and said to him-he repeated this story to me-‘I'm here because I have to be here. I do not want the job. The job will mean that, after tax and all the other things that other, committed people pay, I will be literally no better off financially than work? I am on unemployment benefits. You can employ me if you like but, let me tell you, you won't like me when I get the job.' He at least was honest; a lot of others turn up in that circumstance and the next day have a bad back. They manage to injure themselves in the first week and then become another burden on society because, of course, they will be supported by insurance policies paid for by the general public. But this fellow left. He went back to Centrelink and said, ‘I attended.' I do not think this employer rang up and put him in. They are too frustrated and too busy because they have to interview someone else. That is an example that is ever recurring. Why should there be sensitivity to that individual? Why should the member for Port Adelaide say, ‘You can't call them dole bludgers'? That is what this bloke was, and there is a legion of those left. I think these matters need to be understood. When there were a million unemployed and people were desperately seeking work, there was a requirement for compassion. In the present work environment, anybody can get a job. What are we doing? We are talking about bringing South Sea islanders into pick fruit-I am not critical of this-yet we are talking about changing the regime of how unemployed people are dealt with if and when they refuse the job as a fruit picker. I wrote down that the member for Port Adelaide talked about ‘calibrating the system's response'. If you are fit, able and within a reasonable distance of jobs, why do you need to be calibrated? What is the purpose of a Job Network operator calibrating someone who does not want to work? Why should Australian taxpayers and all those people who up until recently were referred to in this House as ‘mortgage stressed' and ‘both having to be employed just to meet their commitments to a home mortgage' pay tax to support a person who does not want to There was the tragic case of a family with seven children who received over $700 a week in welfare benefits and their children were breaking into premises to get food. Why? When the authorities checked out that house they found there was not one scrap of food in it. What is the score? Why are we here wanting to fix something that ain't broke and wanting somehow to prove that that is a positive response from a new government? All of the people I know desperately want workers. They do not mind what workers' employment backgrounds are as long as they turn up. I have watched it. I have also watched our side of politics do what I think were very stupid things. I still have in my pocket a licence that allows me to drive a heavy truck. I used to have one that allowed me to drive a road train. I did that in the years before I got a letter in the mail to say I was no longer entitled to drive a road train-not because I had forgotten how to do it but because I was not doing it consistently. Next they will be writing to people with pushbikes saying, ‘You haven't ridden a pushbike for a few years; you'd better go to be retrained before you get on one.' And you wonder why there is a shortage of seasonal workers. One contacted me and said, ‘For three months every year I was employed driving a heavy truck.' He was driving a heavy truck-a highly skilled operator who for other parts of the year, as is common in my electorate, took other seasonal work. He knew exactly what his job was with three different employers every year, and one of those jobs was to drive a truck, delivering grain to the silo or carting super back from the works. Now they have taken his licence off him-that was done when we were in office-because he only worked three months a year. It was going to cost him $2,000 to go back and be retrained. For what? When you talk about skills, I can take you out in the country and introduce you to people who are highly skilled-welders with all sorts of equipment they have picked up during their lives-and many of them are forbidden to go onto many workplaces today because they have not been trained. Then, of course, we had the Deputy Prime Minister telling us about her great training achievements. The member for Port Adelaide told us there are 50,000 people enrolled in training places. He might have told us how many of them are in their fourth or fifth training place so that they can avoid going work, because I know of people in that category. There is a fundamental rule in all of and that is that this parliament has a responmember sibility to protect the people who go to As for dual households, I have heard all the arguments saying, ‘I'm a single parent and therefore I have special problems.' My children both work and have exactly the same problems, because they are both at work during the day. They are taxed heavily and they get nothing by way of welfare. The reality is that those people have rights. The average Australian taxpayer has rights and this parliament has the responsibility to see that people for whom work is available and who are physically able are in work. If they are not physically able, they should be on a disability pension. They should not be on unemployment, necessarily. Profitable businesses have closed in my electorate because they could not get anybody to work in them. That is the circumstance. Try and get an Australian to work in a meat works these days. Under the silly rules we operate under-and we were no betteryou have to bring in foreign workers on 457 visas and pay them more than the award that is applicable to the Australian workers. You can imagine how the Aussie workers feel about that! That is how silly these issues are when we come to employment. But, if there is unemployment, I can name two meat works in my electorate that will put on another shift when those people turn up, and they will train them. When you see a meat chain in operation, the skills can be very, very basic. You stand in one place-it is not the happiest of work-and you are likely to put a single cut in an animal carcass as it passes by. Why, then, do we have to get to a situation that makes it easier for people to avoid work? That is the proposal within this legisto lation. You have heard the previous speakers and you have heard the second reading speech. I am astounded, nevertheless, that this, they made something of the fact-and the for Port Adelaide repeated it-that work. the proportion of people on unemployment benefits who have been unemployed for more than five years has increased. Of course it has. The unemployment numbers have dropped from seven, eight or nine per cent to four per cent, so of course that proportion will be greater. But I find the figures astounding because they are inconsistent with those provided to me that relate to the changes since the introduction of the measures that are now to be changed. In 2006 there were 105,000 long-term unemployed and by 2008 there were 146,000. If you want to start being selective about the number of people unemployed for more than five years, there is no reason in Australia today for a person to be unemployed. There is work available in different categories, but it will not necessarily be in whatever category they choose. This place should not be changing this legislation. The other legislation is working. If you are going to do as I explained and walk into employment interviews and make sure you are not given the job, if you do not turn up or if you toss a coin and say, ‘It's a beautiful day-I can go to the beach and it'll cost me 42 bucks,' that is a judgement issue. But when you know that you should be out there seeking work or you are going to lose eight weeks pay, that is a different judgement issue altogether-and that is what this legislation proposes. But again, if it ain't broke, why fix it? If it is compassion for people who will not go out and look for a job when they are available on every street corner, why should we be changing the legislation? If it is going to cost working Australians more tax-those working families whom we never hear about anymore-and it must cost them more with all this calibration, the additional interviews et cetera, or if it will deny them benefits because the surplus is all gone, then is that fair? Is it fair that we, the Parliavider ment of Australia, support legislation because the government wants to be seen to be doing something where change is not necessary? These are the criticisms I have of this legislation. We do not need it. It weakens the discipline on people who wish to be supported by the taxpayer to go and find work. It is a tragedy, because the other solution is to dramatically lower the payments they get, which makes work more attractive. I do not agree with that. If a person is genuinely out of work, they should get fair compensation. (Time expired)",64
139,Mr HAYES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"If we are serious about getting people into jobs, we should be seriously looking at the system that underpins Job Search, which, quite frankly, is the mechanism to assist people to help secure employment. It is obviously our aim and objective to help those who are disadvantaged by assisting them, where we can, into gainful, paid employment. If we are serious about getting people into work, we need to actually have an effective compliance regime in order to encourage people to look for work. Regrettably, sometimes people do need to be led. I do not think we need to make any apology for saying that there must be certain incentives to encourage people to undertake their part of the mutual obligation package, and that is taking all possible steps to seek gainful employment. The reality is that the former government presided over what was a rather harsh and counterproductive compliance regime that certainly penalised harshly when people did not comply. As a matter of fact, if one failed to comply on a third occasion under their regime, this would eventuate in one not receiving welfare payments for eight weeks. Under the eight-week regime, when a non-compliance penalty was triggered, a job seeker was not required to have any further contact with the employment service proor Centrelink for that whole period. So, if someone was going to be in breach, what occurred then was that they would think there was no point doing anything else and that they may as well just sit back and do nothing. That is precisely what the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 is designed to address. It is that ‘do nothing' approach that the minister has sought to change in a constructive way to get the focus back on what we should be doing for job seekersand that is helping them into gainful employment. Therefore, I say that the current system is inadequate as a deterrent. It is certainly in its early stages too harsh on non-compliance and the penalties are too late. Under the current arrangements, the job seeker, as I said, could miss a fortnight's participation before any action was taken at all. If non-compliance is going to be addressed in any way, we simply cannot have a situation where up to a fortnight goes missing before action is taken. What we are trying to do through this legislation is bring about some real, mutual accountability. We know what our accountability is from a government's perspective, and that is to take all possible steps to assist people to find employment. But we are also trying to instil in the job seeker the obligation that they must take all reasonable steps to comply and, in so doing, to find a suitable job. When you think about it, if a job seeker fails to turn up to a job interview or something else that has been mandated under the Job Network scheme, nothing happens. On the next occasion that that same person fails to turn up, nothing happens. That person could then be complying and doing everything else but, if something occurs within that period of 12 months and they then miss a third job interview, that job seeker then incurs the eight-week penalty. It certainly does not equate with the mutual obligation I was speaking about. It does not draw the job seeker's attention on the first two occasions to the fact that not turning up is pretty serious. It does not do that. It simply waits for the final trigger to occur and then down comes the guillotine-‘You will now incur an eight-week penalty and you will go off welfare payments for that period.' If you listened to what the former speaker had to say-and I did labour through that speech-you would have heard him say that he did not think we needed to change anything in the current system. He thought it was fair and that people should be punished if they do not turn up and that this is what drives people into employment. That sort of stuff fails to equate with the fact that in the last two years these penalties have been in operation, 2006-07 and 2007-08, there has been a doubling in the number of people who have received eight-week penalties. Sure, this legislation has really meted out the punishment and, sure, there has been a doubling in the number of people who have incurred such punishment under the legislation, but what is not clear is: has this actually contributed to putting people into employment? The last speaker also indicated that there has been a significant reduction in unemployment over recent years, and that is quite true. It is pretty clear to me that what has led to that is a resources led economic recovery, particularly in some states, that has significantly increased employment opportunities. That is not necessarily right across the board, however. I can indicate to the House that in my own electorate of Werriwa at the moment the rate for youth unemployment still stands at 23 per cent. There is a mining boom out there. There is a resource led recovery taking place in Western Australia and Queensland. But 23 per cent of the young people in my electorate have tried unsuccessfully to gain employment. That is the real figure. That is the real world. That is what we should be working on. We should be encouraging and assisting these people into proper employment. We should not do that to simply reduce the unemployment numbers but to give them what a job gives to people: a sense of self worth and a sense of genuine commitment. Hopefully, that in turn will lead to value adding for our community generally. We know that the compliance system has done nothing to reduce unemployment. Despite the doubling of the numbers that has occurred in the last couple of years, there has been no improvement in the attendance at Job Network interviews, there has been no improvement in the attendance rate at customised assistance and we know that this eight-week penalty does not act as an incentive to get people into employment. What we have been told, and this is from the Welfare Rights Network, is that the relationship between the eight-week non-payment penalty and major dislocation, including homelessness, relationship breakdown, increased mental stress, illness, violence and crime, is both categorical and direct. That is borne out when we consider the people who we are applying this mandatory provision to. Research conducted by the University of New South Wales Social Policy Research Centre has found that up to 20 per cent of people who underwent an eight-week breach lost their accommodation or were forced to move to less appropriate housing. We are not talking about people of means-people who are in the circumstances of being able to move or simply weather an eight-week break. Let us get this straight for this House: we are talking about the people who are least able to move and least able to find employment at the moment-hence they are on the programs that they are. We must appreciate the reality of that. In terms of my own locality, Werriwa, not all that long ago I held a homeless seminar. What I sought to do was to bring together the homeless service providers, a number of charities, some churches and the New South Wales Police. I also brought along a number of kids that I have met from time to time who live on the streets in Campbelltown, Liverpool et cetera. It was a significant cise to bring those people together. While we have this mining boom and while we have a significant number of jobs being generated in the resource based industries, there is a level of disadvantage that operates in our communities. I know it for a fact. In people I mentioned, I also invited on that occasion the local media. They were not there to simply take pictures of an event. Rather, they too have a responsibility, in my opinion, to not only carry a story but be part of the solutions, not covering things up. As a consequence, they have stayed consistently on this campaign to address the levels of disadvantage throughout the Campbelltown, Camden and Liverpool areas. While going through that exercise, I learnt a number of things. Firstly, of those people who persistently struggle to find employment, the figures show that 15 per cent of job seekers who get that eight-week penalty have a mental illness, while five per cent have an unstable housing situation. What we are doing is adding to their problems. The three strikes and you are out policy for welfare dependency is quite frankly penalising the most vulnerable in our society. There cannot be a punishment just for punishment's sake. There has to be something that is an incentive. That is what this legislation is about: providing a positive incentive. If you fail to turn up and fulfil your obligations, as opposed to waiving the first occasion or the second occasion and bringing the axe down on the third occasion, your payments are held back until you re-enter the system. People understand that. It is like ‘no work, no pay'; it is ‘no show, no payment'. If someone is on the network and has given undertakings, including attending various job interviews, and they fail to turn up and do not have a reason, those people's payments will be suspended until they live up to their obligations. That is a fair system. People out exer- there understand that. They do not understand a system that says ‘three strikes and you're out' regardless of when and where those strikes occur over any 12-month period; a system that penalises people eight weeks of their payment. The financial impact addition to the of all this is great. Two weeks ago, I spent a morning in a soup kitchen that operates in Liverpool. I know that we do not talk about soup kitchens today, but let me tell you: they are real. I spent a number of hours out there with Pastor Gino Zucchi. He runs the Church of the Crossroads-called that, of course, because it is located at a crossroads. For a lot of people, this is their only real meal a day. I spoke with a lot of people who rode pushbikes to get there. I spoke to people who had travelled from as far away as Fairfield to get there. This is a community thing. These people are not going for the free meal. They are going there for other reasons, such as the social interaction. Pastor Gino Zucchi's program has people who can actually help people find jobs, work through the system, make contacts and write letters for employment. It is certainly more than just a soup kitchen. Just before I came down here-I should have prepared a bit earlier, I think-I asked Pastor Zucchi what he thought about the passage of this particular legislation. He said: ‘It would be ideal to have clients still participating in programs that enable them to find the appropriate employment because that is the real aim: to get people in employment-not a punishment regime. The reality is that it is often dependbarriers ants and housing arrangements that suffer.' What Pastor Zucchi said is precisely what the University of New South Wales and the research I quoted earlier said. People who are at the sharp end and who are out there working with disadvantaged people-trying to get them into employment and to give them a life and a future not only for them but for their families-know what the reality of this is. We are trying to have people comply. We are absolutely single-minded in that the compliance regime must be fair, decent and reasonable. I would invite members here to apply this sort of standard when considering this legislation as if it were applying to our own kids out there. Those 23 per cent of people all have parents, and hopefully their parents care for them. We are genuinely trying to give those people a future. To have a regime that is simply penalty based for the sake of being penalty based does not put people into employment. A mining boom and all those things will take care of one area of our workforce and we certainly like to see all efforts going to increasing employment opportunities. But under this particular piece of legislation we are targeting those levels of disadvantage in our community and those people who are struggling. We do need to take the view of caring as if the people we are talking about were our own kids. We would want our own kids to be treated with fairness and decency and not to be subjected to something that is so punishment based that it becomes incomprehensible. I also took the opportunity to have a talk to the Executive Officer of Macarthur Diversity Services, Karin Vasquez, who informed me they are very concerned that their organisation has many clients who have been repeatedly non-compliant. They see those people within their organisation as having severe to work. She said: ‘Centrelink asking people why they are not complying is an important and necessary policy shift. For example, one of our clients is able to work in many respects, however an intellectual developmental delay affects his ability to comply.' This is something I really was not aware of. Until today I was not aware that Centrelink does not go out and ask people why they have not complied because, under this act, Centrelink is not required to. Unfortunately the three triggers are the magical things that trigger non-compliance and penalty. This onesize-fits-all approach is hardly a pathway to employment. It is penalty first, and opportunity is hopefully somewhere down the track. The idea of Centrelink having discretion to sit down and go through these compliance regimes is an added bonus. That was certainly in the mind of the Executive Officer of Macarthur Diversity Services. This is a significant piece of legislation and I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)  journed.

140,Mrs IRWIN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 have been presented as delivering Labor's promised education revolution. Together with computers in schools, trades training centres and the educational tax refund, they represent significant improvements to parts of our nation's education systems. These are welcome measures but they are hardly a revolution. The Schools Assistance Bill sets out the priorities of the government through the national partnership payments as improving the quality of teaching, raising outcomes in disadvantaged school communities and delivering a new era of transparency to guide par2008 ents, teachers and policymakers in making the best decisions. But in line with the commitments given before the 2007 election, the existing distriBILL 2008 bution of funds between private and public schools will remain in place until 2012. In her second reading speech, the Minister for Education said: BILL 2008 If this country is to succeed in the 21st century we need a schooling system which delivers excellence and equity for every child in Australia. She went on to say: This is only possible if the community is confident that governments are applying the same principles of excellence and equity to all Australian schools, regardless of their location or the sector of which they are a part. But we will have to wait four more years before we make a start on addressing the issue of equity in all Australian schools. Over the 12 years of the Howard government, we saw the share of Commonwealth school funding going to public schools drop from 43 per cent to 35 per cent. Real Commonwealth grants to public schools grew by 68 per cent, while grants to private schools grew by 137 per cent. There is nothing in this legislation which would redress that imbalance and, indeed, there is no guarantee that the funding gap will not widen over the next four years for which the Howard government's program is to be locked in. We will still have SES funding and indexation. In fact, we can expect to see annual grants to private schools increase by a further three per cent while grants to public schools fall by two per cent over that four-year period, something that the minister describes as applying ‘the same principles of quality and accountability, excellence and equity that have shaped our national reform agenda'. It seems to me that the national reform agenda has been put on hold for four years, and the real education revolution is a long, long way off-that is, unless we take those parts of the bill which provide for the five activities that are essential to achieving transparency in Australian schooling. These are national testing, national outcome reporting, the provision and publication of individual school information, and reporting to parents. These activities are to be central to the national education agreement to be negotiated with the states and finalised later this year. The suggestion is that poorer performing schools, which it is assumed are in socially and economically disadvantaged communities, will receive additional resources to improve their performance-that is, to achieve greater equity and outcomes for students in those areas. But the Prime Minister added his own suggestion: that if some schools are not performing this encourages parents to, as he colourfully put it, ‘walk with their feet; that's exactly what the system is designed to do'. We need to ask if that is the real agenda. it to conduct testing and national outcome reporting in order to identify areas of need and allocate additional resources to those areas? I would think that would be a sensible agenda and would mark a return to needs based funding. Or is it to promote a competitive education system where parents in a position to make choices about their children's schooling may select from a smorgasbord of educational offerings? I have to ask: where is the equity and social inclusion in that proposal? And where does that line up with the reported comments of the minister that ‘we are on about the performance and quality of every school'. It is not hard to see why there is some confusion about the so-called education revolution. On the one hand we have with this legislation measures which set in concrete for four years a private school funding formula which is no different from the Howard model and will provide an even greater proportion of Commonwealth funding to private schools. Until we see the dollar commitment for assistance to disadvantaged schools, we can only guess at how effective this assistance can be. At its first caucus meeting after winning government last year, Labor members were urged to visit schools in their electorate. As a member who keeps close contact with many, many schools in my electorate, I felt this special visit was hardly necessary. But, as I visit schools today, particularly staffrooms, I hear some grave concerns from teachers in disadvantaged schools. While it might be popular to speak of teacher unions fighting yesterday's battles, unlike so many commentators, these teachers see the problems facing students and schools every working day of their lives. When we hear of improving teacher quality, it is rarely about providing a proper level of resources. And when we hear objections from teachers to national testing Is and outcome reporting, we should bear in mind that those objections come from first hand experience of the unfair nature of our education system. I am sure that, if we had a truly fair and equitable education system, there would be no objection to national testing and outcome reporting. But the system is not fair and, until it is, it will not be fair to the dedicated teachers working in our disadvantaged schools to attempt to report on outcomes for each school. Let me give just one way in which the results from testing can be distorted in disadvantaged schools. In New South Wales, students in primary schools can be classified as ‘intellectually moderate' or ‘IM'. A number of schools-and these are generally larger primary schools-have special programs and classes for IM students, and IM students are generally exempted from testing unless a parent requests their child be included. In smaller schools, however, students who could be classified as IM may remain in mainstream classes and, as such, they are required to be tested unless a parent requests that they be exempt. In some disadvantaged schools, these numbers can be as high as one in five students. You can appreciate how the results for a school can be distorted if the lowest performing fifth of students is not included in test results. While it has been suggested that any comparison between schools will use socio-economic factors to attempt to compare like with like, there are differences between schools drawing from similar populations. I am very concerned that we will finish up with a system of classification by postcode. A great many factors, including the one I have just mentioned, can influence the outcomes, which have nothing to do with the standard of teaching in the school. While I am on the subject of teaching standards, there are a few things I would to add to the debate, which to date appears completely one-sided. It has been said that we should judge teachers the same way that we judge lion tamers. If they come out of the cage alive they have been successful. The same could be said for school principals and others in school leadership roles. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, the harshest critics of teachers and principals are students and other teachers. What is surprising is that so many teachers survive for 30 or more years in a system which takes a high toll on those not up to demands of the profession. So, before any government embarks on an education revolution, it would be wise to consult the collective wisdom of classroom teachers and school principals rather than dismissing so called left-wing teacher unions, as members opposite and many media commentators do so often. We would do better to respect their experience and their great dedication. We may speak of an education revolution, but we are a long way from bringing true equity, excellence and social inclusion into our education system. Unless the measures to be announced following the negotiations with the states for a national education agreement bring a massive allocation of resources to disadvantaged schools, our education system will become more unequal and the great hopes for education driving a successful Australian nation into the 21st century will be proved definitely to be more of a slogan than a reality.",72
141,Mr ANDREWS,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"In the early 1990s the then Labor government operated a new schools policy. Orwellian in name, this policy effectively discouraged the establishment of new schools. It was repealed by the Howard government, leading to the establishment of many new schools which exist today. Indeed, many of these like schools can be found in the outer suburbs and in the regional areas of Australia. By 2007, 33.6 per cent of students attended nongovernment schools in Australia, and the proportion of students in independent schools in years 11 and 12 is even higher. The disdain for independent schools has surfaced in Labor Party policy frequently. Remember Mark Latham's hit list of the wealthiest schools targeted for funding cuts? Under the plans of Mr Latham and Jenny Macklin, 67 schools would have seen their funds cut and another 111 would have had the their funds frozen. Mr Rudd subsequently repudiated this proposal in his election commitments last year, saying that funds would be maintained for the 2009 to 2012 period, with a review of subsequent arrangements. No school would lose a dollar was Mr Rudd's claim. During the campaign, the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, revived the spectre of a hit list but slapped down by Mr Rudd. But much of the Left remains antithetical to non-government education, as I shall illustrate. The President of the Australian Secondary Principals Association, Andrew Blair, argued recently that non-government schools would have to cap their fees to qualify for federal funding or have their subsidies removed. Mr Blair proposed three tiers of funding: first, government schools, which receive all funds from the government; second, government supported schools, which receive some government and some parental funding; and, third, independent schools, which receive no government funding. If this proposal were implemented it would return us to the days before the Menzies government introduced state aid for nongovernment schools. Worse, it would impose a new level of government control over the hundreds of independent schools that could not afford to operate on fees from parents alone. They would be required to abide by government policy on issues like accountability and curriculum and cap their fees. Mr Blair quotes other activists, including Chris Bonnor, who describes the current system as ‘stupid'. Supported by groups such as the Australian Education Union, this is a campaign to slash expenditure on the education of many young Australians and to introduce left-wing controls over most non-government schools in this nation. Given Labor's history on these matters, Australians are entitled to be suspicious about their current intentions. The Schools Assistance Bill 2008 and the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008, which we are currently debating, raise these suspicions. The Schools Assistance Bill mandates as a condition of funding that all Catholic and independent schools implement the new national curriculum and make public was data about school performance, including all sources of funding. This has a number of problems. First, the requirement of adherence to a national curriculum puts at risk the uniqueness of many schools such as Steiner schools, Montessori schools and special needs schools. It also risks the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge international exams. This requirement is being introduced in this bill despite the fact that the national curriculum will not be finalised until some time in 2009. Worse, the requirement that all funding sources be disclosed and revealed fuels the campaign to remove funding from independent schools. That campaign, I submit to the House, is misleading. The proponents claim that Australia is at the bottom of the funding table compared to other OECD countries, but when both public and private funding is combined we are about average among OECD countries. They also ignore the huge savings to the taxpayer because parents sacrifice other expenditure for their children's education-and, remember, one in three children who are in school in Australia are now in independent schools. The cost of educating a child in government schools in 2005-06 was, on average, $11,243. The cost to government of educating children in non-government schools in the same period was just $6,268. So, on average, the cost to government to educate a child in a government school in Australia was $11,243 compared to just $6,268-about half-to educate a child in an independent or non-government school. What this represents is a saving of billions of dollars each year because of the financial sacrifice that hundreds of thousands of parents throughout this country make. It is a laudable objective to increase schools funding, but it should not be undertaken in the misleading and divisive manner being advocated by the Australian Education Union and its supporters. It is for these reasons that I commend to the House the amendments which have been moved by the shadow minister.",74
142,Ms SAFFIN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Schools Assistance Bill 2008 and the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 are complementary, hence the two being dealt with together. My comments will canvass both, sometimes discretely and sometimes fused. The Schools Assistance Bill will appropriate an estimated $28 billion in funding for the non-government schools sector for 2009 to 2012. The bill maintains the current SES funding and indexation arrangements consistent with meeting the Rudd Labor government's election commitments of 2007. It also contains two other key reforms consistent with Labor's national priorities. The first key reform is additional funding for all non-government schools where 80 per cent or more of the students are Indigenous and for non-government schools in remote and very remote areas where 50 per cent or more of the students are Indigenous. Previously, there was no such guaranteed funding to the maximum level. This bill will provide an additional $5.4 million to the eligible schools. It also brings together several components of funding for schools with Indigenous students which were previously scattered across a range of programs through the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. I understand that, in addition to allocating extra dollars, the new bill will also reduce reporting and red tape. I had a local example of this with a school that contacted me. Even though they were reporting on the same students and the same issues, they had to do two lots of reporting, state and federal, which created an enormous amount of work. When they had asked previously-some time ago-whether that could be coalesced, the answer was no. That is why it is important that we have the COAG process that is being undertaken because that allows issues like that to be worked through in COAG and be subject to reform. The government's enhanced COAG process and activities enable agreements to take place on issues like that, so that those real problems at a local level can be resolved. The bill brings together the Indigenous funding guarantee and the Indigenous supplementary assistance, which will provide an estimated $239 million over four years. Also, for the first time, it will be indexed at the same rate as other recurrent school funding. It is estimated the increase from indexation will be an additional $24.5 million, which is a significant amount. The second key reform is the new reporting requirements for non-government schools. This brings in a new framework in transparency in Australian schooling. Transparency is only ever a good thing, especially where our children and their education are concerned. The reporting requirements will be consistent with transparency measures for government schools and will help to enable proper understanding of how all schools perform. I know that, at first, when transparency requirements are being introduced there is often a debate within the particular communities that are affected and sometimes there is some discomfort as well. But transparency is always in the public interest and it is therefore always in the interests of our children. The activities that will yield the information necessary to meet the transparency test are in the following areas. The first is national testing-and, again, testing is one of those issues that is always debated quite heatedly and strongly, and sometimes there is discomfort about it, but it is in the interests of our children. The other areas are national outcome reporting, the provision and publication of individual school information, and reporting to parents. What this means is that there will be some common data sets around record handling and what needs to be recorded, as this determines what is reported. The key issue is that all schools, government and non-government, need to be included. Non-government schools have not previously been included in the overall reporting framework. The minister, in her second reading speech, in particular underscored the importance of education that is reflected in the Rudd Labor government's education policies-notably in our overarching policy framework with the education revolution. I know sometimes we bring personal stories and experience of ourselves and others to the debates in this place, and this one is no exception. I owe a lot to education. I have a view that is shaped and informed by that experience. Earlier in my life I was in an educationally disadvantaged situation, leaving school at 13 and not really having any high schooling to speak of. But it was broadened by later engagement in the education sector with my teacher training; being involved in educational politics in the New South Wales Teachers Federation; in the New South Wales TAFE TA; working part time; part-time lecturing; community adult education; serving on boards; and teaching young people with disabilities and in sporting areas and working in refugee camps in conflict zones. The education experience I have had goes beyond the schools, whether they be private or public. That shapes what I think and what I feel and some of the passion that I have around education. It is a right, and it is a right for all. I know that in the Rudd Labor government's education revolution and in our framework that principle underpins a lot of what we do. It certainly underpins my approach to my engagement with the education area. Minister Gillard also said: Education is central to the future of our society. Indeed it is on many levels, and the comments I have just made attest to that. There is a whole range of indicators around education, including, if we just look at child health and the level of education of mothers, the more educated the mothers are, the healthier the children are. That is one of the best arguments for education. I am probably straying from the bill a little bit, but I just wanted to make some points about education in general. Minister Gillard also went on to say: It is a central part of building a stronger, fairer Australia, ready to meet future challenges and able to make the most of its talents and resources. This is precisely what our education revolution is about-ideas. Ideas do matter, ideas are important, they shape our society, but these ideas are backed up by action, and that is a powerful combination, particularly in the area of education. Without a solid education system, we cannot have a stronger, fairer Australia. As we say, education is a great leveller, or should be, and it is needed to ensure Australia stays strong to meet the future challenges that are upon us: the many skills shortages in the workforce and climate change, among others. Some initiatives of our education revolution, which is central to what we do with legislation, include the new computers, which are already in schools. I have been able to get around the schools and see some of those and it is certainly very pleasing to see them being rolled out. The new trades training centres are on their way. There is the education tax refund, which is very welcome indeed. And then there is the 15 hours for four-year-olds at preschool. That will be rolled out over coming years and I know that is being assiduously worked on by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, the member for Bennelong, who is in the chamber at the moment. There is a commitment to parents for their children's education needs of $4.4 billion, and that has been available since July. A number of key reform initiatives are being pursued as well through the COAG process, and they are driven by the government as collaborative and cooperative reform. COAG has agreed to a number of national targets in this area. Some of them will be met through the national education agreement, an agreement among governments in Australia that the minister says will set the terms of funding and accountability for schooling over the next four years. The minister further says in her second reading speech-and it is a really important point that I wish to reiterate here-that Commonwealth funding for government schools does not require specific legislation. I would like to note here that I agree that government schools are also in need. That is a constant; it is not a new thing. All schools are constantly in need with changes that come in within the school environmentsand public schools certainly are in need of enhanced funding. In 2007, during the election campaign, I signed what was called the pledge in company with teachers and their Teachers Federation representatives. It was outside Grafton High School and I was saying that I would support and advocate for such funds. The key amount the teachers were saying was around $2.9 billion. I know there has been some work done by the unions to quantify that and I am still ploughing through some of those documents on education, where we should be aiming for brevity. I know that every time we get a document to read, it is like the books I can see in front me, so I am still ploughing through it. But what I would like to say is that it is actually the states that have provided the core funding of government schools. I note that here and I noted it at the time. Unless there is a change then that will continue. The states have their obligations to fill as well in this regard to ensure that that funding is there. When there are some schools in need, who feel they are missing out, it can and does have an impact on morale, and that is one of the things we always have to be mindful of when we are having debates like the one we are having in this House on these bills. I have said to parents, teachers and students that there is no longer a debate to be had about government and non-government, public and private within an either/or framework. The debate that never took place-it is a debate that never took place under the previous government, one of the many left unattended-is the debate on how to ensure the following things: equity for students; excellence in teaching; strong support for teachers; and the same or similar resources for all in schools, in education communities, with some particular attention to our regional and rural and isolated students. I also had the privilege throughout these debates to have met with the association. The previous government's approach to education, from what I can gauge-and some of that was directly as a member of a university council-was that there was more attention paid to or obsession with the so-called governance, which had little substance and no leadership in it, than with educational outcomes. For the first time, under this bill non-government schools will have a legal obligation to participate in the five key reporting activities in a transparent, clearly marked framework, along with government schools. The outcome, of course, is better of information for schools, for the school communities, for the parents and for the families, and improved educational outcomes is always the ultimate goal. All Australian students will be included, for the first time, and it is paramount to have that inclusiveness. Previously, the school funding legislation, which did not focus on the educational outcomes but on about 20 separate requirements in terms of regulation, monitoring and red tape, caused an excessive level of that regulation, monitoring and red tape. I alluded to my situation at the beginning of my contribution. What I would like to say in general about education is that education was able to give me a life that was richer and more meaningful, and I know it can do that for all young people. In my concluding remarks I would like to compliment and commend the teachers in my local schools and their respective parents and citizens associations and other interested citizens, who in my seat of Page put an enormous amount of work into local schools and education, as indeed do teachers, beyond their regular working hours. I know that they would welcome some of the reforms in these bills. I would like to commend the bills to the House.",76
143,Ms HALL,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It gives me great pleasure to rise tonight in this cognate debate to speak on the Schools Assistance Bill 2008. At the outset of my contribution to this debate I would like to emphasise the enormous contribution that is made to the education of students throughout Australia by both the public and the private sector. In the Shortland electorate over 80 per cent of students attend public schools and as such it is imperative that those children have equal access to quality education. This is the first tranche of legislation that will sure that all students throughout Australia have a quality education. This is about setting a high benchmark, a benchmark that will ensure equality of education and equality of opportunity for all students in Australia. The bill defines a major change in Commonwealth funding for schools as the current act and previous acts provided funding for both government and non-government schools. In the future, Commonwealth funding for government schools will be negotiated through the national education agreement, which is currently being negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states through COAG. This bill addresses the funding of nongovernment schools for 2009-12. It is part of the government's overall agenda for delivering a quality education revolution to all schools. It will continue the current socio-economic status funding, the SES funding, and indexation arrangements for nongovernment schools for 2009-12, meeting the government's election commitment. Part of that commitment is that no school will receive a lower level of funding. Today the students of Budgewoi Public School visited this parliament and saw first hand how it operates. The students in that school come from a less advantaged area than some other students in Australia and the funding arrangements that will be put in place by the Rudd government will ensure that those students obtain a quality education. They asked some very insightful questions about the operation of this parliament and they demonstrated an outstanding knowledge of government. As I mentioned, the majority of students in the Shortland electorate attend government schools. The 19 per cent of students who attend non-government schools mainly attend Catholic diocese schools. Those schools need to receive the security of funding that is provided through this bill. In addiention to the Catholic schools in the Shortland electorate there is one other non-government school, the Belmont Christian College, which provides a fine education to the students who attend that school. The secret to education is that it must vide opportunity. Education is the key to a successful life. Education is the key to a reer, the key to success and the key to choice in life. If a young child is denied equal education opportunities when they first go to primary school and is unable to read or has poor numeracy skills, that will impact on their whole life. It will impact upon their choice of job and of where they live-it will impact on every aspect of their life. The ple fact is that, if they do not have those sic skills, they will not have the same opportunities that others enjoy from the knowledge gained at school. One of the key aspects of the Rudd government's legislative program for schools in Australia is to ensure that all students have that opportunity. The students from Blacksmiths Public School, who will be visiting parliament later this week, will benefit from the education policies that the Rudd government is putting in place. When the first round of computers were provided to high schools in the Shortland electorate, all schools-government and non-government-bar one obtained computers, which means that the students at those schools now have the opportunity to embrace information technology and access the wide range of information that computer technology provides, simply because of the policies of the Rudd government. The trade training centres will also provide young students with the skills that they need when they leave school to take up apprenticeships and will assist them to move seamlessly from school to the workforce. Many of the election commitments delivered in the 2008 budget were part of our education revolution. That includes the trade training centres that just spoke about. The digital education revolution, as I have already pointed out, has put computers in high schools in Shortland. And the COAG reform framework means that for the first time governments in Australia will proagree to a single set of objectives, outcomes and outputs resulting in educational priorities ca- and reform directions for the education system. This legislation will include requirements for non-government schools to meet certain objectives and provide certain information. That will provide parents with clear information about the performance of their children and their children's school, comparative insim- formation about performances, and performbaance data about schools and school systems. This is a whole new approach to education. I must also inform the House that the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 is a continuation of appropriations for 2009 to 2012 for a range of targeted programs and projects under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. It provides appropriations for supplementary assistance to preschools and vocational education and training providers of Indigenous education. This is very important because one aspect of Indigenous education is the very low retention rate. Indigenous students do not have the same educational outcomes as nonIndigenous students. As I pointed out in my earlier comments, this affects the choices that they have in life. The Rudd government and Minister Gillard are not prepared to let this situation continue. We can see the problems and we intend to act to resolve those problems to give Indigenous students the same sort of educational outcomes that other students have. This legislation will give students who attend schools in Shortland the same sort of educational outcomes as students who live in Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition's electorate. I believe that, no I matter where a student goes to school, they should have exactly the same opportunities as students in other areas. I notice the shadow minister for early childhood education, childcare, women and youth, who is at the table, shaking her head in disagreement with my comment. I say to the shadow minister: I am committed to ensuring that all students have equality of cation. I think that she should get on board, stop shaking her head and say, ‘Yes, I think that no matter where a student goes to school, whether in the non-government or the government sector, they should most definitely have the same opportunities in life as students in my electorate.' The legislation will ensure the security of funding for non-government schools. It delivers on the Rudd government election commitments, as will other legislation that will soon be before the House, including legislation for the national education agreements that will fund government schools. I commend the legislation to the House.",79
144,Mr SULLIVAN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I rise very proudly to support these two government bills: the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 and the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. These are both fine bills which, as the previous member speaking in this debate said, go a long way towards delivering on our election commitments. The debate on these bills has been quite lengthy and there have been a number of eloquent speeches made. I probably will not be troubling the timekeeper too much this evening. For those who might turn to my speech to read it, I commend to them the eloquent contribution of the member for Port Adelaide, Mr Butler, who spoke yesterday I believe. It is quite serendipitous that I should follow member for Shortland in this debate as she and I attended the same primary school at the same time, which is almost the Nambour State High School example again except that Nambour State High School seemsMs Gillard-Who's older and who's younger?",81
145,Mr SULLIVAN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I am not telling. Ms Hall-And it was an excellent public school at that.,81
146,Mr SULLIVAN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It was, and we both did edu- fairly well. Nambour State High School seems to have been a little more successful than Macksville Public School in terms of the eventual outcomes for their students. As I read it, these two bills do not do much of anything that should have caused the length of debate that we have had. The Education Legislation Amendment Bill really only transfers appropriations from one area of legislation to another. It contains no reduction-in fact I believe there is a little additional spending that is attached to this. These nearly $780 million worth of measures are designed to improve the educational outcomes for Indigenous Australians. The education gaps that have been outlined in the parliament are inexcusable in modern Australian society. This is not the fault of the previous government alone but, I guess, the collective fault of all the governments that have preceded it, including some that, for a short period of that time, were Labor governments. We as a parliament and we as a government should be as one as we set out to remove those gaps. I note that there are some additional measures for Indigenous education included in the Schools Assistance Bill. The Schools Assistance Bill simply provides exactly what we said we would provide for non-government schools. The same piece of legislation removes funding for state government schools which is still the subject of the an agreement to be finalised later this year with the state governments. This is a funding regime for non-government schools. I want to quote a couple of sentences from the contribution of the member for Swan. He said: ... Commonwealth funding for non-government schools remains essentially unchanged He also said: ... 67 per cent, or $6.4 billion, of Commonwealth funding for schools will be provided to nongovernment schools. He went on to say-about something that we said we would do during the election campaign: The government has also retained the socio-economic status-SES-funding regime ... So what is the problem? This government is putting in place for the next four years what was in place for the previous four years. We are maintaining the existing SES funding and the indexation that goes with it. What has been happening here over the last couple of days as this legislation has been debated is a real concerted effort of dog-whistling. The opposition we see in the parliament these days is more interested in developing a narrative that says, ‘The government is doing this but we think that they are going to do this.' The reality is that we are not. In the parliament earlier today we had the member for Hinkler rise and make a personal explanation. He read to the parliament again some of his contribution to this debate. I would like to, for the third time, read a particular paragraph into the record simply because I think it deserves to be there and it tells the story. The member for Hinkler said: It is also an encouragement to some of the more affluent schools to take on a cross-section less affluent kids by way of scholarships or reduced fees or whatever it might be. That enriches the profile of their school and it gives other the opportunityand this is my emphasisto go to good quality schools. That is what the member for Hinkler said: the SES system gives poor kids the opportunity to go to private schools which are good quality schools. Whatever he might say about having support for the state school education system as well as the private school education system is wiped away in that one sentence. I believe very strongly that state schools provide an education product easily the equivalent of the majority of private schools. Some of the private schools of course are uber wealthy and they have the capacity to provide resources that are not available to the state schools. But for a member of this parliament to stand up in here and make the comment that only by going to a non-government school will a child from a less affluent family receive a good education I think is disgraceful. Mrs Mirabella-That's not what he said.",81
147,Mr SULLIVAN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I take the interjection from the member for Indi. That is what he said. He said: That enriches the profile of their school and it gives other kids the opportunity to go to good quality schools. Those are his words not mine. Mrs Mirabella-It's all part of your class warfare. You're just trying to create division.,82
148,Mr SULLIVAN,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is not my class warfare, Member for Indi; it is his class warfare. I am not standing here in class warfare. I went to a private school at high school. I have been in both the state and the private system. I support both. I have wonderful schools in my electorate, both private of schools-whether they be Catholic or notand state schools, and they do a wonderful job. The teachers in those schools do the kids equivalent-not better-job of the teachers in the public schools, and the students in my area are benefiting from that. I want to say a couple of quick things about schools in my area. I am pleased that the minister is in the House as I can report that the schools in my electorate are very pleased with the computers that they have received. These schools include Caboolture State High School and Caboolture Christian School, which is a low-fee non-government school. The Edmund Rice Flexible Learning Centre at Deception Bay have received computers to help them with the children they are trying to teach who have not been able to be accommodated by the mainstream schools. Northpine Christian College has also received computers. I am particularly proud of the effort that was put in by the Caboolture State High School, the Tullawong State High School and the Morayfield State High School, who formed a cluster to get one of the trade training centres. The parents in my area are very grateful for the tax refund regime, which they are starting to gather their receipts for in terms of next year's taxation. I do not want to stand here and try to make the point that the opposition-the former government-did not fund schools. I have had the opportunity to go to a number of school events in the last 12 months to acknowledge federal government funding that the schools received as a consequence of the previous government-North Lakes State College, Caboolture State School, Narangba Primary, Narangba Valley State School and Grace Lutheran College. And next Sunday I will have the opportunity to represent the minister at the opening of the high school component of St Eugene's, a school in my electorate where the federal government has contributed a little over $1 million. But can I say that there have been varying degrees of priority afforded to education. I go back to a document produced in 1988 by the then Queensland state government. I believe at that time Mike Ahern was the Premier. That document, to give it its full title, was Quality Queensland, building on strength: a vision and strategy for achievement and was prepared by the Queensland government. In that document they decided that the Queensland education system was sufficient to prepare students were available to them after they left school. That kind of inferior policy is rife in business dominated, conservative-thinking governments who see the future generations as fodder only for the profit mechanisms of their masters. People who are going to schools today should be fed the aspiration that they can take on jobs that have not been invented yet, not that they should do their schooling with a view to ending up in the jobs that are available today. As former Prime Minister Keating said once when talking to students, the job that he took when he first left school did not exist anymore. That is the way things are changing. The education revolution is about Australia's future, but it is also about people's futures-individuals' futures. We need to train and inspire our children to take on these other roles. I am a little disconcerted at the concentration that has been evident in recent years on trades training, both at school and postsecondary. I think that we need to concentrate a little more, particular in the area where I come from, on conditioning our children to the idea that they may seek to do something beyond a trade course or a certificate course if that is their desire. I have had a lot to say in other forums about the need for a full university campus on the north side of Brisbane to serve Brisbane north and the Moreton Bay region. We have an excellent campus of QUT operating at Caboolture, and I am in no way critical of the work done by the administrative or academic staff there; they do a first-class job. The students achieve first-class results as well and I do not wish to diminish the workers in that university or the students in any way, but there is a limited range of opportunities available for students there. Neither of my own children were able to study a university course locally and it is quite difficult for people from our area to access universifor the jobs that ties elsewhere. I propose to say no more than that this evening other than to say that these bills, whilst they are remarkable in the amount of attention they give to the areas that are affected, really do nothing more than that. They are not making any radical changes in terms of the funding for non-government schools-it is steady as she goes. In terms of assisting our Aboriginal students to close the gap in educational outcomes, this legislation is continuing with those processes and adding to them. I commend both bills to the House.",82
149,Mr RIPOLL,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I just want to make a few short comments to put my views and my support for the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 on the public record. I want to acknowledge, first, the hard and dedicated work that has been put in by a whole range of people, from the school communities, the department, the teachers and the unions through to the minister, who is ultimately responsible for these bills. I would just like to put on the record that there is a genuine desire and a genuine commitment by the Rudd government and by Labor to move forward on education. The debate of old is just that-old-and I think a bit tired. The debate I am talking about is one we hear from time to time in this placethe class warfare debate, where it is about one school versus another school or about who gets how much funding. These are simplistic debates that do not provide a real basis for saying that we are trying to improve the lot of all our kids in the education system, regardless of their school, regardless of the area, regardless of their background and regardless of the particular funding mechanism which provides for their education. I think that ought to be the basis on which all of us in this place can have a common goal. If we talk about shared values and we talk about what is important, this issue would have to be one of the most important things of all: the way in which we provide a strong, solid basis to a fair system, which means that any young person going to any school in Australia has access to a bare minimum standard-a quality standard. That means that they will have an opportunity and a chance at life and education beyond the old hackneyed debates-the tired old debatesbetween people who keep raising excuses about why you cannot change the system or how you should leave the system in one particular way, to suit their own political ideologies. For me that is wrong. And I am talking about anyone on any side. I am not going to point a finger in one particular direction. I just think we ought to be a little bit more focused on the betterment of all schools. When we talk about schools I think there is a disconnect. We tend to talk about the school and forget the primary goal of the school, and that is to educate young people. For me, it should not be a matter of having to make a critical decision of which school will end up being the one that provides that opportunity. It should be a decision for parents to make based on the quality of education and, depending on the area in which they the live, which school can provide that education for their child. The reality for most parents is that they just do not get a choice. It really is the school in their local region that is the sole provider. There are plenty of examples, whether it is in remote areas, rural areas, or regional areas-wherever it might be. In some areas there are more choices than in others, and again we will hear plenty of debate about all those issues, but the core value comes back to the same principle: what is the role that government should play in ensuring that there is a decent level and standard of education in this country? I certainly strongly believe that these bills are part of that process. I firmly and strongly believe that we are keeping our election promises and moving to meet the commitments we made to the Australian people in the 2007 election with these bills. It is sometralian thing we have acted on very quickly and of which I am very proud. Kevin Rudd and Labor talked about and put in place a new standard. We have called it the education revolution, and we are in the process of making that revolution happen. We are doing it through a range of mechanisms: by providing more real funding than has ever been provided in the past, by providing more computers than have ever been provided before, by ensuring that teachers are recognised for the work they do and for the part they play, by working very hard to bridge the gap between those schools which have the fewest advantages and those with the most advantages and by saying, ‘We need to bring people up to a minimum standard; we need to make sure that there is a standard out in the community that is acceptable to everybody.' We want to make sure that we bridge the gap between the highest performing students and the lowest performing students. We want to make sure that the things that we provide through our policies and through legislation are a fair reflection of how we deliver on all of those election commitments. I believe that that is what we are doing. The simplistic and tired old debates of government versus nongovernment should now be falling on deaf ears; they no longer should apply. Over a period of time, that is the goal; that is what we are aiming for and driving for. That is not what should be the basis of debate tonight. The bills that we have before us do a number of things, and neither is hugely controversial or a major departure from Commonwealth funding arrangements for schools. The Schools Assistance Bill will provide for continued funding arrangements for non-government schools, and future Commonwealth funding for government schools will be provided through the national education agreement, which is currently being negotiated through the Council of AusGovernments. We are not only providing for and continuing the funding with a view to reviewing those arrangements in the future but also working very closely with other governments in Australia and partnering with them to make sure that we deliver on our promises and do the best that we can for the Australian school system. This bill also fulfils the government's commitment to retain the current system of general recurrent funding for nongovernment schools, the socio-economic status or SES funding system, over the next four years. There are some minor modifications, and there will be a routine revision of the SES funding scores for the next four years. There will be no school that will receive less funding because of any reassessment of the SES score, so we have set a baseline guarantee that schools will not lose out. There are no losers in this. This is not about creating losers; this is about creating winners and making sure that funding is there for schools that need that funding. The bill also provides additional funding for non-government schools that have significant numbers of Indigenous students, and this is something that I think needs to be put on the record and clearly stated. There is a massive gap in Australia between lower performing schools and higher performing schools and also, particularly in remote and rural areas, with Indigenous students. We need to do something significant that will deliver real results to increase the number of Indigenous students who do better, who have better access and more opportunities and who become less reliant on government and more reliant on themselves through a better education. That is an important fact to consider, and part of this package that we present will go to that cause. This bill will make the maximum rate of general recurrent funding automatically apply to non-government schools in remote and very remote areas that have 50 per cent Indigenous enrolments or more. I think this is a great commitment that we are making to ensure that Indigenous students get a hand-up and some fair access. The bill also provides funding for capital grants and continues funding for existing targeted programs. These include short-term emergency assistance, education in country areas, teaching English to new arrivals, acy, numeracy and special learning needs. The bill also provides for students with disabilities. As I said before, the funding for Indigenous students is a very important part of these bills, and the aim of the Indigenous supplementary assistance, the ISA, is to reduce the reporting and red tape for schools and provide them with increased flexibility to focus more on the educational achievement of their students and less on the administrative and red-tape provisions. This funding will be increased by $18.1 million over the next four years and will be provided through a guarantee. Together the ISA-the Indigenous supplementary assistance-and the Indigenous funding guarantee will provide $239 million over four years for the education of Indigenous students in nongovernment schools. There are a number of specific conditions for Commonwealth funding for schools which I think are important to note and which schools need to be aware of. Schools are basically required to act in six key areas. One is participation in national student assessments. I think we need to ensure that right across the country students are performing to a standard. You need a way to measure it, and I think a key component of that is not just the measurement but what you do with it afterwards. I am quite excited about the prospect of using this to assist schools to make sure they have access to the sorts of resources they need. Schools will also need to participate in national reporting on the outcomes of schooling within their school and in providing individual school performance reports to the minister so that the minister is in a position to be able to make a number of assessments about school performances. Schools will also need to provide plain-language reports to parents so that parents have a better compreliterhension and a better understanding of the way that their child is performing not only against their peers within the school environment but also on a national and collegiate basis as well. Schools will also need to provide publicly available information about their performance and be part of an implementation of the national curriculum. These are all key parts in ensuring that, while government, through legislation and funding, plays its role in ensuring that we move forward on these issues, schools also play their role. In the end, these bills represent a follow-through on our commitment to schools and the education revolution. They will ensure that we move forward in providing the best possible opportunities and outcomes for every single student in this country. No longer should the debate be about one school versus another school; it should be about making sure that every single student has the opportunities that they need. I commend the bills to the House.",84
150,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (7.08 pm)-in reply-I thank the member for Oxley and all other members who have spoken in this debate on the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 and the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. I particularly thank the member for Oxley for his personal assistance to me during the course of the debate. The Rudd Labor government is committed to creating an education revolution. Our aim is to establish this country as one of the most highly educated and skilled nations in the world. Education not only drives productivity but also empowers individuals to reach their full potential and helps overcome disadvantage. The government has made substantial progress towards these aims with the 2008-09 budget delivering $19.3 billion in investments in education, cementing the government's commitment to trade training centres, new digital technology and a national curriculum. The Schools Assistance Bill 2008 adds further significant investment to school education, whilst the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 extends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 so that the government can continue to make supplementary investments to contribute towards closing the gaps between the outcomes for Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. I thank everyone who has spoken on this debate, from both sides of the House, for their participation and I note that the debate has been thorough and wide ranging. I think that the commitment of members to speaking in this debate reflects the central role that schooling plays in our nation and, consequently, the priority that members of this House-indeed of this parliament overallattach to it. I will respond to the claims have been made during this debate and reiterate why these bills presented together are an essential building block in our reform agenda. In doing so, I would also underline to the House the urgency of passing them. Schools and students need this legislation to pass before the end of 2008. Without the legislation, the Australian government is unable to make recurrent payments to nongovernment schools and systems for the school year beginning in January 2009. I cannot imagine that any member of the House would want non-government schools to start the next school year in a situation of uncertainty. The Rudd Labor government promised certainty and stability in school funding. We cannot leave these schools, students and families in a position of not knowing what might happen just because it might suit the opposition, or indeed other political parties in the Senate, to seek to delay passage of the bill. As the Independent Schools Council of Australia among others have recognised, it is urgent and imperative that this bill is passed in a timely way and that the various stakeholders work together constructively to pass it. They are wise words which should be considered by all members of this House and certainly by all members of the Senate. Scrutiny and transparency should, of course, always be respected in the parliamentary process, but delay for the sake of political pointscoring should not be a feature of that process. The Schools Assistance Bill will appropriate an estimated $28 billion in Commonwealth funding for non-government schools over 2009-12, including supplementary assistance for Indigenous students, and will implement the government's commitment to provide stability and certainty of funding. A further $779 million is estimated to be apthat propriated under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 through the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. These bills have been introduced in parallel with the development of new financial arrangements being negotiated between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments through the Council of Australian Governments. They will be reflected in the national education agreement that we will complete later this year. The COAG reform framework means that for the first time all governments in Australia will agree to a single set of objectives, outcomes, outputs and targets-and, hence, educational priorities and reform directions-for the school system. The Australian government considers that the COAG reform agenda must deliver real change in three core areas: it must raise the quality of teaching our schools; it must help ensure all students benefit from schooling through strategies based on high expectations of attainment, education and transitions for every student, especially in disadvantaged school communities; and it must improve transparency and accountability of schools and school systems at all levels. These two bills are an essential step in delivering that change. Before the 2007 election, we committed to improving transparency in Australian schooling through national testing, easy to understand reports for parents and public reporting on the performance of schools. A central feature of funding arrangements for 2009 to 2012 is therefore a simpler, stronger performance information and reporting framework for non-government schools which will be consistent with the conditions required of government schools under the national education agreement. This transparency framework will apply equally and consistently to non-government and government schools. The requirements in this bill focus strongly on five features that are central to good reporting to parents, the community and government: national testing, national reports on the outcomes of schooling, provision of individual school information, reports to parents and publication of information by schools. This bill contains provisions to ensure that non-government schools receiving Commonwealth funding will provide a range of information in readily accessible formats which enable fair and transparent reporting. These are needed in order to give parents information about how their child and their school are doing to support them in making the right choice of school and in order to guide resources and policy decision making towards the greatest possible effectiveness and improvement. Transparency about the income received from different sources is of obvious imporin tance in understanding the effectiveness of individual schools and in treating all schools, government and non-government, consistently. There have been claims that the bill will require schools to publicly disclose every individual item of income. In fact, the bill makes it possible for income to be reported consistently by source in a way that will be compatible with the existing regulatory requirements to report to the department through a financial questionnaire. We are committed to reducing the regulatory burden on schools and we will examine, through the regulations and guidelines for this act, how we can ensure that the provision of information about income can be as efficient as possible. ",86
151,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,The shadow minister for education is inquiring of me by way of interjection whether we will commit to not publishing it. The government is committed to transparency. We believe that transparency is important. The same transparency framework will apply to non-government schools and government schools.,88
152,Unknown,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,Opposition members interjecting,88
153,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is interesting that interjections are coming from the Liberal Party, which at one point used to proudly say that it believed in transparency. Clearly, now it believes that secrecy should be associated with education. But we will not allow critics of transparency to obscure the purposes of our reforms. Only by understanding the total amount of funds at the disposal of individual schools is it possible to understand the relationship between resourcing and educational outcomes. The opposition have claimed in this debate that the income of a school is irrelevant to understanding its performance. I find this claim nonsensical. If we are to identify accurately where the greatest educational need across the Australian community is located and encourage excellence in every school, we need a basis for fair, consistent and accurate analysis of how different schools are doing. This bill includes performance reporting at individual school level. The government has repeatedly stated that such reporting will not take the form of simplistic league tables. Instead, any public reporting would show how schools are doing compared to other like schools that share the same student characteristics. States and school systems are currently working with the Australian government to examine which forms of data are relevant to understanding the performance of schools, given their overall circumstances and the students that they serve. A particular emphasis on Indigenous students will feature in performance data to guide improvements in closing the educational gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Implementation of greater transparency will be supported by the recent agreement by the Council of Australian Governments to the establishment of a new national education authority, the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority. That will bring together for the first time the functions of curriculum, assessment and reporting at the national level. The new national curriculum will provide a clear and explicit agreement on the curriculum essentials that all young Australians should have access to, regardless of their socio-economic background or the location of their school. In this bill, the government is not requiring detailed adherence to a rigid, line-by-line program of curriculum study. Instead, it is making clear that the national curriculum, once agreed and completed, will be compulsory. Consideration will be given to whether some existing curricula meet the requirements laid down by the new curriculum framework. What is not open for negotiation is the idea that a world-class curriculum will be an optional extra for schools that are receiving significant public funds. The national curriculum will not be a straightjacket for schools. It will provide for flexibility and scope to allow schools and teachers to implement its content and achievement standards in appropriate ways at the local and school level. It should not interfere with the ability of independent schools to continue to offer local curriculum arrangements within the requirements of the curriculum essentials of the national curriculum. A further erroneous claim in relation to the bill has been made. That claim is that it enables the minister to in some way capriciously withhold money from a school that has an unqualified audit report. I indicate for the benefit of the House",88
154,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,As I understood the opposition's claims-and I have its second reading than financial viability.,89
155,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Right. I have the second reading amendment. I can clarify this for the shadow minister at the table. According to his second reading amendment-which has been foreshadowed and circulated and which will be moved later in the debate-he is apparently concerned about a: hidden agenda evidenced by: (a) granting greater power to the Minister to delay or end funding to non-government schools because of an audit qualified for non-financial reasons; Can I provide to him the explanation for the provision in the bill. The explanation is simply this: it is possible for an auditor to submit an unqualified report-that is, unqualified directly in the sense of an auditor's qualification-that still expresses concerns about the financial viability of the school. The auditor may report that the school's accounts provide a fair and true representation of the school's finances; however, without qualifying their opinion, the auditor may also express concerns about the school body's viability such as where it is highly dependent on the continued goodwill of its financiers in which funds have been borrowed on better-thancommercial terms. It is in relation to that kind of matter that the provision is being sought-a probity provision, something related to appropriate and proper use of government funds and something the shadow minister is obviously confused about. The Schools Assistance Bill will make important changes for Indigenous students in non-government schools. Non-government schools where 80 per cent or more of the students are Indigenous and non-government schools in very remote areas where 50 per cent or more of the students are Indigenous will receive maximum funding. This additional funding will enable Indigenous students to receive a higher level of support and to achieve better educational outcomessomething I trust every member of the House is able to support. Bringing supplementary Indigenous education funding into the Schools Assistance Bill and streamlining the administrative arrangements that support that funding will reduce the administrative burden and increase flexibility for providers so that they can get on with the vital job that we want them to do: closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We trust that the impact on Indigenous Australians will be positive; 2,157 Indigenous students in non-government schools will attract maximum funding under the bill. COAG agreed that as a national priority we must aim to have the gap in literacy and numeracy outcomes over the next decade and have the year 12 attainment gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2020. This will not be achieved unless we create the conditions for schools to do things differently to meet these targets. The Education Legislation Amendment Bill extends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, which also enhances the government's ability to create the right conditions for change. In summarising the debate I also note that, under the Schools Assistance Bill, most approved authorities will be better off financially but, importantly, no approved authority will be worse off. Independent schools can decide on the best way to support their students. Where schools are in a cluster association with each school contributing resources, they will not be prevented by this legislation from continuing this arrangement in the future. The legislation ensures that states pass the funding to approved authorities in a timely manner. The legislation makes no changes to the SES funding model used to calculate the allocations to the non-government sector. Indexation is also calculated in the same way as for the previous quadrennium. One change is the discontinuation of establishment grants, and this has been referred to during the debate. Establishment grants were introduced in 2001 as part of the socio-economic status funding arrangements for nongovernment schools. The additional funding was provided to allay independent nongovernment school concerns about establishing new schools with funding levels based on their SES scores in competition with Catholic systemic schools, which at the time were not funded in the same way as the rest of the sector. When in 2005 Catholic systemic schools became part of the SES funding arrangements, the rationale for establishment grants continuing was weakened. A survey of the non-government schools sector undertaken as part of the evaluation of the Establishment Grants Program showed that school operators did not base decisions about opening up a new school on the availability of establishment grants funding. For example, the following quote is typical of the views expressed during the evaluation: The grant is too small to influence such a decision as opening a new school. ",89
156,Ms GILLARD,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"That is a quote from a person involved in the process, not from me. I would also like to correct the assertion that this government was responsible for the demise of the Investing in Our Schools program. The previous Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, made it clear that the last round of funding was the final round. We need to build in our schools a culture of high expectations for students and teachers. This culture must also be matched by effective transparency and accountability mechanisms that meet the needs of parents, policymakers and the broader community. The Schools Assistance Bill 2008 and the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 are critical elements in this national agenda, and I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to.

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 September, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.  wish to delay the House at great length. I have given my speech in the second reading debate on the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 major and have outlined the opposition's reasons for their concerns with respect to the entire bill. There will be a consideration in detail period where the opposition will move three amendments at eight o'clock, but at this point of the debate I would like to move the second reading amendment standing in my name. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) reaffirms its commitment to providing genuine choice in education opportunities for parents and students through both government and non-government schooling; (2) notes that the Government committed to continuing the socio-economic status (SES) model of funding for non-government schools until 2012 and that, while this bill fulfils that commitment, it contains a hidden agenda evidenced by: (a) granting greater power to the Minister to delay or end funding to non-government schools because of an audit qualified for non-financial reasons; (b) requiring adherence to a national curriculum without flexibility that puts at risk the uniqueness of Steiner, Montessori, International Baccalaureate, University of Cambridge International Examinations and special needs schools; and (c) forcing non-government schools to comply with a requirement to inform the Minister of every funding source to a school or an associated body that can be published-information which is both superfluous to the operation of the SES model, and is the Trojan Horse from which opponents of the SES model will head a campaign to remove it through the 2010 review; and (3) condemns the Government for ceasing funding for new non-government schools establishment grants, and urges the Government to reconsider this Budget decision to ensure parents, particularly in new communities, across Australia will be able to access in their children's education”.",91

159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time.

NA CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) Cognate bill: NA REPEAL AND AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 September, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",92
160,Mr TRUSS,ROAD CHARGES LEGISLATION,"The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 amends the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. These amendments permit the making of regulations to apply new registration charges to the five per cent of heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government's Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, or FIRS. These new charges were agreed to by the Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers at the Australian that Transport Council meeting on 29 February 2008. The states and territories have already choice implemented the charge schedule on heavy vehicles under their registration systems. Consequently 95 per cent of Australia's heavy vehicle fleet are already operating under the revised registration schedule. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 also updates some definitions contained in the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and establishes a disallowable charge-setting mechanism based on regulation that will stipulate the table of charges or an annual adjustment process. The FIRS provides an alternative to state based registration for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes and is designed to provide uniform charges and operating conditions for heavy vehicles that carry interstate goods exclusively. Currently slightly more than 21,000 heavy vehicles in Australia are registered under the FIRS. In the case of the ACT, trucks locally registered 2008 are subject to the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993. This act applies charges that are calculated on the same basis as trucks registered under the FIRS. In the ACT there are 2,549 trucks locally registered, of which 91 per cent are rigid. This means the vast majority of ACTregistered truck owners will see their registration fees go down if the ACT is able to apply the new charges agreed to by the Australian Transport Council. Moreover, in spite of the limited application of the FIRS to Australia's heavy vehicle fleet, the coalition ognises that not only does it promote regulatory consistency for vehicles solely involved in interstate operations but also it is a scheme that provides some competition and discipline in the heavy vehicle industry. When an earlier bill on this issue was presented to this place, I raised a range of concerns. Earlier this year, members may recall, we debated the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill, which sought to implement these registration charges. The previous bill contained some provisions which were unacceptable to the opposition parties, and the bill was defeated in the Senate. One provision was the requirement that the Commonwealth must apply the schedule of charges for registration of heavy vehicles as agreed to by the Australian Transport Council. This provision in the previous legislation meant the Commonwealth lost its discretion to determine its own charges upon federally registered trucks and hence the freedom to impose competitive pressure and discipline on state heavy vehicle fees. The opposition believes that competitive pressure is essential to encourage efficiencies and a rational state based charge-setting regime. In addition, the existence of an alternative registration scheme can be used to place pressure on the states to deliver commitments to uniform transport regulations or in other areas. The opposition acknowledges that the government has recognised this flaw in the previous legislation and has removed it from the bill. The previous legislation also included an annual adjustment component. This annual adjustment mechanism was to be based on a road expenditure formula. The problem with this proposal was that the formula is a particularly expensive one for the trucking industry to wear. It is common knowledge that costs associated with road construction and maintenance, such as steel, concrete and asrecphalt, are skyrocketing. In other words, the automatic adjustment component locked in an annual increase likely to be well above the CPI. An arbitrary formula of this nature was not acceptable to the opposition. The opposition recognises the pressure under which the heavy vehicle sector is operating. Since the election of the Rudd government, the daily life of the average Australian has got tougher, with rising fuel and other costs and now an economic downturn. These stresses are falling particularly hard on those who daily haul the essentials of life to supermarkets and keep our industry moving. There are many very small operators in the trucking industry. Many one-man businesses, many families are heavily mortgaged to maintain their transport businesses. They can ill afford increased costs, in particular locked-in increased costs year by year. The opposition is pleased that the government has also responded to this concern. We note that in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008, subsection 5(3), the charge adjustment process will be determined by a separate disallowable instrument. The offending section, which provided charges to be determined by an automatic adjustment process, has not been included in this bill. The opposition will always be uncomfortable with an indexing process that removes from parliamentary scrutiny annual tax increases. The opposition would like to point out that the revised registration charge that is now being levied across almost all of Australia's heavy vehicle fleet will ultimately generate an extra $88 million per annum to the coffers of the states and territories. The opposition expects that the states and territories will use this extra money appropriately. That is, they will spend the money on their roads. It is essential that Australia's truckies see a return on this charge. We expect the Rudd government to use its self-proclaimed good offices with its state colleagues to ensure that this occurs. The coalition serves notice that it will not support any future increases in registration fees unless there is clear evidence that the states are spending this extra money on roads and services for the trucking industry. It is quite clear that over the years the states have been reluctant to expend additional funds on key facilities for the trucking industry. That must stop. If the states expect the Commonwealth to agree to increased registration fees then they must deliver something for the money they are receiving. With this qualifier, the opposition acknowledges that the government has responded to many of our concerns regarding this legislation. The opposition will of course carefully scrutinise any new charge-setting regulations and we will oppose them should they contain an automatic indexation provision. On these understandings, we will not oppose this bill. I turn now to the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008. This bill does two things. It repeals the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 so that the ACT may set its own heavy vehicle charges. The opposition believes that the ACT should be free to make such decisions and we support this element of the legislation. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, this change will actually result in lower registration fees for most trucks in the ACT. The second part of the bill relates to a different issue and amends the Fuel Tax Act 2006 to implement a road user charge rate of 21c a litre from 1 January 2009. The road user charge is levied on the basis that the costs arising from the industry's use of the road system should be recovered. Both the trucking industry and the opposition accept this principle. What is important is that the amount is seen to be fair and that it is spent on roads. Motorists and the trucking industry currently pay 38.143c a litre in tax for every litre of fuel they purchase. However, the trucking industry may claim a partial rebate under the Fuel Tax Act 2006. This act sets a road user charge for the heavy vehicle sector which is intended to recover the cost attributable to the industry's use of the road system. Trucking operators receive a rebate through the tax system of the difference between the fuel tax they pay at the pump and the road user charge. The road user charge is currently 19.633c per litre. The rebate is therefore 18.510c per litre. Should the road user charge be set at 21c per litre, the rebate would be 17.143c per litre. That increase would be the result of a decision by the Australian transport ministers on 29 February 2008 to support the National Transport Commission's fourth heavy vehicle charges determination, a set of charges levied upon the heavy vehicle industry based on the principle of cost recovery. The government has also attempted to implement this tax increase before. Members may recall, in March of this year, when introducing the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government flagged the intention of the government to implement the new heavy vehicle determination and increase the road user charge from 1 January 2009. He also stated that the road user charge was to be indexed annually to the same road construction formula that was to apply to the registration charges. The coalition is concerned that this is an attempt by the Rudd government to reintroduce the indexation of fuel excise. I am sure many remember that the Keating government introduced the indexation of fuel excise and that that index was abolished by the coalition government in 2001. Our position on this matter has not changed. We remain opposed to fuel excise indexation. That is why, with regard to the road user charge, the opposition in the other place disallowed relevant regulation made under the Fuel Tax Act 2006 on 14 May this year which would have effectively introduced fuel excise indexation principles to the road transport sector. In this bill the government has removed the link to indexation. The Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill would repeal section 43-10(5) of the Fuel Tax Act 2006 and add a new subsection which would set the road user charge at 21c per litre and enable the government to make regulations at another time that may prescribe a method for indexing the road user charge. This of course is a disallowable instrument. The opposition acknowledge that the government has made this change. We believe it to be a constructive improvement. The industry, however, remains concerned about the manner in which the National Transport Commission develops the road user charge. Its consultative processes appear flawed and it refused to disclose to the ing industry much of the data and the modelling it used to develop the charge. I will come back to this point a little later. The opposition is also concerned that the government has linked these bills to the implementation of its announced $70 million four-year Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Package. The opposition calls on the government to stop this tactic of blackmail. Threatening to block the $70 million package-inadequate as it is-should these bills not be passed is grubby politics and harms the safety of those who work on our roads. It suggests that the government is more interested in collecting taxes than it is in industry productivity and safety. Governments collect huge revenue from taxes on motorists and the transport industry. More of that money should be allocated for roads. New tax increases are not required-there is more than enough money already collected from the trucking industry to be able to fund this $70 million package and, indeed, to do more. We all recognise that it is important to do more to improve the road infrastructure network, to ensure the safety of truck operators and other motorists on the roads but also to ensure that these vital networks to drive a strong Australian economy are efficient and reliable. Secondly, there are no performance benchmarks in this package. There is nothing, for example, that stipulates how many roadside facilities will be built, or where. How can truck operators be sure they will actually get the benefits being traded for these cost increases? Likewise, the government has not linked the new charges to obligations on the states to deliver on their promises to harmonise transport regulations. What is the government doing about the appalling failure of the states to eliminate cross-border rule changes which so impede the development of an efficient and cost-effective natrucktional road transport system? Labor said when elected to office, delivering wall-towall Labor governments around Australia, that it would fix interstate inconsistencies and state differences. In transport reform, the Rudd government has failed dismally, and it is now allowing another opportunity to deliver on reform to pass. To my mind, the key weakness of these bills is that they do not address the fundamental problems of regulatory reform. They do not take the opportunity to improve efficiency and to put pressure on the states to deliver on their oft-repeated promises to deliver consistency in road transport regulations. This problem, as I have discussed before and will again, is that the states have failed to implement nationally consistent transport regulations. There are many examples, but a pressing and urgent one is the heavy vehicle driver fatigue reforms which were agreed to by the Australian Transport Council in February 2007. These laws are designed to provide a national standard for managing heavy vehicle driver fatigue. They are based on a national template approved by the Australian Transport Council last year. The states agreed to these measures, but now they are failing to deliver them. The trucking industry, which reluctantly accepted the new laws, is not getting the uniformity or the new infrastructure it was promised. But that has not stopped the states, or many of the states, from proceeding with implementing the laws. The states and territories have responsibility for the regulation of heavy vehicles in their jurisdictions. They have to pass the required heavy vehicle fatigue management laws and implement them-and that is where the problems begin. Let us look at some of the bizarre anomalies. Firstly, despite the promises, the laws are not being implemented nationally. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia commenced implementation of the new laws on 29 September. Tasmania and the Northern Territory plan to implement them later. The Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia are not implementing them at all. Secondly, there are differences in the transitional arrangements. For Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, drivers who operated under the previous basic regulated hours of 12 hours driving plus two hours extra work have six months from 29 September to move to the new standard of 12 hours work in total. But not so in Victoria. that state there are no transitional arrangements for drivers on standard hours. As of 29 September, drivers in Victoria on standard hours are only able to work 12 hours a day. What is more, this arrangement will apply to interstate drivers coming in from New South Wales and South Australia. So if they drive from Victoria into South Australia they get an extra two hours, but not if they go from South Australia into Victoria. This is an example of the utter ridiculousness of these regulations. Another example is the different treatments of short rest breaks. Under section 47 of the model law, a driver working standard hours must take a short break after 5¼ hours of work. A driver may make a defence against a breach of this provision if there was no suitable place to be found for a rest and the driver found a rest stop within 45 minutes. In New South Wales or Victoria this is not a defence. This is in spite of the fact that a recent audit of 12,700 kilometres of Australia's major highways found that the states and territories have largely failed to meet the National Transport Commission guidelines regarding the provision of rest stops. As I have said before in this place, surely New South Wales and Victoria can be more flexible, especially since they have not provided adequate rest stops. How can a government reasonably pass laws requiring trucks to stop at rest areas that do not exist? Another baffling difference is the treatment of employers should their drivers be breached under the heavy vehicle fatigue management laws. In New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, if an employer can satisfy a court that they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that their drivers do not break the laws, they have a defence. This means a court will not necessarily attribute liability to the employer in the case of a breach by one of their employees. In In Victoria, no such defence is available to the employer. Let us look at the work diary. Under section 56, a truck driver engaged in standard hours only has to carry a work diary if he or she drives more than 100 kilometres from their home base or has done so in the last 28 days. So remembering that heavy vehicle driver fatigue laws apply to trucks with a gross vehicle mass of over 12 tonnes, the driver of a large removal truck working a regular day delivering furniture around a regional centre should not have to worry about filling out a work diary. In Victoria and South Australia, drivers on standard hours who work within 100 kilometres of their base do not have to fill out a work diary. This is consistent with the national model legislation. In Queensland the distance is 200 kilometres before a driver must fill in a work diary. In New South Wales, the state government has insisted that all heavy drivers fill out a work diary even for local work. However, New South Wales has now issued a last-minute exemption so that drivers undertaking work within 100 kilometres do not need a diary. Those who are primary producers must fill out a diary only if they work more than 160 kilometres from their base. So in New South Wales we have the extraordinary fact that there are inconsistencies within the state between drivers performing the same task, let alone between states. I previously mentioned other baffling inconsistencies in the treatment by the states national road freight. For example, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland have designated road train routes and make it possible for trucks to pull highly efficient triples across the state. B-triples are highly efficient vehicle combinations, up to 30 per cent more productive than B-doubles. They also help to get trucks off our roads since two B-triples is equivalent to five semitrailers. Unfortunately, New South Wales refuses to open up its road system to those vehicles in spite of a COAG decision in 2006 that the states and territories would establish a Btriple network. New South Wales simply refuses to recognise B-triples as a legitimate vehicle combination able to operate on road train routes. Victoria only allows strictly limited B-triple use between Broadmeadows and Geelong, and then only for the trucks moving car components for the Ford motor company. These odd policy decisions by New South Wales and Victoria mean that B-triple freight movements cannot take place on a national basis. This is despite the fact that the road freight task is expected to nearly double by 2020. There are other anomalies too. One is the glacial rate of take-up by some states of common higher mass limits for trucks with road friendly suspension. As far back as 1999 the states and territories agreed with the Commonwealth that Australia should develop approved routes for trucks with road friendly suspension. This is an important reform, promising to generate freight efficiencies worth hundreds of millions of dollars and place Australia in the forefront of the world in pioneering and applying new developments in pavement friendly technologies. According to the reform, an approved road network for trucks fitted with state-of-the-art suspension systems would roll out as specific roads and bridges were protected. Now, after nearly 10 years, Victoof ria, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory and increasing areas of Queensland have developed an extensive approved road network for these types of Btrucks. But where is New South Wales? New South Wales has been blocking this initiative ever since it started, imposing unique and difficult regulations that effectively make it impossible for vehicles to qualify. New South Wales continues to refuse to publish its high mass limit network and open up in a transparent way its approval processes to drive on it. Another inefficient agony in our so-called national road freight system is the different treatment of widths of loads. For example, states cannot agree to a harmonised approach to minor overwidth roads, such as occurs with hay bales. Drought and even average seasonal variations in Australia generate large amounts of hay movement across state borders. However, in New South Wales rigid semitrailers and B-doubles may be loaded to a width of 2.83 metres only, but next door in Victoria these trucks can be loaded to three metres. Beware the farmer in Victoria who dares to load his truck with hay as wide as legally possible who then drives into New South Wales. I conclude with the bizarre treatment of indivisible and divisible loads. If you are a truckie carrying an indivisible load-that is, a load that cannot be physically broken down, like a piece of binding machinerystates will allow you oversized access with conditions. If you are unfortunate enough to carry a divisible load, such as plasterboard, you must stack it to a narrow width of 2.5 metres only. This forces the load to be stacked higher, decreasing roll stability. A rational mind would tell you that if divisible loads were allowed some flexibility, a safer and more efficient truck would be on the road. I continue to call upon the Rudd Labor government to deal with these frustrating and expensive anomalies in Australia's transport sector. I state the obvious: Australia is tion and is a national economy. It is time the regulatory environment for Australia recognised this fact. The government needs to take this matter seriously and deliver on its rhetoric that it will be able to work effectively with the states to deliver nationally consistent laws. Is it any wonder that the truck industry is angry about increased charges being imposed upon it when it is not getting its share of the bargain delivered? The trucking industry is prepared to pay its own way, but it expects to get a fair deal and that has not been happening. The opposition has proposed a series of amendments to the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008. These amendments will address a number of concerns we have regarding the government's approach to the charge-setting regime on the heavy vehicle industry. The first is to ensure that indexation of charges is not reintroduced by stealth. The second is the management of such charges in the future and the implementation of arrangements which will guarantee the transparency of the road-user-charge price-setting mechanism. The third is the issue of heavy vehicle rest areas and the need to put in place a performance guarantee that ensures at least 50 new rest areas are built every year on the national road network. The fourth responds to the matter I have just discussed-the absurd and contradictory state based transport regulations, which must be reformed. Our support for this bill will be conditional on the acceptance of these amendments. Debate adjourned. SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",92

Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.  move opposition amendments (1) to (3): (1) Clause 15, page 20 (lines 4-8), omit paragraph (c), substitute: (c) if a law of the Commonwealth or a State requires the body or authority to be audited - the relevant audit expresses concern about the financial viability of the body or authority. (2) Clause 22, page 25 (lines 3-11), omit the NOES clause. (3) Clause 24, page 26 (lines 5-16), omit subclause (1), substitute: (1) A funding agreement must require the relevant authority for the nongovernment school, or other nongovernment body, to ensure that a report (or reports), of a kind (or kinds) required by the Minister, is given to the Minister in relation to programs of financial assistance provided under this Act, so far as they relate to the authority. It is not the intention of the opposition to unnecessarily delay the passage of this bill through the Senate. Nor is it our intention to stop the bill from having its effect from 1 January, but it certainly is our intention to hold fast to these three amendments, which will improve an otherwise flawed bill. We would hope that the government would seriously consider adopting the three amendments that the opposition has moved. They deal with proposed sections 15, 22 and 24 of the bill. I will start with section 24, which relates to funding disclosure. The bill marks a very considered change from the policy of the previous government with respect to funding disclosure. The Minister for Education pointed out quite correctly in the debate that the financial statements required by nongovernment schools at the moment do require a certain level of funding disclosure. They are made available to the minister, and therefore the department, as part of the records of the school and they do go some way towards providing quite detailed financial information. This bill, however, which requires the disclosure of all funding sources from the school or any body associated with the school, would allow for the publication of that information. This is a critical change and is the hidden agenda contained in this bill. We all know that the minister and most members of the Labor Party privately oppose the socio-economic status model of funding for non-government schools. They are on the record opposing it. They opposed it as recently as 2004, when they introduced their own new policy, which was the national resource index. They oppose the SES model because they do not in their heart of hearts really support government funding for nonrelevant government schools. During the previous government, the information that was available to the government about the funding sources of non-government schools was never published. Under this government, that information would be published-the minister confirmed that in the second reading debate. It neatly ties in with the review being planned for 2010 of the SES model for nongovernment schools. Blind Freddy could tell you that the government, and its fellow travellers in the Australian Education Union and elsewhere amongst the left-wing ideologues who have opposed the SES model, will use this information about non-government schools to mount a case and an argument against the SES model-to throw the model out and replace it with a national resource index. Non-government schools should be very, very afraid of this information being in the hands of the Labor Party. They had nothing to fear from us, but the hidden agenda in the Labor Party's bill is to take the SES model apart. The member for Throsby alluded to it. Julia Irwin, the member for Fowler, alluded to it in her speech. So our most important amendment is to remove the funding disclosure requirement for publication contained in this bill. Secondly, the bill contains a mandated national curriculum. The opposition support a national curriculum but we do not support what this bill requires, which is an inflexible, mandated national curriculum which puts at risk the Steiner, Montessori, International Baccalaureate, special needs schools which care for those people who have special needs and other schools that have a unique curriculum. How does the curriculum of those unique schools fit into the mandated, inflexible national curriculum that is tied to funding contained in this bill? That has not been cleared up by the government in this debate and it should strike fear into the hearts of the principals and governing bodies of those kinds of unique schools. Finally, this bill allows the minister to lay or stop funding to a school that has received a qualified audit on grounds other than financial viability. That is a change in this bill that has never been seen before under the previous government. If an auditor qualifies an audit for governance reasons that have nothing to do with financial viability, it puts the power in the hands of the minister to delay or reject funding for that school. That is a new and far-reaching power which the opposition says should be removed from this bill. For that reason, I call on the government to support the amendments that the opposition has moved.",98
162,Ms GILLARD,AYES,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (8.17 pm)-I rise to oppose the amendments moved by the shadow minister for education. I would have to say that when the show The X Files was on TV, I was a fan of it. The difference between me and the shadow minister for education is that he is suffering a delusion that he is ing conspiracy theories everywhere, spun out of the air, and hidden agendas. That is what these amendments are directed to-not the facts and not anything that is about a child's education but, rather, a conspiracy theory. Why is the shadow minister engaged in a conspiracy theory? Well, better for the shadow minister from the Liberal Party to be engaged in a conspiracy theory about the future than to try and defend the shameful legacy that the Howard government left to this nation in education: declining standards against our competitors, as revealed by international testing; no national curriculum; no transparency; no action on teacher quality; and children not learning with the learning tools of the 21st century like computers. It is a shameful record and I can understand why the shadow minister for education is trying to de- weave a conspiracy theory out of thin air to try and cover up that legacy of neglect, decline and decay that characterised the Liberal Party in government. Let us just look at the facts as opposed to the shadow minister's conspiracy theory. The facts are simply these: the government are committed to a new era of transparency. Yes, it will include transparency about funding sources; and, as the government have made absolutely clear, every condition we put on non-government schools we will also apply to government schools. The same transparency framework will apply. This will enable people to understand across the nation for the first time what is happening in Australian schools. We understand that the Liberal Party was a complete failure when it comes to transparency. Apparently that record of failure has now morphed into a policy position of opposition. We believe in being honest with the Australian people. We will ensure that there is a transparency framework which applies equally to government and nonin it. He is seegovernment schools. On the question of the national curriculum, yes, the Liberal Party members should be hanging their heads in shame because of their lack of action on the national curriculum. Of course for the Liberal Party the curriculum was never about the quality of a child's learning; it was all about whether or not they could get their name in the headlines of the newspapers. It was all about whether or not they could parade their credentials in the history wars to other Liberal Party members. Their intervention in curriculum debates was all about themselves and all about the political positioning of the Liberal Party. The one thing it was never about was the quality of education in Australian schools.  charge of the history curriculum.",101
163,Ms GILLARD,AYES,"The shadow minister is interjecting about the history curriculum now. Perhaps he wants to explain to the Australian people why, after 12 long years and a rainforest worth of broadsheet newspaper columns about the history wars, the record of the Liberal Party in government is that 50 per cent of children in secondary schools do not learn any history. That was your legacy. All of those articles in the Australian newspaper and all of the history wars nonsense they went on about was all ‘look at me' politics-it was all about the Liberal Party and nothing to do with the quality of kids' education. We will have a national curriculum. It will have local flexibility, and of course in giving local flexibility we will be working with those who offer curriculum like the International Baccalaureate. Finally, the provision about accounts is one that the shadow minister is trying to create a fear campaign about. It is a simple provision, a probity provision. If accounts are qualified then of course a minister would have a look, and that is what the act provides. These are very simple provisions. Of course he will be there beating the fear drum. No-one in the sector should believe him. This is about cheap and petty politics to cover up 12 years of neglect. Question put:  to. The House divided. [8.26 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon.

166,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"MCPherson) (8.31 pm)Recently I was honoured to attend the official unveiling ceremony, dedication and commemorative service of the Rotary Kokoda Memorial Wall in Cascade Gardens, Broadbeach. The Kokoda memorial at Cascade Gardens has been created to help visitors to Cascade Gardens appreciate the courage and determination of the men who fought on the Kokoda Track and in PNG during World War II. The memorial was unveiled on the occasion of the 66th anniversary of the first shots fired by the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion and the Papuan Infantry Battalion against the leading elements of the 144th Regiment, South Seas Force, of the Imperial Japanese Army in their advance towards Port Moresby, signalling the commencement of the World War II Kokoda Track campaign, fought between July and November 1942. The Kokoda memorial wall was commenced in 2003 with concept plans drawn up by Gold Coast City Council under the guidance of Rotarian George Friend, who had conceived the idea in 2001. In 2005 local artist and resident of MCPherson David Yardley was commissioned by the Rotary Club of Broadwater Southport to develop the design and construct the wall. From concept to a complete set of plans, David has told the story of Kokoda through sculptured images on the face of a slightly curved memorial wall in the shape of the Kokoda Track. These images are based on the famous photos taken by wartime photographers and correspondents Damien Parer and George Silk and are imposed on seven panels. The top edge of the design follows the line of the track over the Owen Stanley Range, the central mountain range running through PNG. Each of the seven three-dimensional panels tells part of the story of the World War II Kokoda campaign. Panel 1 tells of the arrival of the first troops at Port Moresby in early 1942 and their deployment to fight on the Kokoda Track, beginning their journey at the Golden Staircase, the entry to the jungle. Panel 2 depicts Imita Ridge, the first major geographical obstacle of the Kokoda Track. The saw-toothed top edge of the wall is an exact replica of the torturous terrain which defines the track as one of the most difficult walking trails in the world. Panel 3 tells of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. Australian soldiers are to this day indebted to the courage, commitment and resolve of the Papuan people in their role of carrying supplies and evacuating the wounded on the Kokoda Track. Panel 4 shows the village of Menari. Troops, carriers and the wounded are depicted in chaos receiving supplies and refreshments from the Salvation Army. Panel 5 shows a wounded man being assisted by his mates at a graveside as well as troops moving forward from the midpoint of the Kokoda Track to the next battle. The inscribed words ‘courage', ‘endurance', ‘mateship' and ‘sacrifice' help define us as a nation and are also engraved on the four granite monoliths at the Isurava Memorial in PNG. Panel 6 is dedicated to the Papuan Infantry Battalion, who fought alongside the Australians, as well as commandoes, coastwatchers and those who undertook the aerial resupply of ammunition and other supplies. Panel 7 depicts the Battle of Isurava, the site of some of the most intense fighting in the Kokoda Track campaign. It illustrates the determination, raw courage, commitment and selflessness so often displayed by soldiers on the Kokoda Track. This final panel details the initial withdrawal and the victorious return to reoccupy the village and ultimately expel the invaders from the beaches of Buna and Gona. The rear of the wall will be inscribed in bronze with a dedication to all who fought in and supported the campaign and also offers details of the significant points, villages and battles along the track. Construction of the wall was begun in April 2007 by David in his West Burleigh studio and was completed in July 2008. The Kokoda memorial wall is 23 metres long and five metres tall at its highest point. The largest panel weighs approximately five tonnes. David is an extremely talented industrial artist, and the detail of his work is a moving tribute to the heroes of the Kokoda Track. Funding for the design of the memorial wall and the sculpting of the panels was raised through the Rotary Club of Broadwater Southport with the generous support, contributions and assistance of numerous sponsors and individual donations. I am proud to say that, through the commemorations program in 2007, the former coalition government granted $32,000 towards construction of the Rotary Kokoda Memorial Wall in Cascade Gardens, Broadbeach. I commend all those involved in the construction of this Kokoda memorial: David Yardley, Gold Coast City Council and the Rotary Club of Broadwater Southport. MCGRATH Foundation",103
167,Mr TREVOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Flynn) (8.36 pm)Tonight I want to speak on the MCGRATH Foundation and recent announcements made by the Rudd Labor government, including one made on 13 October 2008. Jane MCGRATH co-founded the MCGRATH Foundation with her cricketing husband, Glenn, after her initial recovery from breast cancer in 2002. In 2005 the foundation was relaunched with the focus firmly placed on raising funds to provide breast care nurses in rural and regional areas across Australia while at the same time promoting the importance of being breast aware to younger women. There are currently eight MCGRATH breast cancer nurses in areas reaching as far as Bundaberg-some areas of which, namely Moore Park and surrounding areas, are in my electorate of Flynn-Perth, Albury-Wodonga and Bega. In 2008, the Australian government pledged $12 million to the MCGRATH Foundation to fund 30 breast care nurses across Australia over the next four years. On 13 October 2008, the MCGRATH Foundation and the federal government announced that this funding would be used to place specialist breast care nurses in 44 communities across Australia, with the majority of these communities in rural and regional areas. Breast care nurses are fundamental for women recovering from breast cancer. Breast care nurses are specially trained nurses who act as patient advocates, coordinating care for women with breast cancer, their families and carers. People wanting to show their support for the MCGRATH Foundation can make a donation to the foundation. The Rudd Labor government is making considerable new investments to help Australian women and the health sector combat this disease. To support women with breast cancer the Rudd Labor government has committed $31 million in funding for external breast prostheses for women who have had a mastectomy as a result of breast cancer and support for integrated cancer care facilities and research. The Rudd Labor government is also providing $2.5 million to help fund a research study with the National Breast Cancer Foundation to gather vital data from up to 100,000 women, which may help to reduce the impact of breast cancer in Australia. In May this year, the government was pleased to include Tykerb on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to assist women with advanced breast cancer. As well, the government provides more than 90 per cent of the funding of the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre-a world-leading centre fostering an evidence based approach to the diagnosis, treatment and support of women with or at risk of breast cancer. The breast care nurse initiative, the locations for which were announced on 13 October 2008, is another weapon in the fight against the disease. This announcement by Minister Nicola Roxon was made with Glenn MCGRATH and the MCGRATH Foundation, with the minister paying tribute to Jane MCGRATH and her tireless efforts on behalf of all women with breast cancer. The nurses are being placed in areas that need them most and in locations where access to a full-time breast care nurse is not currently available. Eighty-nine per cent of these nurses will be located in rural and regional areas, including one in my home town of Gladstone, in my electorate of Flynn. My mother would be very proud of this announcement as she is a breast cancer survivor and Gladstone resident herself. I thank Minister Roxon, Glenn MCGRATH and the MCGRATH Foundation for agreeing to place a breast care nurse in Gladstone. It is fantastic news for my community. I thank Glenn MCGRATH for the opportunity to meet him. He is a fine, outstanding man both on and off the field, and it was an honour to meet him at the launch of the announcement on 13 October 2008. Flinders Electorate: Warley Hospital",104
168,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to make it absolutely clear that the assets of Warley Hospital on Phillip Island belong to the people of Phillip Island. They were intended-beginning in 1923-to be used for the people of Phillip Island for their health care, for their aged care and for their general well-being. These assets are now being liquidated, and the assets must stay on Phillip Island. It is a clear position. It is a categorical position. It is a position I have put without equivocation to Aged and Community Care Victoria. I want to address this question in three brief phases. Firstly, the history of Warley Hospital dates back to a period when those requiring medical attention had to be taken by boat to Hastings or endure a five-hour journey to Melbourne by horse and cart. Against that background, in 1923 Mr and Mrs WE Thompson agreed to purchase the property then known as Buena Vista if the other island residents would fit it out as a hospital. That occurred, and Warley Hospital was opened on 8 December 1923. It is a hospital that has contributed enormously to the people of Phillip Island-to their health, to their well-being and, above all else, to their sense of security and community. Sadly-and this brings me to my second point-Warley Hospital was closed at the end of January this year. The aged-care component was closed only some short months ago. This was an avoidable closure. There was a $2½ million guarantee by the previous government, which was put in place prior to the election. I believe it was not tion promise but a guarantee which should have been honoured. It is a matter of shame and disgrace that the minister, Nicola Roxon, breached that guarantee to the people of Phillip Island, failed to visit the people of Phillip Island and left that island with no emergency service as a consequence. Having said that, it is now time to deal with the future. What I say is this: the assets that were part of the hospital's legacy have been passed under treaty to the Bush Nursing Association and from them now into the hands of Aged and Community Care Victoria. Aged and Community Care Victoria is run by good people. They did not seek these assets. They recognise that there is a debt of somewhere in the vicinity of $2 million to be paid. If that debt is not liquidated, we will see an erosion of the remaining assets with an interest loss of about $25,000 per month. That debt does have to be paid off and therefore the assets have to be treated in a way such that their long-term health is preserved. Against that background, on the three occasions I have now spoken to Aged and Community Care Victoria-to one of their representatives, Bill Forward, and in addition to their CEO, Gerard Mansour-I am convinced they have the best interests of the island at heart and that they are committed to the retention of all of these assets. The remainder is likely to be over $2 million once the debts have been discharged. But that money, as I have said to them, must stay on Phillip Island. It must be applied to the health needs and the aged-care needs of the island. It was raised by Phillip Islanders. It was the result of thousands of hours of community work to create a health service and to maintain and preserve that health service. And now, having been the victim of government negligence, it would be a tragedy if the community's assets were sequesjust an elec- tered and taken away. I believe that Aged and Community Care Victoria will do the right thing. I have made it absolutely clear to them that they must do the right thing. These assets must be used on the island, for the islanders and they must be used for health and aged care. The other point which I have also suggested to the CEO is a very clear one. It is that perhaps rather than trying to administer the funds, Aged and Community Care Victoria could designate an advisory board or indeed pass the assets to a formal trustees board. At the end of the day, the assets came from the work of Phillip Islanders and they need to remain on Phillip Island. Nothing less will be acceptable. Anything other than that will be fought bitterly and strongly by the people of Phillip Island, who created the magnificent Warley Hospital, whose loss we now mourn greatly. Central Coast Business Enterprise Centre",105
169,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It was my pleasure 2½ weeks ago to launch the Central Coast Business Enterprise Centre at its new location in the Tuggerah Business Park on the Central Coast. The Rudd government is committed to small business. Small business creates much of the prosperity on the Central Coast-my areaand throughout the country. There are over three-quarters of a million small businesses employing nearly four million people around Australia. There are a further 1.2 million non-employing small businesses. On the Central Coast, a large proportion of businesses are small businesses. In fact, there are more than 8,000 employing small businesses and 11,500 non-employing small businesses, comprising about 96.3 per cent of the business community, on the Central Coast. Small business is the heart and soul-the engine room-of the Central Coast economy. It is something that this government is very concerned about. It makes sure that it has policies that are small business friendly. One of the reasons that the Central Coast Business Enterprise Centre was able to move to its new location is because at the last tion I was very proud to be with the then opposition spokesperson for small business, who is now the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, when we made an election commitment of $250,000 a year for the next four years to make sure that small business on the Central Coast had a place that they could go to-a small business advisory service, a onestop shop for small businesses on the Central Coast. This is vital for the economy of the Central Coast, given, as I said, that over 96.3 per cent of businesses on the Central Coast are small businesses. We have higher than average unemployment in my area. It is close to 7.3 per cent. Thirty per cent of people in my area have to commute to Sydney to find employment. Those who are employed on the Central Coast are usually employed by small businesses. This promise that the Rudd government made at the last election, one that we fully funded in the last budget, is one that will help small business on the Central Coast. In fact, the Central Coast Business Enterprise Centre had never received a cent from federal governments until the Rudd government honoured the commitments that it made at the last election. They had never received a cent even though they have a tremendous track record in relation to assisting small business on the Central Coast. In the last seven years, 20,000 businesses have been assisted by the Business Enterprise Centre. This has been a massive help to the economy of the Central Coast. What the Central Coast Business Enterprise Centre does is provide services such as business planning, access to legal and accounting services, information and guidance on loans and banking products, development of simple marketing plans, guidance on leasing, advice on government regulation compliance for all tiers of government and menelectoring for new businesses. These are vital services that, if you are starting a small business, you need help with. For many small businesses, that first step is very important, and simple advice on what to do next is something that they often lack. That can cause them to fail. I was able 2½ weeks ago to speak to a number of the business mentors who assist small businesses on the Central Coast. These small business mentors are people who have had vast experience in businesses but who are now often retired and are able to give back to small business because they know the importance that it plays in the economy of the Central Coast. They know that people on the Central Coast look to small business to provide employment, opportunity and a future for the Central Coast. The Rudd government cares about small business. The best thing that a government can do for small business is to make sure that it eases the burden of regulation that often bogs down businesses as they try to compete and try to get set up. One of the things that this government has done is to review over 27 separate bits of regulation so that it is a lot easier for a business to get going and to compete. I was proud to be there at the launch of the Business Enterprise Centre on the Central Coast. Small business plays a vital role in our economy. Everyone who is involved in small business should be proud of the job that they are doing. Poverty",106
170,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am going to talk to the House about the issue of poverty. Most people associate poverty with being a global issue somewhat removed from day-today life in Australia. However, poverty is an issue that we must acknowledge at a global and a domestic level. Globally, new estimates by the World Bank show that about 1.4 billion people live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, which is equivalent to over one-fourth of the developing world's population. The Australian people have always felt a strong moral obligation to help reduce international poverty. In 2005 when John Howard went to New York for the Millennium Development Goals Summit, he announced that aid levels would increase to around 0.35 per cent of GNI by 2010. I was pleased to note that the Labor government has matched this commitment and has said that aid will grow to 0.5 per cent by 2015. However, we can and must do more. One of the ways that Australia can assist is by helping countries to embrace GM technology. Trials in India have shown an outstanding potential for the integration of genetically modified crops. Genetically modified crops increase yields for farmers, are more resistant to pests and diseases and are more resilient in drought conditions. Higher crop yields provide more income to farmers to give their families a better quality of life. An increased supply of food on local markets will put downward pressure on prices, making food more available. People may object to GM crops on ethical grounds but it is difficult to object on moral and financial grounds. Rigorous trials must take place to ensure the safety of the crops. This is an area that the Australian government can contribute to and it is an effective method of eradicating poverty. Reducing poverty in our nation must be a priority of the Parliament of Australia. Peter Saunders of the University of New South Wales suggests: Poverty is a cause of considerable community concern, but the term is now rarely used in government circles in Australia. As a consequence, developing strategies and programs that address the causes and consequences of poverty are not on the policy agenda. In addition to bringing the language of poverty into Australian politics, we must develop an index which measures this policy. Only then can we judge the performance of governments in reducing poverty. At the moment, the methods used are not endorsed by governments. The method we have been using is the poverty lines approach, a relative measure of poverty. Poverty lines are income levels designated for various types of income units. They are based on a benchmark income of $62.70 set in the September quarter of 1973. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has updated the poverty line for Australia to the March quarter of 2008. Inclusive of housing costs, the poverty line is a single income of $710.14 per week for a family comprising two adults and two dependent children. The index is based on estimates of the household disposable income and population provided by the ABS. Because the index is based on estimates, the poverty lines themselves are estimates. The logic is dated and it is rarely referred to in parliament. It is clearly time for a new poverty indicator that accurately reflects the cost of living in modern Australia. Governments do not like talking about this indicator, because most benefit payments fall below the poverty line. Poverty is also a problem in my electorate of Swan. In my electorate, the 2001 statistics of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling indicated that a total of 10,604 people, or 9.4 per cent of the people in my electorate, were in poverty. There is clearly a problem in my electorate. To address this we need to consider the underlying causes of poverty in Australia. The link between employment status and poverty is well established. This is why the Howard government strongly targeted employment generation as its key method of poverty alleviation. The Howard government's Welfare to Work program was also designed with this in mind. Other causes of poverty in my electorate include the housing affordability crisis. The unacceptably high waiting list for public housing in Western Australia-over 17,000 households-accompanied by a shortage of affordable rental accommodation has meant that people have been left with nowhere to live. This is real poverty. Disability is also associated with poverty, and the disabled face difficulties in starting their own businesses, as they have to sacrifice all benefits immediately when applying to the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. Low educational attainment is associated with poverty as well. We need to have a headline poverty indicator that takes this into account so we can judge the performance of governments in reducing poverty. In conclusion, poverty is an issue relevant to Australians at a global and a domestic level. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the efforts of groups such as Micah and all groups in Australia that aim to reduce worldwide poverty. I also thank all the smallscale community groups in my electorate that help people who certainly suffer from poverty. Pensions and Benefits",108
171,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"Parramatta) (8.55 pm)Some 24,500 pensioners, people with disabilities and carers, and around 12,000 working families will benefit from the Rudd government's Economic Security Strategy in coming months. There is no doubt that for many there is a sense of relief. Families and pensioners of all kinds have been coming under increasing pressure not just this year but over several years. I remember pensioners coming up to me after each of the last two Costello budgets to tell me that there was nothing in it for them in spite of their need for relief. For many families, back-toback interest rate rises over seven years have pushed them to the limit. For others, rising rents as a consequence of interest rate rises have caused considerable hardship, as have several years of rising costs of groceries, petrol and child care. In the May budget the Rudd government acted to relieve pressure. In the face of high inflation, we cut spending, built a surplus and provided relief as best we could without pushing up inflation and interest rates. We delivered tax cuts and increases to childcare rebates, and we increased the utilities allowance in March from $107.20 per year to $500 per year and extended it to carers for the first time. We paid bonuses to carers and pensioners. We also committed to a program of nation building, an investment in the productive capacity of the economy-a strategy that would build our economy without pushing up inflation. But since then there has been a significant change in circumstances that demands a different approach. There has been rapid, unforeseen change in the state of the global economy, resulting from the credit crisis that emerged in the United States and flowed rapidly across the world. The time frame for the deterioration of the global economy is illustrated by the response of our Reserve Bank. It was only back in March that the Reserve Bank increased official interest rates by 25 basis points and was talking about inflation and tightening fiscal policy to rein in inflation from an overheated economy with severe capacity constraints. Just six months later, on 2 September, the bank acted to reduce interest rates by half a per cent-the first reduction in seven years. In response to the global credit crunch, Rudd government moved quickly. We cracked down on short selling, committed a $4 billion fund for mortgage backed securities to strengthen non-bank lenders and guaranteed bank deposits and foreign borrowings. All of that was about freeing up liquidity and ensuring that our banks were competitive against foreign banks which had the backing of their governments. It was not due to any weakness in our own banks. In recent weeks-and it is recent weeks, not monthsthe international crisis has moved from the money market to the broader economy, bringing real slowdowns in economies around the world. It became clear that governments needed to stimulate their economies to avoid a hard slowdown. The Reserve Bank of Australia acted again to reduce interest rates by one per cent, and the Rudd government moved to use the surplus to bolster the slowing economy. The surplus that we worked so hard to build now came into its own, and it will be used to do what it was intended to do: balance out the highs and the lows. Growth is still projected at over two per cent. Revisions will be released shortly and will no doubt reflect trends in the growth projections of our major trading partners. But those of us down in the streets and homes of our electorates know that the growth is not uniform and that there are some who have been doing it tough for several years. Affected by the rising prices of groceries and petrol, people were wearing the effects of inflation but not receiving the direct benefit of the boom in mining and commodities. When it became apparent that the government needed to inject a stimulus package into the economy, the Rudd government took decisive action through a $10 billion economic security package to strengthen the Australian economy during the global financial crisis, and it was those who have been the doing it tough who were first on the list. The $10 billion economic security package delivers a down payment to four million pensioners of all kinds, including seniors, veterans and partners, people with disabilities, carers and self-funded retirees with Commonwealth seniors cards, who will all receive lump sum payments of $1,400 per single and $2,100 per couple. That is very good news for the more than 25,000 pensioners in my electorate of Parramatta. The package also gives a hand to working families. Over 12,000 families in Parramatta that receive family tax benefit part A will receive payments of $1,000 per eligible child. We are responding to the potential for a further slowdown in the housing market by stimulating residential construction by increasing the first home owners grants from $7,000 to $14,000 and, for those building a home, from $7,000 to $21,000. This will apply to all contracts entered into by 30 June 2009. The Rudd government is also responding to a potential slowdown in the labour market by investing in an additional 56,000 training places this financial year. The Rudd government's economic security package is a comprehensive package and an appropriate and decisive response to the unforeseen and rapid changes in world economic circumstances. I am grateful that, as part of that appropriate action, we have been able to boost incomes for pensioners, carers, working families and businesses in my electorate.",109
