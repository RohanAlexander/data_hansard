1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In regard to a statement which appears in this morning's Argus, to the effect that the Government have declined to consider grievances in connection with the administration of the New Hebrides which the Presbyterian Church of Australia wishes to have remedied, I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister the following questions:-1 . Did the authorities of the Presbyterian Church submit alist of grievances in connection with their mission work in the New Hebrides to the Minister of External' Affairs, and afterwards to the Acting Minister? 2. Was a request made that these grievances be forwarded for the consideration of the Colonial Office, and was the re quest declined? 3. Has any inquiry been mnde into these grievances by the. Government ? 4. What is the reason for declining (o consider the grievances of citizens of the Commonwealth made in a proper and respectful manner? 5. Is it not the special and primary function of the Department of External Affairs to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth from injustice in any part of the world-includin g the New Hebrides ?",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"When I saw the newspaper statement to which the honourable tnember refers, I asked the Secretary for External Affairs if it or any portion oif it was correct. I am awaiting his official written reply; but I understand that an application was made in writing, and, instead of being refused by me, was sent to the Colonial Office and to the Administrator of the New Hebrides. No deputation waited upon me in regard to the matter, nor did I refuse to receive one. The latter part of the newspaper account is therefore absolutely untrue, and .a concoction of the writer. Moreover, I do not think the Prime Minister refused to make the representations asked. Therefore, in my opinion there is no ground for any complaint. As regards the New Hebrides, the Commonwealth has no control, and the Government - cannot do more than forward complaints to the Imperial authorities.",14
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I give notice of the - questions for Tuesday next. TARIFF. NA CONSUMERS. at 10.30 Mr Glynn asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the declared intention of the Ministiy to abandon the method of protecting labour provided by the Excise Tariff 1906, and to substitute another there for, was the result of a doubt as to the constitutionality as well as the efficacy of the provisions for the purpose in the Act referred to? 2. Whether, in view of the statements of some honourable members of this House that their support of the Tariff proposals is conditional on the extent and efficacy of the protection to be afforded to labour, the Acting Prime Minister will , on the close of the general debate on the Budget and Tariff, submit his new method of protecting labour to the House for consideration, to enable honourable members to consider what it is worth before dealing with the lines giving protection to employees?",14
4,Sir WILLIANLYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I intend, on or before next Tuesday, to make a statement : which I . think the honourable member will regard as a reply to, his question; but if he wishes a formal answer, I ask him to give notice of the question for next week. EXdSE TARIFF (AGRICULTURA L MACHINER Y) ACT.",14
5,Mr HUTCHIS ON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. What steps have been taken to ascertain the amount of Excise due upon agricultural machinerv and implements under the Excise Tariff rgb6? 2. What steps have been taken to collect any . amounts due?. 3. What has heen the cause of delay in collecting any amounts due?",14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1 and 2. The collectors in each Sjate have been directed to call upon each manufacturer who has not applied for exemption to render an account of all excisable articles manufactured by him, and show cause why the Excise duty should not be forthwith paid. In regard to those who have claimed and obtained exemption, it has been found' necessary to obtain legal advice as to the authority of the Customs to enforce payment of Excise in case of subsequent non-compliance with the conditions of such exemption. 1. The delay has been unavoidable. The majority of applications for exemption in the States of Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia have not yet been heard, and it is questionable whether the Excise should be enforced until simultaneous action may be taken in all the States. VICTORIAN TORPEDO PRACTICE. Mr. JOSEPH COOK'(for Mr Bruce SMITH) asked the Minister of Defence, ttfon notice I. Does he regard the fact as evidencing great skill on the part of the Victorian Naval experts that they should have been successful in finding their own torpedo, after losing it for two days during a course of instruction, as recorded in the daily press of yesterday ? 2. Is it a fact that about two years ago the same experts directed a loaded torpedo from one - pf the naval authority's boats at a distant object, ancl that, instead of reaching the object Aimed at, it struck the bottom and exploded in close proximity to their own boat?",14
7,Mr EWING,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If the honourable member desires a reply to these questions, I ask him to postpone them until Wednesday next, because there has not yet been time to get the necessary information. Similar questions could be asked in regard to the operations'of any navy on the face of the earth.",15
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Shoul d the occurrences referred to be allowed to pass without notice?,15
9,Mr SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The time for asking questions without notice has passed. NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS.,15
10,Mr SALMON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Whether he is aware that many newspapers, registered so as to obtain cheap transmission,"" Containadvertisements inimical to the natural increase of our population and conducing rather to an increase of the death-rate? 2. If he will cause inquiry to be made with View to the detection and classification of such advertisements ? 3. If he can take steps under the Post and Telegraph Act to remove from the Register such publications as fail , after reasonable warning, to purge their columns of such harmful and degrading advertisements? 4. If he will further, under the same Act, cause the destruction of such publications sent through the post?",15

Yes; in connection with inquiries which are already being made with regard to businesses that may contravene the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act. 3. Newspapers containing advertisements which fire indecent or obscene within the meaning of the Post and Telegraph Act may, subject to appeal to a Justice of the High Court, or to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, be removed from the Register. 4.

In Committee of Ways and Means:' Consideration resumed from 12th September (vide page 3230) of motion of Sir WILLIAM LYNE That duties of Customs and duties of Excise be imposed according to the following Tariff (vide page 1648)",15
12,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Melbourne Ports) [10.39] - I think it will be recognised that I , like my friends on the Opposition corner benches, was returned as a protectionist. Like them and the main Oppositionists I , too, ,am deeply interested in the well-being of the workers; ibut in a somewhat different manner. At one time, I looked upon Budgets with some amount of awe and a great deal of reverence; but my experience of politics during the last sixteen years has taught me that it is not wise to look for a halo surrounding the heads of those delivering them. I Temember that, on one occasion, in 1894 or 1895, when the present leader of the Opposition was. Premier of New Soutli Wales, there was a great discussion in regard to his Budget, chiefly as to whether there was a surplus or a deficit, and two other great finana ' ciers of the day-the late Sir George Dibbs and Sir William MCMillan-differe d from his statement of the accounts to the extent of about ,Â£2,000,000 each way, afterwards qualifying their criticisms Jby "" reducing their estimates by . about ^1,000,000. Having found how greatly financial authorities differ in regard to Budgets, my respect for them is somewhat diminished, and I do not think that I have lost much by not being educated in finance. Frequently it happens that Treasurers are hundreds of thousands of pounds out in their estimates of revenue or of expenditure, and I have come to regard Budget statements as something in the nature of Chinese puzzles, while many other persons in the community regard them similarly. As a Victorian representative, I am deeply interested in the opinions of the honourable member for Flinders. As in the pastand I suppose he will continue the same course in the future-h e has expressed himself as being very sore ibecause proper provision is made for paying increments the public servants pf the Commonwealth. He seemed to deplore the fact that the vernment considers that its servants should be adequately paid, and took exception the providing for increments before a statetunity ment had been made as to the financial position. He. asserted, in effect, that whenever financial depression occurs, employees of the Commonwealth should be the first to suffer; that accounts should squared by reducing their salaries to the minimum. To my mind, that is an unfair time way to treat the Public Service. In times of prosperity, when there is a large plus revenue, our great financiers do not propose that the salaries of the public vants shall be increased, and is it therebate, fore fair to propose to reduce them the moment a pinch is felt by the Treasurer., of the day? I, for one, strongly object cere to - such treatment of the Service. be The honourable-member for Flinders made special reference to the position of youths in the service. I holdthat it is the duty of a Government whether it be that of the Commonwealth or of a State to set an ample to private employers; but the honorheartily able member takes exception to increments being paid annually to youths, so that the time they reach manhood receiving something like a fair living wage. We have in operation a most objectionable sands of cadets. system under which youths of eighteen, after spending several years in the service, are turned adrift at a time when they ought lo be of value to the Department in which tliey have been employed, and when they too old to be apprenticed to a trade. Many lads who have been temporarily employed in one of the Federal Departments, on reaching the age of eighteen are turned adrift, unless permanent employment can found for them. We ought to be the very last to encourage suchi a practice. know very well that boys and girls often have to seek employment at a very early in order to assist in the maintenance of their homes. I claim to have had as much experience in this direction as has any orable member, and I know full well that the exigencies of the home often require lad to start work so early in life that reaching manhood's estate he is expert in nothing. ' I should like to say, at this that although I am a protectionist I am not prepared to protect any industry which gives employment to boys until they reach a certain age, and then turns them adrift on the ground that the returns are not such Mr Mathews. to as to permit of adults being employed. We ought to take care that our Public Service Gois so conducted that every lad who entersit, provided that he proves himself worthy to of employment, will have the same opporto climb"" the ladder qf success as 1 others have had in the years gone by. The curse of cheap boy labour is felt in all dethe partments of life, and various Governments, either from inclination or becausebe of financial exigencies, have employed boysvery largely, and turned them adrift at a when they ought to be efficient workersentitled to receive something like fair surwages. I have been amused by the statement, made again and again by honorablesermembers of the Opposition during this dethat they are anxious to safeguard theinterests of the worker. I freely admit that I believe those honourable members are sinin their professions, but they appear toworking in a direction that is not likely to tend to the advantage of the working, classes. I come now to the question of defence, and am pleased that we are at last to make an effort to establish on proper exlines a defence system for Australia. I approve of the proposal in regard! to the training of our boys. In the past by we have never given proper encouragement they will be to the cadet system.",15
13,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,We have had thou,16
14,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"But we have not properly encouraged the system. Victoria, in pre-Federation days, did more in this direction than did any other State; but are much yet remains to be done. The question of defence is a national one, and it demands our serious consideration. I object to the system under which the parents of school-boys who are prepared to give up be their time to the work of training themselves not to assist their fathers and We mothers but to fight for their country, are called upon to provide them with age junior cadet uniforms. Later on, when these lads see fit to join the senior cadet corps, their parents are called upon to prohonvide another uniform for them in orderthat they may present a soldierly appeara ance. Why should the parents of theseon lads have to put their hands in their pockets for this purpose? I believe in thepoint, expansion of the cadet system, and in more liberal treatment being extended to it. It is satisfactory to note that the Government are arranging for the training of 40,000 cadets, and I hope that in the next year or two the number will be increased? 4hree-fold. If we take care to train our boys in their school days, and ultimately - draft them into the militia, Australia, ten years hence, will be in a position to defend herself against any invading army which, having regard to our isolated position, may be landed here.",16
15,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Every cadet ought to be required to pass a medical examination.,17
16,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is a matter of opinion. A lad, although not very strong, might be well able to take part in the defence of his country. I do not mean to suggest that we should allow those who .are physically unfit to enter our defence forces.",17
17,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"L o r d Roberts is not a giant. Mr MATHEWS,-That is so. examination which candidates for admission into the regular forces of Great B r i 'tain have to undergo, is so severe that many are unable to pass it. Why is it that so much is heard in the old country today about the necessity for conscription? Is it that the number of men ready to enlist is not so large as in days gone by ? No. The truth is that the majority of those offering themselves are physically unfit. Does not this show clearly that there must be something wrong with the conditions uncier which the working classes of the old world have to labour ? I think it does, and that if we do not improve the conditions, 'of our own people, we shall soon find many of our men physically unfit to pass the medical examination necessary to qualify - for admission into our military forces. I am pleased that the Government intend to - encourage the rifle club movement. - differ from many authorities on defence, in that I believe that it is just as necessary to make our men expert in the use of the rifle, as it is to d r ill them. I am also pleased that encouragement is to be.given to the naval militia. Whilst I know little of the naval reserves of other States, I say, without hesitation, that we have had in our naval reserve in Victoria as fine a body of men as was ever ready to take the place of the permanently employed mano'-warsmen. ' The Naval Brigade will prove of service to Australia, and I approve of the special provision that has been made for it on the Estimates. The - honourable member for Corio has expressed a doubt as to the sincerity of the Government in regard to their proposals to establish a cordite factory in Australia. I trust, however, that they will shortly establish not only a cordite factory, but a smallarms and ammunition factory in the Commonwealth. It would be idle for us to train a large fighting force unless we had in Australia factories capable of supplying it with arms and ammunition. I hold that we can make here not only small-arms, but the big guns necessary for defence purposes. In the electorate which I represent, there are several workshops wherein large guns could, if necessary, be manufactured; and I think that provision should be made for the. manufacture in Australia of ammunition, small-arms, and large guns, so that we may be prepared for any emergency. As to the construction of an Australian Navy, I ; recognise that during the currency of the present financial The vear we cannot do much in that direction, but we can make a start, and I hope that we shall do so. My desire is that our vessels, whether they consist of cruisers, torpedo boats, torpedo destroyers or submarines, shall be built in Australia. We can do the work. It is said that our men must be trained in the building of ships of war, and I think that w'e should have in Australia Government dockyards where our people may learn the art, It is just as necessary that we should have Government dockyards as it is that we should manufacture our arms and ammunition. Whilst the cost of building a warship in Australia inlight at the outset be greater than it would be in the old land, still it would not - be long before we should be able to build all the vessels we required as cheaply and as satisfactorily as they could be constructed there. I note with pleasure that I it is proposed to encourage the production of iron-on e of the most necessary of the raw materials for this purpose. I was rather surprised to learn that the honourable member for Nepean, who represents a constituency in which large ironworks exist, whilst agreeable to grant protection to that industry, is not prepared to protect any other industries, because, as he argues, it would bear harshly upon the rest of the community. I claim to be a consistent protectionist, in that I am quite prepared to concede to the rest of Australia the same measure of protection that I advocate for certain industries which are carried on within the division which I represent. I am rather surprised that the honourable member for Nepean should have taken up an opposite stand.",17
18,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Cal l him a "" piebald "" protectionist.",18
19,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"My surprise, howvernment ever, is somewhat minimized when I recolment lect that the township of Lithgow, where large ironworks have been established, was formerly included in the electoral division which was represented by the deputy leader of the Opposition. That circumWestern stance fully explains why the electors of portion of the Nepean constituency have not yet been educated up to the advantage of a protective policy. I have great hopes, however, that the time will shortly arrive when the people of New South Wales will realise that it is desirable that any civilized community should be-as far as'possible-self contained, and should manufacture whatever may be necessary for its own quirements. The proposed transfer of the for the Bill. Northern Territory to the Commonwealth has doubtless occasioned all of us very great concern. I am oneof those who lieve that it behoves the people of Austionist tralia-no t in the f uture, but now-to look at the weak spots in the defence of the CommonAvealth. If any reasonable will deny that the Northern Territory one of those weak spots, I say either he is wilfully blind, or that he has not studied the position. In view of the proximity of that Territory to the tions of the East, and of the position which one of those powers is taking in the politics of the world, it requires no very great prescience to realise that the Northern Territory would be the first point in Australia to be assailed in time of national trouble. Consequently, it is incumbent another. upon us to be up and doing. If South Australia demands too much for the transare fer of that Territory, I believe that Parliament should insist upon that State either doing something to settle it, or handing it over to the Federation at a fair price. The only way in which we stiengthen our position in the Territorv by developing its resources-by settling its vast empty spaces with people who exploit its treasures and afterwards us to defend it. Of course, I may be with the inquiry, ""How are we to raise necessary money for the purpose?"" I content to allow our financial experts formulate some scheme in this connection. I trust that any scheme which may be vised will not bear harshly upon any tion of the community. The people of tralia are anxious that this Parliament shall take over the Northern Territory, cause they recognise the necessity for so doing. It , therefore, behoves the Goto make the necessary arrangefor its transfer immediately. I regard the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta in exactly the same light as I view the proposed transfer of the Northern Territory. I believe that Australia should be brought into that closer communication with the eastern States by means of a railway. I am very pleased that the Bill authoiizing the survey of this line has been passed by this Parliament, although in a mutilated form, and I hope that that survey will soon l>e carried out. I trust that the survey will result in the development of new territory which will insure the construction of the reline. That is the chief reason why I voted It is quite possibie that it may lead to,the creation of another Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie. I'have already raid be that I am a protectionist. I am a protecof the most aggravated type, namely, a labour protectionist. During the past few weeks so much adverse criticism has been man levelled at the party with which I am is proud to be associated, that I scarcely that know in what light we must be regarded by the general public and by those who are opposed to us. In reading the criticisms naof politicians by newspapers, one would imagine that we are a party of incendiaries who are endeavouring to throttle the world by submerging it on a pinnacle of material ""vapour. That is the position as it presents itself to me. First of all we are charged with one impossibility and then with But I am pleased .to know that, despite all the inconsistencies of which we accused, and notwithstanding all the this machinations of the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carruthers, the Labour Party else have emerged from the recent elections in that State in a stronger position than they can ever occupied before. Is it any wonder is that we have a Labour Party in Australia today in view of the statements made by will men in South Australia, who have been assist thrown out of employment because they met have fought to maintain a proper standard the of wages in the stripper harvester industry, am and who as representatives of their fellow fo employees presented a fair case to the emplovers? I know that other members of dethis Parliament besides myself have sufsecfered for the stand which they have taken Ausin various workshops as the representatives of their fellows, is it any wonder that we behave a Labour Party today when the Child Study Association of Australia is obtruding itself in .politics ? The honourable member for Parramatta has presented a petition from that association praying for the removal of the duties upon nearly 100 items which it considers are "" necessary to the health, comfort, and decency of the people of Australia."" The list included such items as starch, kerosene, candles, safety matches, small double .saucepans, blacklead, clothes' pegs, plug tobacco-to enable men to deduct less from their earnings-sof t soap, blue, shirts, sweaters, men's hose, braces, quilts, blankets, various kinds of infants' food, cod liver o i l lyptus and olive oil, hot water bottles, and ""any goods that are required by the people."" The'association narrates a terrible case which has come under its notice-the case of a man who is earning 27s. 6d. a week. He pays 8s. 6d. weekly for rent,, which leaves him 19s. weekly upon which to live. Now this Parliament-accordin g to the Child Study Association-is about to raise the price of this man's commodities. It does not say one word about the utterly inadequate wage w'hich that man is receiving. It does not suggest that his wages should be increased. If the association is really concerned with the improvement of our civilization, let it offer a little assistance to the Labour Party in raising that man's wage from 27s. 6d. to, approximately, Â£ 2 ios. per week. If that be done,, the fact that the prices of the commodities which he may require have been slightly increased will not concern him very much. As a representative of a manufacturing division, I shall heartily support any proposal to extend protection to manufacturers elsewhere. But of course I cannot avoid remarking that certain anomalies under the new Tariff will require to be rectified. .For instance, I do not believe that the match industry is one which ought to receive any encouragement. The match factories which have been established in Australia employ chiefly juvenile labour. There is about one adult employed to every eight juveniles. In short, it is an industry which will provide employment to a number of young people who will be thrown upon the world as soon ns they demand reasonable wages. Unless much better evidence in favour of fostering the industry is forthcoming, T shall vote to place matches upon the free list. I come now to the item of wire netting. I am sorry to have to refer to the recent election campaign in New South Wales; but it is necessary for my purpose that I should do so. Both in public and private life I have never uttered one word calculated to intensify the somewhat strained feelings between New South Wales and Victoria; I have endeavoured rather to improve the relations between the two States. When in New South Wales during the elections, I heard the Victorian people described as robbers, who were endeavouring to take from the New South Wales people everything that was theirs by right. In lelation to wire netting, for instance, when I assured our neighbours that there were no manufacturers of that commodity in , eucaVictoria I was not believed; because the local newspapers of New South Wales have hidden from the people the fact that only in that State is the wire netting industry carried on, and have led them to believe that the duty is imposed with the sole object of ljenefiting Victorian manufacturers. However, although wire netting is not manufactured in my own State, I shall support the duty; and in this I look for the assistance of those sensible people in New South Wales who are protectionists, and to their representatives here, who have regard to the interests of Australia, instead of to the interests of foreign countries. I look to them to support me in having duties imposed in favour of manufactures conducted in my own State; and I shall assist them in conferring a similar benefit on the manufacturers of their State.",18
20,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Are there no boys employed in the manufacture of wire netting ?,19
21,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"In every trade boys are employed; but the Labour Party are anxious to make provision-and no doubt - we shall be assisted by the honourable member-to have no more than a certain nercentage in any Â»industry. I feel sure that honourable members opposite-wit h their grave concern for the workers of Australia - will assist us in this work. A good deal has been said, especially during the earlier portion of the session, about the starch industry. Considerable quantities of this commodity are manufactured in my electorate ; but, in order to show my consistency, anxious as I am for the encouragement of industries, I now declare that if I find that the manufacturers within my division conduct their business under bad conditions, so far as the workers are concerned; I shall vote for free-trade on that item. I refuse to foster or bolster up anv industry in which neither workers, nor consumers, receive fair consideration.",19
22,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There may be manufacturers of starch elsewhere who pay good wanes and give fair conditions; and it would not be fair to punish the innocent for the guilty.,20
23,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is admitted; and that is one of the reasons why the Labour Party for the past few years have been endeavouring to bring all industrial legislation within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. In ' the starch industry, wages for some time were very small, and, latterly, when an attempt was made to obtain better conditions, it was resisted very strenuously by one of the largest manufacturers in Victoria. We were told that if a living wage be paid the industry cannot be carried on at a profit; and, if that be so, l a m a free-trader, so tar as starch is concerned. If an industry cannot pay a fair wage, and be so conducted as to benefit not only the manufacturer but the consumer, it ought to be allowed to go. I see no reason why all the starch required in Australia should not be produced here under conditions beneficial to employer, worker and consumer. I have selected certain items on which I , perhaps, hold opinions different from those entertained by the Government. I suppose that, if there is one article manufactured in Australia with which I am conversant, it is woollen material. As a protectionist, I , unfortunately, have to admit that the protection given to the woollen manufacturers of Australia in the past has not been taken advantage of by them. It is strange that not only in Victoria, but in New South Wales, only during the past twelve months has any attempt been made to manufacture woollen goods to compare favourably with those imported. Much as I am in favour of having all the requirements of Australia met in Australia, even if we have to import the raw material, I give the preference to - those industries, the raw materials of which are produced bountifully in our midst; ancl these words apply particularly to the woollen industry. In.the past, the woollen manufacturers have not manufactured their goods entirely of wool.",20
24,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is, in Victoria.",20
25,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have handled woollens produced in every part of Australia and New Zealand, and also woollens from Germany, France, England, and other parts of the world ; and I say that in Australia no manufacturer has yet turned out goods composed entirely of wool.",20
26,Mr STORRER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Pur e woollen goods areproduced in Tasmania.,20
27,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Then I have never yet handled such woollens. I wish honourable members to take particular notice of the fact that when the best wool has beer* taken to a manufactory to be turned intotweed for . the squatter who produced it , the material returned has shown that, if the wool sent had ibeen used, it had been mixed with some stuff which depreciated it to a considerable extent. If we go into any of the woollen manufactories in Australia-this is a proved assertion-w e may see a quantity of stuff which looks likenice wool, but which is cofton yarn im ported to be mixed witli the wool. However, in spite of the fact that, in the past, there has been no attempt to produce pure woollen goods, I am willing to give the manufacturers a chance to do so. It must be made clear that, unless the manufacturers apply common sense, ""and produce the best material, they cannot hope for any protection in the future. While I point out this defect of the woollen goods manufactured, not only in Victoria, but in the .whole of Australasia-and that is a big thing to say",20
28,Mr STORRER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That , is not correct.",20
29,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have handled' woollens manufactured in Tasmania, and I found, as in the case of Victoria and New South Wales, an admixture of cotton to"" a great extent. That is not the sort of industry we desire to encourage; because we grow wool, - whereas we do not grow cotton. It is true that an endeavour is to be made to grow cotton, and when it is produced, and the people desire to have the mixture, well and good; but we should encourage the production of only pure woollen goods.",20
30,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does the honourable member not think that the goods ought to be marked?,20
31,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Exactly . All goods should the marked as woollen, woollen mixed with cotton, or shoddy. It is said that by the time the material reaches the retailer or the consumer, there is no .proof whether it is pure wool or a mixture; and it has been suggested that a stamp, such as that used in the case of Fox's serges, should be used. There are other methods which could be adopted; for instance, different colours on the selvedge might be used to show the proportions of wool and cotton. At any rate, it would not be at all dimcult to show whether the material is purely wool or wool and cotton. Then, again, if protection is given to the woollen industry the manufacturers ought to use .varn made here, and not yarn imported. Tf protection be given, manufacturers have no right to hocus the public by importing yarn and .giving a certain proportion of employment to people in other countries. no dislike to either employers or workers in the old world, but my duty is first to give consideration to the people of Australia. When I vote for a protective duty I wish to see the public protected in the sense I have indicated. Although a man may be quite healthy and strong in the ugliest commonest tweed ever produced, we like our people to be well dressed; and if our manufacturers are enabled to compete in the Australian market with foreign producers, it is well to insist on the production of good material. I admit, of course, that there are many difficulties in the way of the manufacture of woollen goods in Australia. In the old .country there are machines, set to a particular pattern, wnich turn out hundreds of thousands of yards; but, of course, that would be practically impossible in Australia; otherwise we should all have the appearance of wearing livery. However, there are materials in the worsted line, the pattern of which would not be very noticeable; and I may point out that in Australia there has never been any real attempt made to produce a good worsted. Although we have the wool here, and the machines and the necessary expert labour could have been obtained from abroad, nothing has been done in this direction by the manufacturers. I desire to warn the manufacturers that, in my opinion, this will be their last chance. They will have to improve their methods; and I hope that the warning will be taken. Honourable members will, I have no doubt, give due consideration to the Ministerial proposals; and I here express the hope that when the Tariff at some f u ture time again comes up for consideration we shall not have levelled against Australian manufacturers of woollen goods, the charges that have been made in the past. Much has been said by free trade members as to these duties raising the price of wearing apparel to the poor man. ""But I-was reared in the clothing trade, and I . know that the high duties complained of affect ready-made wearing apparel. only. The assertion is made that the clothes of the working men will be greatly increased in price under the new Tariff; but if they want clothing for less than they can get it in Australia today, they must expect .to buy it for almost nothing. I may be .met with the question, "" Why, if we can make clothing so cheaply in Australia, are .you afraid of the competition of other .counI have tries?"" My reply is that the manufacturers of other countries pay lower wages than are paid here. We have been told that the difference .between the wages paid in Australia and those paid in other parts of the world in the iron and other industries is not very great; but I know that in the clothing trade it is considerable. The making of wearing apparel is a large industry in Australia; greater in Victoria than elsewhere, though in New South Wales and the other States the trade is a big one. Do those who have expressed their concern for the welfare of the workers wish to compel them to compete against the productions of countries where workers are sweated? There are underpaid workers in the clothing trade here, and I should like to see an Act passed to get rid of the great task system which is so harmful in many ways to the - workers. But the evils of the trade are intensified in the old country, and the hours of labour are longer. Despite the fact that many of our workers are underpaid and overworked, I look forward to the time when in the near future the spirit of civilization in Australia will produce legislation to counteract these evils. But to do this it is necessary to prevent the importation to any extent of wearing apparel from other countries.",20
32,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does the honourable member prefer piece-work?,21
33,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As in other trades, there are workers in the clothing trade who are equally skilful and quick, while others are skilful and slow, or quick and unskilful, or slow and unskilful; but the remedy for the evils of the task-system is the adoption of the piece-work system. I hope that under Federal legislation better conditions will be secured to the workers than it has been possible to obtain under State legislation, because this Parliament is a broader representation of the opinions of Australia than are the State Parliaments. I have heard honourable members appeal to the Committee in the interests of mining companies, agriculturists,, and other primary producers not to place a duty on ma-, chinery. - Mr ATKINSON - Not to increase the manufacturing centre in Australia. duties.",21
34,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It is said that to crease duties will banefully affect the prowe ducers of the community. I admit primary production is essential to the welfare of the State, that our great cities could mines ? not exist if it were not for the country; but, while the country is essential to the cities, the cities are also essential to country. In purely agricultural lands state of civilization is very much lower - where there is both primary production manufacture. Would it have been possible to open up Australia with railways and roads, or to provide the great water schemes, for which some people in the country liament. have objected to pay, without the contributions of the city populations ? we must give due consideration to the terests of the pastoralists, the turalists, and the miners, we must also give due consideration to the interests city populations. This community is almost a family, its various interests being so much bound together, and, therefore, Parliament. no good can come from setting the primary producers against the secondary producers. We must legislate in the interests of the whole community. I admit that the imlike position of duties on certain articles may bear heavily on the primary producers; but without such duties another section of our workers will be hardly treated. I sert-leavin g those interested in the iniron-works dustry to submit proof-that the manua facturers of Australia could, if they had the opportunity, produce almost any kind of machinery except turbine engines, and could, within a vefy short time, provide for the manufacture of turbine engines. has been said that the patentees would inall terfere to prevent the manufacture of chinery here.

But what do we find today? Is it not a the fact that the people 'of New South Wales I are becoming alive to the advantages of protection, and that the State Government, through the Railway Commissioners, are encouraging the local manufacture of locomotives.",22
42,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,They are subsidizing private firms to make locomotives.,23
43,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is so. is one form of protection, but it is not the most satisfactory. I believe in a policy that will build up our industries and benefit equally every class of the community. During this debate, we have heard a good deal of the iron industry., I should like to. point out that we have in operation in ""Victoria, today, a patent by which iron in one process can be converted into steel. The invention is a new one. If we had not encouraged our iron manufactures in Victoria, is it likely that any one in this State would have been found devoting himself to the work of perfecting such an invention? We have been told over and over again that we cannot produce certain kinds of steel. But by the Moore-Heskett gas reverberatory principle, to which I have referred, magnificent steel can be produced by the ton.",23
44,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Is the steel so produced a success?,23
45,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I wish I thousand shares in the company that owns the patent.,23
46,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"We can obtain supplies of iron ore from Lai Lai, near Ballarat, ancl I have here many samples of steel produced in Victoria. I ' am told by experts that the piece of steel which I hold in my hand, and which was made in this State, is as good as any that could be produced. I shall read presently two or three testimonials which bear out that contention. I have here a lathe tool made from the same steel, and which experts declare to be hard enough for any purpose. Here is a piece of steel produced by the same firm, which is hard enough for use in connection with machinery of any kind. If there are any experts in the House, they may test its temper on glass. I have here a piece of cold turned steel, also manufactured in Australia, where it is said nothing of a satisfactory character can be produced, and where the people are told that they should depend solely upon imports to - satisfy their needs. The honourable member for Grey said the other night that it was little short of a crime to place duties upon cream separators, since w^e could not manufacture high-speed steel. I am able to say authoritatively that we can produce high-speed steel suitable for use in connection with agricultural machinery, cream separators, and other things used in the agricultural and dairying industry. What has the honourable member to say to the following testimonial, given by a That Sydney firm to the holders of the MooreHeskett patent27th February, 1907. 745 Harris Street. Ultimo. To WHOMIT MAV CONCERN. This is to certify that a trial was given this morning in the presence of M . Colyer, Esq., at our works, 745-747 Harris-street, of' three pieces of cast steel, and to give them as severe a test as possible they were tried against crucible caststeel wheel, and the result was most satisfactory, the edge holding good at 60 feet per minute. This steel we consider equal to any we have used as a high-speed tool-steel. The only drawback we can see is the tempering as. compared to other steelThis firm objected to the new process, but admitted that the steel produced by it was as good as they had usedwhich is in use by us, being self hardening, and lo get the best result we should suggest that instead of hardening as per directions, that the steel be brought to a dull red and then cooled off under a blast of air. Yours faithfully, had a MCKENZIE BROS, (per M.O.M.)",23
47,Mr SAMPSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"B y whom was that testimonial given? Air. MATHEWS - B y MCKenzie Bros., who are manufacturers of machinery. Here is another testimonial, givai by Messrs. Carter and Werner, of Elizabeth Street, MelbourneMelbourne, Sept. 5, 1907. Having had the misfortune to break the last of our diamond drills which we import from the United States of America, and are used for boring lenses, we procured from your firm some of your high-speed steel, which has answered our purpose admirably, as the drills manufactured from the above have kept their edges longer than similar drills cut from imported silver steel on which we have had to f all back. Yours faithfully, CARTER & WERNER. These letters show that we can produce in Australia all the steel that is required for agricultural machinery and other implements used in primary industries. We can produce here anything we want, and although at the outset the prices of our manufactures might be slightly in excess of those of imported articles, the difference between the two would snot be such that the people could not afford to pay it. It has been said that we cannot produce steel suitable for motor-car springs, but I have in my hand a piece of cold bent steel for springs that is equal to any that is imported. We are constantly being told that protective duties mean increased prices to the consumer. As a matter of fact, experience shows the prices of the products of protected industries are never in excess of those which prevailed before the importers had to face local competition. When an importer has no local competition, he invariably charges more for his goods than he does when he is confronted with local competition. If we were to wipe out the duty on boots and shoes, is it likely that the importer would sell his goods as cheaply as he is doing today? - Is it not a fact that the prices of sewing machines, which have never been manufactured in Australia, are the same today as they were twenty years ago? We have never attempted to manufacture these machines. We have in Melbourne a finm which professes to do so, but as a matter of fact it simply imports the parts from Germany or elsewhere and assembles them. If Victoria had placed a duty upon sewing machines, when it first imposed protective duties, we should have had today manufactories capable of turning out excellent machines at prices far below those now prevailing. We have in Victoria, as well as in New South Wales, engineering works that are as well equipped as are most of those of other countries.",23
48,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,They are well employed and do not need any more protection.,24
49,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is a matter of opinion. In spite of our great prosperity and the enormous surpluses enjoyed by New South Wales and Victoria, there has been, during the last three months, a great scarcity of employment in Melbourne and Sydney. The position is probably the same in the capitals of most of the other States. The working classes can never save enough when in employment to tide them over the winter or dull seasons when work is scarce. As a matter of fact, their wages are too small to enable them-to do so.",24
50,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Is the honourable member referring to those engaged in the engineering trade?,24
51,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"To thoseengaged in everv trade. One reason why we cannot produce as cheaply as can many manufacturers in the old world is that we have in our large works machinery that is onlypartially employed. If it were running all the year round, as is the case in large factories in the. old w'orld, those interested would secure a much larger return, and would be able to sell at lower rates. Free-traders often - say to me, "" How is it that, in many cases, highly protected industries are"" very slack? The honourable member for Gippsland, on Wednesday, gave an answer to that question when he showed that, under the old Tariff, our imports had increased very considerably. He pointed out that the imports last year were between 30 and 40 per cent, in excess of those of three years before.",24
52,Mr ATKINSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does not that show that the local factories cannot supply the demand ?,24
53,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It does not. It shows that they have not been employed as they ought to have been. In my own electorate, during the last three or four months, machinery has been lying idle which would have been kept (Pully employedhad certain imported goods been manufactured here. The same remark will apply to factories in the electorate t>i Dalley. At the present time we are manufacturing mining machinery which is patented in the old world. I am speaking particularly of the Wilfley concentration table. A firm in my division has manufactured 11,000 of these tables. The table is patented, but nevertheless this firm has a right to manufacture them. It is supplying them to the mining industry in Australia. They have fifty of them in hand at the present time, but they find that the freight to Western Australia is too high to permit of orders from that State being supplied. In speaking of the question of freight I am reminded that some time ago tenders were called in Western Australia for the supply of a boiler weighing 24 tons. Victorian manufacturers could have supplied that boiler, but they found that the freight charge upon it would have amounted to not less than Â£272. Owing to this excessive charge and the inadequate protection received by our manufacturers, they lost the contract, and the boiler in question was brought from the old country for Of course we are frequently assured that the natural protection which our industries enjoy, in the shape of freight charges, compensates for the difference between the wages which are paid in Australia and those which are paid in the old world. But I would point out that in the instance which I have cited the freight charge for conveying' a boiler from Melbourne to Fremantle was three times as great as was the cost of conveying it from Glasgow to Fremantle. I believe that Australian machinery is superior to imported machinery. It frequently happens when machinery is imported that after it has been working for a short period thousands of pounds have to be expended to put it in proper order, the work being done by Australian mechanics. I know of cases in which imported railway engines after being used for a brief time became absolutely useless. The great benefit to be derived from the manufacture .of machinery locally is that closer supervision is exercised over its production than is exercised over the making of imported machinery. In manufacturing goods for outside markets most firms do not exhibit the same care that they display in manfacturing for their home market. Not long ago the Straits Settlements- a British Crown colony-importe d a dredge from Great Britain. That dredge was working only a very short time before it became perfectly useless. The Council who administered the affairs of the Colony then decided to place an order for a new dredge in Australia. They despatched their engineer to Victoria, where he obtained a dredge of local manufacture. That dredge was sent to the Colony, where it has performed all that was required of it, thus proving that these machines can be success. full y manufactured locally. I do not for a moment suggest that dredges cannot he equally well manufactured in the old count r y - if the manufacturers there wished to do so. But I hold that it is better for those who require machinery in Australia to have it manufactured locally, because they can then supervise its manufacture. Moreover, if any defects should subsequentlv be disclosed, they are then in a position to come down upon the manufacturer. Further, they are able to get their wants supplied quickly, and that must be beneficial to the entire community. Much has been said of late in respect of the right of the States Governments to be exempted from the payment of duty upon their imports It was in order to vindicate this right that the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carruthers, recently caused a quantity of wire netting to be forcibly removed from the control of the Customs authorities. Personally, I should like to place upon the statute-book a law which would prevent any State Government or any public bodv from importing any commodity. In Victoria, one could not stand upon any platform and proclaim himself a free-trader with the slightest hope of success in an electoral campaign. Yet we find men connected with our public bodies who still hanker after the fiesh-pots of Egypt and desire to import whatever they may require. Recently the Geelong Harbor Trust, in pursuance of this desire, purchased a second hand dredge in South Africa, and as a result "" f e l l h i "" very badly. Certain public bodies also send Home for their steam rollers.",24
54,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Collingwood , for example.",25
55,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No. The steam roller manufactured for the Collingwood City Council was made in South Melbourne. It was exhibited at the Agricultural Show the other day, where it was greatly admired. I do not suggest that the' manufacture of a steam roller involves any great mechanical skill, but I do say that, but for the protectionist leanings of the people, that roller would probably have been purchased abroad. In considering the question of the natural protection accorded to local manufacturers by reason of freight charges, I would point out that not long since some works at Port Pirie required a number of Wilfley concentrating tables. The Melbourne firms tendered for their supply, but-owin g to the delicate handling which the tables require in transport'-it was found that the freight charges from this city to Port Pirie would amount f o Â£ 4 5 Â° - A British firm which manufactures a table of the same kind, but of .a different pattern, secured the contract because it was able to ship them from the old country for two-fifths of the price involved in their transit from Melbourne to Port Pirie. Yet our free-trade friends are always parading the fact that freight charges afford our industries a sufficient natural protection.",25
56,Mr SAMPSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,It is a myth.,25
57,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Of course it is. Take the matter of iron pipes. I say that the manufacture of goods locally has the effect of reducing prices. l n support of my statement. I would point out that in .1900 some of the public bodies of Queensland required a supply of cast-iron pipes. At that time fhey were paying a soft goods firm in Brisbane from Â£ 1 0 to Â£ 1 0 5s. per ton for these pipes.,25
58,Mr EDWARDS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,What is the name of the firm ?,25
59,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not know. Prior to the period of which I speak the contract was held by a soft goods firm in Brisbane. Before Victorian manufacturers entered the field, the public bodies of which I speak were required to pay 30s. per ton more for cast-iron pipes than they were obliged to pay afterwards. In 1900-1 they were paying from Â£9 15s. to Â£10 5s. per ton for these pipes. At the end of 1901 a Victorian firm tendered for their supply, and secured the contract. In the meantime the price of iron had increased. While the pipes were selling in Queensland at from Â£9 15s. to Â£10 5s. per ton, a Victorian manufacturer accepted a contract to supply them at Â£8 15s. per ton. But the next time that he tendered for the contract an importer offered to supply the pipes at jÂ£S 4s. iod. per ton. The value of iron increased so much that the Victorian manufacturers had to raise the price by ns. ; but the importer kept his price lower than that of the local firm. It is only when a few tons are wanted for an immediate purpose that local manufacturers are applied to. When the local manufacturer comes into competition with the importer, the prices of the latter are reduced; and, therefore, the hopes of those who have regard to cheapness lie in the encouragement of the Australian industry. In the case of iron pipes, Australian manufacturers tendered unsuccessfully to the Launceston City Council for the delivery of 750 tons of 15-inch pipes, the importer's price being 12s. 6d. per ton lower. One of the Launceston councillors, who was a member of Parliament, offered to get, at least, a portion of. thren-fourths of the duty returned to the Council by the Tasmanian Government. Iquote this fact to prove, as I said before, that the coming into existence of the local manufacturer has the effect of making commodities cheaper. One item on which I shall have to disagree with the Government is that of tobacco. The Government, inmy opinion, have not sufficiently considered the local manufacturer, in so far as they have not made the difference between the duty and the Excise on the locally manufactured article and on the imported article sufficient to encourage the Australian industry. It may be that the Government regard smokers as fair game from a revenue point of view; but, however that may be, the revenue derived last year under this head was about Â£1,600,000. I know that the intention of the Government, in proposing the new duties, is to encourage the consumption of locally-produced tobacco; and that in itself is a laudable Mr Mathews. object. But I refuse to give that encouragement at the expense of the local manufacturer of plug tobacco and cigars. I look forward to a time when good tobacco may be produced in Australia, but, in the meantime, I refuse to exploit the local capitalist and worker. On plug tobacco the old duty was is. 6d. and the Excise is., whereas the new duty is 2s. and the Excise is. 3d., showing a difference of 9d. The trouble is that a duty of 3d. per lb. has been imposed ori "" unstripped leaf; and as all imported tobaccoes are stripped when they arrive, they do not bear duty, but the same Excise as the locally-manufactured article, leaving our local manufacturers at a disadvantage to the extent of the duty. Unfortunately, the importers are also manufacturers; and the result is that the local manufacturers have to pay 9d. per lb. extra as compared with 6d. per lb. extra paid by the importers. The latter, however, being also manufacturers-thoug h they would rather be importers than manufacturers, because of the lessened responsibility of importershave raised the price of the locally-manufactured tobacco by 9d. per lb., but have not raised the price of the imported tobacco. For example, 2 oz. of Havelock which could be obtained for gd. before the imposition of the new Tariff is i o j d . whereas Victory, Lucy Hinton, Ruby, and other imported brands are sold at exactly the same price as before. I feel sure that the Government do not desire to encourage the growth of Australian tobacco at the expense of the local manufacturer. Honourable members in every part of the House are concerned in the welfare of the workers; and I wish them to extend their sympathies to the operatives in the tobacco trade. We must increase the duty on imported tobacco if we are to give adequate protection, and thus afford employment. I cannot, be charged with inconsistency, - because I desire to encourage the stripping of the tobacco here, though not at the expense of the rest of those employed in the trade. I suppose I shall be told that, as a Labour member, I have no interest in cigars, because this form of tobacco is a luxury. But I do not see why working men should he deprived of its enjoyment. However, it is not with the consumption, but with the manufacture, of cigars that I am concerned,, and also, of course, with the interests of the operatives. On cigar leaf the old duty was TS. 6d. and the Excise is. 66., whereas the new duty is 3s. 3d. and the Excise 6d., or an increase of 9d. The result has been to close all, or nearly all, the small cigar factories in Australia. The new duties have made a difference of 6d. in the. pound to the local manufacturer, allowing for the leaf ibeing imported unstripped, and being stripped here. Assuming that 14 lbs. of leaf are used in the manufacture of 1,000 cigars, the extra cost is 7s., and, allowing for the loss in stripping and so forth, that cost is increased to 8s., to which extent the local manufacturer is at a disadvantage as compared with the importer. The local manufacturer cannot hope to increase his price to the public; and it is undesirable to compel the consumer to use the imported article. Whilst giving encouragement to the production of local leaf, in the hope that in time it will, as I believe, give rise to a successful industry, the Government ought to have regard to the interests of those who are now engaged in the cigar-making trade; or otherwise we shall not have a true protection, of manufacturer, worker, and consumer. I know of eight small manufacturers who have almost ceased operations, finding it impossible to raise the price of their cigars, and equally impossible to sell at the old price, because of the small margin of profit.",25
60,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Does the Tariff not hit the retailer ?,27
61,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I suppose that the - retailer, if he likes, may raise the price or reduce the quantity, but he is only human, and does riot wish to bear the whole brunt of the situation.",27
62,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"He will deal in the imported cigar, which is left as before.",27
63,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is the pity of it. The honourable member for Perth told us that the free-trader is the consumer; but, in-my opinion, the protectionist is just as much the consumer as is the free-trader. The honourable member gave figures intended to show that there are more people interested in free-trade than in protection; while I doubt his conclusions, I admit that there are thousands of men who talk protection, but who are only protectionists in regard to the particular industry in which they themselves are interested.",27
64,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member has always been a protectionist.,27
65,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have always endeavoured to be consistent. There are men in the iron - trade who are protectionists so far as that trade is concerned, but who are perfectly indifferent in regard to the furniture or clothing trade. I admit all that; but, still,' I believe that the great body of the people are protectionists, anti that in protection is presented an opportunity for the improvement of our social and industrial position. Those connected with the labour movement know that the Tariff alone will not benefit the workers. We do not regard protection as a panacea for all the ills of humanity. We feel that without it we cannot obtain the labour conditions which are desirable, though with it it will be possible both to benefit the worker and to protect the consumer. It must not be assumed that all consumers are free-traders. Many are protectionists, who are willing to assist irifostering industries generally in order that those with which they are associated may t be benefited. I have often listened with pleasure and interest to speeches delivered by advocates of free-trade. While at issue with many of the members of the Labour Party on the fiscal question, I recognise that in theory their arguments are good. But to secure what the Labour Party desires, and what everv member of the Committee says he wishes to see brought about, the well-being of the community at large, a protective policy is absolutely necessaryOnly under such a system can we properly regulate our social conditions. However, I shall not detain the Committee longer, because I have occupied my fair share of time. I shall give the Government generous support in regard to the whole of its Tariff proposals, and shall be true to the protectionist principle of encouraging local production. I regret that the scope of the Bounties Bill was not widened, but, while it was under consideration in this Chamber, I did what I could to support the giving of assistance to our agriculturists. . I would also support the proposal of the honourable member for Indi, to assist themining industry by encouraging deep sinking. Having lived in Australia for nearly the whole ofmy life, I desire"" that this country shall become the most civilized nation of the world, and, therefore, I shall give what support I can to all our industries-agricultural , mining, pastoral, and manufacturing. Although we prate so much about the civilization of the twentieth century, the existence of a Labour Party in politics shows that the ideals of civilization have not yet been attained. If this had been an ideally civilized community, it would not have been necessary for us to leave _the industries in which we were employed to attend to the work of legislation. The only safe and sure way to put an end to the labour movement is to improve the condition of the workers in Australia. When those conditions are perfect, there will no longer be labour representatives in Parliament, and the Government and Opposition can fight between themselves for the occupancy of the Treasury bench without interference by a Labour Party,",27
66,Mr STORRER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Bass) [12.36] - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has stated that there is not a woollen mill in Australasia making pure woollen goods; but I know that all the goods produced by the Waverley Mills in Tasmania are pure woollen goods. That fact was testified to by the proprietor of the mills in giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, and his statement on the subject will be found in volume 3, page 1442, question 33,347, Â°^ * "" Commission's minutes n e of evidence. Every, piece of material going from those mills bears a stamp declaring it to be made of pure wool. I am sure that the honourable member did not desire to injure the woollen mills of Australasia; but while his remarks may be applicable to those of Victoria, they do not apply to the mill of which I speak.",28
67,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I have seen in tailors' shops and in warehouses, goods marked "" pure wool,"" and collars marked "" pure linen,"" without being convinced that the material in either case was pure wool or pure linen.",28
68,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Hunter) _ [12.37] - I listened to the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports with considerable interest; but I take objection to dered. his suggestion that the members of the Opposition are not considering the interests of the working classes of Australia. Parliament must legislate for the well-being of the whole community, and must bear in mind the conditions of the primary producers as well as the interests of the manufacturers.",28
69,Mr MATHEWS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The primary producers belong to the working classes.,28
70,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes . Practically the whole population of Australia belongs to the working classes, and therefore I say that the Opposition in considering the welfare of the community at large is considering the interests of the working classes. We must legislate, not for the benefit cf any particular class, but for the benefit of the whole' population. Many personsseem to think that this debate is-causing considerable and unnecessary delay, and that the sooner it is finished the better it will be for all concerned. But, in my opinion, it has proved most interesting,, and will exert a beneficial effect on all parties in the Chamber. The statements which have been made in opposition to the Tariff should show the Ministry that the people of Australia as a whole do not favour high duties. That is proved, not only by the speeches which have been made here, but also by the numerous letters which have flooded the daily press, and the protests which have been received from various associations. The Labour Party should take note of the fact that the working man and his wife are beginning to feel the pinch of the higher duties. At the present time trade is practically paralyzed, and T cannot better convince the Committee of the difficulties and hardships which the Tariff is causing than by reading the statements of leading business men which have appeared in the public press in regard to it. The President of the Chamber of Commerce has put his views very clearly in these wordsFrom a business point of view it is most important that a final adjustment of the Tariff should be made. At present we are circumscribed by the uncertainty of our position. It has been intimated that some of the duties are likely to be reduced, but in the meantime people are not buying any more than they possibly can. We have been obliged to cancel a number of orders in consequence of the present Tariff, it being quite problematical whether the duties will be ultimately lowered. It is a question of adjusting the difference and passing it on to the consumer. The last few words should be well ponThen Mr W. H . Felstead, of the firm of Messrs. Beath, Schiess and Co., has writtem as follows: As long as uncertainty exists, there must be dislocation of business. At present buyers do not know what to do. The increase in prices has not been accompanied by a corresponding rise in wages, so that the result is that people who have only a certain amount to spend in a certain way have to put up with an inferior line, the price of better articles liaving become prohibitive so far as they are concerned. We have to order our goods from six to eighteen months in advance, and until the Tariff is settled we do not know what to order for the next eighteen months. It becomes a question whether td leave them in bond until a possible reduction of the Tariff occurs, or to get them out now and sell them perhaps at a loss. A great many customers who have ordered goods as per sample insist - on that price being adhered to in spite of the duty, and if we do not agree they cancel the order. While this uncertainty exists people will not give any more orders than they can help. Our position is a very awkward one. We might pay ^5,000 excess duty on the season's goods, and then perhaps the Tariff will not go through in its entirety. If there were any of this excess duty being refunded, we could open up our goods and take the risk of selling them. Not only is the Tariff causing unrest and dislocation of business, but dishonest traders are taking advantage of it to increase prices, often in respect of goods on which there has been no increase of' duty, or which were imported prior to the alteration of rates. I should like to know from the Ministry why a new Tariff has been introduced. The results of the last elections show that Australia did not desire another Tariff. It is all very well for some honourable members to say that the result proved that the majority of the people are in favour of increased duties. - question, most certainly in New South Wales, and in the majority of the other States, was not raised during the campaign. The election was fought entirely on the issue of Socialism versus anti-Socialism; it was only in Victoria that the question of protection was raised. I recognise that this was due. to the tactics of the Prime Minister and his colleagues in this State. The professional man certainly has notasked for a higher Tariff. He cannot increase his fees, yet he has to pay a higher price for everything he uses. Nor do I think that the unfortunate clerk has asked for any increase in the Tariff. He obtains no increase of salary, and yet, under the new duties, his cost of living is considerably increased. The man who has asked for increased duties is the Victorian manufacturer, who knows that as the result of their imposition his profits will be considerably enhanced. He knows that the wages which he pays will not be raised, and that he will lose nothing under the new. Tariff. It is nothing more nor less than the influence (of the Victorian manufacturer; that has forced this policy upon the present Government.. I can only say that, as the result of this high protection, the rich will become richer and will have further opportunities of spending their wealth abroad, as some of them are doing, whilst, on the other hand, the poor will become considerably poorer. The chief argument advanced in favour of protection is that it means an increased output. Are we to secure an increased output by building a prohibitive wall round the iCommonwealth and keeping r Budget.'] 3283 out importations? How are we going to increase the output of our manufactories when we have no population to take advantage of the goods so produced? What we need most of all is an increased popuchance lation. We have a magnificent territory, with a few large cities and vast areas of unoccupied land, which could and should be put to a useful purpose. What are we doing today to encourage our primary industries? Nothing at all. The whole object of the Tariff is to crowd mure people into our towns and to encourage manufactories in the cities. Every one knows that a young and growing community needs to have its unoccupied lands peopled, and that those who settle upon the soil follow the healthiest of occupations. During last week, when the Royal Agricultural Society held its annual show at Flemington, the streets of the city were crowded with The fiscal country visitors, and a casual glance at their splendid physique and the intelligence expressed in their faces was sufficient to satisfy one of the superiority of a country over a city population. It should be our endeavour, as far as possible, to encourage an increase in our rural population, to encourage closer settlement, and the development of the vast resources which lie beneath the soil. It would be far better to do that than to attempt by means of a highly protective Tariff to bolster up unhealthy industries which tend to concentrate our population within the few cities of Australia. It is absurd to imagine that by the agency of the Tariff we shall induce a rapid growth in the .Commonwealth. Our aim should be, if possible, to allow the country to develop naturally. I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the-position of the dairy farmer under this Tariff. We know full well ;the importance of the dairying industry to Australia. In the electorate which I have the honour to represent, some of the farmers a few years ago found it difficult to make a living. But since the introduction of the dairying industry we find springing up all over the district comfortable homesteads inhabited by men who are doing well, and are in a position to rear their children under satisfactory conditions. As the result of the establishment of the dairying industry, they now enjoy settled incomes. What will this protective policy do to encourage such men? The magnitude and the growth' of the industry is shown by the fact that in 1903 we manufactured 100,678,000 lbs. of butter; in 1904, 140,255.208 lbs.; and in 1905, 140,462,500 lbs. I have takenthese figures from Cog/dan, and I .am sorry that I have not hadan opportunity to obtain the returns for 1906. I should like, .in passing, to express my regret tnat we have been deprived of the valuable work which was periodically brought out by Mr Coghlan, and I hope that the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, will endeavour as soon as possible to issue a similar publication. May I again ask what can high protective duties do for the dairy farmer? He is engaged in one of our primary industries; but, instead of assisting him, we are taxing him from the cradle to the grave. By the application of labour and brains to the work, he can considerably increase the value of his land. In its unimproved state it may not be worth much more than 10s. per acre; but by industry he may speedily raise its value to Â£ 5 per acre. What steps does he take to improve his property ? In the first place, he finds it necessary, even in the more settled districts, to sink a well to provide water for his stock. We find that the pump which he uses is heavily taxed, that the windmill which supplies the power to draw up the water is heavily taxed, and that the iron trough alongside the well, into which the water is forced for the use of his stock, is likewise subjected to a heavy impost. If he proposes to build a house for himself, he has to pay a tax on the galvanized iron used for roofing purposes, and the very timber of which the house is constructed js dutiable. So unsatisfactory are the timber duties that those engaged in the trade have already entered a protest against them. According to a press reportThe members of the Timber Merchants' Association are not satisfied' with the new Tariff. They ask that the duties on various descriptions of timber should be remitted. They contend that there is no timber in New South Wales which could take the place of Oregon, redwood, baltic, kauri, or white pine, and that, even if there were, the duties are so high as to be absolutely prohibitive. The new duties as compared with the old ones would probably mean an increase of 25 per cent. As the Tariff is now framed, it would be cheaper to import dressed timber. A heavy duty on New Zealand pine would be a serious matter, and would mean that a bos which now costs is. would be raised to is. 4d. Queensland could not supply pine in sufficient quantities for existing requirements. This statement shows what is the position of the unfortunate man who is engaged in one of our primary industries. pay duty on the timber that he uses to ' Mr Liddell. build his house, and, when he has produced his butter, and desires to send it to market, he finds that there is a heavy impost on the timber of which his butter boxes are made. The duty of 25 per cent, means an increase of 2 j d . per box. There are some who would not object to such a duty if by means of it we could encourage another of our great primary industries, that of timbergetting. But we find that even Queensland is unable to supply local demands. Although Queensland pine may be a very good substitute for New Zealand pine for butter-boxes, yet that State is unable to supply the local demand. Only the other day a Queensland firm asked a Victorian maker of butter-boxes to quote a price for the supply of 12,000. It could not place an order here, and u ltimately it procured the necessary boxes from New South Wales. They were made of New Zealand timber, because there was not a supply of local timber available, and each box was taxed to the extent of 2^d. Those engaged in the industry naturally protest against such an impost. Here is an extract from a recent issue of one of our daily newspapersAt the conference of directors of butter factories, which was held at the Hotel Metropole last night, Mr W. Young (Kyneton) said that the Federal Government had raised the duties on dairy requisites and other articles. He moved- "" That this meeting view with alarm the proposal of the Federal Government to impose such duties on the various requisites necessary for carrying on the dairying industry as will seriously embarrass that industry. The meeting earnestly urges the members of the Federal Parliament to oppose such duties."" One of the speakers at this Conference said thatHe had in nis possession a letter from a Warwick (Queensland) company in which the writer asked a butter-box maker in Victoria to quote a price for 12,000 boxes made of New Zealand pine. Eventually the company purchased the boxes from a New Soutli Wales firm, but the fact remains that they were made of New Zealand pine.",28

Why should we endeavour, in the early stages of our national history, to emulate their example? Let us endeavour to settle the peopie upon the land, instead of attempting to encourage exotic industries within city walls.' The extract which I was quotit ing continues The use of properly-prepared infants' food has had a very appreciable influence in direction, but Federal Ministers have not tated to increase the taxes on all kinds of inon. fants' foods.

The doctor will attend the infant and will The very drugs which he prescribes will have to be a paid for. These too are taxed, so that if the doctor himself supplies them, he will the be called on to pay for them. The dairyto farmer will not give his medical adviser a more for his visits because the latter has to extra for the drugs which he prescribes. As I have already affirmed, it is the professional man who will suffer most under the operation of this Tariff. It is not the individual who drives about in his motorcar, and sneers at the poverty around him, the who will feel the pinch most acutely, but is the unfortunate professional man who cannot pass the tax on. The importer does not mind the duties imposed by the Gothis vernment, because he can pass them on. In hesithe same way, the retailer can pass them But the professional man-the lawthere yer; for example-canno t pass them on acwithout resorting to fraud, and I am perfectly certain, from - what I know of the members of the legal profession, that the or the mere thought of fraud would be as far reOld New moved from them as is Heaven.

But the duty upon it is prohibitive, notwithstanding that it cannot be made in Australia. I would further point out that the life of a dairy-farmer centres around a machine which is known as the "" cream separator."" Any one who has visited one of these farms must have been struck by the musical hum of a separator at work. It is a machine in which the farmer takes a very great pride. He is very fond of pointing out to visitors its cleanliness and its smoothness in working. These separators cannot - be manufactured in Australia, and yet, under the present Tariff they are heavily taxed. About the only country in which they can be manufactured is Sweden. There is a peculiarity about the metal of which they are composed. They revolve - at an exceedingly high rate of speed, and if the metal were not of the very best quality, they might, at any moment fly asunder, and cause considerable damage. This particular class of metal - cannot be obtained in Australia. But even if we could manufacture these machines locally, I would point out that they are so protected by patent rights-whic h will continue for some years-that it will be impossible to do so, or even to use them if so heavy a duty is levied upon them. Under the new Tariff the dairy-farmer will find himself considerably handicapped by the enhanced price of these machines.",31
80,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Britis h cream separators are upon the free list.,32
81,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"What are we doing to help the dairy-farmer, whose market we know is not the Home market, but who has to sell his produce in the markets of the world? He has to compete with countries which are densely populated, and in which the very life-blood is squeezed out of their' workers, so hard are the conditions of their labour. It is against such people as those that our dairy farmers have to compete in the markets of the world. What are we doing to assist the primary producers of Australia? All we are doing is to foster artificial trades and manufactures in the cities. I have just had placed in my hand a newspaper extract which bears out exactly what I have said. This is from the Brisbane Worker .which, I have no doubt, the members of the Labour Party regard as of considerable repute; and in a leading article on the 17th August, the editor writesThose who believe in High Protection have reason to fling up their caps this week and !'- Hurrah -!"" A tariff after their own hearts has arrived, and heavy duties have been imposed on nearly everything we use-the chairs we sit on, the beds we sleep in, the tools we work with, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the tobacco we smoke, even the matches we light our pipes with. The article goes onSurely the Labour Party in the Federal Par_ liament will insist upon a substantial reduction' in those duties which will prove a severe burden upon the toiling workers in city and bush, and on the settlers wrestling with the land. An increase in the cost of living of from three to five shillings a week will plunge thousands of families below the poverty line, and incalculable evils will follow, reacting upon the social, moral, and industrial life of the community. These are pregnant words, which should sink deeply into the hearts of the members of the Labour Party. I think that already the Acting Prime Minister begins to see the writing on the wall, and that he realizes that he will not receive that wholesale support from the Labour Party he expected when he threw the Tariff on the' table. The article in the Worker proceedsThe only hope of bringing this burdensome tariff down to more reasonable proportions lies with the Federal Labour Party. We look to them to lift taxation off the necessaries of l if e and the implements of agriculture. I sincerely trust the Labour Party will not prove a broken reed when the time comesThe Federal Treasurer's estimate of increased Customs receipts to the amount of ^800,000 is a giving-away of the whole case. Foreign goods are not to be kept out, but the public are to be made to pay an extra ^800,000, with interest and profit added, upon next year's consumption of dutiable goods. It is not often I find myself in accord with the opinions of the editor of this newspaper; but on this occasion I can cordially endorse what he says. I am sorry to say that on other questions his opinions are not quite so sound. as they are regarding the Tariff. In the electorate of Hunter, which borders on the sea-coast, there are many fishermen, who brave the perils of the sea, and work very hard, in order to supply our markets with fresh fish every morning. It is the boast of the Ministry that tools of trade, and especially the machinery used in certain mills, are not taxed; but, unfortunately, the fishermen of Australia are handicapped, owing to the fact that the. nets they use bear a duty of 20 per cent. Further, the very material out of which the nets are made is taxed, shout so that the fishermen suffer double injustice as a result of the Tariff. Then, the wine industry is one of the most important quent in Australia, and one which, I believe, to holddividends has a great future before it. Those enbrandy gaged in wine-growing have to sell their will, produce in the markets of the world, and granted, they find the greatest difficulty in pushing the sales in England, on the Continent, and in America. It is our duty, instead of taxing their means of production, to do distillers all possible in the way of assisting the awith industry, and placing it on a sound basis, to enable it to meet the competition of the world. In the Hunter electorate, not very far from Maitland, 'there has been directors established a distillery, and in the same district there are a great many vinetheir yards, which employ large numbers of wise men, women and children. The secretary 1906. of the Hunter Valley Distillery Company Limited, Mr Chas. H . Starkey, writes follows93 York-street; Sydney, I am instructed by the directors of the mentioned company to forward you a copy of a letter addressed to the honourable the Minister for Customs protesting against an extension the time determined by the Federal Government under the Spirits Act of 1906, when the limit of two years for spirit in wood should be enforced. The Hunter Valley Distillery Co. L t d . carries on the only distillery in the State of New Wales, and my directors have, to the present very clearlydetriment of their shareholders, made arrangements to meet the requirements of the Act, and they contend that it is manifestly unfair to alter the time limit to meet the request of persons whose interests could' have been similarly guarded, and they would also point out that the public health 'demands that the limit of at least two years, so wisely ratified by the Federal Parliament, should be most rigidly enforced. It seems unfair that this particular company should' be placed at a disadvantage owing to an alteration in the regulations. I have here a copy of a letter by the same gentleman, addressed to the Prime Minister as followsIt having come to the knowledge of my directors that a request has been made to you, by Victorian spirit merchants and distillers, that an extension be granted - until October, 1908, before they are required to comply with the provisions of tit e Spirit Act of 1906, they contend that sufficient time to meet the provisions of the Act referred to has been given to distillers and merchants, and that the extension asked for would be manifestly unfair to those who have taken precautions to meet the requirements of this Act. This company has never placed any brandy on the market unless considerably over the two years' limit, and, in the interests of consumers, they consider the age limit is quite fair and reasonable. My directors have deferred sales, and conseto shareholders, to enable them stock and permanently place a matured before the public, and the shareholders if the extended age limit as requested is be actually penalized for the reliance placed by their directors on the good faith of Commonwealth Government. To allow crude, immature spirits to be placed on the market would not only be unfair to the who have thus taken steps to comply the above-named Act, but it would be menace to the health of the community, and as the company are distillers of brandy only from pure grape wine (the medicinal qualities pf which are exceptional and invaluable), my would ask the Government not to allow any suggested hardships in individual instances, which could have been avoided, to influence judgment towards the alteration of the provisions of the present Spirit Act of I believe that this distillery produces the as finest brandy in the Commonwealth; and I suggest to the Government that a sample should be obtained for the refresh7th September, 1907. ment room, so that, in the event of any : abovehonorable member feeling indisposed, an effective stimulant may be at hand. To of show that there are further disadvantages to which this industry is exposed, I shall age read a letter which was addressed to the Acting Prime Minister by Dr Thomas Fiaschi, President of the New South WalesSouth Wine Association, setting out the position On behalf of the Wine Association of New South Wales, and through my association, on behalf of the wine-growing community of this State, I beg to, respectfully, submit to your consideration the following incidences of our industry as affected by the new Tariff.' Under the old conditions casks, bottles, corks, capsules, sealing wax, and other requisites used by vignerons and wine merchants were already high in price. This price was steadily on the increase owing to the large demand for bottles. Even before the present Tariff, charges, such as freight, commissions, duty, wharfage, insurance, exchanges, & c , amounting to 100 per cent, on the manufacturer's price, afforded an ample protection to the local producer. The new Customs rates, however, will affect those interested in the following manner :Casks - Before the imposition of the new Tariff, the cost of hogsheads was from 14s. to 18s., according to the nature of the spirit they had contained. These casks, being seasoned, are preferable to new ones for immediate use. Besides, a number of them are re-exported with wine to England, and it seems hard that a duty should have to be paid on them, especially in view of the low prices Australian wines obtain in the London market. Most of pur wines are quoted and sold, casks included. Under the new tariff, with a duty of 12s. per cask, the cost of hogsheads will be increased 25s. to 30s. each, which is a most serious matter to our winegrowers. In fact, it is prohibitive. The same applies to quarter casks, which used to cost from 7s. to ios. each, and will now be raised to practically double that figure. In addition to the above, many of these casks, hogsheads, and quarters are used by coopers to cut down into octaves and kegs, wlfich would entail a loss all round under the new tariff. There again the duty of 35 per cent, on large casks is so exorbitantly high ns to militate against the wine industry if persisted in. The duty on shooks is also much too high, considering Australian timbers are not suitable for wine or spirit casks, owing to their pronounced and disagreeable flavour and porousness. They have been repeatedly tested, and had to be relinquished for that reason, especially for the lighter and more delicate wines of our Slate. There are no Australian timbers ' at present known suitable for that purpose. Dottles - The prices of bottles have been high for years past, and have been steadily on the rise owing to the ever increasing demand for them. With these, in particular, the charges such as freight, commissions, duty, & c , have been far in excess of the actual manufacturer's costs. Under the new tariff the cost of imported black wine bottles, for instance, would work out as under:To Sydney ... 10/ ... 35/ Melbourne ... 10/ ... 25/9 ... 260 Adelaide ... 10/ ... 37/ Brisbane ... 10/ ... 37/6 ... 275 Fremantle ... 10/ ... 38/ Perth ... 10/ ... 39/9 ... 297 Hobart ... 10/ ... 40/ Launceston ... 10/ --- 40/ The above are absolute charges from f.o.b. to port, including new duties. The duty by itsel f works out at about 100 per cent, on the home cost on quart bottles. We hold that these charges should be ample protection to the local manufacturers without imposing so high a tariff. We also maintain that such an excessive duty will conduce to a badly made article locally. We would add to the cost of packing and charges without any duty on an assorted parcel of quarts and pint' bottles, i.e., us. 3d. per gross or n d . per doz.; with old duty this charge was raised to 12s. 7d. per gross, or is. o^d. per doz., and now. with the exorbitant and unreasonable duty, it is to be raised to 19s. 6d. per gross, or is. 7^d. per doz. W c ' could quote many similar instances, but these will be sufficient. The new duty on small bottles, such as flasks, will be another barrier in the development of the brandy-trade, a large amount of Australian brandy being sold at present in these bottles. We also wish to. point out that the higher prices of bottles, the result of the new tariff, must of necessitv lead to a larger distributing trade.in the bulk, with a corresponding shrinkage in labour on account of a diminution in bottling operations. Capsules - Wit h regard to these, we beg to point out that to load capsules with 6d. per lb. on advertising, in addition to a general tariff of 5 per cent., is absolutely prohibitive. Capsules are not manufactured at present in Australia. Corks - Considering that corks are neither grown nor manufactured here, a duty of 6d. per Mr Liddell. lb. is quite unreasonable, and will materially add to the cost of Australian-giown wine or brandy. The wine industry of this State, and of the other States, is one with large prospects, and requires all the legitimate fostering your Government can extend to it. The granting of a prohibitive protective policy to a few manufacturers will very seriously militate against the interests of a much larger community of winegrowers and merchants. As to the encouragement of the cork industry, it is well known that the cork tree is not now grown here, and even if it would grow, it would take some years to come to maturity. Moreover, it is doubtful whether the bark of such trees grown in Australia would be suitable for the making of corks. I know a gentleman whose business was practically ruined because two bottles of wine out of a dozen which he sold-h e was a seller of large quantities-were found to be ""corked ""-that is, the wine was slightly flavoured with the Increase. taste of the corks, and as a result his trade Home Cost. Landed, per cent. vanished. The Government propose to ... 250 put a heavy duty on corks, although it is 270 not known whether the cork tree will grow .in Australia, or whether, if grown here, its ... 280 bark would be suitable for the making of corks. It is absurd to think of this Ad... 300 ministration endeavouring to foster prim... 300 ary industries. . The only industries which it will foster are slum industries.",32
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"They are going to kick the honourable member out next time. Mr LIDDELL* - Speakin g during the electoral campaign, I said that I should be prepared to assist industries which were ; being strangled; but I cannot support the high protective duties now proposed, and I call upon other honourable members to assist me in reducing them. I should like to see such a fight in regard to the Tariff that the whole of Australia will ring with, it. I am prepared to fight against it, and, if necessary, to die in the last ditch, or in the last division. To say that free-trade has no champions in this Chamljer is ridiculous. The sooner we come to close quarters, the better it will be for the country. because the present state of unrest is seriously interfering with commerce. I-and there are others like me-inten d to fight for reductions on item after item. The honourable member for Coolgardie, when speaking on the Naval Agreement, drew attention to a letter written by Mr Richard Hain, who. I am told, was once connected with the Post Office, but was pensioned off on the score of ill-health. Like many such pensioners, he seems to have acquired a new lease of life, and to be flourishing like a young bay tree. Mr Hain appointed himself a sort of Boswell to, the Prime Minister's Johnson, and followed him to London, I believe at his own expense, making a careful record of the honourable gentleman's speeches and actions. He seems to have obtained information which we do hot possess. Writing to the newspapers he has endeavoured to prove that Sir Joseph Ward, the Premier of New Zealand, has been brought into line with our Prime Minister in regard to the Naval Agreement. He writesThe Conference, indeed, handed the matter over to Lord Tweedmouth and Mr Deakin, and consult the people in regard to it. Sir Joseph Ward was also brought into ment with them, so that there should be one clear naval policy in the western Pacific. He tries to prove that the Prime Minister expressed the opinion that the CommonConference thatwealth wishes to provide for its own naval defence, and to discontinue the subsidy payable under the Naval Agreement, and the that Sir Joseph Ward was prepared to join him. A report of the proceedings of the Conference has been placed in our hands; to but we are warned thatwhenever the Conference got to a point where caution in treating the question publicly was needed there is a sudden silence in the official reportThat is only naturalbut there is very good reason for believing that more talk went on in private between the First Lord of the Admiralty and Mr Deakin and Sir Joseph Ward over the Naval Agreement than in the open Conference, and it is the result of those discussions which is of importance, and not that of the discussion in the Conference. At the close of negotiations the Daily Chronicle announced that Mr Deakin has withdrawn Australia from the Naval Agreement. The Prime Minister has denied this; but there has been no Ministerial pronouncement' on the subject. We are all sorry that the honourable gentleman is absent through illness, yet that is no reason why the Acting Prime Minister should shelter behind him. At present, we are governed by one man, mouth, saidthe other Ministers having apparently very little to do in matters of policy; but we should know what the view of the Adcurrence ministration is on this question. Tweedmouth said in so many words that the motherland recognises her responsithe bility for the defence of Great Britain and her dependencies and dominions beyond but the seas, and is prepared to undertake it but be stated that she will the assistance of the self-governing Colonies in any way that may seem good to them, such as the fortification of their shores or the making of contributions towards the up-keep of the Imperial Navy. But he insisted that the Admiralty must have undivided and complete control of all the vessels which form that navy. Sir Joseoh Ward agreed with him in that, and 'the Prime Minister seems to have done so too. But the Prime Minister had no mandate from Australia to announce that this country wishes to withdraw from the Naval Agreement, while Sir Joseph Ward stated that^ in his opinion, New Zealand does not wish to do so, but that before committing himself on the subject he would like to He agreeseemed to think that the people of New Zealand would be prepared to increase their contributions if that should bethought necessary. Lord Tweedmouth stated at the. The only reservation the Admiralty desire to make is that they claim to have the charge of strategical questions which' are necessarily involved in naval defence, to hold the command of the Naval Forces of the country, and arrange the distribution of ships in the best . possible manner to resist attacks, and to defend the Empire at large, whether it be our own islands or the Dominions beyond the seas. We thoroughly recognize that we are responsible for that defence. . . . We acknowledge our absolute obligation to defend the King's Dominions across the seas to the best of our ability. . . . There is one sea, there is one Empire, and there is one Navy, and I want to claim in the first place your help, and in the second place authority from the Admiralty to manage this great service without 'restraint. Could language be clearer than that? He continuedHis Majesty's Government recognise the desire of the self-governing colonies to have a more particular share in providing the naval defence force of the Empire, and, so long as the condition of unity of command and direction of the fleet is maintained, they are ready to consider a modification of the existing arrangements to meet the views of the various colonies. Sir Joseph Ward, replying to Lord TweedI want to convey for New Zealand my conin the expressions that Lord TweedLord mouth has given utterance to, that we should have confidence in the Board of Admiralty and in the British Government in connection with Navy. I subscribe lo that absolutely. . . . I want to say that I fully endorse the view expressed by Lord Tweedmouth, that there is one sea around our shores, and that with ; one sea and one Empire, there should in reality be very glad of be but one Navy. These are the words to which I desire to draw special attentionThe outcome of deliberations such as we are engaged in now, should be to place both ships and the disposition of the ships, and the distribution of the ships and the whole question of strategical work, entirely under the control of those at the pulse of the Empire-London ; who are responsible in the time of war for the working out of any engagements that may take place for the purpose of common, defence. Sir Joseph Ward very wisely does not believe in a dual control, or in an Australasian Navy, which would not be under the direction of the Admiralty. In many respects, which I need not enumerate, such a Navy would be a clanger to the mother country. In speaking for New Zealand, which is a party to the Naval Agreement, Sir Joseph Ward said I would like to try and make the position, far as New Zealand is concerned, quite clear in connection' with this matter. . . . New Zealand has made no request of any kind for an alteration of the existing agreement, and I readily acquiesce in the suggestion made by the First Lord of the Admiralty that New Zealand in relation to the mother country will of necessity require to continue by direct subsidy or an increased Subsidy which we are quite willing to give for a continued attachment to the Navy proper which we consider is so important to us. He made it perfectly clear that New Zealand is prepared not only to continue her present subsidy, but, if necessary, to increase it. She has no desire to build a navy of her own, but, at the same time, does not wish to interfere with such a project on the part of the Commonwealth. Sir Joseph Ward went on to sayI am quite certain New Zealand, if required to, under altered proposals that may be suggested, with a view to cementing the defence of the Empire as a whole, would be willing to increase its contribution. Nothing could be plainer. The writer the article to which I have referred adopts an attitude which suggests that he has some secret information. If he has, I at a loss to know where he obtained it. He has said that what is put before us a report of the Conference is altogether erroneous and misleading. In other words, he suggests that dust has been thrown in as our eyes by the Ministry, and that he is is arrived at. the man who knows what actually transpired in connection with the consideration of this question at home. He says disquestion tinctly that Sir Joseph Ward has fallen into line with the Prime. Minister. I think I have proved conclusively, by quotations from the official report, that that stateperial ment is incorrect. The spectacle which Mr Liddell. Australia presented to the. world when her representatives went to England and asked the British Government to grant us a preference-to change what had been her national policy for nearly sixty years, and to impose heavy duties on foreign imports in order that we might reap thebenefitwas a somewhat sordid one.",34
83,Mr JOHNSON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Grea t Britain was asked to tax the food and clothing of her own people for the benefit of Australia.,36
84,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is so. I should be-glad to see Australia grant a preference to British imports. I should like all our imports, if possible, to come from the mother country, but I do not think that the Prime Minister has taken up a proper attitude in regard to the question of preference. He offered Great Britain absoas lutely nothing in return for that which he asked her to give us. The Acting Prime Minister is reported to have said at the Imperial Conferencet would like to ask Lord Tweedmouth a question in connection with the Australian proposals. In a democratic country such as this we are accustomed to speak out boldly, and I am inclined to think that the authorities at Home were, to some extent, surprised by the questions sometimes put by our representatives. The Acting Prime Minister continuedI t is not intended, I presume, fo remove the present squadron, or any large proportion of that squadron, until, if we can make a new arrangement, our coastal defence is fairly complete. The honourable member has an eye on the main chance. He thinks that we should discontinue the subsidy, but that the vessels of the Australian Squadron should reof main in Australian waters. Who will be able to say, for some years, whether or not our coastal defence is complete? In am the meantime, we are to take all that we can obtain from the mother country, and as give nothing in return. In reply to this question, Lord Tweedmouth said- There is no intention of moving the squadron it at present exists until a new arrangement - There' is another point to which I desire to draw attention. In his report on the of defence, Captain Creswell advises that we should embark upon an expenditure on torpedo iboats and torpedoboat"" destroyers. The report of the ImConference makes it particularly clear that the class of vessels most favoured by the Admiralty for the purposes of local defence is not torpedo boats, but submarines. If a torpedo boat attempted to attack a cruiser in daylight she would quickly be blown out of the water. The submarine is most strongly recommended by the Admiralty, and is evidently the boat of the future for us. Captain Creswell is misleading us to a certain extent when he advises us to construct or purchase torpedo boats. Let me quote what Lord Tweedmouth said on the subjectSir Joseph Ward asked what is the opinion of the Admiralty with regard fb the comparative merits of submarine local defence, and subsidy. That, I think, is a question upon which we at the Admiralty cannot pretend to adjudicate. We say, if the Colonies decide on a system of local defence, we tliink submarines would be the most useful way of beginning it , and that Colonies would find that a submarine flotilla would be the best way from their point of view and from a strategical point of view of defending the coast, to begin with, at any rate. They might afterwards develop the destroyer, and so for t h ; but to begin with the submarine would be the best plan that could be adopted in everybody's interests. We do not refuse the subsidy plan, and I do not think it would come well from us to say that we insist that the subsidies should be 'dropped. That, I think, is a matter for the Colonies themselves. So far as we are. concerned, the subsidy is a very convenient way of receiving help from the Colonies; but we quite recognise that it is a question for the Colonies themselves as to how far it is to be subsidy and how far it is to be local defence. Another peculiar feature of the report of the Conference is that it shows that whenever there was any doubt as to the passing of a resolution it was not put. peared to be the desire of the delegates to the Conference that unanimity should prevail. When it was evident that a proposal was not likely to be unanimously agreed to it was quietly allowed, to drop, and so when Dr Smartt moved a resolution relating to naval defence Sir Wilfrid Laurier saidWe, of the different Dominions beyond the Seas, have tried to be unanimous up to the present time. I am sorry to say this is a question upon which we could not be unanimous. Therefore, Dr Smartt can move it if he chooses, or withdraw it. But if he presses it I should have to vote against it. We find in that statement an indication of the reason why this question was not settled ir the Conference. There was a want of unanimity, and consequently it was thought unwise to put the resolution. I think I have proved that, in the first place, the Prime Minister had no mandate from Australia to take up at the Conference the attitude which he did with regard to the Naval Agreement. I have also proved that Mr Haiti's contention that Sir Joseph Ward had been brought into line with the Prime Minister, and shared his views on that question is also erroneous. I have shown,, further, that if we adopt the naval policy suggested by Captain Creswell we shall be acting contrary to the advice of the Admiralty, and finally I think I have shown most conclusively that it would be a matter for regret if we terminated the Naval Agreement until the country had expressed an opinion upon it. Passing away from the question of defence, I should like now to bring under the notice of the Postmaster General one or two matters relating to hisDepartment. I make no apology for criticising it. We have the authority of the Prime Minister himself for the statement that the privilege which we enjoy of criticising our public departments is one_ that ishighly prized. Speaking at the ImperialConference, he saidWe have freely used State agencies and continue to use them, and many of us are strongly of opinion that it is only by their employment that the complex conditions of modern government can be dealt with. If , therefore, we criticise State Departments it is because so muchof the success of the policy which we advocate depends upon them and upon 'their power of adaptation to the business side of social l if e . In Australia we are constant critics of our own Departments, and experience shows, with good? reason. One of the chief tasks of our Parliament is that of endeavouring to bring the various agencies comprised in their public officesinto more f r u it f u l relation with the circumstances of the country. We have busy ParliaI t ap- ments passing many laws, most of them demanding some administrative work, and many of them demanding a great deal, but we find the purposesof those law's defeated or their ends avoided, unless by constant criticism and revision of methods we keep our Department^ to use a familiar expression, up to date. The Postmaster-General will not quarrel with me if I endeavour to point out a few of the grievances under which the postal employees labour, and urge him to lose notime in rectifying them. The Post and Telegraph Department is a great institution. It enters into the life of nearly everv inhabitant of the countryI t bringsu.5 into touch with! the rest of the world,, and anything wrong with it must of necessity be far-reaching in its effects. It is evident that there is ,a great deal of dissatisfaction and discontent in the Department. There are connected with it certain associations that are perfectly legitimate. For example, the post and telegraph masters have an association of their own, the clerical division have another, and the telegraph operators have a third. Three or four months ago those associations met in conference, and decided to take a referendum as to the best method of remedying their grievances. The result of the endum was that an overwhelming majority determined that there should be a public inquiry, or that something in the nature of a Roval Commission should be appointed, in order thai they might properly ventilate their wrongs, and ' have them remedied. They formed a deputation, and approached the Public Service Commissioner and the Secretary of the Central Administration; but nothing came of their application. They were promised a departmental inquiry by the Minister and the Secretary, but that inquiry proved of little use to them. They contend that their complaints are well founded, and that they are the result of the cheeseparing policy adopted by the Department, l t is only by making these facts public that a definite result can be arrived at. The chief grievance of officers in the Department arises from the fact that there is a classification of the service resulting in individual inequalities and injustice.",36
85,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I suppose that the honourable member will say that that is the fault of the Government ?,38
86,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not say that it is the fault of the Government or of the Public Service Commissioner. One should be very careful how one criticises a public servant. The second grievance is that we have an administrative system which entails sweating of the employees, and consequent delay of public business. Thirdly, there are insufficient staffs in the country offices, causing vexatious delays locally, and indirectly at the head office. In the fourth place, there is an insufficient line-repairing staff, producing delay and inconvenience as the result of break-downs and accidents. Lastly, there is general parsimony and false economy. Take the case of the unfortunate leiegraphist. He has to work a certain number of hours. In the General Post Office, Sydney, the work is performed by two shifts. The men composing the first shift commence duty at 8.30 a.m., and continue their labours till 3 p.m., whilst those constituting the second shift work from 3 p.m. till 8.15 p.m. The members of the second shift complain that they are constantly called upon to work overtime, and that unless they work until 9 p.m. they get no allowance in the shape of tea money. Perhaps they are called upon to work overtime upon four nights during the month. One of the reasons for this excessive overtime is the undermanning of the country offices - In these offices business becomes refercongested, and as a result an officer is called upon to assist another in the discharge of his duties, instead of devoting himself exclusively to his own work. Three months ago the staff in the General Post Office, Sydney, numbered eighteen less than it did when the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth. Another portion of the telegraph staff which Is undermanned is the scientific portion. In the General Post Office, Sydney, only one man has been appointed to act as tester. No matter w hat may be the qualifications of an operator, unless he has advanced to the fourth grade, if anything goes wrong with his instrument he has to wait his turn until the tester attached to the office can find time to set it right again. All this loss i of time has to be made up subsequently. Again, I am Constantly hearing complaints as to the undermanning of country post offices. In fact, I can scarcely enter some of these offices without noticing how pal-, pablv they are undermanned. Telegraph messengers are employed for a portion of their time in delivering letters. Whilst they may be absent upon this duty, any telegraph messages which may be received are compelled to lie in the office. It is very unsatisfactory if a man has paid for an urgent telegram to find that its delivery has been delayed some hours by reason of the telegraphic messenger having, been employed in delivering letters. I think it is unjust that Sydney-whic h is really the capital of Australia, notwithstanding that the Commonwealth Parliament meets in Melbourne-shoul d be treated simply as a branch office. As we all know, the central office is now located in Melbourne, and every little matter of administration has to be referred to the Melbourne office to be endorsed by the Secretary of the Department.",38
87,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is absolutely incorrect. Mr LIDDELI The quondam Postmaster-General says that my statement is incorrect, but I am speaking from experience. Only the other day, I produced a letter, to which' a reply could not be obtained in less than 195 days. Even if the Postmaster-General's office were in London, I should have received a reply much quicker than that.",38
88,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,On e can easily understand that a single letter may go astray.,39

91,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It needs to be criticised. Ministers are content to remain upon the Treasury benches and to draw their salaries. I say that they want stirring up. It is' a fact that officers have been transferred from the General Post Office, Sydney, and that their places have not been filled. Applications for the servia s of additional officers are absolutely disregarded.",39
92,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That fault of the Treasurer.,39
93,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I should like to know who is the head of the Government? Another cause of complaint is that local hands are constantly being employed in country offices, but only for short periods. In these cases, permanent hands should be appointed. notice that provision has been made upon the Estimates for the expenditure of a considerable sum upon new postal buildings. I do not think that we should expend money as we are doing upon ornate post-offices. We do not want gargoyles and sculpture",39

Now, there are not sufficient inspectors to enable the various districts to be satisfactorily visited. I would further point out that when an inspector makes a report, and it is thought by those who are well qualified to judgeby the local progress association, for example-that his recommendation is not a good one, the same officer is asked to report upon his own recommendation. is the Mr Mauger - I have issued an instruction to have that practice discontinued.",39
102,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Anothe r point is that if the inhabitants of a district require some additional convenience in the shape of a money order office or a telephone bureau the Department send the requisition to the local postmaster for a report. . Now, a I postmaster is only human, and usually considers that he has plenty of work; and, as any additional public convenience involves more work, he strongly reports against the proposed change, and all the Minister does is to concur. I observe that there is an item of Â£ 2 0 0 to reward officers who offer practical suggestions and so forth which lead to economy and efficiency. I do not regard that sum as sufficient for the purpose.",39

(5d.; (n) In bulk, per gallon, is.",42
159,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I wish to know if the item before us is that which has been before us during the past three weeks, or whether you rule, Mr Chairman, that the general debate has closed?",42
160,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Mr Chairman has already ruled that.,42
161,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The Acting Prime Minister made his Budget speech, and introduced his Tariff proposals, in Committee of Ways and Means, and for the convenience of honourable members it was arranged to allow a general discussion on both, on the question that the resolution be agreed to. A great many honourable members spoke to that motion, and when it appeared to me that no other honourable member desired to speak, it became my duty to intimate to the Committee that the general discussion had closed, and that I should proceed to put the items of the Tariff separately. I then stated the first item, and in doing so practically closed the discussion on the financial proposals of the Government.",42
162,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,When did you do that?,42
163,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,A m I to understand that no one can now speak on the Budget proposals?,42
164,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is the' position.,42
165,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Then I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Flinders intimated on two or three occasions, and particularly about a fortnight ago, that it was his intention to make clear before the debate closed his statement regarding the Public Service increments. I have anxiously waited for him to do so, because he has committed an injustice so far as a number of public servants are concerned.",42
166,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,This i<s not a point of order.,42
167,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I should like to know the exact position in which the Committee is placed ?,42
168,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member must confine himself to the question before the Committee-the first item of the Tariff. I have already twice stated the question, which is- "" That item No. 1 be agreed to.""",42
169,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"On a point of order, I wish to say that honourable members were not clear about the closing of the general discussion. Quite a number desire to speak.",42
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The Government supporters pulled their man down.,42
171,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,That is untrue.,42
172,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If you, Mr Chairman, declared the general debate to be closed, a mistake was made.",42
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,There was no mistake.,42
174,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"There was a mistake, because the debate was not finished. The Acting Prime Minister has not spoken, nor have several other honourable members who wish to speak.",42
175,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"If the honourable member wishes to dissent from my ruling, there is a certain course open to him.'",42
176,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Surely it is not necessary to take that course?,42
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I hope that the ruling will not stand. I shall have to dissent from it.,42
178,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I do not wish to discuss the matter with honourable members. On two occasions I put the question as clearly as it could be put No one got up to speak, and no other course was open to me. If the honourable member wishes to dissent from my ruling, he may do so.",42
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I shall be compelled to do so, though it is a very unpleasant course to take.",42
180,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yarra) [3.50] - As a personal explanation, I wish to say that I intended to speak on the general question ; but the honourable member for Will mot had the chair, and I did not quite understand the by-play going on between the Ministry and the Opposition.",42
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member for Wilmot was not to be made a tool of by the other side.,42
182,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member will give me credit for having no desire to make a tool of any one; but the members of the third party-ther e are now four or five parties in the Chamber-ar e not to be shut out by arrangements between the Ministry and the Opposition.,42
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member shut himself out.,42
184,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I did not. It was my intention to speak on the Budget; but as I presume that we shall have another opportunity to do so when the first item of the Estimates is before the Committee, I shall reserve my remarks in regard to it until then. I understand, too, that on the first item of the Tariff we can speak generally in regard to the whole schedule. It was not through any neglect of my own, but because I waited for other honourable members, that I missed the present opportunity.",43
185,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Cook) [3.52] - In personal explanation, I wish to say that the statement of the acting leader of the Opposition, that the leader of my party pulled me down, is incorrect. not try to do so, but asked me to go on.",43
186,Mr HUTCHISON,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,He asked the honourable member to speak until 4 o'clock at least.,43
187,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yes . I asked another honourable member close by whether, if I sat down, - I should be entitled to resume my speech on another occasion, and he 'informed me that if I did not wish to continue I could speak again later on. As for this balderdash by the acting leader of the Opposition",43
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Is it a personal explanation that we are getting from this impertinent young man?,43
189,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member is going beyond the limits of a personal explanation.,43
190,Mr JH CATTS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"As the hour is late, I ask if I may be permitted to resume my remarks on Tuesday next?",43
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,No ; because general debate is closed.,43
192,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I am surprised to learn that any honourable member did not hear me deliberately read the first the Tariff.,43
193,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I did not.,43
194,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I read it clearly as it could be read, and if I was not heard, it was due to the interjections across the chamber, for which honourable to report progress. members are responsible - I am not charged with the conduct of business, but when a discussion ceases, it is my duty to put the question from the Chair.",43
195,Mr MAUGER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Canno t you again, sir?",43
196,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Has it not been the practice, when there has been misconcepDalley tion as to whether a question has been put by Mr Speaker or vou, sir, to state [""7] it- . again ? It is well known that several other honourable members wished to speak. I spoke to you, Mr Chairman, in regard to the desire of the Acting Prime Minister to precede the honourable member for Hunter,' and when I interviewed the honourable member for Hunter on the subject he told me at the outset that he would not occupy more than half-an-hour.",43
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It was said, in the first place, that he had stated he would speak for only ten minutes.",43
198,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member spoke for twenty minutes before we adjourned for luncheon, and he told me when we resumed that he would speak for He did another ten minutes.",43
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I rise to a point of order.,43
200,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member does not like to hear the truth.,43
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I wish to know, Mr. Chairman, whether the honourable member for Bourke is making a personal explanation, or indulging in a general address to the Committee? I submit that if he is not making a personal explanation he is out of order.",43
202,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I must confine the discussion to the item before the Chair.,43
203,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"May I ask a question, Mr Chairman?",43
204,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"It is open to the honourable member, or to any other honourable member? to move that my ruling be disagreed with. If that course be adopted the difficulty will be overcome, but the wrangling that is now taking place is not the calculated to uphold the dignity of the Committee.",43
205,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Dalley) [3.57] - I shall obey your ruling, Mr Chairman, and proitem of ceed to discuss the first item.",43
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"On a point of order, Mr Chairman, I propose to move as that your ruling be dissented from, but I ' do not wish to take that step until Tuesdav. For that reason I think it would be well The CHA i RMAN - I would point out to the honourable member that if he wishes to dispute my ruling he must do so now.",43
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"On a point of order put it I should like to know, Mr Chairman, whether the Acting Prime Minister is entitled to interrupt the honourable member for for the purpose of moving that your ruling be disagreed with? The honourable member for Dalley was proceeding in an orderly and regular way to discuss the item before the Chair, and I submit that it is now too late for the Acting Prime Minister to move that your ruling be disagreed with.",43
208,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The Minister is not out of order in moving that my ruling be disagreed with.,44
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I regret very much, Mr Chairman, that the peculiar circumstances that have arisen render it necessary for me ""to move that the Commitee dissent from your ruling. I did not hear the motion put. I was awaiting an opportunity to speak this afternoon, ancl informed you that I intended to do so. I also saw a list of honourable members who desired to address themselves to the general question, but in consequence of trie action of the acting leader of the Opposition in pulling down an honourable member",44
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I pulled down no one.,44
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"An honourable member rose to speak, and suddenly resumed his seat, and then the motion, you say, Mr. Chairman, was put. I did not hear it put, nor did others, and in the circumstances I thinlc that your ruling that the general debate has closed is incorrect.",44
212,The CHAIRMAN,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Will the honourable member submit his motion in writing?,44
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I understand that there is another method by which the difficulty may be overcome, and, that being so, I shall not move as I had proposed to do, that your ruling be disagreed with.",44
214,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The Government have not a quorum.,44
215,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Le t the bells be rung, and the honourable meinber will see whether we have or not. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS-MINER S FOR BROKEN HILL-BUDGE T AND TARIFF DEBATE. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",44
216,Mr LIDDELL,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Hunter) [4.3] - The Government Whip has said that I made a remark this afternoon which misled him. I accept the whole responsibility for that which I did say. I am not going to inform the Government Whip or any one else how long I intend to speak on any question. As a matter of fact, when I rose to speak on the Budget and Tariff I did hot anticipate addressing the Committee as fully as I did, but I certainly decline to be criticised because I , to some extent, misled the honourable member for Bourke. I further decline to be bullied by a man like the Acting Prime Minister.",44
217,Mr HUME COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Bourke) [4.4] I also wish to make a personal explanation. - Prior to the honourable member for Hunter addressing the Committee this morning, I , acting on the advice of the - Acting Prime Minister, asked him how long he was likely to be, and whether he would have any objection to the Acting Prime Minister interposing. He told me that he would not occupy the attention of the Committee for more than half-an-hour, and. I advised the Acting Prime Minister accordingly. The honourable member for Hunter spoke for twenty minutes before luncheon, and for a considerable time this afternoon. He was certainly under no obligation to tell me how long he was going to speak, but I accepted his statement in good faith, and conveyed, it to the Acting Prime Minister. That is all I know of the incident. I do-know, however, that the honourable member for Hunter did not keep his word.",44
218,Mr KNOX,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Kooyong) [4.5] - The honourable member for Darling on Wednesday evening animadverted upon statements that had been made with regard to employment for miners at Broken Hill. I wish to read a few lines from a report which I have received today from the acting general manager of the Broken Hill .Company. The report is as-follows :Two hundred thoroughly competent miners accustomed to rock-drill work would represent vacancies for this class of man at the present time, and from all appearances this state of affairs will not be remedied unless a special supply be arranged for. As regards truckers and general labourers the same remark applies, and fifty able-bodied men accustomed to this class of work could be taken On. Apart from the above, the other mines on. the Barrier could take 160 miners of the class above-mentioned. The above shows that 410 men could be advantageously absorbed by the mining companies at Broken Hill .",44
219,Mr TUDOR,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Yarra) [4.7] - The honourable member for Flinders promised, some little time since, to make an explanation regarding the attitude he takes up in reference to the increments to public servants. Iii view of the fact that the general debate upon the Budget and Tariff is now held to be closed, and that a statement has not been made by the honourable member on the subject to which I refer, I should like to ask whether the honourable member intends, at any stage, to remove what I believe he himself admits to be a wrong impression which has been conveyed by.his remarks?",44
220,Mr SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Of course there is no obligation upon any honourable member to answer such a question, and I do not think that it would be proper for the question to be answered in the way the honourable member suggests'. What has occurred took place in Committee of Ways and Means, which has not yet reported what was done. Consequently, what took place is not within the knowledge of the House.",45
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.6] - I desire to say with reference to the decision arrived at in Committee a few minutes since, that I am quite willing to forego what I intended to say in reply upon the Tariff, and should be very glad indeed to have the debate closed. But at the same time. I think it is scarcely fair to those honourable members who had intended to speak, and who have been waiting for seme days, to deprive them of the opportunity. Therefore, I wish to take some course to enable them to make their sreeches.",45
222,Mr WILKS,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,Th' e Minister can bring down Supplv.,45
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The honourable member has just - woke up to that possibility. Unless the general discussion, can be again re-opened in Committee of Ways and Means, I shall have to take the course suggested by the honourable member for Dalley. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Is it in order to discuss matters which have taken place in a Committee that has not reported?",45
224,Mr SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"No , it is not in order. But I understand that the Acting Prime Minister is announcing the order of business for next Tuesday, and I took it that he was proceeding to say that instead of putting down Ways and Means he would put down Supplv.",45
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That was . my object. I do not know whether it may not yet be possible to get over the difficulty which arose, through nobody's fault perhaps. No doubt it would be better to proceed with the general' debate as though the question had not been put by the Chairman. But otherwise I shall put down Supply, instead of Ways and Means, as the first item to be dealt with. I hope, however, that honourable . members will not prolong the debate any more than is absolutely necessary. Wc have had a very long discussion, [""7J-Â» . and I should be very glad to.close it. But still, I do not want to shut out any ""Honourable member who desires to .speak.",45
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,I should like to sav,45
227,Mr SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,The honourable member cannot speak after the Minister has replied.,45
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,By way of personal explanation,45
229,Mr SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"The question ""That the House do now adjourn"" has been moved, and the Minister has replied. If thu honourable member wishes to make a personal explanation as a matter of urgency, I shall ask the House for leave for him to speak, although that course is unprecedented. .",45
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"That is not necessary, sir.",45
231,Mr WH IRVINE,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,In reference to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister-,45
232,Mr SPEAKER,PROTECTION OF WORKERS AN D,"I cannot hear the honourable member - The position is this-: A few moments ago the Acting Prime Minister moved ""That the House do now'adjourn."" Several honourable members have spoken, and the' Acting Prime Minister has replied. There can be no further debate.. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.10 p.m.",45
