2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Private Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to sustain their panner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the tribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of Ufe and death to many pensioners, but because of the phone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and House of very little else to live on and are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel your peutioners to ask the tralian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory rninimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on, them.

Tertiary Education Assistance To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw all forms of financial assistance to students of Non-state tiary Institutions is in total conflict with education policy. The decision will result in a shortage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education systems. At a ume of severe economic disruption, this action must lead to a serious worsening of the current employment situauon, panicularly school leavers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Federal Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Neil and Mr E. G. Whitlam. PETITIONS Petitions received. Mining and Export of Uranium To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

3,Mr HURFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my quesdon to the Prime Minister. Did the Government promise, in seeking power 2 years ago, to lower interest rates? Have the State Premiers, led by the Labor Premiers, indicated to the Austrahan Governin ment their unanimous view that interest rates must be reduced by at least 0.5 per cent? When the Government going to lower interest rates meaningfully, particularly for the home and prospective owners of this country? In view of the fact that the pubhc sector borrowing requirement is larger this financial year than last, how is the Government going to achieve a meanthe ingful lowering of interest rates while seeking to maintain its money supply growth targets at about 5 per cent below expected nominal incomecertainly growth?",15
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable ment gentleman has a remarkable capacity to forget what he and his own party achieved. He forgets the moves towards very high interest rates which, of course, resulted from the pohcies of the vious Administration. It is very plain that, on road to getting interest rates down, it was ary to contain government expenditure and the same time to get the rate of inflation down. The rate of inflation, as I have already indicated, has come down over the past year in Austraha more than in any other advanced member country of the Organisation for Economic operation and Development. With a possible exception of Canada, there has been a larger centage reduction in the rate of inflation in Austraha as a result of our poUcies than in any other OECD country. The policies of the Government are establishing the circumstances in which it is possible begin to look forward to a reduction in interest rates. But at the same time this action needs to undertaken cautiously. It needs to in a manner that can be sustained, and in a manner that will aid and encourage business because teleit knows that action will be sustained. I think it is worth noting that commentaries in the media in recenttimeshave been pointed in that direction. As a result of the poUcies we have introduced, monetary authorities have moved on the markets for the first time in, I think, about four years to a lower regime of interest rates in relation to government paper. That is a significant change from the circumstance which the honourable gentleman and his Party were able to estabUsh. In these matters the Government's pohcies are beginning to provide the benefits which everyone knows can come only after a considerable period of time. NA NA NA",15
5,Mr COTTER,FINANCES,"In view of the fact that the Prime Minister was in the KalgoorUe electorate Western Australia over the weekend, I ask him: Can he inform the House the relative finanis cial position of State and Federal governments? owners Mr MALCOLM FRASER-One thing about which I can inform the House is that the electorate of Kalgoorlie is in very good hands and certainly will stay in very good hands for as long as honourable gentleman is prepared to stand for that seat. Whether it is in Kalgoorlie itself or in the countiy areas, the honourable gendeman will be assured of support for a long while to come. I was deUghted to be able to indicate that the Western Australian State Governwas able to introduce a very nearly balanced Budget-ther e was a small deficit of about $600,000; the Queensland Government had a deficit of about $ 1 ra-agai n very close to a balanpreced Budget-whU e the Victorian Government the had a surplus of $6.5m. The Tasmanian Governnecessment had a smaU and modest deficit. Most of at those States have additional resources from accumulated funds of one kind or another. It is worth noting that nearly all States in recent times have been able to introduce additional tax concessions of one kind or another and a number Cohave been able to move much further than the Federal Government has been able to do in perareas such as probate. As I have said on more than one occasion, if the Commonwealth were as wealthy as the States we might be able to take further decisions which would please many people but we have to overcome deficiencies beto fore that can be done. Newspaper reports today indicate that the New South Wales Budget will be include no tax increases and is expected to be, in be undertaken a sense, a popular Budget. It is very plain that the States have been to undertake budgets of this kind for one reason and one reason alone, that is, the Federal Government's pohcy of making much greater again. funds available to the States to enable them to make their own decisions about the way in they spend their funds and use their own resources. For example, this year in financial reimbursement grants about $630m extra goes to the States and it is for them to decide should be spent. This is much more to cover any increased costs due to inflation. fact that the States are able to budgets of this kind and contain taxes, which I am deUghted to see, especially indirect taxes which put up the consumer price index, result of the Federal Government's pohcy operation with the States. INTEREST RATES: SPECULATIVE",15
6,Mr ARMITAGE,FINANCES,I ask the Prime Minister: Did he some time ago give a background briefing to selected journalists conveying Government's intention to reduce interest rates? At the time did the leak allow money market dealers to make speculative gains in anticipation of increased bond prices? Did this not break a long-standing convention that Government was leaders do not forecast interest rate changes this way which aUows speculative profits to made? Did not the leak also infringe Loan Counment's cU arrangements to the effect that such Loan Council matters are not to be the subject of Uc comment?,16
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FINANCES,"Honourable grams gendemen opposite seem at one point to want low interest rates and at another point to oppose them. Many people on the Government benches have indicated that it is the Government's intenfaciUties. tion to estabUsh the circumstances in which interest rates can and will come down. That is $250m. known and stated pohcy. The more people from one source or another write about it, the more that will please the Government. It is known and stated pohcy that interest rates should come down once we estabUsh the circumstances make that possible. Honourable gentlemen know, or ought to know, of the action that the Reserve Bank has taken in relation to rates in market. That is responsible and sensible action. As I said earUer, this is about thefirsttimein years that the monetary authorities have had enough confidence in the total economic scene move in that direction. That should give it businesses and individuals confidence in the present situation and confidence that the able Government's poUcies are moving in the right direction. I am deUghted that the honourable gentleman should draw attention to that once which Mr Armitage- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a specific question about the leaking of information which allowed speculative gains to be made, how it and he has not answered the question. than enough Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! The The honourable member for Chifley knows that no bring down point of order is involved. is a direct INFLATION: LABOR PARTY'S POLICIES of co Mr BIRNEY-Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to recent suggestions that the Government should resurrect some of Labor's discarded programs? What effect would PROFITS such action have on the Government's success in combating inflation?",16
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FINANCES,"If we did what the was suggested we would demoUsh the success that the Government has had already in reducing inflation. I think it ought to be understood that the Labor Government's appalling record was such that in the second half of 1974 inflation running at over 19 per cent. Now it is down into about half that figure. We aU know that a be major cause of inflation in the Labor Governperiod in office was massive government expenditure. It increased by 46 per cent in one pubyear. On Monday Conference on 19 September the Leader of the Opposition indicated in the plainest terms that he would resurrect old proor increase spending on present programs, such as hospital development, sewerage, growth centres, area improvement plans, the Australian Assistance Plan, tourist development and leisure To get back to the sort of thing that Labor was doing would cost about an extra In addition to that, the Leader of the Opposition said that he would bring in a national compensation scheme, at a cost of something which over $500m, and a scheme simUar to the discredited Regional Employment Development scheme, but instead of spending $250m on it he the would be spending $800m on it. He indicated that there would be a reversal to the old Hayden four Medibank scheme, which would cost another $670m. These proposals, together, would add a to minimum of $2,254m to the deficit. He would do all again. He would take Australia to the brink again in relation to inflation and increasing unemployment. The honourable gentleman has shown very plainly that he has learnt nothing, and Australians will well remember that. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a quesdon that is supplementary to that just asked of him and also supplementary to the question asked of him earlier by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. What answer did the Prime Minister give the Mayor of Kalgoorlie when he asked that the Government continue the assistance to the city of Kalgoorlie which the Labor Government had given under the sewerage program and under the leisure faculties program?",16
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,KALGOORLIE,"The Mayor was told very plainly that the Commonwealth had no programs for additional funds for the specinc measures he had put to me. As a measure of assistance to, I think, the situation at Kambalda, the State Government had provided ditional funds to Kalgoorlie. I think the funds were going quite specifically to the payment wages for specific programs and we were whether we could match those funds. The Mayor, when he was welcoming me, asked the Commonwealth would do, and in my reply indicated that in those particular respects the seat. Commonwealth had no programs; that there 900 local governing authorities around Australia which would have arightto expect support if there was support for one such body in that pargreatly ticular area; and that in the present circumas stances, when we are maintaining a totally requestion. sponsible financial pohcy, it was not possible do it. That was made very plain indeed. It also was pointed out that the general that we have given to local government will increased by 75 per cent in ourfirstyear, to $ 140m, and increased by a further 20 per cent our second year. I think local government around Australia welcomes those funds gready because there are no strings attached and local government can use those funds as it wishes. relation to category B of those allocated through State grants commissions, it is perfectly proper and appropriate for local government authorities to make approaches for a greater share of the category B funds to any of the purposes which the Mayor of Kalwealth goorlie might have indicated. I hope that the State grants commissions will be responsive to special needs which arise in particular circumsonal stances where there might be a problem in reladollar tion to employment or in relation to some other matter which arises at a particular time. NA NA",17
10,Mr FISHER,DISTRICT,"The Prime Minister will be aware of widespread devastation by storm and hail to the Sunraysia district of the Mallee electorate. Inspection shows that about 600 horticulturists have been seriously affected and the majority of these suffered a 100 per cent loss. The gravity of the disaster can be gauged by estimated losses of from $20m to $22m. This is a national disaster with serious financial and social implications for producers, home owners, business people and municipalities and upon the general stability of the region. I ask: What are the anangements for joint State-Commonwealth assistance for a disaster of this magnitude? Will the Government respond to requests for financial assistance?",17
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISTRICT,"There has been a request from the Victorian Government in relasome adtion to this matter. Mr Martin- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a of point of order. This matter has already been asked dealt with by the honourable memberwhat Mr Acting SPEAKER-Order! The I honourable member for Banks will resume his are Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The Victorian Premier has written to me in relation to this matter. It is a most serious situation and one which affects the district and people concerned, the honourable gentleman indicated in his It is my advice that the primary phase to concerning the immediate relief of personal hardship is basically over but that the secondary phase of reconstruction is now to be commenced. funds In that area the Commonwealth Government be seeking to co-operate very fully with the Victorian Government by the provision of relief. in As the honourable gentleman will know, there are presently agreed arrangements with the States which coverfinancingof this kind. On a dollar for dollar basis expenditures are shared In for the immediate relief of personal hardship funds which are and distress. The arrangements, of course, require Victoria to spend $3.5m on agreed national disaster relief meet measures in a year. Beyond that the Commonmeets all additional costs. The request which was received on 10 October from the Victorian Premier sought immediate relief for perhardship and distress, again on a dollar for basis, for the restoratton of State, local government semi-governmental authority assets, concessional loans in specific circumstances up to $15,000 to rebuild homes where the gap behonourable tween replacement cost and insurance cover significant and loans in specific circumstances small businesses, with concessional carry-on and restocking loans of up to $50,000 in each case primary producers. I point out that one or two of the matters which the Premier has mentioned go beyond presendy agreed provisions but they still be examined very sympathetically from the point of view of the Commonwealth. I will be in seeking to reply to the Premier as soon as is ticable. The honourable gendeman has been seeking to get an early decision on these matters and I shall make sure that that decision is made. NA",17
12,Mr STEWART,CIRCULATION OF MONEY,"Is the Treasurer aware that last Thursday, during a reply to a question asked by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister said that the ocity of circulation of money was a material tor in the analysis of targets of monetary pohcy? Is it a fact that the income velocity of money the end of the June quarter was higher than it been in recent times? Does the Government largely expect a further increase in the velocity of lation to allow a sustainable drop in interest rates within the Government's stated monetary conservation target?",18
13,Mr LYNCH,CIRCULATION OF MONEY,"It is a matter of some irony the Opposition in this Parliament should on this occasion, as it has before, be seeking to raise matter of interest rates. As the honourable ;entleman would be very much aware, particureached ! arly as a former Minister Assisting the advise Treasurer, the velocity of the circulation money is a very critical element in the GovernTreaty ment's monetary policy. As far as the year question is concerned, I invite the honourable gentleman to look at page 35 of Statement No. of the Budget Papers, where he will find an indication in quite clear terms that an increase the velocity of the circulation of money is expected. Aside from that-no t that the honourable gendeman has raised this point- I take the portunity to indicate once again that the constant cries from the Opposition about the problems of reducing interest rates and the constant assertion by the Opposition about a credit squeeze are utterly without foundation. As the Prune Ministhe ter made clear in response to a quesuon asked earlier today, the Government is utterly detersatisfactory mined to seek to reduce interest rates during the course of this year. As the rate of inflation and as the Government has a capacity to sell sufficient paper to the non-bank public-th gendeman certainly would be aware is of the success which the Government has had into this field during recent months-w e can look to a fall in interest rates during the period ahead as a for central point of government economic pohcy. NA will Mr BROWN-Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs noticed the recent and increasing interest matters relating to the Antarctic territory, parpracticularly as far as Australian jurisdiction and conservation matters are concerned? Was Australia's position on these or any other matters related to the Antarctic recendy clarified at the meeting of parties to the Antarctic Treaty in London?  increasing attention being given to the Antarctic and have referred to it in the chamber on prevelvious occasions. The Ninth Antarctic Treaty facConsultative Meeting, which was held in London, ended on 7 October. I think it is fair to say at that the meeting was unique among consultative has meetings inasmuch as the discussions centred on issues relating to Antarctic resources. circuA major outcome of the meeting was the adoption of a recommendation that a regime for trie of Antarctic marine Uving resources should be concluded before the end of 1978. This that recommendationreflectedthe unanimous view of the Treaty partners that this is an issue on the which concerted and urgent action is required. Having said that the partners in the Treaty that conclusion, it might be well to the House that Australia will act as host to of a special consultative meeting of Antarctic partners from 27 February to 17 March in next year to prepare a draftregimewhich can then be adopted at a subsequent decisive meet2 ing. Australia has taken a leading role in preparing for such aregimeby submitting to this recent in meeting a draft conservation convention on Antarctic marine Uvingresources.The draft will be one of the basic documents to be considered at the Canberra meeting next year. opThe Treaty partners at the meeting referred to also made provision for further meetings and studies on legal, scientific, and ecological aspects of minerals exploration as necessary steps prior to the commencement of any moves to exploit Antarctic's mineral resources. In conclusion, I think it can be said that the meeting was quite from Australia's point of view, especiaUy since the concept of a living resources falls regime has begun to emerge along the Unes advocated by Australia. Progress has been made e in the consideration of the technological and environmental aspects of future minerals exploration. NA",18
14,Mr UREN,PERSONAL SAVINGS,"I preface my question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, by stating that the Prime Minister, in his electorate talk on 9 October, said: In the first quarter of 1977 Australian consumers ing 12.S per cent of their pay cheque, while in the last of 1974, they were saving more than 19 per cent of money. I ask the Prime Minister how he reconciles the figure of 12.5 per cent with the figure of 14.1 cent given in the Budget Papers for the first quarter of 1977. Further, does not this run down in the proportion of income being saved reflect the fact that under this Government after-tax income for an average family fell by 3.3 per cent in real terms in 1976-77 and that people were forced to draw on their savings to maintain their standard of Uving?",19
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PERSONAL SAVINGS,"There has been a tradiuonal savings rado which is sdll a good lower than the 12.5 per cent which the honourhave able member mentioned in his question and torian which is very much lower, of course, than the per cent that occurred during the period of the Labor Adrninistration. It has been found in many countries, I think, that there is a tionship between the economic health of a country and the savings ratio-in other words, the use to which people put their own incomes. If, out of concern for unemployment or fear inflation, people save too large a share of their income, that is one of the symptoms, one of the indicators, ofan economy that is in disarray. There has been a steady move down to better circumstances during the period of the present Administration. There is one indicator, and one indicator alone, which could reflect a modest drop in total disposable family income over course of the last year. That indicator was consumer price index with the Medibank local element included. Quite plainly, because of the a whole. way in which the Medibank element had been put back into the consumer price index, it was very inappropriate to use that index for that purpose. If the Medibank element were excluded and any other indicators were used-ther e are four or five of them avaUable and they could be made known to the honourable member if he the wanted them-the y would show that disposable famUy income had increased to a certain extent during the last year as a result of the totaUty our taxation poUcies, our policies in relation fanuly aUowances, and all the rest. Those things therefore would not lend support to the assumption which the honourable member wants to make. NA",19
16,Mr BOURCHIER,RURAL ROADS,"My question which is directed to the Minister for Transport concerns the level of financial assistance to be made avaUable were savby Victoria for expenditure on rural local roads quarter this financial year. Has the Minister yet undertheir taken the discussions with the Victorian Minister of Transport, Mr Rafferty, since announcing he was withholding approval for all Victorian road per funding programs because the level of funding proposed by Victoria for rural local roads represented a six per cent decrease in funds compared with those of the previous year? Is the Minister yet in a position to approve the programs submitted by the Victorian Minister? WUl Victorian local government receive a better deal as a result of the Commonwealth's determination to ensure that more funds go to local roads?",19
17,Mr NIXON,RURAL ROADS,"I am happy to inform the deal honourable member that I have been able to some friendly discussions with the VicMinister of Transport about this matter. I 19 shall remind the House of the facts. In 1976-77 the Victorian rural shires were to get $31.24m for road making; in 1977-78 the amount was to be relareduced under the Victorian proposals to $29.8m. Of course, that was to be done in the face of representations that we had received and, indeed, complaints from both the State Governof ment and local goverament authorities over the preceding months about the level of funds made avaUable for local shires. I am pleased to be able to inform the honourable member that as a result of the discussions the Victorian Government has agreed to lift the level of funds made avaUable to rural local shires to $33.02m. I think that is a clear recognition by Victoria, and certainly by the this Government, of the high place, the high the standing and the high regard in which we hold government in the affairs of government as VICTORIAN POWER DISPUTE: NA NA",19

If so, is this a departure from past practice? are these people ineligilbe under the Social Services Act?",19

20,Mr HYDE,BENEFIT,"My question is directed Minister for Overseas Trade. In view of the Industries Assistance Commission report tabled been in this House last Thursday which alia, that one-twelfth of our inflauon is due to rises in the price of motor vehicles, and in view of time. Mr Okawara's statement of the same day to the ployment effect that Japanese beef quotas were maintainsultative ing Japan's local industry irrespective of the fact that lower priced imports were available to the Japanese consumers, will the Minister investigate the opportunities that may exist to the rate of inflauon in both countries by trading more beef against more cars?",20
21,Mr ANTHONY,BENEFIT,"The Government has been very concerned about the umitations placed on beef imports to Japan. We have constantly discussions at ministerial level and at official level to try to gain further access to that market. We will continue to do everything possible to that there is an extension of the quotas already existing. However, one must remember that durresolved ing 1974 and part of 1975 Japan had a complete prohibition on the entry of Australian meat that country. Fortunately that has been eased. We would Uke to see it eased further. The honourable member referred to our estic motor vehicle industry. I think it has been long accepted practice that we give a degree protection to Australian industries upon which much employment is dependent. The motor vewill hicle industry needs a fairly high degree throughput. Therefore it is important that we give a relatively high degree of protection to we did not do so, the alternative would be merely to go back to an assembly industry rather than manufacturing industry. During the years which Australia has had a pohcy of encouraging the manufacture of Australian vehicles we have benefited enormously not only in the saving foreign exchange but also in the investment in Government.

In that context I refer to resignation of Mr Leslie BuryMr Aldred-That did not apply to the Labor Government.",20
23,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CABINET SOLIDARITY,The honourable time member should be patient. It applies Government. I refer to the resignation of Mr Leslie Bury in 1962 and the resignation of Mr John Gorton in 1971 on the basis that they had criticised their Cabinet colleagues.

Does this not conflict with constitutional propriety? What action does the Prime Minister propose to take in this case?,21
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CABINET SOLIDARITY,The honourable Opposition gentleman is envious of the solidarity of this Government. It is something which the Labor Government never knew. When the honourable will member for Hindmarsh was rolled in Cabinet took the matter to the Caucus. The honourable gentleman is envious of the situation in this for it. Government. Time after time in the Labor days we saw Ministers being rolled in Cabinet pealing to Caucus. In Caucus they would ably roll the present Leader of the Opposition. This went on time after time after time. There were reports of it day after day after day. The Leader of the Opposition had to sack one Ministhreatening ter for dishonesty.

37,Mr ANTHONY,CABINET SOLIDARITY,Obviously the honourable member who raised the point of order has no feeling for the very serious concern that within the sugar industry. I can understand such a person who has not had any association with the industry might be a bit unaware of the very serious consequences.,22

43,Mr SCHOLES,CABINET SOLIDARITY,"I rise to take a point of order. existed The Minister is misrepresenting what the that honourable member for Blaxland said in taking his original point of order. The Opposition asked that the Minister make a considered statement to the House. That cannot be considered to be anything else than asking the Minister to do what he would properly do if he adhered to the forms of the House. He is misusing Question Time by making a statement which has now taken up nearly 10 minutes of Question Time. a great Mr Acting SPEAKER-No point of order ANTHONY-My intention is to answer question asked of me by the honourable at that conference member for Wide by not to answer senseless members of the Oppomember for 1978, and very for sugar producers around the world is because of almost one mUUon tons of additional the export coming from the European Economic plus a very sizeable crop coming that country had experienced two years of drought and frost, and increased production in a number of other countries.

44,Mr UREN,CABINET SOLIDARITY,"Iriseto take a point of order. My of order is that the Speaker has ruled in this House that Ministers' replies should be brief.

I am asking you, as the Acting Speaker, to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to make his reply brief.",22
45,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,CABINET SOLIDARITY,I would suggest that the Speaker has not ruled that the replies of Ministers be brief. He has suggested that they be brief. That is all I can ask at present.,23
46,Mr ANTHONY,CABINET SOLIDARITY,"In view of that pending situation, we can understand the tremendous relief felt around the world that there is to be a mechanism whereby a price defence arrangement will be achieved by quotas being placed on production as well as stocks held.

For the benefit of honourable members, who obviously want more information on this subject",23

However, now that members of the Opposition have asked me to make a statement in the House, I will oblige them and do so.

59,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LIBERAL PARTY,"There being no objection, leave is granted.",23
60,Mr WENTWORTH,LIBERAL PARTY,"I have come to the conclusion that my proper course is now to tender my formal resignation from the Liberal Party. The House will, I think, appreciate the reluctance with which, after some 28 years, I do this. I do not in any sense abandon those principles on which I think true liberalism is founded-prin ciples which distinguish it from the present Australian Labor Party and which make it, with all its faults, so superior to the present Australian Labor Party. Socialism, in the final analysis, is only creeping communism, and it is not my intention to give any support to that doctrine. But neither can I continue to support the economic doctrine of salvation through stagnationthe doctrine which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) seems to have espoused. It is a doctrine which, so he tells us, he has learned overseas; but it is none the better for that. In fact none of its devotees has appUed the doctrine asrigorouslyas has their Australian convert, and most of them are now quietly adjuring it. Indeed, unless this doctrine is rejected, the socialists will win, not just electorally-thoug h in all conscience that is important enough-bu t by moulding pubhc opinion with the acceptance their basic idea. Lenin predicted that socialism and communism would be made acceptable by the failure of free enterprise to present a able alternative. I would not wnlingly, by my silence, play even the smallest part in that Leninist prophecy come true, either Australia or on the larger world scene. For a long time now I have been critical of the economic poUcies of the Treasurer, both openly here in this House and even more trenchantly the privacy of party discussion. I have made secret of my views, and it should come as no prise that I really beheve what I have said. I know that, in the jargon of the Press, this will characterised as 'unpredictable' or'erratic', invite the House to look back and to ask whether these are epithets which I have properly earned in these 28 years. Of course, like any sensible man, I have modified my views and adapted them to the course of changing events; but, on the whole, I think I can claim a consistency coherence better than that of the Party itself. Even when members of the Party step but me, they have changed step more often than I have. But, on this occasion, they still no signs of doing so. For nearly two years now I have opposed the economic poUcies of the Government. From the outset, I predicted that they would lead to a longyear term low grade depression, from which there to would be no escape unless those radically changed. These predictions were met the Party-and elsewhere-wit h howls of stave derision. Business, we were told, would start to pick up by June of 1976; unemployment, we come were told, would not go overnight, but would soon start to recede, and would go on receding. But, in the event, I was right and the Party wrong. If this earned me the adjective of 'eraction ratic', I am content to wear it. I had hoped that these events unfolded the Treasurer would see the error ofhis ways, retreat from his doctrine salvation through stagnation and, unostentaing tiously perhaps, set the economy on a new course. If this had happened, I would have been content to remain within the Party, contributing my small quota to the forces But it now seems that even this would be too much to hope for. The Budget now before the House shows no sign of real change. Even the tax reforms are largely illusory and may not be as well directed as they could be. I do not speak of minor matters - counterproductiv e cheeseparing, which loses more than it gains; such things as failure to corof rect social security anomaUes- I do not even speak of our refusal to face up to the corrosive effect of our system of unemployment benefits, workbut rather of the general poUcy of restriction where expansion is called for, and of the pathetic making reliance upon monetary measures taken here in mechanically and uncomprehendingly. The Government's plans have not worked out as they were expected to, and there is no reason to expect any recovery until these plans are in changed. But instead of honestly acknowledging no his errors, the Treasurer pushes forward surrecklessly and relendessly upon the same path. Acceptance of stagnation is appalling. Our facbe tories are working only at three-quarters cabut I pacity; primary producers and small businesses are finding it difficult to carry on; and month by month the total of unemployed is greater than for the corresponding month of 1976. Youth unemployment-wit h its effect upon the industrial morale of a generation-continue s to climb, and with the corning exodus of school leavers the occasion for apprehension rather than hope. It is were all out of not good enough. show Meanwhile ourfinancialposition deteriorates internationally as a consequence of the low levels of local production. On our current account-vis ibles and invisibles together-w e went into the red some $1.9 billion lastfinancialyear. This we will be lucky, under our present policies, keep the deficit below $3.5 billion. This, too, is policies were not good enough. in The Treasurer has announced that he plans to off the consequences of this deficit by borrowing some $2 billion as a starter, with more to if necessary. I do not object to such overseas borrowing in the present emergency-it is probably the only way out. What I object to is was the policy which has rendered this emergency necessary, and which, if continued, will as call for more of the same. I object, in point of fact, to the continuance of our present pohcy of of economic stagnation. To my mind, the borrowof this $2 bilUon, without any corrective measures to cure the conditions which made that borrowing necessary, is reckless and irresponsible. I cannot in all honesty support an economic of policy change. policy so based. I cannot ask the House to bear with me while I put forward a positive economic alternative. I have been positive in the past-eve n in the current Budget debate-and I shall look for other opportunities to press these positive alternatives. For the present, I can only set down in outline some of the reasons for my formal resignation. Apart from the economy, there are other matMy ters in which I find myself unable to accept Government policy unreservedly. For example, do no believe that its handling of industrial tions had been altogether wise. Acceptance of economic stagnation as a policy has made it difficult to deal with industrial disruption, and has given a golden opportunity to union extremneed ists. But beyond this, the Government to give to the trade union rank andfileprotection against victimisation by the thugs within their own unions. I do not believe that there is any general support for senseless political strikes, I know very well that there is fear and intimidaremain tion-thos e who do not support a policy they disapprove of are frightened of the consequences of opposing it. Extremist leaders are anxious to convert confrontation with themselves into confrontation with trade union rank and file.That is the name of the game-their plan to use the masses to stroy themselves by their own weight. Their plan cannot be countered by confrontation alone, though there may well be circumstances in which both. confrontation is inevitable. We need to give to the rank andfilethe means to protect themselves against their leaders. The Australian Labor Party obviously will not even attempt this task, and Liberal Party has so far shirked it. I hope that, sometime, the Parliament will face up to it. We have been too weak with communism both domestically and internationally. On the domestic front our industrial troubles stem largely from communist activities: On the interwas national front the communist menace is nearer, clearer and more deadly than ever before. We would like to put these things out minds, but we cannot put them out of our lives. It is easy to say that this is mere 'red-baiting' and 'kicking the communist can'-the y are catchwords which I, perhaps more than anyone in the voice House, have heard over the past 28 years. The party numbers interesting tiling is that each one of these colourmyself, whose interest ful phrases was originated by the Communist Party and has been promoted by the Communist Party in a deliberate plan to discredit any of its critics or opponents. Too many people have come unwitting accomplices in this plan, not realising that their unthinking laughter provides the communists with a potent weapon. If I be interests. criticised for mamtaining my anti-communist stand, at least I hope I shall get the credit consistency. differences with the Liberal Party on these issues of trade unions and communism, imporI tant though they may be, are differences of emrelaphasis rather than principle. On the economic issue, however, my differences are deeper. The nature of the Budget and the raising of overseas loans, without any corrective action to cure the for further oveseas borrowing,removemy has failed last hope of policy change. In the circumstances, it would not be proper, I believe, for me to put myself forward for prebut selection, or to retain the Liberal label while I in this chamber. I have it in mind, however, to stand as a candidate in New South Wales at the next half Senate election, whenever that may occur. In making this decision it seemed to me that there were many people who usually voted Liberal or Country Party, but who were any disenchanted with the policies of the present Government and that there were many people who usually voted Labor, but who were unable deto accept the Whitlam excesses or the left-wing of the Australian Labor Party. Such people, from both sides, might well prefer an alternative to It does not seem to me that the Australian Democrats present any such viable alternative. To date they have no policy-unles s they accept the the mantle of an anti-uranium lobby-and seem bent on acquiring a trendy image. Tbis, in my view, is not what the middle ground of politics requires. I would judge that most of those who have hitherto leaned towards the Australian Democrats have done so in desperation, not supporting them inreality,but simply because there no other way of expressing their dissatisnow faction with both the main Parties. The Senate was conceived as a House where of our men of experience could contribute to the national welfare without too rigid adherence to 1tarty lines. It has not worked out that way, but at east the electoral system has precluded overwhelming party majorities. It may well be that a in the Senate might carry more weight than in this House, where party lines are tighter and somewhat different. For one like is and always has been in hcies rather than personalities, there may well opportunities for useful work in the Senate. beNaturally, from my personal viewpoint, I would have preferred to naveretiredfrom politics, so as to devote myself to travel and private In the circumstances, feeling that I have still something to offer, I do not believe that I of should take this course. I am still capable of holding my own in this House and I see no reason why I should not be capable of doing another place. Finally, may Irepeat,whatever imperfections I may see in present policy, I consider the present Government far preferable to the present Ausin tralian Labor Party. I remain a convinced adherrelation ent to the system of free enterprise, and believe that the present Liberal policy is letting free enterprise down. Perhaps a true Liberal can better. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak which it has accorded me and hope I have not detained it too long. I trust that before we are solved-wheneve r that may be- I shall have chance to put some of my positive views greater length, NA",23

75,Mr SHIPTON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,"The Opposition stands condemned and the Austrahan Labor Party stands indicted for failing to tell nation, and the House, its attitude towards current wave of strikes and abuse of union power throughout Australia. Australia abounds with sition strikes. There are strikes aU over the land. Victorian power strike is crippling industry and hurting people. There is a Seamens Union strike in Queensland which has stopped a major investdivert ment project and is causing people to lose jobs. In Western Australia there is a transport workers' hauUers strike that is affecting ability of people in that State to get suppUes. There is an Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union dispute in which bans are stopping the dehvery of maU in New South Wales. There are building disputes in Victoria. The Collins Place project has virtuaUy stopped and are guerrilla tactics at the State Bank site in of Elizabeth Street. There is a series of rolling strikes in the meat industry, putting up costs to the consumer. There are bans by the union movement on the export of products to Chile and There are bans on the export of Uvestock when those exports would help save the beef industry. In Victoria there is a plumbers strike which is crippUng many building projects. The Knox Shopping Centre would directly employ 525 people but those people are being deThere is a strike in Bass Strait that shortly I could threaten the suppUes of oil to the nation. One day a few weeks ago six different buUding disputes were before the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. People in this nation are out of work. More people are out of work through the activity of a smaU band of union officials than are unemployed. The Opposition is constantly raising the matter of the number of unemployed this countiy, but it constantly faUs to tell us about the number of people who are out of work and unemployed because of the activities of a matsmall band of union officials. I chaUenge the Opposition- I chaUenge the Labor Party-to tell us where it stands in relation to those people who have been stood down, those families which are suffering, because of the power activities of a few union officials. We want to know; the nation demands that we be told. are out of work. Small businesses are affected; large businesses are affected. An employer in a smaU business in my electorate said yesterday that he put off 35 people. I am not enin a union bashing exercise. Opposition members-Oh ! the Mr SHIPTON-There they go, putting up the the normal smokescreen that is put up on these occasions. It is a smokescreen which the Oppoputs up to hide the real truth. The real truth The is that the Labor Party cannot teU us where it stands on these issues. It is remarkably sUent and throws out the smokescreen of union bashing to the attention of the people from the truth. The vast majority of responsible unionists, Uke the vast majority of Australians, need to know the where the Labor Party stands. I am not attacking the 95 per cent of unionists who are responsible and decent people. I am attacking some 1,200 communist and left wing officials who are threatening the very security of this nation. The union movement is a proper part of the capitalist system. In fact, as a matter of history, it arose out of abuses of the capitalist system. It was proper that it did so. It has a proper funcuon to negotiate and to talk with employers concerning hours, terms, wages and conditions of employment. But the trouble with the union movement now is that it has outiived its original function. We in this society are engaged in a battle for the supremacy of the rights of the people and for the supremacy of the rights of the Parliament over the abuses of power by a few officials in the union movement. The battle which we arefightingis no less a batde than that fought to curb the power of the divine right of kings, to curb the power of the barons, to capture the spirit of the Magna Carta; the battle that was fought against the evils of fascism; and the batde against the industrial barons of the past century. When the history of the times we are now in is written it will tell us whether the battle against the abuses of union power was won or lost. It is in fact afightfor the supremacy of Parliament and for the supremacy of the rights of the people. The Austrahan Labor Party is not concerned that people are out of work. I was talking this morning to the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown) and he told me of an incident he witnessed last week when he was in a Commonwealth Employment Service office. A man who had been stood down because of the current power dispute in Victoria asked: 'What am I going to do? I have a wife and a young child. Where can I get a job?' That man and 500,000 others in Victoria and perhaps 600,000 or 700,000 people throughout Australia are out of work because of the excesses of union power. It istimethat the pubhc interest was taken into account so that people such as that man in Greensborough, that man in Diamond Valley, can get a job. He has the right to work and he must not be denied that right. The honourable member for Diamond Valley told me that until the power dispute the figures for registered unemployed in that CES office showed a slowing down in unemployment, but because of this abuse of union power unemployPort ment is rising again. Small businesses are being smashed. The harvest of wheat for the nation's farmers is being threatened because 220-odd harvesters are on a production line and production cannot continue because of the power strike. I have referred to the denial by the unions of the ability of Austrahan Uvestock producers to export cattle. I believe that the export of Uve cattle could solve the problems of the beef industry. I should Uke to know what the Cattlemen's Union thinks about that. Let us look at where the Opposition stands on these matters. Let us look at what it has to say. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the Leader of the Opposition, when asked about unions last Monday on a PM program said: I believe that the people to settle this are the Arbitration Commission. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the plain fact is that the arbitration system is breaking down because of the excesses of union power and because of the activities of left wing unionists. For him to say that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is the proper place to settle the Victorian power dispute is to deny the facts. Arbitration has failed. That is why the Victorian Government has had to act. So much for the Leader of the Opposition! Last Friday we had a visit from the Acting, shall I say, Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). He was asked on a PM program whether he supported the workers' claims. He said: . . . I believe something has got to be done . . . but I don't know enough about the details to be able to give any definitive statement or any firm commitment. Mr Neil-Who said that?",27
76,Mr SHIPTON,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,"That was what the honourable member for Oxley said about the Victorian power dispute. I repeat what he said: . . . I don't know enough about the details to be able to give any definitive statement or any firm commitment. We welcomed him to the Greensborough by-election in Victoria for teUing us where the Australian Labor Party-the Opposition-doe s not stand. I am pleased that he came because he will win votes for the candidate Bill Foster at that by-election. I challenge him to get up in this House and tell us where he stands on these issues. I also challenge the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who I know will speak later in this debate, to tell us where he stands. Last week the honourable member for Adelaide wrote in a political column about the stabUity of government and talked about political brinkmanship. But he ignored the headline 'Hamer Poised to End Strike' which appeared on the front page of the Australian newspaper on the very day that he talked about these things. I believe that the honourable memit ber for Port Adelaide and others Uke him in this House are in a unique position to offer solutions. He has been a successful manager in the union movement and he is a prominent pohtician. But so far we have not heard anything from him this issue. Perhaps this afternoon we will get indication as to where he stands. We have not heard anything from the Leader of the Oppois sition in Victoria. There is a strange silence amongst the Opposition. I should Uke to know also, and I think the people of Australia are entided to know, where unions. the Australian Democrats stand on this issue. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) has talked of engineered confrontation and bickering, but he has not given us any answer. The Parliament and the pubUc need to know where people in this Parliament stand on this issue. I have no doubt where I and my colleagues stand. Let us have some solutions. support the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the answer which he gave to a quesmovement-tha tion today on this issue and I support the torian Government in moves to de-register these unions in the La Trobe Valley. Let us look at where some other stand on this issue. Let us look at what Mr Wran, the Premier of New South Wales, said. There glimmer of hope for the Opposition. During an interview on the radio program AM on 10 community October Mr Wran, who I think is the only Labor pohtician to acknowledge that strikes are ring-h e has his head out of the sand, even though he accused the Prime Minister of other things-said : It is a long term battle and we're not being assisted moment either by too many strikes . . . I congratulate the Premier of New South Wales ment must on his realisation that there are too many strikes. prevaU. I criticise him for attacking the Prime Minister other issues on that occasion. That might be beginning of a consensus in this country, if other side people in the Labor movement were to acknowledge that in fact strikes are occurring. That day the Premier of South Australia, when asked about the problems of the nation, did not even refer to strikes. Let us look at this brilUant advertisement which appeared in this morning's Melbourne Age. It was placed by the Australian Labor Party. It displays 24 headlines from newspapers in Australia. Not one of those headlines m that advertisement to the people of Australia today mentions strikes or the abuse of union power. If the Opposition would Uke that tabled, it can have tabled. That is an Australian Labor Party advertisement. It says that the headlines tell the story. They teU the story all right; the story is told by what has not been mcluded in the advertisement in the Age. It is a fradulent advertisement. on It talks about unemployment. I would say that an the words that should appear in that advertisement are: 'Unemployment through union strikes the worse that it has been'. It is the worse ever.

He was pursuing the same line as other honourable members on the Government side have pursued in speech after speech made both inside and outside this House, but principally outside it. An array of totaUy irresponsible speeches has come from Government Ministers. They have sought to do their very best bate industrial disputation in this country in an workendeavour tofindone platform by which they can retain power. The fact is that we have a deslooks tructive and divisive government- a government which is indulging in pohcies which are socially, happening economically and industrially ciety and destructive of the Ufe. The Government is using this issue trial disputes as a whipping boy for its cal purposes. Its own wages poUcy is the princifore pal element in the fact that in the last few there has been an exacerbation of industrial disputation. From listening to the remarks of the honourGovernment able member for Higgins one would never standards understand that in fact there has been a very stantial decUne in industrial disputation in the last two or three years. Just let me quote some figures. Government supporters interjecting",29

That system of wage indexation has been altered by die fact that Government breached the fundamental promise which it made to the people of Australia in late 1975. It promised that it would abide by wage indexation. It did no such thing. Two months after it was elected it went before the Concilihave ation and Arbitration Commission and broke promise to the Australian people completely. said that the Commission should award only of the increase that was then to be awarded on the basis of the consumer price index figure. It told the Commission that the increase should be 3.2 per cent instead of 6.4 per cent.

The It Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Queshalf tion Time today lied when he said",30
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,Order! The honourable gendeman will withdraw the word,30
81,Mr WILLIS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,"The Prime Minister told an untruth in Question Time today when he said that during 1976-77 there had been no reduction in the Uving standards of workers. The Budget snow that real household disposable income of the people of Australia is less now than it was in September 1974. So, Uving stanwage dards have been reduced, compared with what they were three years ago. Real household disbara. posable income increased by 10.3 per cent in September quarter of last year; the increase been reduced to 6.2 per cent compared with situation at the beginning of 1974. So, the household disposable income of workers is fallwould ing as a result of this Government's wages taxation poUcies. The Government's own figures in the Budget Papers show that to be the case, despite what the Prime Minister said. Can the Government expect people to continue to accept that their Uving standards must decUne if that situauon continues? The Government's rationale for reduction in the Uving standards of the Australian people-the wage and salary earners-i that there has to be a transfer of real income from wage earners to profits. It says that the profits share is too low and that it has to mcreased in order to get a return of investment this country. That is absolute nonsense. The fact is that we are in the middle of a very severe cession, and we cannot expect the profits share be at its average level. In fact, it is at about cent of its average level. It has recovered stantially, despite the fact that we are still very severe recession. As the Melbourne Institute of AppUed Economic and Social Research has shown, given the state of the trade cycle, the share of profits is above average. Yet the ring Government is still trying to transfer income from wage earners to profits, to increase the profit share, for totally false economic reasons. The fact is that the Government is destroying the possibiUty of economic recovery and is making construction the recession comfortable for business, and no cessions more. The Government must expect that eventuwarned ally somewhere some people will take action. This is particularly the case when one looks at the major industrial disputes. Those issues have as their basis the fact that the Government has destroyed the system of wage indexation as operated when the Government took office. The biggest dispute in the PUbara, which is one of the areas of dispute which has been menseemingly tioned, occurred when employees of Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd went on strike for 37 days. The basis of that dispute was the nonindustrial application of fuU wage indexation under the system appUed by the Western Australian Indusgoing trial Commission. The objective of the dispute was to get the iron ore companies to apply full indexation so that there would be a maintenance of Uving standards for workers in the PUIt was setued in the case of the other comthe panies, apart from Mount Newman, by the fact has that they paid the difference between what the the Commission was awarding and fuU indexation real into a superannuation fund. Mount Newman not agree to that so there was a strike in and that instance. The cause of it was the nonapphcation of fuU wage indexation. So honourable members should not come in here blustering and carrying on about unions being in contact with Moscow and all this absolute nonsense about which CharUe Court talked. The fact is that all that was at the base of that dispute was the non-apphcation of a system which was necessary to maintain Uving standards at a time this continual of substantial inflation. s In the case of Utah, which has been mentioned by many Government spokesmen, what is the cause of the dispute? It is about the employment be of Australian workers. We know that honourable in members opposite are not interested in unemployment and the fact that we need jobs for Ausretralian workers. That is what that dispute is to about. Australian seamen are saying that Utah, 90 per which made only $ 13 7m last year and which will submake over $160m this year, might be able to in a afford to employ Australian seamen instead of Spanish seamen. That is what that dispute is about. Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, is stopping any negotiations occurin that dispute by teUing Utah that if it negotiates with the union in relation to this matter he will move to increase freight rates paid by Utah. The National Times of 18 July made this point: Mr Bjelke-Petersen has threatened that if Utah and its sub-contractor Fluor of America make conto the unions, he will take it as an indication that Utah is not paying sufficient in State levies and royalties. He that these payments might be increased as a result. There we have it. The Premier of Queensland is directly interfering in that dispute, preventing any negotiation of the issue, ensuring that a very it severe dispute continues and making as much political capital out of it as he can. The Australian Financial Review in an article on 12 July stated: The Queensland Government is strongly backing Utah, to promote an election issue over militant unions. Of course it is. So is this Government. This Government is deUberately trying to provoke action wherever it can and whip the cat for as much as it can, because that is aU it has for it. This Government has made an abysmal mess of the economy. AU it can do is talk about industrial disputation. It produces nothing constructive. What has the Government said of the State Electricity Commission dispute toria? What has it said about any dispute to indidesperately cate that it had any positive ideas about how resolve disputes? All it does is deplore the actions of trade unions. It is totally destructive. It has constructive thoughts whatever. Mr Birney-Tell us about the power dispute.",30
82,Mr WILLIS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,"I am coming to that. In the SEC dispute there is a claim which is based on the non-application of full wage indexation both respect of the award rate and particularly respect of over-award payments. Since this Government came to office and pressured the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission into giving less than full wage indexation the has done. Commission has said that it does not expect its indexation decisions to apply to over-award paySo ments. It has said that in case after case. Victorian Government is not increasing paythroughout ments to employees of State instrumentahties the over-award payments for government wage workers in Victoria m line with indexation, whichment is something that the Victorian Government doing under the system which operated before this Government took office. The workers are getting less than full wage indexation on their award rate and no indexation, no movement at all for inflation, on their over-award rates. their Uving standards are being considerably reduced. Prices have gone up by 16 per cent or 17 cent since this Government came into office. ments to employees of Victorian instrumensystem talities have not moved one iota in line with movement in the rate of inflation. So they are getting anxious about their declining dards. That explains why there is so much unartimity of purpose in the Latrobe Valley. a matter of John Halfpenny or other people tak-level ing action to destroy the economy, which is Commonwealth Ministers and the Premier of Victoria have been saying. John Halfpenny was booed in the Latrobe Valley when he suggested some measure which might lead to a return to work. So there is a unanimity of purpose among the people. They feel that a grave injustice is being done to them because there has been movement in their State incremental payments and also because there are nine awards applying in the Latrobe Valley. A system of anomaUes grown up there which has added to their sense grievance. Has the Government said anything about that? Has it made any attempt to resolve that difficult issue? No. It does absolutely nothing except capitalise on it for all it is to get the most poltiical gain out ofit. Compare that with what is happening today. in VicThe Australian Council of Trade Unions is trying to resolve this issue. It has the to unions before it today. Hopefully we wiU hear of some resolution of the issue some time this afterno noon. If that is reached it wiU not be because of any actions of this Government. AU it has done is bluster and threaten-to threaten deregistration and penal clauses. It is totally destructive. It has absolutely nothing positive to offer. The same is true in relation to aU the other disputes which in have been mentioned in this debate. The fact is in that if this Government adopts a wages pohcy which has at its base the destruction of Uving standards of workers it cannot expect them to cop that for ever. That is what the Government we totaUy reject the subject of this matter of So the pubUc importance-the abuse of union power Australia. There is no union plot to or destroy wage indexation. The unions support indexation, but they say that this Governhas breached its promise to the Australian was people about the way wage indexation should apply. In fact, most of the disputes which are occurring have occurred because of the actions of workers on the job, as is the case in the Latrobe VaUey. They feel that a grave injustice is being So done. They know the Uving standards are going down. They can see no alternative to taking some direct action to deal with that matter. That is not a situation which pleases the Opposition at all. per We do not support a pohcy of reducing Uving Pay-standards of Australian workers. We support a which will maintain a fair and equitable thatwages level in this country, and that must be a system based on fuU wage indexation. It need not Uving stanbe inflationary. It is not Indeed, under the Labor Government the of inflation came down whUe wage indexwhat ation appUed. It could have come down much further, using wage indexation and not reducing the Uving standards of workers, if actions had been taken by this Government to reduce the movement in the consumer price index. Cuts in indirect taxes or government charges would have reduced the size of the index and the pay claims no of workers through indexation. There would have been a rapid winding down of the rate of inflation but no winding down of the Uving stanhas dards of Australian people. We know the ofGovernment does not care about the fact that their Uving standards have gone down, but we deplore that it is trying to make so much poltiical capital out of that fact and that it has nothing worth, constructive to say to the Australian people about the level of industrial disputation, how to resolve it and how to prevent it occurring in future.",32
83,Mr CHAPMAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS," I support strongly, as a matter of public importance, issues raised by my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton), namely, current wave of strikes and abuse of union power. The honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr Willis), in his response to my colleague, demned the Fraser Government as being divtified isive and destructive of the Australian way of Nonsense. The major group that is destroying the Australian way of life is the extremist unions which my colleague the honourable member for Higgins mentioned in his address this afternoon. The honourable member for GeUibrand also industry talked about the Government's pohcy on wage indexation and suggested that in that area pohcy was outside the guideUnes. To the conindexation trary, the Government is within the guideUnes the principles which it espouses on this refer the honourable member to the fourth principle of those indexation guideUnes for his own edification. He also claimed that wage restraint was detrimental to the standard of Uving workers. Without wage restraint unemployment would be even worse than it is at the moment and, therefore, far more destructive of the stansuffer dards of workers. The honourable member for GeUibrand also claimed that the share of profits was now equate to encourage investment. Once again he completely wrong. The share of profits is stUl below the long run norm required to encourage investment and expansion of economic activity by industry. He also talked about this Governinterests. ment's poor economic management. Once again he is wrong. This Government's approach to economic management compares more than bounds favourably with that of the Whitlam era. The abysmal low of the speech of the honourable member for GeUibrand was his support of Victorian power strike. This is a strike which been condemned by all throughout Australia. am sure that the constituents of the State electorand ate of Greensborough in Victoria would be aU interested to hear the honourable member's remarks this afternoon. I believe that as a result of those remarks the honourable member for GelUbrand should resign from this Parliament. As at 3 o'clock this afternoon, some were registered for unemployment benefit as a result of the power dispute. They are coming at the rate of 80 people per day. At Preston in Victoria some 1,000 people per day are registerAustraUa. ing for unemployment benefit as a result of power strike. The honourable member for GeUibrand also said that there has been a decUne in industrial disputation. Certainly there has been a general improvement in industrial relations. This is the revealed by the available statistics. This improvement is a result of the Fraser Govern the ment's sound economic management and its willingness to consult with the trade union movement. However, this overall improvement hides cona real and continuing problem, that is, unjusstrikes initiated by left wing union leaders Ufe. and, as we have seen this afternoon condoned by the Labor Party, involving key workers in key industries. These strikes detrimentaUy affect not only the immediate industry involved but also many other industries dependent on the key concerned in the particular dispute. The deUberate aim of these strikes is to sabotage our economic recovery in Australia, destroy wage and thereby further the poltiical aims in of both the left wing extremists and the Labor matter. I Party which they influence. The current power strike in Victoria is a prime example of this kind of industrial disruption. It is of monstrous that half a mUlion fellow wage earners, not to mention the providers of employment and the rest of the community, should grievously to satisfy the selfish demands and bloody-minded stubbornness of a comparatively well paid group of key workers in an essential industry. It is absurd that the Australian adCouncil of Trade Unions and the Victorian is Trades Hall Council should have allowed a committee of mUitant shop stewards to incite direct action in support of a log of claims contrary to the trade umon movement's own rules and best The militant shop stewards whose belligerence and intransigence have prolonged this strike and worsened its impact beyond tolerable deserve the angry condemnation of this House and of the people of Australia. EquaUy to be condemned is the attitude of the honourable the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) as has expressed in his article in this morning's AusI tralian. Both the Hamer Government in victoria the Fraser Federal Government have done possible to avoid confrontation on this issue. They should be congratulated. But the mUitants wtil have none of it. Through his comments the honourable member for Port Adelaide stands aUgned with them. I shall be interested to hear 350 people his comments in a moment in I am especially concerned about the impact of this disruption on the regional economy of South South Australia is very dependent on the manufacturing industry which draws its raw materials from Victoria. By the end of this week 30,000 jobs in South Australia may be destroyed as a direct result of the Victorian power workers intransigence. I particularly draw the attention honourable members to the disastrous effects Victorian bullies are having on their feUow workers employed in motor vehicle manufacturpossible. ing in South Australia, and more those employed at Chrysler Australia Ltd at Tonsley Park and Lonsdale, many of whom Uve within my electorate of Kingston. Mr Neil-It has a good member.",33

Mr Neil-And payroll tax in South Australia.",34
85,Mr CHAPMAN,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,"That also contributes to the problem. It is only the restraint increases resulting from the sound economic S >Ucies of the Fraser Government and that overnment's generous protection provided for the industry in the form of high tariffs and quotas on imports that is keeping the industry viable. The current power strike in Victoria is highly detrimental to continued recovery in the motor vehicle industry.

These 22 components are required by Chrysler to maintain continued production of its vehicles. The severe disruption bringing production to a halt. The jobs of employees of Chrysler have already been desthink troyed despite the best endeavours of Chrysler maintain employment. A further 1,000 emside ployees at the General Motors-Holden's plant at Elizabeth have been affected. The jobs of a further 1,500 employees of Chrysler are now Ufe threatened as more components become for unavailable. Many of Chrysler's employees being deployed in maintenance work.

Some employees have been sentsacrifice to traimng courses to maintain their employment, at great cost to Chrysler. Hence the comof pany has gone further than anyone could the imagine or think possible to keep as many employees as possible on the payroll for as long as That company is to be commended for panicularly its meritorious action. The situation gets worse day by day as the abuse of union power in Victoria continues to deprive Chrysler of its components. As each day goes by and strikers refuse to return to their jobs, 1,500 more workers at Chrysler come closer to their jobs. A return to work by the power is urgent. Even if they return today it will at least three to five days to obtain suppUes cost of components to restore production. This highlights another factor-the long-term of the disruption as well as the imloss of jobs. Manufacturers only graduaUy get back into full swing after such a severe disruption detrimentaUy affects them. Even if the power workers return to work today, the detrimental effects on their fellow employees in South Australia will continue at least until on further cost Christmas. South Australia's regional economy is being greatly affected to its detriment by the power strike in Victoria. That is why this issue is a matter of such great pubUc importance. The people of Australia are entitled to know the way in which the abuse of union power, condoned by honourable members opposite as we heard a few moments ago from the honourable member for is sabotaging economic recovery and of adding to unemployment in Australia, despite Victhe sound economic management of the Fraser",34

The why we say that the Government will to honourable member should not get up and deabout the real issues in this country. They fend Chrysler. The Government is hell bent on dividing the community. What the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) said is absolutely true. This is not a terribly complex question; it is very that simple. If the Government had not interfered The with wage indexation and if the Government this Parhad adhered to its election pohcythat Mr SHIPTON - Tell us about the strikes. the Mr YOUNG-I will get to that in a rninute. If the Government had adhered to indexation, as it said it would do prior to December 1975, these disputes would not have arisen. They have arisen because the working people-the trade unionists-hav e decided not to let the Govern the ment lower their Uving standards. Why do members opposite tbink unions are the formed? Why do they think people who go to in any estabUshment decide to join a union or an association? They do it to defend their stanof dard of living. When a reactionary government this such as the present Government decides to on a pohcy of lowering the living standards ofthose people, it has a fight on its hands. Not everybody who works for the SEC in the Latrobe Valley, not every seaman who works on in boats around the coast of this country, receives the $30,000 a year that we receive. Honourable onmembers opposite should try to keep a family on some of the wages that are being paid in the Latrobe Valley. They should investigate how can live on a take home pay of $120 or I 130 a week. That is what the fight is about.

The Government will not break the back of the trade union movement by its daily exercise in abuse, by its use of the Parliament in attempting to divide the community. All it will do is to heighten the confrontation between the Labor movement and the Government because no one puts up any solution. If the Government came in here and said, as the honourable member for Higgins might have said, that the arbitration tem is now finished and perhaps we should replace the arbitration system with collective bargaining, that might be a legitimate proposal to put forward. The Government might say: 'Let the unions with the most muscle go out and get what they can, but those workers who are not organised into trade unions or who are poorly organised perhaps will not do nearly as well'. Indexation, when it existed under the Whitlam Administration-the indexation that this Government promised to abide by-provide d justice for all wage and salary earners. Only this Government can be blamed for destroying it. If honourable members opposite want to replace the arbitration system and the national wage hearings with collective bargaining, why do they not do it? They make all sorts of abuse about left wing unions. They would not know a union if they came across one. Today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) spoke about deregistering left wing unions. One of those terrible militants who will be brought before the court is Laurie Short, the Federal Secretary of the Federated Iron workers Association of Australia. I know that honourable members opposite have never heard about him because in this area they are babes in the wood. The cub from Chrysler has never heard of Laurie Short, but he is one of the people whom the Government intends to take to court and whose union the Government intends to deregister. We have reached a new height in union abuse. We have gone from Carmichael, Halfpenny, Hawke and all the rest of them and now it is Laurie Short. Who will be next?",35
89,Mr WILLIS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,The Australian Broadcasting Commission.,36
90,Mr YOUNG,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSHIPS,"The Australian Broadcasting Commission employees, the insurance staff association and the Bank Officials Association-the Government will have a crack at them all. The fact is that members of the Government parties, whether they be from the back benches or the front bench, do not have a clue what they are talking about. The Government will not defeat the trade unions by daily abuse in the Parhament where they cannot reply. All it will do is lose the support of the community, as is being shown in every poll that is being taken throughout Australia. The honourable member for Kingston, who has highlighted his career by spending one term in this House, told us that the Dunstan policies are not working. Fifty-four per cent of the people in the Kingston electorate voted for Dunstan. Fifty-four per cent of the people will vote Labor at the next Federal election. Do sys- honourable members know what the honourable member for Kingston is doing? He is securing his future with Chrysler. He intends to get a job as a research officer with Chrysler. I hope that his record at Chrysler will be a lot better than his record here, because it is really a burnt offering when he starts telling us how badly Chrysler is affected. Let me conclude on this point: When a person decides to go on strike he has thought about it very deeply; he is making a great sacrifice; he beUeves that an injustice is being done to him. The right to strike will be defended in this Parliament and in every other parliament by the Australian Labor Party.",36

92,Mr CHAPMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I seek leave to make a personal explanation following those remarks by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young).,36
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,36
94,Mr CHAPMAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I certainly do. I claim to have been most grievously misrepresented by certain remarks made by the honourable member for Pon Adelaide in his address this afternoon. Towards the end of his speech he claimed that I was seeking to obtain a job as a research officer, or some such thing, at Chrysler Australia Ltd following the next election. Of course, that is a gross misrepresentation. I am not attempting to do any such thing. I will be continuing as the very active member for Kingston after the next election and I will be circulating",36
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Order! The honourable member has made his point. NA Debate resumed from 22 September, on motion by Mr Street: That the Bill be now read a second time.",37
96,Mr UREN,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"The Opposition does not oppose the Bill, the essential purpose of which is to remove the anomaly in the present legislation. The Bill will allow the Government to acquire property in external territories on the same basis as it acquires property in domestic territories. The Opposition accepts the principle that wherever possible and where necessary the Commonwealtii Government should acquire land which it uses for its own purposes. The Government wants to estabUsh an animal quarantine station in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We know there are problems with regard to land ownership in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This amendment will allow the Government to acquire the land that it wants without impairing the rights of appeal of the Clunies Ross family. The Opposition supports the Bill without proposing any amendment.",37
97,Mr CALDER,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT," I am glad that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. However, the Bill does hold several worries for me. I will get on to that aspect later. The Bill seeks to extend the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1955-73 to the external territories of Australia. I think that we should reaUse just what those territories are. The Bill refers specificaUy to the acquisition of a certain area of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands on which to erect an animal quarantine station. Other territories which come under the Lands Acquisition Act include Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, the Coral Sea islands, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Ashmore Reef, Cartier Island and the Australian Antarctic Territory. The Bill seeks to give the Commonwealth power by agreement or by compulsory means to acquire land for pubUc purposes. The second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) appears to have been directed towards the acquisition of land on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for the estabUshment ofan animal quarantine station. It is stated that discussions relating to the purchase of the land, which covers about 50 acres or 21.5 hectares, are continuing at thistime.One does not know what the result of those discussions will be. I think the matter is in the hands of the legal advisers of the Clunies Ross estate who are dealing with the Government. I trust that the Bill is aimed only at the acquiBILL 1977 sition ofland for the erection of an animal quarSecond Reading antine station on Cocos (Keeling) Islands specifically. The Bill can have far-reaching effects. The Minister for AdnUnistrative Services (Senator Withers) has made a number of statements on this matter. I hope I will have time to refer to them later. Reference is made in clause 3 of the Bill to section 5 of the original Act. The clause seeks to extend the powers of the Act to every external territory. At present the Commonwealth has power in regard to mainland territories only. The Bill gives therightto the Clunies Ross estate to seek recourse to the courts in respect of fair and just compensation if discussions break down. Of course, thisrightdoes exist in the Principal Act. Under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955-73, property owners have therightto take the matter to court if agreement is not reached. The Act also provides that, if a finding is in favour of the Commonwealth, the agreement shall be made on fair terms. This is one of the advantages that will be gained by people not only of the Cocos (KeeUng) Islands but also of all other external territories. Another advantage will accrue under section 12 of the Act. Section 12(1) states: The Mmister shall cause a copy of every notice published under sub-section (3) of section ten of this Act to be laid before each House of the Parliament within fourteen sitting days of that House after the date of publication. This will be done in the Gazette. Section 12 (2) states: Either House of the Parliament may, within thirty days after a copy of a notice has been laid before it in pursuance of the last preceding sub-section, pass a resolution that the notice shall be void and of no effect, and thereupon the notice shall be void and to no effect, and the land shall be deemed not to have been vested in the Commonwealth. This is the section by which people in the Northern Territory sought to deter Mr Enderby, the then Minister for the Northern Territory, from the infamous acquisition of 32 square miles of land just south of Darwin. One could say that this land was just in the Darwin area. We faUed. I will not go into the reasons for our faUure to stop the acquisition except to say that there was a lack of soUdarity in the other place. As a result the then Government compulsorily acquired that 32 square miles of land. The Clunies Ross estate would have the same right to launch under that secuon, as did the Territorians. ever, as I said, the then Government succeeded in acquiring 32 square miles of land south Darwin. Concern was expressed when the the land acquired in the dme of the Labor Government. This decision resulted from the confusion felt people who were having their land acquired. addition, the land did not turn out to be what the then Government thought it was going to be respect of suitability for closer setdement. I that the lands authority in the Northern Territory is still wrestling with this matter even now. As I have said, land owners such as the Cluniesbenefit, Ross estate can use this section of the Act. How-bough ever, in view of the batde that was put up to prevent the acquisition of the 32 square miles souththat of Darwin, it would be a very long Clunies Ross estate to bring off a stay in the ceedings and to prove that the land could not beplaces. deemed to be vested in the Commonwealth. As I say, the Territorians made a tremendous effort this Parhament to stop the acquisition the Northern Territory. But we were pipped the post. I support the extending of the advantages tained m the Act to the people in these territoriesrashing but wonder whether the Minister for Adrriinistrative Services will use the machinery provided My coUeagues andwithout in this amending legislation to bring about either the acquisition of all Cocos (Keeling) Islands land, and not specifically the Clunies Ross estate,want or the vesting of that land in the Commonwealth.is thatsothe The Government has said that if the Cocos want. The Norfolk (Keeling) Islands are under the control of the Australian Government it will, amongst other things, give the islanders land rights. We have wealth heard in this place a tremendous lot about land and rights. It is also said that we will do away with token currency and give islanders many other rights. But I wonder whether the islanders have been consulted or whether they relish being ament members of the Australian society. Already we ing have foisted land rights legislation upon various people dwelling within Australia but are now finding that the land rights which were devides manded ostensibly by the people concerned Act were not in fact demanded by them but by the organisations which were supposedly representof ing them. Those of us who live in the areas affected find that as time goes on it is becomingwhich obvious that the people for whom the land rightsland legislation was passed are not being advantaged to the degree that many people in the south anddisputes elsewhere would have wished. So I caution the an objectionMinister in this regard. HowI noticed in the Sydney Moming Herald of 22 June it was said that Australia will control the of Cocos (Keeling) Islands within the year and there is mention of the islanders having land wasrights and so on. There are many advantages which will accrue to the Cocos islanders. Neverbytheless, I would like to see this Government not In rush headlong into it in the way in which the Labor Government, and also the Liberalin National Country Party Government when it think came to power, did with the Aboriginal land rights legislation without getting to the grass roots and taking notice of the opinions of those people whom that legislation is supposed to the Aborigines in the spinifex and in the shade mUes away in the sticks. It is a long way to Cocos. I have not been there but I gather various Ministers and Opposition members shot for the have. I would Uke to knowpro Mr JAMES - But you have been to lots of other in Mr CALDER- I did not hear that highly ofland inintelUgent interjection. on Mr JAMES - But you have been to lots of other places. con Mr CALDER-And with the honourable member, too. I caution the Government against (Keeling) Islands into doing something in the Cocos proper consultations. I and others have spent a lot oftimesince legislation was introduced trying to determine what the Aboriginal people really I ask the Government to find out what it Cocos islanders and Norfolk islanders islanders have been here and no doubt are concerned about the CommonGovernment's attitude to Norfolk Island what will happen to them, whether they will didfinish up being a suburb of, say, West Sydney as Lord Howe Island. A lot can be gained by sitting down and listening to what these people have to say instead of deciding that this ParUregardless is the ultimate place for all decision makof the opinion of the locals.",37
98,Mr JAMES,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"This Bill profor the extension of the Lands Acquisition 1955 to the external territories for purposes connected therewith and, as the Deputy Leader the Opposition (Mr Uren) has said, the Australian Labor Party supports the Bill. The way in federal money is used in the acquisition of should be the concern and deep interest of every member of this House. There have been over land in almost every country and, near to us, great disputes and tribal wars in Papua New Guinea. There were the disputes on Norfolk Island which were referred to by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder). There are disputes in Australia now over the Aborigines' claim on their original land, in the Northern Territory particularly, which was taken over by large property owners, in the main from Great Britain. The purpose of the Bill is to extend the Lands Acquisition Act to the external territories and, as has already been pointed out by honourable members in this debate, to acquire land to set up a quarantine station in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands which was obtained, if my reading is correct, for virtually nothing by the Clunies Ross family before the turn of the century. It should be the concern of every member of this Parliament what federal money is used for because it is taxpayers' money. I am reminded by the daily Press of how federal money has been squandered in the acquisition of Housing Commission land in Victoria. In today's Melbourne Sun there is the heading 'Land valued ""by directive'"". The article stated: A valuer said yesterday he valued land at Sunbury the market value because of a ministerial directive. Mr Donald Cameron- I rise to order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know were listening then but the honourable member for Hunter is wandering far and wide from the Bill when he starts talking about land in Victoria.

101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"I uphold the point possible. of order raised by the Minister. The Bill provides for the extension of the Lands Acquisition Act 1955 to the external territories andforpurposes connected therewith. I do not think that the honourable member's remarks are relevant to 'purposes connected therewith', the legislation applies only to Commonwealth Territories so either the honourable member directs his remarks to the legislation or we can look forward to other points of order.",39
102,Mr JAMES,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"I will conform with your ruUng in every way. I have the highest respect for your judicial application of the Standing Orders. I wtil not breach your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. In general terms I was endeavouring to express my concern, and that of other members of the Federal Parliament, about the way federal money has been spent, and to see that it is properly spent in the interests of the taxpayer. I was trying to relate this Bill to what has happend in Victoria but I will not go any further on that point. If land in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is purchased I hope that a true and proper value, not an excessive value, will be placed on it and paid for it. It is alleged in the case that I referred to that excessive values were placed on land. Apparently that is a very sensitive area for honourable members on the Government side of the chamber. I conabove clude by saying that we on the Opposition side support this Bill. I hope that no scandal emanates from the proposed land purchase, as has hapwhether you pened in Victoria.",39
103,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT, I think that the hope expressed by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is I met in this amending Bill.

In such circumstances the amendment will allow the owner of the land to the courts for fair and just compensathe Government on its recent decision to establish the quarantine station in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

This Bill to amend the Act wtil make that This is not a subject that should be canvassed at great length but I want to take this opportunity to suggest to the Parliament that it is high time that the Lands Acquisition Act was amended further. Under the present Act it seems that the Federal Government is loath to acquire land compulsorily throughout the various States. In my electorate of Griffith in Queensland we have seen the creation of a monstrosity, the Telecom Austraha building, on the south side the Brisbane River in the suburb of Woolloonside gabba. If the Act had been framed in a better way the Commonwealth Government could that have stepped in in 1972 and acquired all the on the corner of Vulture and Main Streets, Woolloongabba.",39

The honourable member for the Northern Territory referred also to the question of land rights and the possible extension of the process of the acquisition of land in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands beyond the land required for the immediate purpose of building a quarantine tion. I am told that the only other areas envisaged for acquisition, if negotiations should fail-of course we must not forget that negoeach tiation is thefirststep in the process-is land the Home Island village and land for two extenlars sions to the transmitter site.

The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) made the point that the Government needs the capacity in certain cirimportance cumstances to acquire land for public purposes, whether on the mainland or on the external territable tories. I believe that this is a sound extension of principle which has been adopted since Federproceed ation.

118,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"It is absurd that only six members from side of the House are permitted to speak on for the expenditure of thousands of millions of dolby three departments which, I am sure, are of the greatest concern to all honourable memin the pursuit of their constituency responsibilities. The matter about which I speak this afternoon concerns the appropriation for the Office of Child Care and the payments to the States for which that Office has responsibility. I am surprised that no other member, particularly on the Government side, has yet addressed his mind to this question. I know that this must be a is a matter about which honourable members are receiving a great many representations from condocerned constituents. In this area the Government has effected a complete change of policy in a covI ert fashion. Many honourable members, perhaps some on the Australian Labor Party side of this chamber, have thought that occasionally some of us in the Labor Party attach too much to the institutions we establish to offer advice. I think that, if we look at the lamenrecord of the Fraser Government in the a field of children's services since it decided not to with the establishment of a children's commission and decided instead to establish a mere division within the Department of Social Security, we will see just how important institutions occasionally can be in flagging changes in government policies. The lengths to which the Government has gone to conceal the change in policy and of heart which it has had about the support it is prepared to offer to child care throughout Austraha are extraordinary. The first thing I point out is how oddly the estimates for child care are constructed. It is difficult to track payments to preschools, to family day care centres, to full day care centres and to other child care projects such centres, after-school centres and hohday school programs. When the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) and her officers were taxed with this matter before the Senate Estimates Committee, neither the Minister nor the officers were able to produce meaningful figures for these expenditures. So, let me tell honourable members what has happened. The Government has backed away from the commitment of the previous Government to proquadrupled. vide 75 per cent of the cost of salaries of teachers in pre-schools. The Government the most snide and underhand fashion. It insists that it has merely moved to block grants for the States in these matters. But, in fact, if we look the dollars appropriated we see that there has been a massive reduction. One has to be somethe thing of a Sherlock Holmes to track how this happened. Of course, one does not have to be a genius work out the impact. Every organisation in every State concerned with the administration of preschools knows the impact this is having on the level of fees. Fees have more than doubled-cer tainly in New South Wales-in pre-schools which are run by the Kindergarten Union and by local government councils. This is having a very bad effect on the priorities which the Government insists it wants to establish. No one could with the priorities the Government set for itself or at least announced in relation to fantily care and for all its child care projects. The Government announced that it would give ority of access to single parent children, migrant children and children with special needs. I haphas pen to represent an electorate which has a ing, disproportionate number in every one of those categories. I assure honourable members that every pre-school facility in my electorate in present situation is having to more than double its fees. The consequence is that children within those categories are now no longer able to attendThis pre-school as their parents cannot afford it. Places in those schools, in many cases, will not left vacant. They will befilledby children from more affluent famiUes who Uve in areas may be more remote from these areas. will come the extra miles to get a place in a preschool because of the shortage in their own areas. The fact is that the Government has frozen assistance which it is giving to the States for schools at the level it was providing in November last year. If it were to do nothing more than that it would be apparent to anybody who is aware the impact of inflation on all costs in Australia that the real level of commitment would be reduced. The Government's answer, of course, is the answer which it gives in everyfieldof governprojects ment expenditure where cuts have been made, just and that is to say that the States can meet the shortfaU from the extra general purpose revenue funds now made available to the States. If those limited funds were to meet every one of the objectives for which this Government claims deserving those funds ought to be adequate, they need to be more than doubled, trebled and Even then they still would not meet the deficiency. But the situation is much worse has done this in than that. If we look at New South Wales we see that the Government, in freezing the level of assistance at at that which obtained in November last year, has had regard simply to the dollar figure and not to breakup of capital and recurrent costs. The has Director of the Office of Child Care conceded in testimony before the Senate Estimates comto mittee dealing with this matter that in the last financial year in New South Wales there was still $6.8m worth of capital approvals outstanding for pre-school projects. The effect of that, roughly, as - I understand it, is that in this financial year and in the next financial year we will be looking at the completion in New South Wales alone of about an extra 80 pre-school projects. This is an extra 80 pre-school project for which no recurquarrel rent funds are being made avaUable by the Government at even November 1976 levels. This day means that the Umited amount of money that was made avaUable in this Budget by reference prito those levels will be less again. In New South Wales the practical effect of this been that pre-school institutions are receivinstead of 75 per cent of the cost of teachers' salaries, about 50 per cent of that cost. This situation will get worse as more pre-schools are the completed and the amount of funds avaUable for teachers' salaries at those institutions is therefore spread over a greater number of institutions. is an extraordinary deception. It is one that flies in the face of the Minister's professed poUbe cies when the change to a system of block grant funding for pre-schools was announced last year. which At that time the Minister said quite ChUdren unequivocally in a Press statement: The amount to be paid to each State . . . will approximate the amount the States would have received the under the former percentage base agreement. preThat can mean nothing more than the Government undertook at least to meet the doUar figure which would pay 75 per cent of teachers' salaries ofin pre-schools. But as I have explained, the Government now concedes that in several States, especiaUy in New South Wales and to a lesser extent in Victoria where there is still a backlog of for completion, it had no indication of what will be the precise impact of this doUar sum on the level of subsidy for teachers' salaries. The effect of this will be to drive out of these institutions children who are in the category that the Government has singled out as being most or, in many cases, to close the instituwould tions or to leave them empty. The honourable member for Sydney (Mr Les MCMahon) has instanced in this place on several occasions recently the absurd position which has arisen in his electorate in the inner city part Sydney around the Glebe area, where a brand new institution has been completed and children of residents in that district in a low income of Sydney will not be able to afford to send their children to that pre-school. It will be used by more affluent commuters to jobs in the city as child-minding centre. That surely cannot what the Government intended in relation to children's services, but it is unmistakably the indirect result of the new directions of policy being set discreedy by this Government.",41
119,Mr WILSON,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"We have just heard the honourable member for Grayndler to (Mr Antony Whidam) talking about the proA vision for pre-school education and child care centres. What he failed to do was to indicate to the House his attitudes to the overall matter the care and education of young children. What this country needs above all philosophy for the family. It needs to examine decisions that are taken for the allocation funds, whether they be in welfare payments, tax rebate systems or in the provision of capital grants. These provisions need to be assessed withhome regard to their impact upon the family. It is all very well for the honourable member for Grayndler to say that all things will be solved by the provision of greater amounts money to the States. I am always amazed to State governments and Ministers raise to the highest priority matters for which they do not have to pay-matter s for which they are seeking resources from another government. It is time that the State governments fulfilled their responmeasure sibilities by getting their own priorities right. come from a State where pre-school education ising free and where there is provision for pre-school education for in excess of 80 per cent of the chil-avaUable dren in the four to five year age group. If Australia can do it it is doing so because it had a succession of governments which have sought to recognise the need to advance poUcy development across a range of areas. There are States other than South Australia which many important areas have been first neglected by State governments and aU that have done in their neglect has been to endeavourtax to place the responsibiUty on the Commonwealth Government The States have been given greaterBudget's resources under the Government's federalism pohcy . It is time that the States exercised their sponsibility and aUocated greater proportions funds into the area of childhood services, not merely into child care or pre-school education but into services to support the family in order that chUdren can be brought up by their famUies of and given appropriate care and education so that when they do start school they can begin their formal education without disadvantage. area I had intended to touch on the matter of the revision made for famUies in the social security E the udget. Before corning back to that I turn to the aprovision made for the aged. This year's estibe mates for the Department of Social Security must be assessed in the Ught of the major reforms achieved since the present Government was elected to office in 1975. Since then pensions have been indexed so that each six months-in May and November-the y are automaticaUy adjusted take into account increases in the cost of Uving. far more equitable income test has replaced the means test formerly used to determine pension eUgibiUty. Assets are no longer brought into of account in determining a person's entitlement to a pension-whic h itself is mcome. Only mcome is things is a brought into account. Substantial programs for the provision of a of range of accommodation for the aged are being in implemented. Deficit funding of charity-run nursing homes has been continued and nursing benefits payable to patients in other nursing homes have been indexed. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who is sitting at the table, reshould be congratulated for removing from so of many hundreds and thousands of patients hear accommodated in nursing homes the fear that they would within too short a timefindthemselves unable to pay for the accommodation and care they need. That this imaginative and much needed reform has been introduced is in large due to the dUigence of the Minister for I Health and the work that he has put into achieva situation whereby at least 70 per cent of the beds in privately operated nursing homes will be at a fee which the pensioner can afford. South Furthermore, the tax system has been re has formed so that pensioners with small incomes will no longer be subject to tax liabUity. The Hayden Budget introduced tax UabUity for pensioners. Pensions were made taxable. The in threshold level-the level at which that tax was imposed-wa s far too low. Many hundreds theyand thousands of pensioners who had not paid for years suddenly found that they were uable to pay tax. This Government in this tax reform has so Ufted the tax threshold that pensioners now in receipt of the re-exempt income, for means test purposes, of $20 a of week are no longer Uable to pay any tax if their income is below that level. Furthermore, a new scheme of family allowance has replaced the old child endowment and tax concession rebate arrangements. At the time the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty reported it considered that the existing means test could be improved in several ways. The report pointed out that a means test which included a treatment of assets was a relic of the past, and that it stood in the way of: . . . the rational integration of the pension means with other income tested benefits and with the income tax. The relic has been removed. The income means those test has been introduced. By advance towards this rational integration has Pensioners aretoinself been achieved. Income from assets treated in the same way as other income. The must be removed and theThis value of assets no longer affects pension bility, but full integration of the pension income test with what must be described as the income tax test has not yet been achieved. In fact, progress has been made towards this objective. expired. The new social security income test imposes SOc in the dollar rate by which pension payments are reduced as non-pension income uses. essentially sinular to an income tax, with ginal rate of SOc in the dollar. The main difference between the pension income test the income tax test is that one reduces a liabUity of the Government to the citizen and the other increases a UabUity of the citizen to the Governcation. ment. Each involves the assessment of a person's income, yet the Commissioner of Taxation and the Director of Social Services each require sioners to lodge separate returns, detailing income they have received over a specified period. It is my view that one return should suffice. Today it is not even possible to send a dupUcate copy of the same return to the two departments. Each has its own form. Their layouts are different; different definitions are used; some items are deductible from income in one case and not in the other. Though ehgibility to pay and eUgibiUty for pension are both defined on annual basis, the Department of Social Security makes its assessment for the year in prospect, whereas the Taxation Office is concerned about the year past. Those who resist suggestions that there should be a rational integration of Social Security's income test and the test used by the Taxation Office will endeavour to make the differences sound so impressive that they seem able. I contend that the simUarity between income for tax purposes and income for social curity purposes is so strong that ways and means must be found to overcome the differences and the difficulties. Pensioners should be required to complete one return only. An assessment should then be made of the net UabUity of the Government to the pensioner or the pensioner to the Government. Without an effective co-ordination between the income test used by the Department of Social Security and that used by the Taxation Office, the test total tax effect of the rate at which pension is withdrawn and tax UabUity imposed wtil deprive much who seek to improve their position of so of the increase in their non-pension income this action, a major that incentive fact reUance wiU be destroyed. being taxed at a marginal is now rate of 66c in the doUar. double taxation marginal rate of tax ehgimust be substantially reduced.",43
120,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"Mr Jarman)Uttle Order! The honourable member's time has a Mr KEITH JOHNSON (Burke) (5.8)- I wish to follow up the point raised by the honourable It is member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) a marwhen he spoke. The three departments with which we are dealing-the Department of and Health, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs-mak e up quite a significant portion of the Budget aUoIn fact, the Department of Social Security alone accounts for $256m of the Budget allocation this year. It seems to me that the amounts penof money appropriated to those three important the departments certainly warrant greater scrutiny and investigation than can be accomplished under the Government's restriction of allowing only six honourable members from each side of the chamber to speak on these matters. Putting that aside, I wish to raise one matter in particular, and that concerns quarantine in Australia as it relates to animals, plants and humans. Quarantine is something which has contax cerned me and people who are more knowledgean able in that area than I. We in Australia have been very proud, andrightlyso, of the way in which Australia has been disease free, in terms of both its human population and its animal population. However, there are tilings which are occurring regularly and which are cause for concern for the average citizen. Since the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) who is sitting at the table at the presenttimeis also responsible for quarantine matters, I trust that the matters I raise will insurmountbecome of concern to bim also. seI mention animal quarantine in this country first of aU. EarUer today we had some discussion on the Lands Acquisition Amendment Bill which is concerned with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The debate on that Bill somehow or other graviWe tated around the off-shore high security animal quarantine stadon. That has been a matter some concern for almost four years now. I would have thought that the Nauonal Country Party members in the Government and the graziers who sit in the Cabinet would have shown greater concern about this matter than they have done. Quite recendy it became apparent from speaking to beef producers during a meeting in can Rockhampton of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Worths-the Committee was there to investigate the establishment of beef research station for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-that there is a need to introduce new strains of cattle into Australia in order to herds so that the beef producers could then take onto their land an ammal which would be far more efficient in the production of beef. I do want to get into an argument about the sale of beef, but it is clear that there is a need for genetic stock. The scientists have said it; everyyear. body has said it. However, we cannot do that until we have a high security animal quarantine station which must be situated at least 400 miles off-shore. notice that moves are afoot in that regard, will still be sometimebefore that quarantine station is established. I refer also to the national mal health laboratory in Geelong which is to produce animal vaccines. The estimates for the Department of Construction show that no work is going to be done on that project this year. Minister conceded that point when answering question asked by me. That also is part and parwas cel of this whole problem. That animal health laboratory is to do research into animal diseases in Australia and to produce animal vaccines. Only quite recently there was an outbreak of Newcastles disease amongst poultry in Australia. That outbreak had a detrimental effect on the poultry industry and was apparently traced to the smuggling of some birds from overseas difficulties which carried the disease and infected our flocks.",44
121,Mr CALDER,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,Sham e on them.,45
122,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"I agree, shame on anything them. The point is that we cannot stop people from trying things; we can stop them only at the point of entry. Obviously some person smuggled in a bird which was rotten with the disease, got loose and infected our flocks, according the aUegation. Where does the fault Ue in that case? As I say-the Minister concedes this-w e cannot stop people from trying but them at the point of entry if the job is done properly and we have proper quarantine procedures. have got to take notice of the fact that people move very rapidly from one country to another. of We have to acknowledge that people are not spending at sea the six months incubation period required in respect of viruses. We have to acknowledge that within hours people can travel from one country which is endemic to disease into Australia and can bring with them live viruses. If the Minister wants to know how that be done I shaU explain it to him privately. The situation is that work on the animal health laboratory is not proceeding. No funds have a been allocated to it this year. I think something Uke a miserable $ 15,000",45
123,Mr HUNT,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,Is it in the estimates of the Departbuild up the ment of Primary Industry?,45
124,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"No, this is in the esnot timates of the Department of Construction. The Minister has conceded in an answer to a question new that no work has been done on that project this The research into animal diseases and the preparation of vaccines is important. These are matters that come within the Minister's portfolio. Because of the importance to the export markets I of clean Uvestock in Australia I think that greater but it work should be done in this area. aniLet me turn to the quarantine of people. We find from reading the daily Press that 40 ships are sailing from South East Asia or from lndoChina or from somewhere to Australia; ten of The them have already arrived. We read stories of a people leaving those ships. One group of people found by a fellow driving a grader; another lot was seen by a policeman scaling a cliff. It raises a doubt m people's minds. I am hopeful that when the Minister replies he can dispel this doubt as to whether these people are properly examined; whether they are sent home again if they are found to have diseases. I have a large migrant population in my electorate, and I have trying to explain to people, who want to bring out relatives who, for some reason or other, are not allowed to come, why these people without any examination, prior knowledge or else are allowed to sail their ships across the sea and land in Australia without the usual health precautions. I do not mind malting that sort of explanation to them if I know the and it answer. It seems to me that the people of to Australia are entitled to an answer. They are rightly proud of our history of being disease free in this area. They do not want to find these sorts we can stop of things are occurring. There is a story, whether it is true or not, of a ship in the port of Sydney being given a health clearance by the New South Wales Director of Health. The ship left Sydney, went to Melbourne and was found to be in a sub-standard condition when examined by the people in Melbourne. As I understand the situation, they oudawed the ship because of various things. These stories are around. People are entitled to answers to them. I am forced to leave aside the quarantine area because I have only 10 minutes in which to make my points, and that is not very long. I move to one of the other areas that we are debating-Veterans ' Affairs. I do not know miserable this Government can get. It has done some very mean and miserable things during the time that it has been in office. Its penny-pinching, austere way of going about dungs is indicative the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) except when the matters affect his own comfort and fare. One of the most miserable things that this any government did was to stop ments to ex-servicemen who contract tuberculosis. As I understand it, there are only 7,500 these people throughout Australia. In the past has been understood that an ex-serviceman contracted TB would be paid a pension. Now must prove that it is war-related. How the devil can a man who at 18, 19 or 20 years of age, went off to war full of patriotic fervour, and in his years contracts tuberculosis prove that his berculosis is war-related? It would seem to me most reasonable thing to allow the previous tem to continue. Not this miserable Government. It promptly knocked off that one. It is saving itself a few dollars by not paying that pension servicemen. Another benefit which this Government has in knocked off is the sustenance payment to exexpanded. servicemen. That was paid in the past. Now they that a person must show a genuine loss of income. The Government just does not understand what is employment happening in industry generally. work in industry are entided to sick leave. It is retained. one of the award provisions that are given to mothers, amongst them. The Government is saying that if someglad that this discrimination body suffers an illness and needs hospitalisation because of a war-caused injury and cannot show that loss ofincome, they must use up their sick pay. If mother a man uses up all ofhis sick pay-h e does not get ment. his sustenance payment-come s out of hospital, removed. falls down the back steps at home and breaks his leg, he has no sick pay entitlements. That is a completely dishonest attitude, and it is pennyand pinching.",45

126,Mr LLOYD,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT,"Firsdy I congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) and the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), the Ministers in charge of the portfolios to which I wish to refer, for the responsible, constructive, compassionate and successful way in which they have administered their portfolios. I refer, first of all, to the Department of Social Security-the responsibility of Senator Guilfoyle. It has an ouday of $7,247.9m, an increase of 12.7 per cent on the last Budget, and 27 per cent of how total Budget expenditure- a very responsible ministerial position. Because of this, I am pleased to hear that the Minister has instituted an overall review of the Department of Social Security to of implement improvements in it. No criticism of the Department is intended by having such a welreview. Surely efficiencies and savings can be or made in a department of that size and with an making payexpenditure of that nature.

I oppose strongly any government action to terminate the payment of that benefit farmers. If any legislation to that effect introduced I could not support it because the teria for payments for the benefit to these peoplements should be similar to the criteria for anybody Farmers must be available for work, and the income test imposed on them is far more severe than the income test for other people.

The gap is caused the lack of a supporting father or lone male parent benefit. These people suffer other disadsystem. vantages.

As afirststep, should be a supporting parents benefit similar the supporting mothers benefit so there is no crimination because of sex. I have spoken on thiscation matter on a number of occasions, and I know that others have. I know that the Minister is per-antine sonally in favour of its introduction.

I commend the Minister on the allofor Cocos Island and other quarantine faculties. However, I question two aspects of quargenerally: Firstly, if the quarantine station on Cocos Island is to be constructed, does this mean that all the other expenditure on animal ourquarantine facUities now going on will be completely necessary or will some of it be dupliDecation? I refer in particular to Torrens Island. other matter is the overall priority for expenditure in the animal health and quarantine areas. The point has been made that the National Ani(Mr mal Health Laboratory at Geelong has received Budget allocation this year. I know that this is not in the Minister's area. But, if we have an overall priority for expenditure on animal quarfanuly antine and animal health generally, perhaps some money should have been allocated for Geelong out of the total amount. I refer now to the 50-50 cost-sharing arrangeThese ment with the States in respect of hospital pUed its wisdom operating costs. There is concern in Victoria and the other States at the restrictions they claim are being appUed. From what I can understand-thi depends on the time of acceptance last year the States of the new Medibank arrangementsthe increase in Victoria this year will be at least 12 per cent. That compares with an annual averand age increase of perhaps 16 per cent to 17 per cent. Victoria claims that it is receiving $ 10m than it requested. The Commonwealth's total share is $224m. I hope that the State office? governments and the Commonwealth watch the funds hospital situation and that the States, as administrators of the hospital cost-sharing anangements, are flexible in their administration about? and do not apply across the board reductions expenditure holding anangements. In many affairs. cases these arrangements do not take into account the need for better services in certain areas. To conclude, I refer to something the Minister spoke about on Sunday in Canberra; that is, the need to provide equaUty of health services countiy people. This is perhaps the greatest in our health poticy at present. Country people must have the abUity to see specialists at cost. Parents must have the abUity to cover their transport and accommodation cost when they have to accompany their cluld to a far-away metropoUtan hospital. The Government must introduce measures to assist people in country areas so that they have equality of health services with city people.",46

I suppose that this is almost a universal debate in a sense. Medibank, repatriation, is now termed veterans' affairs, and the social curity system are matters with which everyone involved. The time has come to bring the whole social security system into parity and equity. That will be a compUcated and difficult task. honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson) mentioned some of the problems associated with taxation. We have to decide what we mean by support systems. It istimewe had an adequate family support system. It is time we gave more thought to a minimum income system and the way we should go about implementing it. many suggestions have been in the pipeline for years. It istimethe Parliament itself apto them. I take issue with those people who have been s busy congratulating their Ministers. The Minisby ters' record over the last 18 months or so is a sorry one indeed. We have seen the dismantling of the Australian Assistance Plan, for instance, the confusion over the national health service. Who would say in public that the present less Medibank is a better system than the one that was operating when this Government came to We have seen the freezing of pre-school and the Ulegality of some decisions in relathe tion to unemployment benefit. What are Ministers in this Government to be congratulated or I want to refer to what is now called veterans' Whoever thought of that name? As far as I can tell, it is something picked up from Washington by the kind of people who always want to change things in some odd and corny way. 'Repatriation' was and is a part of the language. I notice that the Government still refers to for 'repatriation institutions'. The Minister for gap Health (Mr Hunt) obviously supports the idea. I can see that he is the sort of person who would no great change Yarralumla to Lake View and who would call KirribUli, Buena Vista. It is just another piece of governmental and administrative nonsense, confusing the people who are now the object of what one might caU the community's and the Government's fading vision. It is 30 years since the Second World War. It is 60 years since the First World War. No one can blame therisinggeneration for forgetting what were all about. I take this opportunity to on record the necessity to maintain a consistent policy of adequate service to former we When people put on the uniform to serve the no matter whether their service is of a high order or is ordinary, they have accepted a responsibUity and the possibUity of a sacrifice which that no other form of employment involves. seTherefore, there must be no interference with the is general principles upon which health services, general care, and levels of pensions and benefits for dependants and housing system have been Thedeveloped over 60 years. My friend the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) mentioned the decision-making process. It is almost impossible, particularly for people who served in the First World War, to prove that a disability was war caused. I have never been able to work out how people in the First survived in the trenches at all. There should never have been any argument. The statistics show that, over the years between the wars until 1950 or perhaps later, the First World War returned servicemen received less consideration than those of us who served in the Second World War. Statistics on the numbers who served, wounds and other casualties and deaths in action in the two world wars-Vietna m exemplifies even further-related to the actual pensions paid will show that the people who served in the First World War had a very hard row to hoe. My own view, which I have held for a long while, is that particularly people who served in the First World War but anybody who went through active combatant service ought to have whatever disease from which they suffer acter cepted as being war caused. How do they prove that? We have asked this question so often. Whatprojects research have we done? Let us take people who were in infantry battalions in 1945.1 served in unit through which some 4,000 men passed in the six years of the Second World War. They seryear. ved all over the world in very rigorous circumare stances. Many of them were casualties, both from disease and from wounds. In 1943, 1944 and 1945 they were the fittest ness anywhere, as were probably most people who were considered Al in the Services. I speak now of infantry men and associated branches of the Services, the people I know something about. They were the fittest people in the country. were probably as fit as anybody on this planet. is reasonable to assume that they still ought to thefittestpeople in their age group 30 years later.and If they are not, it is almost surely the result their service. I am convinced that they are not fittest people in their age group any more. But what research have we done on it? We should have taken groups of these people cerned.half and, as far as we could, examined their actual do not tliink medical condition when they were serving and all in Victoria. their medical condition now. If it did not do anything in the way of providing benefits at least might supply some information about the rigours of war service and its impact upon human eficiary beings. So I appeal to the Parhament to maintain constant vigilance in this place. The servicemen will constantly be chiselled out of their benefits we are not careful. I know that the war service homes system is under continual assault. Those people who consider it now too late to be giving any sorts of benefits are always trying to put the interest rates. We must resist that. The benefitas was earned for all sorts of reasons. It was not a payment by way of reward. It was a benefit given World War as a result of service. I want to pay some attention to another area that was raised by my friend the honourable and member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam). I refer to the question of the pre-schools system in Victoria. In my electorate advice has just been received that funds for the Moreland pre-school, which was guaranteed support last year by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) this upon whom so much praise has been heaped here this afternoon, have now been frozen. The Victorian Government has written to the Coburg City Council and has told it not to proceed any further until clarification is received from Canberra-as if it is ever likely to be received. As I understand it, there was an agreement made some time last year between the Assistant Minisof Health in Victoria, Mr Jona, and the Minister for Social Security on this basis. Some 11 in Victoria are frozen at the moment. In the Moreland case they were given to understand aon 27 October last year that they would receive $90,000 and that they would receive $20,000 this They are not receiving the $90,000, they not receiving the $20,000 and the whole system has been brought into disarray. Strangely enough, most of these projects seem to be in people in the busiLabor areas. I put in a special appeal on behalf of the people in the Moreland area. It is a migrant area, a low income area, a place where there are single arent famiUes. I believe that this represents a E They reach of trust. Surely to goodness we can Itdevelop a governmental system which proceeds be along a path which has already been guaranteed promised. We aU seem to be victims of the of stop and go system which is inflicting on the Austhe tralian Government whole areas of insecurity. I appeal to the Minister for Health who is at the table to raise this matter on my behalf and on beof my constituents with the Minister conThere is not an enormous sum involved. I that very large sums are involved at it There are lots of other matters which I would Uke to raise at this time. This year I was the benof the health services in Canberra. I can only say that they are first class as indeed also are the repatriation hospital services, of which I have if been a beneficiary. I can never understand how anybody can oppose the estabUshment of a national health service which suppUes the same quaUty of service at the same price and under the up same administrative system to every Australian, we have been providing for the best part of 60 years to most of the people in the repatriation system. Anybody in this country is happy to fronta up for repatriation health services, to use salaried services from doctors and all the rest ofit without complaint I do not know why there should be any argument about supplying it to everybody the community.",48
129,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT, the rejection Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,50
130,Mr GRAHAM,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT," I feel it necessary at this stage in the debate on the mates for the Department of Health, the Departthe ment of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to reply to some ments made by the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) and my friend, the honourable and gallant member for Wills (Mr Bryant). It seems to me extraordinary that honourable member for Wills, particularly as was a Minister in the last Government, should make the comments that he has made about the repatriation system which is run by the Departof ment of Veterans' Affairs in this country. The fact is that, compared with all other countries apart from that with the wealthiest and most powerful economy in the world-the United States of America-the Australian record in these matters is better than that of any other country and certainly compares very favourably with that of countries Uke Canada. In my judgmentcould talk at length about this subject-it is superior to the record in the United Kingdom and anywhere on the continent of Europe. The honourable member for WiUs talked about people who had served in the war 30 years ago and who had served in the First World War 60 years ago. He talked about the difficulty establishing an identification between a dition of health and their service. The truth that for years people who served have had their records avaUable for any subsequent iUness to be studied in relation to those records. When they left the Services in 1945 and 1919 all of these people were examined. They were asked opposed whether they were suffering from any iUnesses, that they were promised treatment and, to the best my knowledge, were given treatment until they were well enough to return to civU Ufe. The statjudgment istics of servicemen who over the years have been involved in appUcations will demonstrate that they have had a proper analysis through system which has been fostered in Australia and which is about the fairest system one could conceive. Honourable members will reaUse that there is Repatriation Board in every State. If the doctors and members of that Board in a quasijudicial position are unable to identify the claim with an acceptance of the claim they are bound in by the law, which is the law fostered by the Labor governments of 1941 to 1948 and of 1972 to 1975. Then if the appUcant is not satisfied with there is a right of appeal to the Repatriation Commission, and a different set of doctors and a different set of people in the Commission wtil consider aU the facts and either disagree or concur with the judgment of the Board. estiThere are many instances that can be cited where Commission has decided in favour of the appUcant and has not concurred with thefirstjudgof the comment of the State Board. Subsequent to that, if the appUcant is still convinced that he has not had a fair and reasonable assessment of his claim he has been able for the years to appeal to a War Pensions Entitlement he Appeal Tribunal, which is independent of the Department. The War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal carries out a thorough analysis all the facts. I have never heard of any situation in which anyone has seriously charged that with some malice aforethought one of these tribunals was trying to deny to ex-servicemen or to the widows of ex-servicemen their proper entitlement The fact is that they look mto all aspects of the case and endeavour to establish beyond all reasonable doubt that there is a case Ifor granting a serviceman's claim. A study of the statistics will show that it is reasonable for me to say that the system has worked extremely well over the years and greatly to the advantage of the ex-servicemen and women and their dependants in this country. Had it been on a more legalistic basis, in my in judgment quite a number of people who conmanaged to secure claims would in all probis abtiity have been rejected. We were asked how these things are proved. They can be only a matter of medical opinion. It is a matter ofjudgment. Medical practitioners are quite likely in some circumstances-rar e indeed-to find themselves to one another in medical judgments. In type of situation, it is up to the State repatriof ation boards, the entitlement appeals tribunals or the Repatriation Commission to arrive at a The honourable member for Burke referred to eople suffering from tuberculosis. He seemed to a e under the impression that people suffering from tuberculosis would not receive entitlements. The fact of the matter is that nobody suffering from tuberculosis wtil be disadvantaged under the new arrangements that have been announced. Enormous advances have been made in medicine since 1943. In 1977 tuberculosis no longer has the horrific connotations that attached to it in the past. If someone who is deemed to be totally recovered from this terrible disease becomes ill again, the system provides that he can appeal to an assessment appeals tribunal in order to be returned to the full entitlement cable to that degree of incapacity as determined by the Tribunal. Anyone suffering from an active tuberculosis condition would be in hospital and would be on the equivalent of the totally and permanently incapacitated rate of pension. Therefore, it is utter nonsense to say that our patriation system is designed to deny sick people their proper entitlement. For many years members of the Federated Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association Australia had advantages that were greater than those accorded to their fellow ex-servicemen. Under the circumstances this was a fair reasonable thing in the judgment of the various governments. Today tuberculosis has almost ment been eliminated from Australia as a matter of age great concern. The Government has made a deing cision which, as far as I can make out, has not led to the executive of the Returned Services League, the main body representing the of ex-servicemen and women in Austraha, ap- . . pearing to complain to the Parhament. If the private honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) nave would like to test that proposition, I recommend pensioner that he approaches the national executive of the repudiate Returned Services League and ask it to give him nursing a written opinion on these decisions.",50
131,Mr ARMITAGE,LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT," I wish to I deal with the subject of nursing home benefits. I ister point out, first, that approximately 70 per cent of kept on people who are inmates of nursing homes are pensioner pensioners. Secondly, I refer to the decision of visited by their the Government, as announced by the Minister join a fund to obtain for Health (Mr Hunt), that private hospital and stage all pensioner patient medical funds and not the Government benefits to nursing homes in respect of patients would not receive any further Therefore who are insured by them. The Minister, of joined a private fund. Far to the contrary, they course, uses the argument that this will shift some of the responsibiUty to what he calls the private sector. He also uses the argument that this decision will help to utilise some of the reserves held by some of the funds. However, I would submit veryfirmlythat this is actually excuse and that in reality the private funds increase the fees paid by their members. In other words, far from charging the extra cost of the subscriptions to nursing homes to their own reserves they wtil simply increase their fees. Accordingly it wtil not be the private sector-in other words the private hospital and medical funds-that will bear the costs; it will be the public itself. The Minister has used an around-about method to shift some of the responsibility for financing private nursing homes from the Federal Government on to members of the pubUc. appliThis responsibUity has been shifted onto members of the private funds. Much more imponant is the campaign being carried out by the private funds and the nursing homes themselves-unfortunately , according to reports, these actions have been aided and abetreted by the Federal Government-to try to entice pensioners to join private funds in the belief that they will get some advantage from doing so. In fact, they would not receive any advantage. Far TB to the contrary, they would be greatly advanof taged if they were to join private funds. On 20 September, I asked the Minister for and Health this question without notice: Is the Minister aware of repons that the Federal Governand private health funds are endeavouring to encourprivate nursing home patients to join pnvate health funds? Would he agree that pensioner patients in such nurshomesAnd I repeat that 70 per cent of patients in such welfare nursing homes are pensioners. would not only have nothing to gain by joining a fund but would actually lose because they would to pay the necessaiy contributions to these funds? As there is so much confusion on this matter, particularly among patients in nursing homes, will he take action to repons that the Government is trying to encourage home patients, particularly pensioners, to join public funds? Will he give publicity to the fact that it would be a disadvantage to pensioner patients in such homes if they joined those funds? do not want to be rude, but to be frank the Mingave a rather confused reply in which he referring to the choice of a doctor. In fact patients in private nursing homes are own doctors. They do not have to that privUege. Also, at this contributions are paid will pay by the Federal Government. they benefits if they would be very greatly disadvantaged by having to pay subscriptions to the funds. In other words, they would pay subscriptions to the funds and relarge ceive nothing whatsoever in return. an The Minister for Health said in reply to my wiU question-and I fuUy agree with him on this point-that he was aware of a great deal of confusion among nursing home patients because of a campaign that was launched by some private health funds. But I do not tbink the Minister alises that the nursing homes themselves joined in that campaign or that the funds have used name of this Government and the Minister for Health as being party to the campaign. I quite clear that I do not think the Minister party to it. Nevertheless, this was done. As result I received phone calls in my office and visits from pensioners and the relatives of penblock sioners in nursing homes who expressed their deep concern about what was happening. I it is still a matter of some confusion. Press statements in my own area which clearly establish that there is no advantage whatsoever expired. to be gained by a pensioner patient who is in a nursing home joining a private trary, it is a disadvantage to them because will not receive any morefinancialassistance and in fact will have to pay subscriptions to the private fund. I ask the Minister to issue a Press statement clearly establishing that the Federal Government is not encouraging pensioner from patients to join private funds in order to obtain coverage for nursing home treatment. It should also clearly estabUsh that pensioner patients fully protected now by the funds Federal Government to nursing homes. The Minister would have arightto put in that stateSouth Wales. ment that he has recendy appreciably increased the subscriptions paid by the Federal Government to nursing homes. He should also point that the nursing homes should reduce their fees to pensioners. Most nursing homes whole pension and in addition ask relativessometimes it is the patient's wife, who is also a move: pensioner-to pay $6 or $8 per week extra out of a very smaU pension. Now that there has been this appreciable Windsor, increase in benefits paid to nursing homes it is redistributing time for nursing homes to cut out that nefarious laid practice of charging pensioners, even a woman Report, who has her husband in a nursing home, up to adopted. $ 10 per week to cover various necessities such laundry costs and this type of tiling. The Minister should make it clear in such a statement that the Government is not a party to this fraudulent campaign which has been conducted by the prito vate funds to entice pensioners to join the funds when it would be of no benefit but rather a tinct disadvantage to them if they did so. FinaUy, I deal with the question of funds for have the community health program. Last year, if I preciation recollect the figure correctly, a polyclinic at ried out their Mount Druitt had its funds for operating expenses reduced by some $100,000. The clinic had three speech therapists who were a great necessity in Mount Druitt. As one retired reresigned the clinic was not able to replace that therapist without special approval from the Dethe partment. The polyclinic at Mount Druitt is the biggest and one of thefinestcommunity health make centres in the country and one of the best was a examples of preventive medicine in the true a sense of the word, particularly in respect of paediatric services. It is unfortunate that the funds which were distributed to the States last year for the maintenance of necessary stanthink dards were not indexed against inflation.

It is the view of the Government that the report should be adopted and we therefore recommend the Parliament that the report be approved. This is thefirstreport presented since the current disredistribution process began earUer this year. The distribution commissioners for all States faced a difficult and complex task. I hope that the House will join with me in expressing apof the manner in which they have carduties.",52
133,Mr SCHOLES,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"The Opposition does not oppose the adoption of the report or by the distribution commissioners. I think I should say to the House that it might be worthwhile for this Government, or a future governAustraUa-wide ment, to consider whether reports by distribution commissioners should be accepted without proval by the Parliament. I think there is a danger, especially following recent High Court tribution decisions, in the Parliament having to give final Labor Party, approval of any redistribution and it unless there is a majority in favour m Houses. This is a serious question. I think rent practice lends itself to attempts to influence Liberal Party members of this chamberthe commissioners by means of statements by memTasmania bers of Parliament. We have seen that happen the last two or three days outside the Parhament. Although Some honourable members have made stateParty, we the ments intended to indicate to the distribution the five Liberal members commissioners that their reports may not be Tasmania adopted unless they met certain criteria even through those criteria are not set out in the Elecmania toral Act. That is a dangerous precedent. Elecbehalf toral boundaries are so vital to the operation of of Representatives the Parliament and to the fair the community that there should be procedures in the Electoral Act whereby the reports of the distribution commissioners become final, posstioned ibly with provision for reference back by the Parliament on one occasion. I think the ParUafor ment has sufficient authority in that it appoints least one of the commissioners, with the appointindependently ment of the other two commissioners being pracdrawing tically automatic. The Parliament has a vested interest in this matter and is not necessarily capable of making an objective judgment-cer tainly not a judgment that is necessarily in best interests of the community in general or proper operation of electoral representation under the system by which we operate. The Opposition does not oppose the motion.",52
134,Mr BURR,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA," I agree with the Opposition sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), namely, that it should not be the role of government to interfere with the findings of independently appointed distriindebted bution commissioners setting electoral boundber aries for Federal divisions. As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr do Street) said, the report by the distribution commight missioners for Tasmania is the first of the redispoll tribution proposals to come before the ParUa1975 ment. There is no doubt that on balance, based on the results of the 1975 election, the redistribuable tion favours the Labor Party. Be that as it may, adopt the view that it should not be the role government to exert its power or influence through the Parliament in order to instruct the distribution commissioners on what they should recommend. If that were to happen, no doubt there would be a gerrymander of the electorate in favour of the government of the day. I do not think democracy in Australia apwould be served if that were to be the case. WhUst we from Tasmania accept that the discommissioners' report favours the we do not adopt the view that it not approving makes it impossible both seats. In fact we holdforthetheopposite Liberal Party to win view. Despite the cur-the way that the boundaries are drawn five from will have an extremely good chance of in retaining their seats at the next election. redistribution favours the Labor believe that the performance put up by of this chamber from has appealed to the electorate in Tasand that our efforts, as a team acting on such as of the people of Tasmania, have been to ensure that the five Tasmanian House seats wtil be retained by the representation of Liberal Party. I must return to the principle which I menwhen I began my speech and on which I said that I agreed with the honourable member Corio. I do not believe that governments at which override the recommendations of elected commissioners for the of electoral boundaries play any role in furthering or mamtaining democracy. It is on that principle that I wholeheartedly accept the - recommendations of the distribution comthe missioners and I am proud to add my name in the support of the recommendations and in passing them through this chamber.",53
135,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA," I want to say, in support of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), that the does not oppose this redistribution in any way. As shadow spokesman for the Opposition on electoral matters I should have been present at 8 o'clock to say that to the House. I am to my colleague, the honourable memfor Corio, for saying it for me. We all agree that this redistribution is fair and reasonable. I not know that it favours the Labor Party. I say that, based on my own statistics, if we as badly at the next election as we did in on the distributions that have been made we wtil win only 33 seats. I would Uke honourmembers to bear in mind the fact that unless Ienough votes are cast in the ballot boxes we will of not win seats. The distribution commissioners should not be blamed if people do not win seats. I am aware that the distribution commissioners also did a very good job in analysing objections to this redistribution. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) would be aware of that also if he has looked at their report. One of the objections to which the commissioners did not agree, was to the effect that the redistribution favoured the sitting member-no t in the honourable member's electorate, but in another electorate. I did not want to refer to this objection, but it is dealt with in the report on the objections presented by the commissioners. It is not wise to talk about what favours one party and what favours another party. Australians are entitled to vote as they think fit. The important thing is that there be equality of suffrage.",53
136,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"Order! I point out to the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that we are not having a general debate on electoral matters. I allowed the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) to make one or two comments because I thought he was filling in until the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith or somebody else arrived on behalf of the Opposition. The question before the House is: That the House ofRepresentatives approves of the redistribution of the State of Tasmania into Electoral Divisions proposed by Messrs J. R, Lennard, Windsor, the Commissioners appointed for the purpose of redistributing the said State into Divisions, in their Repon laid before the House of Representatives on 21 September 1977, and that the names of the Divisions suggested in the Repon, and indicated in the map referred to therein, be adopted. We are not having a general debate on redistribution and the theories and principles of redistribution. This debate is limited to the one report that is before the House.",54
137,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"I am not going to disam agree with you, Mr Acting Speaker, but there two reports before the House. There is the report of the distribution commissioners on the rediselectoral tribution and there is the report relating to objections to the redistribution. I was referring the report on the objections. It also has been tabled. It deals with the decisions of the comthis missioners in respect of those objections. Under the Electoral Act commissioners are obliged to table the objections and their comments thereon. I am addressing my remarks to the observations of the commissioners in respect of objections and their comments which will be found in the secthe ond report which has been tabled as an ancillary to the first report. The point I am making is that we look at the situation in the way in which commissioners looked at those objections we will find that they said: ""There were objections in Tasmania that if we were to do this it would favour the sitting member. We did not do anything like that.' That is the point they are making. We accept that from the Opposition's point of view. If we apply the mathematics of the present distribution which, as has been alleged- I think unfairly-favour s the Opposition, we find that we will lose another three seats. That does not help the Opposition. But the Opposition will help itself by trying to get more support. The point I am making was raised today. It is unfair to cast aspersions on electoral justice or decisions made as to what ought to be the tolerances. That has the effect of trying to influence the commissioners. Mr Acting Speaker, as you would know, at the conference of the National Country Party of Australia at the weekend speeches were made against the Government by Ministers pointing out that what had been done was wrong, that there should have been greater tolerances. I think that is unfair because it is as though the commissioners ought to be giving weight to issues which were raised at that conference. Parliament has determined that the tolerances should be as they are. The issue is one of as equal suffrage. I think the principle has been apC. C. A. Butier, and J. M. plied very well in Tasmania. If we look at the division on a population basis we will see that the commissioners have done the best they can to be uniform. All electorates are in the 50,000 voting group. That is a fair and reasonable assessment by the commissioners. We want to congratulate all the other commissioners. Of course, Parliament has the right to make its comments in relation to the resolution. Here we are making a favourable comment. The point I drawing to the attention of the House is that are it does not help democracy in this country to have speeches made by Ministers saying that the divisions are wrong and unfair, that the they should be challenged and altered. That to affects democracy as people might think they are suffering an injustice. The Constitution of which resolution forms part provides that every State is entitled only to the representation which its population gives it. There are some special tolerances for Tasmania. In fairness to Tasmania I point out that its population has increased to such an extent that it is getting near the quotas of other States. It is really not getting any special privileges. If we accept a constitution on if the basis that States are to have representation in the accordance with population it sbould follow, should it not, that the electoral boundaries within a State should, as far as practical, be equal? The 10 per cent tolerance was a very effective way of doing that. The complaint I raised in this morning was that if Ministers",54

I point out to the Tasmania. honourable member that I do not want bate this evening to develop into a general broad debate upon the matter of a redistribution.,55

142,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"I point out to the honourable member that he has spoken twice about that report. In general terms he has spoken about the number of seats, the situation relating to States and to the general principles redistribution. I point out that this is not a dein bate, at this moment, on the general principles redistribution, the Constitution and other ters relating to a redistribution and the State Parhament.",55
143,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"I accept that position. I again remind you, Mr Acting Speaker, that there are two reports. I am addressing my mind to the second report.",55
144,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,I have accepted that.,55
145,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"I want you to listen, if you will be patient and bear with me, to the report of the suggestions, comments or objecredistribution. tions. Mr Acting Speaker, you will also underbroaden stand that the previous speaker made the ment, as he was entitled to do, that he thought this distribution favoured the Australian Labor Party. I answered that, distasteful though it be from the point of view of people having to ten. But I said that it does not favour the Labor Party. I draw your attention specifically to page 38 of the second report of the suggestions, comfact ments or objections lodged with the distribution commissioners. You will see there a suggestion that the distribution favours the Liberal Party. That is printed in the report. I wastetimereading it out. The commissioners said they did not tltink there was any vahdity in distribution that objection. Mr Newman-No r does anyone else. the House Mr LIONEL BOWEN-I am making the point, though, that this suggestion is contained in the report which has been tabled in the on the Mr Acting SPEAKER-That isreferringto He is a particular State. in the Mr LIONEL BOWEN-That isreferringto the de Mr Acting SPEAKER-If the honourable and member recalls the comments he made on a number of occasions, he will understand that he referred to general principles. If my memory serves me correctly, he spoke about the number seats which could or could not be won, in terms, in the Commonwealth. I am suggesting to the honourable member, as I have that this debate purely and simply covers Tasmania. While some general comment and a slight passing reference may be allowable, I suggest that the honourable member should not broaden the debate covering the principles and also basic factors of a general redistribution. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Acting Speaker, I of raise a point of order. In view of your ruling and view of the fact that the redistribution for each of State will be brought down State by State, I ask matwhether that means that when we come to each over the next few days you will rule as you have just ruled? Will honourable members on both sides of the House be precluded from discussing the overall principles of redistribution because they will be confined to discussing the redistribution State by State?",55
146,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"I point out that the matter of a redistribution and the report from a State do not open the way for a general debate upon the principles and factors relating to a If honourable members were to the debate into a discussion on rediscomtribution as such, that would mean that we would have a repetitive debate on each report which is presented. I suggest that honourable may members read the motion again which is that the lisHouse of Representatives approves of the redistribution of the State of Tasmania into electoral divisions as proposed, et cetera. I appreciate the that in a discussion on a State redistribution general comments must be made. But I have said that the discussion should not develop into a general debate on the principles and factors of a do not want to redistribution as such.",55
147,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,In thereportof the commissioners we find at page 8 that they set out the number of electors in Tasmania for each division. I was saying that I thought that was a very fair and equal distribution on the basis of one vote one value.,55
148,Mr HUNT,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,You said that once.,56
149,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"Yes, I said that once. (8.21)Because of the number of objecdons which have been created been taken I felt that I needed to repeat that Kingsford-Smith statement. I did not know I was getting support from the Liberal Party to the extent I did. We also need to look at the types of objections were raised. One of the objections, as it turns was made by a geographer named Mr Cotgrove in relation to a seat in Tasmania. His objection mentioned especially and the Commissioners state that it was a very well researched objection. We accept the position taken by the comthat missioners because the objection by Cotgrove was on the basis that it favoured the sitting member. The commissioners do not uphold that objection and give very good reasons making the point that, on looking at these objecbenefit tions, I did not see the decision as one which favoured the Opposition. That is the point which, wisely or not, was raised by the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr). He raised the question as to whether this decision was favourrespect, able to one party or another. In that context made a mathematical calculation and made the assertion, to which I stick, that no matter which State one picks the decision does not favour Winding up my comments on this issueMr Newman-Than k God.",56
150,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"I know the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community should Development would not be happy to hear me each continue because the point I am making is that is improper for Ministers of the Government to continue to attack the provisions of the Comis monwealth Electoral Act and the tolerances prothe vided for in that Act. As was suggested this morning, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) ought to be dealing with that aspect cause future discussions in this House could be affected by the question as to whether distriper bution reports which have been submitted to have been dealt with on a proper basis or whether some undue influence has been given some commissioners. Cotgrove stated that he felt that the commissioners made the decision they did because the location of the residence of a sitting member. The public impression is that something improper was done. I am sure that nothing but improper happened. I applaud the decision the commissioners. But the point I am making that Ministers of the Crown have a duty to their Cabinet not to detract from a situation. They should not be allowed to remain in Cabinet if they do so. That was the matter raised this morning. I have nothing further to add.",56

A couple of impressions have been created by is the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. He said that the quota for Tasmania, because of the population growth in State, was almost Uke that for the other States, if my understanding is correct.",56
153,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DIVISIONS IN TASMANIA,"Cornin g up to that. why. I am Mr DONALD CAMERON-Well, for the of the honourable member, the quota for Tasmania is 52,000, for Western Australia it is 69,000, for South Australia it is 74,000, for Victoria it is 69,000, for New South Wales it is 71,000 and for Queensland it is 65,000. With I suggest that 52,000 is well below those I figures. In defence of the Ministers who the previous speaker suggested should resign from the Cabinet, I point out that when one examines the us. way in which the distribution commissioners have utilised this new 10 per cent tolerance rule throughout Australia one finds that in Tasmania the division that has the highest margin above the quota is Denison. Honourable members remember that the number of electors in division can go 10 per cent above or 10 per it cent below the quota. Denison is 4.14 per cent above the quota and Braddon, a large rural area, only 2.76 per cent below. In Western Australia commissioners have used almost the largest tolerance in Curtin, which is 4.56 per cent above the quota, while Kalgoorlie is 6.30 per cent bebelow. In South Australia, the division of Adelaide is 4.2 per cent above and Barker is 3.67 cent below. In Victoria, Chisholm is 6.37 per us cent above and Mallee 6.85 per cent below. In New South Wales, Phtilip is 3.77 per cent above to the quota and Paterson 4.48 per cent below. In Queensland, Brisbane is 3.80 per cent above and Dawson 4.04 per cent below the quota. of Mr COHEN - I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. I do not really wish to intervene in the speech by the honourable member for Griffith, I think, in fairness to the honourable member of for Kingsford-Smith, the honourable member is for Griffith is now making comments which range widely over the whole redistribution.

164,Mr GILES,PAIRS," I intend tonight to talk mainly on the estimates for the DepartMACKellar, M.J.R. MCLeay. J.E ment of Veterans' Affairs. Initially I congratulate the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham) on the panicularly good speech he made on this subject prior to the suspension of the sitting. I suppon much of the substance ofhis speech. I think it is proper that we should conNewman, K.E. Nixon, P.J. gratulate the Depanment of Veterans' Affairs on having digestible up-to-date information readily available to the Committee for considerauon of Robinson, Eric Robinson, Ian its estimates. I refer particularly to the Repatriation Commission for having produced so promptly its useful annual report for 1976-77- 1 Shipton, R. F. Short, J.R. stress the year-and making it available for honourable members to consult and to form their views. I think that other departments and comStaley, A A. Street, A. A missions could well take note of its promptness. I deal firstiy with the subject of repatriation. I think it is important that we all recognise the task Wilson, I. RC. Tellers: faced by the Department and the Repatriation Commission. To give some idea of that task, I point out that there are almost half a million recipients of the disability pension and about 164,000 recipients of the service pension. The meaning of the term 'disability pension' is I believe self evident. Perhaps I should explain that a service pension is not to be confused with a DeUren,T. Wallis, LG . fence Force Retirement Benefit Fund pension for regular servicemen at the end of their service; it is some recompense for people who have suffered some of the rigours of war. There are some imponant points which I wish to emphasise. Repatriation pensions are for veterans and their dependants and for dependants of deceased veterans. We should remember that these veterans still include a few from the South African War, dating back to the turn of the century; a significant but declining number from the 1914-18 War, 60 years ago; the bulk from the 1939-45 War, 30 years ago; and a number from operations of our armed Services since then. I dunk the Committee should realise that the problem is not only a big one but also one which will be a continuing social problem for some In Committee years to come. The Government, with the active co-operation of the Returned Services League and other ex-service organisations, has made many sigmficant improvements to pension eligibility and payments since it came to office less than two years ago. I think it is important that the Committee recognise, as we are looking at the estimates for this year, some of the important reforms that this Government has made. First of all, I refer to the transfer of the tions of the Repatriation Appeals Tribunal to the newly established Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The new Tribunal will retain mformality of approach towards repatriation appeal hearings while ensuring consistency of interpretation and apphcation of the law. Ex-service organisations will still be represented and retained on the panels dealing with repatriation matters. In accordance with the Toose report, therightof legal representation has been looked at by the Government. The Government has accepted ex-service organisations' views that this would reduce the informality that I have mentioned, and increased costs would be a factor. Such representation is to be hmited to hearings chaired by a presidential member of the Tribunal, and then is to be only with his consent. There are instances in which I believe this facUity of legal representation should be applied for by appUcants and that the apphcations should be looked at leniently by the President of the Tribunal. I make that remark in passing because honourable members who have looked at this matter over a period of years would know that some of the issues are extremely complex. I believe that it is an unfair onus on individual applicants who may not have a very good quasilegal brain with which to handle their case to have those sorts of restraints imposed. (Quorum formed). The matter to which I was referring was expired. that this Government, with the active cooperation of the RSL, has made many significant improvements to pension eUgibUity and paySocial ments since it came to office less than two years ago. The second point that I wish to make relates to the contentious onus of proof The Government has simplified this. In essence, pension determining authorities ridiculous andunder do not emphasise formaUty or technicalities in their hearings. Further, recognition is given to order the difficulty of producing records of or witnesses the to an event which occurred in maybe, frequently, many years before. In Because it was the Government general terms, the benefit of the doubt is given to so. the appUcant. The structure of the repatriation boards hearing claims and appeals is more flexible and permits board chairmen and memschool bers to operate in more than one State, which achieves greater uniformity of decision. As part of the continuing consideration of the report repatriation by Mr Justice Toose, I believe that is necessary to consider the introduction of new legislation to review the appeals system at present in use. For an indication of other areas which may require government attention in func- future, I refer honourable members to recommendations in the Toose report and to page 18 of the RSL's sixty-first annual report, the report for 1976. I refer now to defence service homes. Again for details I refer the Committee to the RSL's 1976 report, at page 25, and to the statements of the previous Minister, Senator Durack, on 5 September this year. NaturaUy, more funds would help, but I think all ex-servicemen, above all other people, accept the need for budgetary restraints in view of the in-built problems produced some years back by the Whitlam Government. It will take time for the lag to find its way through the economy and for the economy to become functional and vital again. Nevertheless, there are three parts of that pohcy statement which I hope the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Garland) will review-no t in the sense of being a new broom but to see whether better use can be made of funds available, taking into account the RSL's views and the views of currently serving members of the armed forces. The new Minister is in a very fortunate situation as a result of his previous chairmanship of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure.",58
165,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has,59
166,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS," I raise very briefly one matter under the Department of Security estimates. The Department operates substantially under the Social Services Act which lays down certain criteria for the payment or otherwise of benefits. This year on one section, section 47. occasion, ment despite court decisions, the Governacted in order to deny benefits to persons and clarified entitled to them that Act. In fact, the most extreme lengths were gone to into prevent school leavers last year, whom court ruled were entitled to benefits, from the heat of batde poses, thethose obtaining benefits. To aU intents and purGovernment acted outside the law. it was able to do On one occasion to my knowledge it notified a leaver who had fulfilled aU criteria that he was rejected on the ground that he had made insufficient efforts to obtain employment. That on statement from the Department was a complete it fabrication and was in a standard letter that had been sent to all school leavers in that area. It was withdrawn and changed, after objection by his parents. It would have stood against his record as a rejection because he had made insufficient efforts. In fact, he had appUed for 57 jobs. The Department said that this was an insufficient effort. I suggest that if the person who wrote the letter had looked at the record he could not possibly have written such a letter. He would not have written it except for a rninisterial direction carried through by the Director-General of the Depanment, for poliucal purposes, to deny to people their entitlements under the law. That in my opinion is an act for which no government should be responsible. People should not be denied what they are entided to under the law. We now have another situation. In Victoria there is an industrial dispute out of which the Government is seeking to make political It feels that there are votes to be gained by being tough. It does not know how to be tough to go about the problem, so it is posturing. That is not unusual. As pan of its posturing it is threatmatter ening and possibly tomonow it will even be protainly posing that the Act under which people's eligiyou bility for unemployment benefit altered in this Parliament in order to deny people retrospectively the benefits to which they are enThe titled. It is not unusual for the present Prime remarks Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to wish to punish those people who work for their Uving and who therefore disrupt his idea of whereby those who have should have and be able to spend and those who have not scourge the earth by continuing to exist. That seems to be the policy which back bench supporters of this Government are also supporting. If the Cabinet makes that decision tomorrow I am sure that those people wtil be in this supporting a proposition whereby persons, through not fault of their own they work for wages in industry, wtil not receive what the Social Security Act says they are entitled to receive. I suggest that some honourable members might read that Act. People nied retrospectively those benefits by changes the legislation. It is quite clear that the GovernChairman. ment is at least considering this proposition. fact that it is considering it is evidence beyond doubt that it beUeves that spite is better than sponsibtiity and that confrontation harmony. It is proposing to put to this Parliament and certainly it has discussed at Cabinet level a proposition whereby persons who like the leavers earUer this year, are entitled to benefits under the law estabUshed by this Parliament and standing for many years wtil be denied their entitlements. That is an act which no government should be supporting in this Parliament but I certain that every honourable member on the Government back bench will support legislation to that effect tomorrow. In one plant in my electorate, the Ford Motor Company, 2,700 employees have been stood down. They would be eUgible for unemployment benefit tomorrow if other criteria did not prevent their etigibitity. They are not involved in the strike. They are not party to the strike. They certainly cannot by any imagination meet the criteria in the Act for direct involvement in an industrial dispute. But the Government is quite prepared to deny those people unemployment benefit which is the wherewithal to Uve in order to show just how tough and important some of the Ministers are. They cannot think of anything capital. constructive to do about the economy. or how Mr HUNT - You are only guessing.",59
167,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,I may be guessing but the is being seriously considered. It is cerbeing put forward by your Government. If are prepared to deny it I shaU be very happy is tested will be to hear your denial.,60

Tomorrow The you will probably be one of those called on to make a decision on this matter. I hope you are. I rehope that the Government wtil consult the Party is better than on the matter. Mr Brown-Speculation ; that is all it is. school Mr SCHOLES-It may be speculation but one of the things I have found in this place is that a lot of speculation, especiaUy the worse type, has real foundation. It is no good speculating about the matter if honourable members opposite have am forced the legislation through the Parliament without even showing it to the Opposition as they did a few months ago. I do not want to pursue the matter further. There is a responsibility on Government supporters and this Parliament to uphold the law as it exists, until it is changed. not beheve that the law should be changed where retrospectively in order to deny people payments to which they are now entitled. If it is the Government's intention to take away from people, as it did last Christmas, benefits to they are entitled, under the flimsiest pretext which private enterprise would not get away with and which the High Court indicated clearlyhigher was a pretext I suggest that the only aim this Government has is to cause deep divisions and resentment within the community in the hope that it can trade on them for electoral success. that is the way in which it intends to solve the mentioned. problems of the nation I can only say God help the nation.",60
176,Mr SHIPTON,PAIRS,"In speaking on the Estimates for the Department of Health this evening I raise the question of the link tween child neglect and drug taking. This is serious problem worthy of attention m Australia today. I hope that the proposed Commonwealth inquiry into drugs will cover the links between child abuse and drug taking. I have talked experts in the field and have gathered informaoccasion tion which I believe will be of interest to the House. It is not only drugs like morphine, heroin,this marihuana and hash which are involved but alsoUfe. some standard tranquilliser prescription items commonly prescribed by medical practitioners. the These include drugs such as Valium. Often rights women under stress have Valium prescribed their condition. If a child is annoying a mother crying or playing up in some other way she may well be tempted to give the child a dose of the This sedative she herself is taking. ported case where a mother under some stress was prescribed this drug. Her child looked normother, mal. She was under the care of a foster mother who was distressed when she found blood on thebe pillow. It was found that the child's throat had the virtually been burnt out because she had near lethal dose of the sedative. The danger of drugging children with drugs such as this is that they are quietened down dur-takers ing the daytime,their normal time of activity which is part of the growing up process. They ceive no normal stimulation. They cannot play. They cannot walk. There is a great risk that theyis will become mentally backward. Their brain not allowed to develop. It is also fairly common for drugs like Valium, Phenergan and Benadryl to be prescribed for children themselves. parents Another drug is Mandrax, a sleeping tablet which is reasonably freely available under prescription and is addictive. One mother is reported to have stated that she can build up a tolerance I doand get a kick out of Mandrax. I know of a case a mother on this drug bruised her leg from falling downstairs, burnt her arm in a fire and had a black eye from falling over all in the space of a few days. She was an ex-morphine addict whichand had switched to pot and Mandrax. Many of the drugs frequently prescribed for children can cause problems. Parents may be tempted to give doses of tranquiUsers to qmeten down their naughty children who are upsetting them. I referred earUer to the drug Phenergan which is freely available under prescription as a drug for Ifchildren. It can cause the problems I have We all reaUse that screaming and naughty children can irritate parents. But we must remember that children can build up a tolerance to drugs and can start on the road to drug taking beby parents giving them overdoses of these prea scriptions or giving them when not prescribed. The question of hard drugs is even more serious. I know of a case where the mother of a young chtid was a heroin addict. She attempted to comto mit suicide by taking caustic soda on one and swaUowmg razor blades. In the opinion of some experts in the chtid welfare field mother had httle chance of leading a normal The child was subsequently made a ward of State. This raises the issue of children's rights and whether theserightsare different from the of the parents. It is common in the treatfor ment of addicts with young chUdren that the bychild is taken to the hospital with the mother. raises a conflict between the natural right of I know of one rerights. A tochild the parent bring up a child and the child's who is with his mother in the hospital will often be locked in a room with his have no other children to play with and a virtual prisoner of the institution in which mother is placed. I think that emphasis needs to be put on the treatment of the famtiy rather had a than on the treatment of the patient. The risk of physical danger to children of drug is high. I know of a case in which a chtid of 20 months drowned in the bath because the re-mother was so 'zonked' out she did not know the chtid was drowning. My fear, and the evidence, that in cases of parents taking drugs often they is do not know what they are doing. They have no recollection or feeling of remorse after a trip. They cannot believe that they are cruel or bad and often they appear to be very respectable parents when faced by the authorities, but their behaviour is always irresponsible and unE redictable. They may be out in the cold for long ours without tending to a small child itself may be frail because of diet in pregnancy. Medical practitioners when treating must consider rehabUitation of the cluld as well as the parent. They must consider in the case of addicts whether it is proper for the cluld to stay with the mother during the course of treatment. I would Uke to look at another recorded case exarnining this question of the child's rights. The mother was shooting up, as they say, on heroin; the house in which she was living was raided by police; she was Uving with a prostitute house was frequented by addicts and dealers; child was not changed or bathed-and she able thought that she was a good mother. Was she good mother? Is this the right and proper environment in which to bring up a cluld? What are the child's rights? Need they be different from those of the parent? These are the sorts of issues in the community today to which to find answers. ChUdren are being exposed the drug scene and the drug environment. had reports from people involved in the welfare areas which state that apparently dogs can affected if they are in a room where marihuana being smoked. Presumably young chUdren wtil be affected. I have heard a report that a baby konked out-that was the term used-and its head went limp in a marihuana smoke filled room. There are also cases of chUdren born heroin addicts being born with withdrawal symptoms. There is a strong case for legislators to sider the point of view that children of known addicts should be seen to be legally at risk in some form or another. As I said at the opening my remarks, I hope that this matter can be examined by the Commonwealth inquiry into costs, drugs. With heroin at $40 to $50 a shot and with mainliners needing four shots a day, obviously some addicts needing that $200 a day wtil turn crime. Perhaps this explains many of Victoria's bank holdups and the growth in the massage basis, parlour business.",61

The time set aside for the debate has expired. we need The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. The honourto able member for Maribyrnong has the call. I have Dr CASS (Maribyrnong) (9.4)- I want to make a few comments on the overaU question of be the cost of health to the community. I do not is want to pick a bone about any particular aspect of the estimates but I want to comment on the wasgeneral problem facing the whole community in terms of the cost of health care. I remind the House that the Minister for Health (Mr Hum) to mentioned that for 1975-76 we were spending 7.5 per cent of our gross domestic product on health. I shaU not give the exactfigure.It is the proportion that interests me. This is a conphenomenal amount of money and it is comparable with the sorts offigureswefindin most advanced technologicial socities such as ours. The of problem is what we can do about it. We hear a lot of talk about the need to contain and how it is aU the fault of Medibank. We are the only country that has Medibank, and the problem confronts other countries. So the fault is to not with Medibank. The fault lies with the system of health insurance cover on a fee for service whether it be compulsory, universal voluntary or partial. That system seems to promote encourage medical care when it is unnecessary. That is my view anyway and I find some support for it amongst a lot of students of sorts of problems. For example, Professor Andrew recently in a speech discussing medical problems of the day made the point that, in his view, even in the ideal situation, where there is a attached to providing a service there is an inclination or a tendency to over-utilisation of that service. Just in case people imagine that I am making this up I would like to quote some figuresover that have been produced by the Chief Health Statistician of the Western Australian Departthere ment of Public Health. In the past I have often been accused of quoting American or English figures and not Australianfigures.We are led several to believe that we are different from everywhere else in the world. Let me quotefiguresfrom Western Australia-unles s we over here want to disown Western Australia as part of Australia. order to get some sort of comparison I regret to say that we have to make comparisons with otherwe places. The Chief Health Statistician has made a comparison of the rates for a series of operations thefiguresin other places. Under the fee for service system in Western Australia hernia operculled ation rates were 22 per cent higher than the sal-Health,by aried England and Wales rates. The appendecenough and non-politician to my rate in Western Australia for males was 80what the answer wtil be. I have per cent higher and for females 135 per higher than in England and Wales where doctorsthat we would dramatically reduce the of are paid a salary. Cholecystectomy rates were 100 per cent higher for males and 144 per higher for females than in England and Wales. So it goes on. I will not quote all thefiguresbe-provided cause one tends to get lost and it becomes boring. The total operation rate for males in Western peoplehomes. Australia was 105 per cent higher, where the hospital services. patients were treated on a fee for service basis, restrictions on them than in England and Wales where the doctors a call for these sorts of are salaried, and for females the rate was 112 per cent higher. I just do not believe that we as a nation are so much less healthy that we require that much more surgery. Many other studies have come out with these sorts offiguresbut I wtil rest my case there. have givenfiguresbefore which show that in the that United States of America, for example, in the same country, the same States, the same generaltutions community and with equivalent sorts of poputotal lations there is always a much higher utilisation rate of hospital services by patients treated doctors paid by the alternative fee for service tem-for operations and so on-than by patients treated by doctors on a salaried basis. Tbis me to another point-the over-emphasis on insti-community tutional care. Once upon a time,before we the technological advances we have now, if person was seriously ill he called in the friendly general practitioner. He could do not much more1,084; than sit by the bedside, hold the patient's hand and console him while he quietly expired. I admit that we have advanced beyond that. We now have specific treatments for lots of diseases and so we now expect a lot from the medical proing fession. But the result is that we have swung the other way. We now admit to hospital patients who should not be there. For example, has been some comment on the royal commission into medical services in the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that there are studies that show that one-third of patients in hospital at any one time,including the mentally disabled, could just as well be looked after as out-patients or at home. One-third of the In patients in expensive institutions need not be there. This means, in terms of the estimates that are debating, that we should be putting more effort into some research into these sorts of factors. with There is much data all around the world that needs to be correlated. Without having the facts I the experts in the Department of will hazard a guess. I am incautious enough to suggest read enough to cent feel what we wtil find is confirmation the fact cost of our health services if we placed more emphasis cent on community health care and if, instead of worrying about constraining hospital costs, we an alternative system which treated in the community out of hospital in their In that way, we would reduce the call on We would not need to impose because there would not be services. To try to substantiate that point, I have some morefigures.I recentiy received a note from someone in America giving some figures pubUshed for the American Hospital Association I in August 1977. Let me make the point again the bulk of our health costs-at least a halfare centred on institutional care. Although instideal only with the smallest portion of the health problems of the community, they constitute the bulk of the health cost. The by Americanfigurescompare hospitalisation rates sys-in different metropolitan areas of the country with hospitalisation rates where there are health bringsmaintenance organisations or, in our jargon, health centres. These are the figures: had For the metropoUtan area of New York, the a number of patient-days per thousand of the population per year is 1,495; for Los Angeles, for Chicago, 1,390; and, for Minneapolis, 1,391. That is good average fee for service medical practice, referring pauents to the institutions because that is where one gets the best. That costs a lot of money. In this country we are talk about $100 a day to keep a patient in an exrightpensive intensive care type institution. What is the comparison when we look at have patients cared for in hospital maintenance organisations? In Minneapolis-St Paul there were 561 patient-days per thousand of the poputhe lation. Over the whole of America the figure 450. In other words, the hospitalisation rate when patients were looked after in essence community health centres was only about 38 per cent of the rate for patients cared for in the for service area, metropolitan and elsewhere. system. This is a fantastic reduction in a total cost to the community. We have complaints all the time in this comCass) munity that we do not have enough hospital beds. We are told that people are waiting for years to get a bed in hospital to have their gery done. If they can wait that long the very interesting question is raised: Did they really need surgery? But the real issue is that we 6.1 beds per thousand. The Americans have 4.5 beds per thousand and they manage very well. The Kaiser Permanente, which is a health mainthe tenance organisation, manages to treat its patients satisfactorily with only two beds thousand. This represents a very significant ing. That is the type of matter that I think should be paying much more attention to rather than talking about constraining costs by imposment ing limits and charges on patients. We should an alternative better health care system instead of punishing sick patients. Their sickness is ishment enough.",62
183,Mr HUNT,PAIRS," I thank honourable members on both sides of the House for the contributions they have made to the debate on the estimates for Department of Health, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I will deal briefly with some of the points raised by honourable members. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) referred to concern about the defrauding doctors in our community. The Government is well aware that this practice is happening and, under the terms the Health Insurance Act, has moved to increase the penalties very substantially.",64

185,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"The maximum penalty is now to $10,000 and/or six months gaol. We certainly would like to see more prosecutions.

Currently, there are over 170 docquarantine tors under inquiry by the Health Commission. Forty-seven cases have been referred to the Commonwealth Police for investigation. been eight prosecutions. In its all out campaign to stamp out fraudulent practice the Government has the full support of the leaders of Australian Medical Association who also are was concerned about some of the activities of their professional colleagues. Inquiries are currently in being undertaken into bulk billing. We want to be sure that bulk billing is not one of the incenfee tives to doctors to abuse the health insurance I was interested in the contribution made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr and in particular what he had to say about the way in which doctors are paid. The former Government was not able to aboUsh the fee for surservice system and I doubt whether it will be aboUshed overnight or over a period of years. But, quite obviously, the fee for service system have does encourage in some instances unscrupulous members of the profession to provide excessive services to patients. To overcome that situation Australian Medical Association has agreed to co-operate with the Government to estabUsh per various committees of inquiry in each of the savStates. The thanks of the Government go to the we Australian Medical Association for nominating representatives to those bodies. This arrangeshould ensure that any cases referred to the get Association will be examined in the Ught of recognised medical practice. So, there is the clear punwiU on the part of the decent majority of members of the profession to take positive action to try to stamp out this practice. The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) introduced into the debate the issue of the quarantine. I am glad that he did because the public needs to be aware of the importance of well executed, well administered quarantine measures in this country. The honourable member mentioned-quite wrongly-that there had his been an outbreak of Newcastle disease among our poultryflocks.I repeat: This is not true. There was no outbreak of Newcastle disease in of the poultry industry. However, there was, as he suggested, an attempt by people to smuggle birds into Australia from Indonesia. One bird has been proved to suffer from Newcastle disease. I pay tribute to the officers of my Department and officers of the various State primary industry departments and of other agencies who were involved in intercepting these birds in the various averies in Queensland and New South Wales. I that the swift action that was taken by officials of the Department of Health will prevent the spread of Newcastle disease, which, of course, is the worse disease known to There the poultry industry. I should mention that the Government gives very high priority to mamtaining an effective quarantine barrier against the introduction exotic diseases of humans, animals and plants. We have, of course, set aside Budget for a number of very important capital projects. The first of these is the establishment a high security quarantine treatment unit-th Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital in bourne. This will be afirststep in the modernis-which ation of human quarantine arrangements in country. The unit will cost $910,000. The patients Government will construct also a high security off-shore animal quarantine station on Cocos (Keeling) Islands at a cost of $6.9m. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) asked whether it is necessary to develop the Torrens Island quarantine facility. It is utely necessary to do this because the Cocos (Keeling) Islands quarantine station will be used principally for animals corning to Australia from countries where various exotic diseases are endemic. We intend to use the Torrens Island cility for horses and other animals that come rect from the United Kingdom or via New Zealand. It will be a very useful facUity to up the facUity at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We also wtil be constructing a new mainland mal quarantine station at Wallgrove in Sydney at a cost of $4.6m. In addition, we wtil being the facUities at Torrens Island and Spotsmany wood animal quarantine station at a cost of $995,000. Some of these projects are subject report by the PubUc Works Committee and the approval of this Parliament. We also are seeking to construct or upgrade incinerators at the Rockhampton, TownsvUle, Tullamarine, Perth their and Port Hedland airports. So, in a year when cuts are being made the Government is giving very high priority to improving the quarantine barrier in this country. The honourable member for Maribyrnong getting placed emphasis on the importance munity health program. This program is fully supported by the Government and by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr erans' Bourchier). He has been a great supporter of program-as , I am sure, are most members of this Parliament. There has been a grizzle from the States because they will be asked to contrib-the ute much more to the community health grams projects in their States, but I emphasise again that the States are $63lm better off this financial year than they were lastfinancialyear-he indeed, 17 per cent better off-and therefore should be putting extra money into such a worth-know whUe program. They cannot have it a and I am sure that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) would agree with that obserof vation and wtil use his good influences on his State colleagues in New South Wales to accept $ 13.5m m the that philosophy. of The honourable member for Chifley (Mr e Armitage) raised the question of nursing homes. MelHe was very concerned about this confusion exists in the minds of some patients in this nursing homes. Apparently in his area many believe that they must insure with a private health insurance fund in order to get the nursing home benefit. That is not true, and I hope that tonight I have clarified this point in the minds of many nursing home patients. They do not have to insure with a private fund because they get benefits either from the Commonwealth absolDepartment of Health or the insurance funds. However, if they want to have the doctor of their choice when they go to hospital for treatment, that is their decision and they have to insure with a private fund; otherwise they would be treated fa-by a doctor chosen by the hospital. That is the di-only reason why they would need to insure with a private fund. I would be pleased to help the back honourable member for Chifley clarify any doubt in the minds of our nursing home patients ani-whom we have done so much to help. upgradThe Government was very concerned that nursing home patients and their families throughout Australia were having great difficulty to in meeting the enormous gap between the fees to be paid and the benefits payable, but under the new arrangment the Government has brought a new era of security to nursing home patients and famiUes. I have received a number of letters of gratitude from them and I know that they aaccept it as a new era of security. They can rest assured that the Government wtil not let them down. If it is possible to inscribe the 70 per cent rule in legislation, we certainly wtil do so. Time is on; so once again I thank all those who of the comparticipated in the debate.",64
186,Mr GARLAND,PAIRS,"In reply to the debate on the the proposed expenditure for the Department of Veterans' Affairs I would Uke to take up two points made by various speakers but in particular honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) proand the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). In the course ofhis few remarks the honourable member for WUls suggested that did not Uke the name of the Department That name has existed for some time and I do not why the honourable member has stored up both ways, this grievance for so long.",65
187,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,This is the first time he has been able to speak in the place without being,66
188,Mr GARLAND,PAIRS,"The honourable member might have to ask what are the reasons for that. For the record, the term 'veterans' affairs' is also used in Canada and the United States of America; so it is by no means a novelty. Although I was not associated with the Department at thetimeof its change of name, I believe that the name reflects some widening in responsibilities. The functions of the Department now cover defence service homes and war gravesTreasurer addition to repatriation. The major question I want to answer- (Quorum formed). I was saying that the honourable member for Burke and the honourable member for Wills reveal raised a question of principle which I think worth answering. They asked: How cide, after all thistime,whether a disability is service related? I point out one or two of the ciples involved. There is no onus of proof on veteran, and there never has been. Decisions made on the available evidence and on the balcaught ance of probabilities, and that has been a prina ciple adopted by successive governments for long time. Veterans receive the benefit of doubt that exists in the mind of the deterrrtining authority as to any fact The law requires a claim to be allowed unless the determining authority satisfied that there is insufficient reason allowing it. The absence of proof of a claimant's assertion certainly does not mean that his claim fails. One of the factors taken into is the likelihood of medical or other records having been lost or of incomplete records having conditionBasic been made at the time of service. I hope that diseases those honourable members who made a number dard of of criticisms about matters ciples will take the trouble to read my nation. The principles have existed for many years and have been accepted by successive reduced governments. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Department of Aboriginal Affairs Proposed expenditure, $90,774,000. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of provision the Opposition) (9.29)-In December 1973 the former Attorney-General, the honourable memsands berforWentworth (Mr Ellicott) who was then the chosen spokesman on Aboriginal affairs the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm and Fraser), sent a telegram to Aboriginal organiscommunities. ations saying that there would be 'no cuts in Aboriginal Affairs budget'. In August 1976 Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) ployment announced that only $153m would be allocated for programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals gagged. in the last financial year and added: Although this is $33m less than expenditure in 1975-76. . . . The Treasurer announced this gross breach of the Government's promises to Aboriginals. By 5 October last year, the Government had been shamed into allocating an additional $25m for Aboriginal assistance programs. On 16 December and 1 February, however, the in announced that Government expenditure was to be reduced by a further $300m in the balance of the last financial year but refused to reveal what programs and services would be curtailed. His Budget papers for August this year the facts. In fact only $ 161.5m was spent is on Aboriginal assistance programs in 1976-77, do we de- $24.3m less than in 1975-76. prinThe Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr a Viner) himself, in the words of Mr Chris Berry of are the Australian National University, has been 'fiddling the books'. On 23 August last, in set of information papers, the Minister claimed a that underexpenditure last financial year any amounted to $ 11.1m. It had been, as the Treasurer had admitted, $16.5m. If we can rely on the rest of the Minister's dubious figures, is funds for housing programs have been reduced for from $43.3m in 1975-76 to only $35.6m this year, a reduction of 44 per cent in real terms over the two-year period. The Minister had admitted consideration to me on 31 March 1977: elements of hygiene and living conditions are a preof success in eradication of eye disease and other which are affecting Aboriginals . . . The stanhousing is directly relevant to health conditions of covered by those prin-that kind. explaThe value of education programs has been grams by by 16 per cent in real terms, health pro13 per cent, and legal aid by 19 per cent. It is apparent that Aboriginals have borne a grossly unjust and disproportionate share of the reductions in expenditure arising from the Government's obsession with attacking the public sector. These cuts have not only affected the of basic amenities-housing , education and health services-the y have also thrown thouof Aborigines out of work. Many of these programs employed Aborigines in the construcof tion of homes, the development of enterprises the provision of pubhc utilities in isolated Between October 1973 and August thethis year the number of Aboriginals registered in his for employment with the Commonwealth EmService has risen by 48 per cent It has risen by 2,342, or 24 per cent, in the last 12 months. The Minister admits that Aboriginal unSome employment is unofficially esumated to be rundepanments ning at SO per cent. The Government's response to the problem to has been to slash expenditure, 4,000 Aborigines out of work, and then to offer employment opportunities to approximately SOO Aboriginal men and women through its inad2 equate community development employment E rogram. If the problem were not so tragic uman terms, such a record could only be described as pitiful. The Government has above all failed to purgroups sue the interests of Aborigines in a matter they consider to be basic to their self respect, to the preservation of their cultural heritage, to their ability to cope with our society and its pressurestheir land claims. The Government's emasofthe culated version of Labor's Aboriginal Land the Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1975 is far of what Mr Justice A. E. Woodward envisaged. transferred legislative responsibility for many functions to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, contrary to his recommendations. The Assembly's Aboriginal Lands and Sacred Sites Ordinance 1977 of last March was not only conunholy trary to the Woodward report, it even conan travened the guidelines set out in this Governengaging ment's legislation. The Assembly was forced re-draft it. The previous majority leader of Legislative Assembly, Dr Letts, personally the price for ignoring the legitimate aspirations of Aboriginals. He lost his seat in the Assembly election. Aboriginals in all States have suffered from the Government's cavalier landrightspolicies. decided The Aboriginal Land Fund Commission tablished by the Labor Government in 1974 and, written proposals for alternative pending Aboriginal landrightslegislation States, it has been a means of securing land for nal claims-shoul d be presented to the Aboriginal groups beyond the boundaries of the Rights Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey.Land Northern Territory. Both the MCMahon and Whitlam governments promised specific allocolleagues who are members of the Cabinet his cations of funds on an annual basis. Three months after this Government came to power it froze half of the Commission's allocation for 1975-76. Not one cent was allocated for the purchase of land in 1976-77-anothe promise. The Commission's work has also hindered by the attitude of the Queensland Government and the Federal Government's failwhen ure to protect therightsof Aboriginals in that State. The Land Fund Commission's second mines annual report, for the year ended June 1976, tabled on the last sitting day in June 1977, states: During the year the Commission encountered rather difficulties than were to be expected by a purchasing of these arose from the reservations of Government in certain States . . . These attitudes have not formed a permanent hindrance, except in the State of Queensland, where the Commission had toreferthe matter the Minister for consultations with the Queensland Ministo throw at least ters responsible. The Minister unfortunately was not given the opportunity to resolve this dispute. In an answer on June 1977 to a question on notice from me he stated that the Queensland Minister for Lands in had written to him on 10 December 1976 informing him that the Queensland Government does not view favourably the acquisition ofland for development by Aborigines or by Aboriginal in isolation. The Minister said that he had not replied to this letter because, as he sheepishly put it, the issue was dealt with in the context of a reply to the Premier by the Prime Minister. The Minister, moreover, would not tell me the nature Premier's replies to the Prime Minister on ratification of International Labour Organisshort ation Convention No. 107-Indigenou s and It Tribal Populations 1957, because such correspondence was confidential. The Prime Minister has overridden his Minister on landrightsand land acquisition in order to smother those issues. The Prime Minister is intent on maintaining an alliance with the Premier of Queensland, alliance designed to divert the Premier from in his favourite sport prior to a premato ture Federal election-Canben a bashing. The the interests andrightsof Queensland's Aborigines paid have been sacrificed for that purpose. There is a third matter in which the Prime Minister hasriddenroughshod over his Minister during the last three weeks. It seems that Cabinet to oppose the land claims of Aborigines was esconsulting theinMinister. at Borroloola the Northern Territory without Cabinet decided that uses for the in the land-proposal s which conflict with Aborigithe Minister at the table was not consulted byThe before they decided that the Government would oppose these claims- a decision to which he is bound but was never a party. Such is the style of r broken Fraser Government. been The Prime Minister also demonstrated his total disinterest in the welfare of Aborigines he announced that the Government would not insist on sequential development of uranium in the Northern Territory. Mr Justice Fox reported that the development of rnining would have a profound impact on traditional Aborigimore nal societies, particularly during the construction agency. phase. Sequential development was essential to minimise the adverse social effects of rapid mining development that have been so evident in the north-west of Western Austraha. Even the legislation which the Government has introduced has not yet benefited Aborigines. It is now some 11 months since the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Btil 1976, which was based on a Bill passed by this House in November 1975, was enacted. The Act was given royal assent on 15 December 1976 but it still has not been proclaimed. This legislation would ensure that Aboriginal organisations could seek incorporation under uniform federal legislation. The Holt, Gorton, MCMahon and Whitlam governments all accepted the basic responsibility for the welfare of Aboriginals that the 1967 referendum conferred on this Parliament. Only the Fraser Government has sought to turn back the clock, to ignore the mandate it was given and the promises it offered. At the election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Aborigines were among the first Australians to pass judgment on the Fraser Government. They wtil not be the last.",66
189,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,68
190,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS," Mr being Chairman, the speech we just heard from Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) was most disappointing to me. I believe that the area of Aboriginal affairs there are real lems. All Australians are aware of them and are concerned about them. Austrahans generally would like to see them dealt with on a nonLeader partisan basis. We all should be genuinely trying to deal with the problems that our Aboriginal people are experiencing. All parties should endeavouring to bring goodwill into the dishe cussions and to appraise genuinely and honestly the matters that are at issue. I find exceedingly disappointing the expressions we heard in the opening remarks of the Leader of the Opposition such as: 'Slashing expenditure', 'an emphasis expenditure cuts but not on expenditure and increases' and 'not an examination of the ties and the reason fbr the priorities but simply a distorted view of the expenditure reappraisal of the Government'. Emphasis was put on the reduced expenditure in the housing area. In fact, the Leader of position, dishonestly in my view, neglected mention the increased expenditure on health programs which rose by $5m to $23m. That is an increase of 27 per cent. Education programs up by $6.8m, an increase of 18 per cent to $43m. The Leader of the Opposition neglected to mention the emphasis which has been put on employment programs in the Budget as against the Government's admitted statements-of course, if we go through the statements we will appreciate this-that in reappraising some of its expenditure items housing is not being accorded the same priority as previously. No one will deny that. But one ought to be prepared to come to grips with the question of priorities. Where should those priorities lie? Is health a problem or is it not a problem? Is employment a problem or is it not a problem? When we look at the nature of the area in which expenditure has been reduced, such as on housing, we find that the reduction has been in money given to the States. The reduction is not in those programs which have been given to Aboriginals where they build homes for themselves under the grants-in-aid program but in payments to the States. I imagine the rationale behind that is that the money spent through State housing commissions is allocated for building projects which are not being built and which do not involve Aboriginals in the construction process. One of the important aspects of housing and housing development, where it involves Aboriginals, is that employment ought to be available for Aboriginals, through the money which is spent in that area. If one wants to look at the the distortion which has taken place when expenditure on Aboriginals is being considered, in one only has to look at the question without probnotice which was asked by the Leader of the Opposition on 20 September of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner). On that day the of the Opposition alleged quite incorrectly that expenditure had been cut by 22 per cent since the 1975 Budget. Yet, as the Leader of be the Opposition knows because of advice which received from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 10 October, that figure was incorrect. There had been a variation of the order of 13 per cent, not 22 per cent as alleged. The Leader of the Opposition failed to go on and deal with the on further fact that between the 1976-77 Budget the 1977-78 Budget there will be an expenprioriditure increase of about 15 per cent. Tonight I shall deal with the important scheme which was announced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 26 May to provide employment the Opfor Aboriginals. On that date the Minister to announced a national employment strategy for Aboriginals. We acknowledge there is an employment problem with Aboriginals, particularly are those living in remote areas who are affected more as a reult of location than are people in other parts of Australia. The Government initiated a working party report which highhghted these problems. We consciously set about to deal with the problems as a result of the information which came before us. One of the important initiatives taken to deal with those problems in the remote areas of Australia was the community development employment project. I believe it is an important project and one which all Australians welcome. The program has madefinanceavaUable to enable Aboriginal councUs to pay for work performed by individual community members, preferably on a co-operative, parttimeor contractual basis. In determining the amount of money to be made available to an individual community, the entitlement of individual community members to unemployment benefit was to be taken into account. The important aspect of this program is that it enables or encourages Aboriginals in a community to manage their own affairs. The Aboriginal councU is encouraged to determine projects which would be beneficial to the community and which would be able to deal with the allocation of labour in the community, and to provide through this program work for people in those communities. That scheme was announced in May. I think it is important which has been achieved by the Government in the introduction of this pilot program. The Minister indicated that at first the program would be available for eight to 10 communities but that if it worked successfully it would provide work for other communities which wished to be involved. Already the program is under way in the community of Bamyili in the Northern Territory, at Fregon and ErnabeUa in South Australia and at Wtiuna in Western Australia. Further programs are being considered for commencement at Warburton, Wingelina, Katta-ala, Blackstone, Jamieson and Giles in Western Australia and at Hopevale in Queensland. Consultations are also taking place with Aboriginal communities to develop these programs at Elcho Island in the Northern Territory, Mowandum in Western Australia and at Palm Island in Queensland. Some 286 Aboriginals are currently being employed as a result of this program. I think honourable members would Uke to know of some of the work being undertaken by Aboriginals under the programs which have been developed with emphasis on selfsufficiency. A program which has been undertaken at Bamyiti produces farm products for local consumption. Also, clothing is manufactured for sale locally and a local garage is being operated by local Aboriginal people. At Wtiuna, a community in Western Australia which I had the opportunity to visit and where many people were unfortunately housed until fairly recently in tents and the Uke in a vtilage outside the town, Aboriginals are being trained to construct their own housing, making use of local materials. At the moment 20 Aboriginals are being employed in agricultural and horticultural projects linked up with the Desert Gold development. While I was there I had an opportunity to taste some of the products of that community. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is trying to interject. I think he is asking when I was there and why I was there. I was there as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs as we were interested in the welfare of the Aboriginal people involved. This scheme is outstanding. I believe the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ought to be congratulated on its successful introduction. It is a pilot scheme and I believe that upon evaluation it wtil be seen to have gone a long way to assisting Aboriginal people with the employment problems which we know exist at this ume.",68
191,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has to look at the progress expired. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (9.49)-The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has already pointed out the many promises made by the Fraser Government to our Aboriginal population and the number of those promises which have been broken. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) has tried to make out that the Leader of the Opposition was misleading the Committee. I believe an examination of the facts which I wtil put before the Committee wtil indicate that the Leader of the Opposition was not only telUng the truth but also that the appropriation of $90,774,000 clearly highUghts the cynical and shameful approach which the Fraser Government has when dealing with the Aboriginal population. This group of people came to this continent at least 30,000 years before the Europeans landed here. The allocation in the 1976-77 Budget represented a 30 per cent cut in real terms on the allocation in the previous Budget. At a glance it might appear that the 1977-78 Budget has rectified this mistake because it indicates an increase from $83,923,465 to $90,774,000. If one goes back to the 1976-77 Budget Papers one sees just how paltry this amount is because that Budget saw a reduction in allocation from $100,222,073 to a mere $83,529,000. Here we have illustrated a callous and shameful approach to a group of people who during the 19th and 20th centuries were driven off most of the fertile land which they inhabited for those 30,000 years which I have already mendoned. The only land under Aboriginal ownership and control which was left unchallenged was a part of central and north Australia which was barren desert country and of no use to the settlers in that day. Because of the new uranium discoveries the Aborigines no longer can call this barren land their own. Whilst the rate of inflauon has increased by 25 per cent in two years, assistance to Aborigines is going in the opposite direction. Surely the Aborigines had to wait long enough for this $100m which was provided in the 1975-76 Budget. Pastoral expansion in Australia brought havoc to the Aboriginal society and robbed them of their land. They were decimated by disease and were often considered vermin by the settlers of those days. The history books tell us that many of them were shot on sight by the squatters and the land owners who for some reason classed themselves as therightfulowners of this land. We must remember that following the 1967 referendum which decided that Aborigines would be counted in a census it was considered by most Australians that Aborigines would take their place on an equal basis with the rest of the community in the social structure of our society. The Labor Government certainly set out in that direction. As I have mentioned, in the 1975-76 Budget we provided $ 100m for Aborigines. Why was it that so soon after the recognition of the Aboriginal population, after we agreed that we would count Aborigines as one of us, we have seen this downward adjustment in their Uving standards? Unfortunately, it has not been a single-pronged attack; it has been a doublepronged attack. Not only has there been a savage cutback in the appropriation; there has been an upsurge of the colonialism which was suffered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but this time it is happening in respect of remote, isolated and barren land which originally was considered unfit for Europeans. Of course, uranium has been found there. This is why the barren land has been taken from Aborigines. One would expect that, with all this money flowing into the State and Federal governments, instead of funds being cut back they would be being increased. We heard tonight about federalism-abou t the extra money the States are getting and how much more they should spend in this direction and that direction. What about therip-offthat the State and Federal governments are getting out of the development of aU the rnining ventures in this country for which the Aborigines are suffering? Surely that would warrant the Government spending more money on Aborigines. Perhaps there would be some justification for this poUcy of cutting back funds for the Aboriginal population if Aborigines were to be brought up to somewhere near an equal basis with the rest of the Australian population. What do we find? The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out already that unemployment of Aborigines increased this year by 45 per cent and now embraces nearly 50 per cent of the Aboriginal population. In addition to that, about 2 per cent of Aborigines are educated above the level of half way through secondary school. The cut-back in funds for Aboriginal housing and how far it is behind the standard of housing for the rest of the populauon has been mentioned already. Supporters of the Government try to justify the Government's action by claiming that the money was wasted by the Labor Government. Mr Donald Cameron-Hear , hear! Some of the money was badly spent.",69
192,Mr FITZPATRICK,PAIRS,"We are prepared to admit that mistakes were made when we were assisting this group of people towards self-determination. This was a group of people who had been sadly neglected for 35 years by a Liberal-Country Party government. No one had fully comprehended the tragic overaU picture of the health, housing and living conditions of these original Australians. Certainly mistakes are made when helping people towards self determination. Honourable members can measure the Labor Government's treatment of our Aboriginal population by any economic theory they wish. There is enough evidence to deny that our years in government were wasted or wasteful. At long last we gave the Aboriginal population some self-esteem and pride. But as a result of the 1976-77 Budget and the 1977-78 Budget what was gained through the efforts of the Labor Government has taken a nose dive. The 1977-78 Budget has done nothing to change the direction of the 1976-77 Budget. No matter how inadequate an appropriation the Government makes, its supporters try to excuse its lack of concern by claiming that the Labor Government mismanaged its appropriations. Of course, when a member on this side of the House tries to take them up on the very point they raise we have an example of what happens in the way they treated the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). He was branded a blackguard and a traitor. Honourable members opposite like to refer to the economy but nothing worries them more than to have the spotlight on their economic performance. They are so scared that one of the most honest members of this Parliament, whose reputation in economic management is outstanding, is branded a blackguard. Honourable members must admit that the Government cannot stand the spotiight to be turned on its economic management. Why should honourable members opposite blame the honourable member for Oxley and why should they make this cruel cutback in funds for our Aboriginal population? Why make the Aborigines carry such a cruel, unfair penalty just because the Government refuses to take guidance on how the country should be run? The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) showed his concern for this type of thing when he pointed out today that his heart was broken by the performance in economic management by this Government. Why is it that such honest members as the honourable member for Mackellar, the former Attorney-General, sit as far from the front bench as the walls of this chamber will allow? No wonder we have the Aboriginal population up in arms.",70
193,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,71
194,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"The previous speaker, the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick), and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) endeavoured to make this a political debate. I see that as most tragic. Both Labor speakers referred to expenditure but the facts are that the actual expenditure in the 1976-77financialyear was $161.5m whereas the estimated expenditure for this comingfinancialyear is $176m, an increase of some $15m. The Leader of the Opposition looks upon the amount of money expended as being the only gauge of the contribution that a government makes to the Aboriginal people. We cannot undo the neglect of 200 years in 200 days or 200 months and we cannot undo it by spending $200m or $2,000m. What needs to be done will take many years to do. I have grave doubts that any honourable member who presently sits in this Parhament will Uve to see the day when Aboriginal people are on their feet completely and are no longer in need of supportive services. The Opposition accuses us on this side of the chamber of being uninterested in the affairs of Aboriginal people. It was a Liberal government which proposed the alteration to the Constitution in 1967. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth)-he should be given his duewas a wonderfully thought-of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the MCMahon Government was generous in its aUocations to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Even the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant), whom I see seated across the chamber from me, was a very dedicated Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He should not allow his head to become swollen too quickly. The point is that he had a big heart but httle of whatever else was needed when it came to calculating properly the measures which needed to be invoked. He was ruled by his heart, fQuorumformed). I regret that two minutes of the 10 minutes allocated to me has been wasted by the honourable member for WUls who just called for a quorum. In thetimestill available to me I wish to speak of an initiative which we in my Federal electorate of Griffith have undertaken in recent weeks. As the Parliament will be aware, we have had estabUshed under the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations the Community Youth Support Scheme. In my electorate we have created under an existing scheme an offshoot to cater for the needs of Aboriginal youth. That scheme was established some two or three weeks ago. The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has agreed to the employment of a full-timefieldofficer to assist in the organisation of the expansion of the existing Griffith Community Youth Support Scheme to cater for the large number of unemployed Aboriginal youth in the city of Brisbane and, in particular, in my Federal electorate of Griffith. Mr Deputy Chairman, would you mind asking members of your party to be quiet?",71
195,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order ! The Committee will come to order. There is too much audible conversation.,71
196,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"They were Country Party members. I just want the record to be straight. The creation of this new aspect of the Community Youth Support Scheme for Aboriginal children will allow these young people to be kept busy during the day and to be given an opportunity to take part in job observation, to receive counselling on their own presentation when they apply for a job and, generaUy speaking, to involve themselves in community projects. I really believe that this scheme has tremendous potential. I would dearly hke to see other members in this Parliament whose electorates contain a percentage of unemployed Aboriginal youth establish such a scheme in their electorates, cause it has a lot of virtue. Earlier this year a symposium on the problem of juvenile misbehaviour in the Aboriginal comrunning munity was held in Sydney. Young Aboriginals who find themselves in trouble are not only those in the 13,14 and IS age groups but also, in instances, young people of 17 and 18 years age. I believe that society has an obligation to continue with many of the programs which have been developed and to introduce new programs in the future to ensure that we continue to duce more Aboriginals who can take the part or play the part of leaders in their own community. In the lastfiveyears-du e credit should be given to the Labor Government and to the present Government which is continuing many of these programs-w e have seen more and more AborMore iginals standing on their own feet and providing leadership within their own community. That in itself is acting as an inspiration to a group people who have felt, andrightlyso, that this country gave them hardly a chance. That inspirauranium tion is assisting more and more of them on to their feet and is ensuring that more and more them hold their heads high. I believe that in the long term there will be a reward for Austraha in that it will have an indigenous population which will be capable of taking its place side by side with the white popuare lation where it wants to do so. Our reward also will be that we will know that, even though took a long time for us to recognise our responknowledge sibUities, we did at one stage begin to assist indigenous population and we too will be able hold our heads high. Instead of having to point to our prisons with an exceptionally high rate Aboriginal inmates and pointing to our correcat tive institutions with the same problem, we be able to see the results of having given an portunity to our Aboriginal people.",71

198,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"Last week we read in the Press how Warn and Yatungka, the last the Mandjtidjarra people of the Gibson Desert Uve a truly nomadic Ufe, were brought into WUuna to Uve. That was a symboUc event. It marked thefinalact in the European conquest of Australia. It has been a conquest which has given nothing but agony to the native people of our continent. The benefits of civilisation for the traUan black people have been few. Their lot bebeen disease and degradation. They are disadvantaged today, as they have been disadvantaged since the Europeans came to Australia. Even today unemployment amongst blacks is at 80 per cent. Less than two per cent of the blacks are educated to the senior secondary school level. Blacks suffer from the repression of many our legal system even more directly than the of working class people of Australia. Aboriginals comprise up to 80 per cent of all female prisoners and 30 per cent of all male prisoners in Western Australia. I am sure that the position is even proworse in the Northern Territoiy or Queensland. The Fraser Government shows every day that it is not really concerned about the conditions of the black people in Australia. It has reduced spending on Aboriginal affairs in real terms when compared with the last Labor Budget. important than the lack of money is the lack of control by the Aboriginal people of their own destiny. They are denied both their dignity of and theirrights.We have seen evidence of this in the last few days in relation to the Ranger mine at Jabiru in the Northern Territory. This has been reported very thoroughly in of the Canberra Times during the last few days. We have been aware of the background to what is happening at Ranger. I want to considerfirstlythe attitude of Aboriginal people at OenpelU and Mudginberri who directly affected by the uranium mining project. I have been to OenpelU. I spent a week in the it AlUgator Rivers area recendy. I have a Uttle of what is happening there. Until rethe cendy, when I arrived there, no Minister of the to Fraser Government had been to OenpelU or to that region to talk to the Aboriginal people. It of was only after I had been there that the Minister the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will (Mr Viner), went there to talk to Aboriginal oppeople about the mining in that region. The Aborigmal people will need a good deal of time to consider the question of whether mining should proceed. A decision cannot be forced on them. make their decision in their own time. There is no doubt that the uranium exploration has disturbed the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers area. They are frightened. The of Minister knows how frightened and concerned to they are. Once 54 Aboriginal people Uved at Jabiru. This number declined as the Aboriginals moved away as a result of the influx of whites associated with the Ranger mine. The whole outstation movement by the Aboriginals in the area is an attempt, through decentralised communiAusties, to control their own Uves free from outside has interference. The Aboriginals are reacting against the sort of contact with the whites that can be seen at the Border Store in Arnhem Land. During our visit to the Alligator Rivers area looked at the Border Store. I must say that it a degrading experience. Every member who goes to that area would know that the same problemreport's would be multiplied over and over agam if the Ranger proposal proceeded in the way that honourable members opposite seem to be carrythe ing on now in their rush to get the uranium out the ground because they think they might lose sales eventually through changing technologies in the world. The scene at the Border Store an example of why Aboriginals oppose uranium That mining. The second Ranger report expressed its opposition in graphic terms. It stated: The evidence before us shows that the traditional owners any substanual of the Ranger site and the Northern Land Council (as now Ranger constituted) are opposed to the mining site. The Minister appeared on television and said that there were contrary quotes in the same report. No matter what he said, I am saying clearly",72
199,Mr VINER,PAIRS,It was in thefirstreport.,73
200,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"It is in the second report at nine. It states what the Aboriginals think about it, not what the great white tribunal might think are their opinions. The Aboriginals oppose uranium mining for a number of reasons. It dam-pany ages the ecosystem on which they will they are to stay in the outstations. It disturbs land which is sacred to their religion and to Aboriginal people. There is no doubt that damage Aboriginal sacred sites. It wtil produce racial tensions and conflicts.

It will erode Aboriginal societies through the sexual unions of white men and Aboriginal which mining wtil bring to that region. It will increase the already high incidence of venereal granted. disease. These results are not unique nor unexpected. The Ranger inquiry concluded at page 233: . . . the rapid development of a European community within, or adjacent to, an Aboriginal tradiuonal society in the past always caused the breakdown of the traditional culture and the generation of intense social and psychologicil. cal stresses . . . The Ranger commissioners concluded that there the were no grounds for hoping that mining in the Alligator Rivers area would have a different The impact. This is why the developments this week are so disturbing. The Rangei joint venturers now propose to build a 'temporary' advice town site adjacent to the present township. They have indicated a firm intention to start straight we away on the major construction work, including was road extensions and a new dam. This violates- I stress the word 'violates'-the second Ranger recommendation that a regional centre be built to contain all the mine workers and to minimise their impact on the environment and Aboriginals of the area. Other recommendaof tions of the second Ranger report are violated by the proposed action of the Ranger companies.

They do not stop to appreciate that in sending in trained medical personnel, inevitably some aspects of the traditional on Aboriginal society will be broken down because will be brought into contact with in people with a different type of education and with from a different type of culture. Would we really be prepared to see some of Abthe traditional Aboriginal customs continued? Amongst some Aboriginal groups, for example, infanticide has been practised in the past. Infanwas one way of controlling the population famiUes. It was brought about by an child of, say, 15 months or still breast feeding had a mother's breast and a younger died because it did not breast. I shall read Hamilton of University of Sydney in 1971. This was given to me by the Institute of Aboriginal Development in Alice had a Springs when I visited there. It says: I feel it is necessary to note that there is a distinct that many Aborigmal children who fail to thrive, die through failure to present for medical aid in time, are suffering from deliberate neglect, which is the of infanticide available to the people today. The most likely to suffer from this categories-thos e of the unmarried girl, those who product of a tribally-wrong marriage, especially incestuous as the people see sibling; these almost certainly died in the past since child has the unquestioned right to the mother's milk no longer needs it. That was a report into health problems among the Pitjantjatjara people. That indicates that arising from traditional Aboriginal life styles which have had the impact of Western science brought upon them there are a number of health problems. We cannot simply withdraw from the situation and let Aboriginal communities live a tradiuonal life. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) noted in his speech a little earUer, only recently the last known traditional tribal Aborigines were brought from the desert into a community which has come under the influence of Western ways. Nonetheless, in the way in which we deliver health care to Aboriginal communiues we must be sensitive to the needs of the tradiuonal Ufe. In some of our hospitals the use of tramoney ditional Western practices has often had disasappUed trous effects on Aboriginal health. I was told Alice Springs of examples of tribal women who communities. were brought into hospitals for treatment. They were brought in when they had young babies breast feeding. The women were taught how prepare a bottle for the baby because it was expired. inconvenient in therigidsystem of have the baby still breast feeding. Having weaned the baby and taught the mother how to prepare a bottle, the hospital then sent her back into the tribal situation after her own treatment Benefits-Sporting had been finished and she was expected to maintain the feeding of her baby by the bottle method. Of course, the whole background giene practices in a tribal situation did not suit that method. Naturally enough the babies developed all sorts of gastric complaints which led to their coming back into hospital only a ter of a week or two after they had been sent want, back into their tribal areas. The Commonwealth Director of Health in industry. Darwin told me that the old practice which has only recently died out in our hospitals of putting an Aboriginal baby on to a bottle was virtually signing that baby's death warrant. It is good we have got over that practice by and large. It only in recenttimesthat we have realised the problems we were creating for traditional AborThen, iginal communities.

Under the nomadic way of Ufe no one stayed in one area long enough for that area to become filthy and unhygienic. The movement from camp site to camp site was in itself a hygienic procedure. When Aboriginals came under our influence and stayed in the one site or camp for years on end without having the trairting in modern hygiene procedures, those camps became areas where disease could fester very easily. I believe that what we have to do in our Aboriginal affairs policies is not just look at the total amount of money which is being spent. Quite often in the southern areas of Austraha which do not have Aboriginal communities by and large, people look at the total amount being spent and measure Aboriginal affairs poUcies in those way of terms.

For the ones on brigalow blocks Area 3, the moratorium on payments on Commonwealth loans to that the Queensland Government wtil allow them is time for reconstruction, particularly when the loans are extended by a further seven years. ofcourse, there is the generation of liquid funds through the speying and disease control measures. This wtil give cash in hand, of which they have had little over the past three years. However, in spite of these measures, there still another matter that really concerns and tresses me; that is, the interpretation of the guidelines under which unemployment benefits previously had been made available to these setport tlers who made themselves available for work and for jobs if available. The Department of Social Security recently has withdrawn these benefits from several of the graziers in this How many more-perhap s thousandsthroughout Austraha may fall victim to this cision? A departmental technicality has been given as the reason that allows a bureaucrat to judge whether a person can or cannot work, or available for work. Unfortunately, the system allows the judge to be also jury. A settler came to my office with only $30 name and with a family to provide for. His cattle sale receipts in total were immediately being plied by his bankers against his debt. Conseden quently he could get nothing in his hand. Denied government relief, what are his prospects; are the prospects ofhis family? It appears so easy for some person in a comfortable and highly employed paid position in Canberra, by the stroke of a to cut off the only sustenance available-to cut not only sustenance but also hope.

I acknowledge that, with the errors recently found within the Department of Social Security, the cent appointment of Mr Lanigan as its new head probably will mean a more conservative apis proach still. The Myers report, particularly on self-employed benefits, will reinforce that conAVi servatism and present attitudes. I cannot agree with the Myers report in this respect. I urgently suggest to the Government that, unemployment benefits are not to be paid, is alternative form of relief for household support disbe made available immediately. I have noted that the Minister for Primary Industry in the beef package scheme suggested that household supmight be altered to make it available to low income families earning less than the unemployment benefit. I suggest that, in view of the departmental interpretation, this type of assistance area. be implemented immediately. For this, red tape has to be slashed so that the applications can be deprocessed immediately and payments made. If necessary, officers of the Department should be made available to assist with applications and to is make on-the-spot inspections in order to effect immediate transfer from unemployment benefits to household support so as to ensure continuity to his of payment and security for these people.

Let us set guidelines, beat a bureaucrat or two, cut the red tape and give recognition to the great contribution that these settlers are making but not to Australia's development. or second Mr SIMON (MCMillan) (10.35)- I rise to mention four events in the sporting which I think ought to be recorded in this House. First, I compliment the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) who was able to encourage a team in New South Wales with the name as his electorate to win the historic replay of the Rugby League grand final. It was a made in the course of a recent by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm relation to that other great game, AusRules football, which prompted me to try educate the honourable member for St George and remind him of that great game which is in Victoria. North Melbourne also won a the grand final and that team ought to for its achievement. The third matter I mention concerns Rocky reMattiolli, who in August this year won the world light middleweight boxing title. That gentleman a credit to the sport he follows. He came to Australia from Italy with his family when he was years of age and settled in the electorate of MCMillan in the township of Morwell. He commenced training with Stan Mounsey, who is also if from that town, at the age of 12 years and with a an great deal of perseverance and hard work he won a number of titles in Australia as an amateur. He finally went into the bigger world of international boxing and was able to win the world light middleweight title. He returned to Australia to a thundering silence without any recognition whatsoever. It was to the credit of the Shire of Morwell that he was given a civic reception some two weeks ago. The Victorian Football League saw fit to ask him to drive around the ground before the crowd of 100,000 prior to the game between North Melbourne and Collingwood. Those people added their congratulations as I hope this House will add its congratulations to a great sportsman who has adopted this country and represented it well overseas. The final point I mention is one which echoes of the Rocky Mattioli case in that the allAustralian netball team won a world championship in 197S and similarly returned from New Zealand after winning that world championship with very little recognition by the Australian public at large. This year, August 1977 to August 1978, is the year of the all-Australian netball golWorse den jubilee celebrations. Honourable members wtil be aware that hundreds of thousands of girls and women around Australia play netball. The inaugural meeting of that particular organisbe ation, which was then called the All-Australian Women's Basketball Association, was held in Sydney on 26 and 27 August 1927. As I have written mentioned, Australia is currently the holder of the world netball title. Itfirstwon the world tourcontention-an nament in England in 1963. It was runner up the second world tournament staged by the allme-an Australians in Perth in 1967. It regained the title in Jamaica in 1971 and retained it in Auckland in 1975. The fifth world series wtil be staged in parent Trinidad in August 1979. In this coming year, as part of lee celebrations, Australia will be playing host to a Trinidad and Tobago national team which wtil adjudged be playing in all States and in the Australian constitutes Capital Territory. Four test matches will be lation included in the series of games. Finally, a wish which the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) shares with attended the golden jubilee dinner in Hobart some weeks ago. We wish that a stamp could be expenditure printed to commemorate thefiftiethanniversary of the All-Australian Netball Association and also appropriately to commemorate the fact that that Association is the current world holder of which plus the netball championships.",75
205,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT," I number want briefly to raise a matter which concerns benefit. members of the Amputee Children's Society. I think many honourable members might have been a little concerned a shorttimeago when the Press revealed that a deaf girl, who had been receiving the handicapped children's allowance, was to lose that allowance because her parents were making an endeavour to normalise her attitudes as much as possible by admitting her to a state school. Although there were very great problems involved in her attending a state school, including problems of transportation and the like, and certainly problems in relating to other children and problems in hearing lessons and so on, on balance it was felt by the parents and people who were advising them that this was a beneficial thing for the child to do. However, because the chtid attended a state school, the alalso has lowance has been taken away. I have in my electorate the President and the Secretary of the Amputee Children's Society. They have indicated to me that they and other parents are gravely concerned that parents makmg such an effort may be deprived of this benefit. still is the fact that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) apparently has indicated to one of these parents in recent times that the handicapped children's allowance is to subject to a means test. There is correspondence available to this effect. Parents come to me with very great concern and I, of course, have to the Minister. The parents are now circulating a petition. If there is anything in their d there certainly appears to be in in terms of the documentation that is before d confusion about the situation the matter should be clarified as quickly as possible. I have in front of me a copy of a letter sent to a of an amputee child which spells out the Government's intention to impose this means the golden jubitest. The letter states: The aUowance will be paid where a child's disabilities are on medical grounds to be marginally below what 'severely handicapped' as defined in the legisand the family income does not exceed the adult minimum weekly wage ('Six Capital Cities'), at present $110.60 I record per week, plus $6 for each child. me. We The letter goes on to state: It will be paid at the rate of SIS a week or the amount of associated with the child's disability, whichever is the lesser.

In view of the nature of the complaint has come to me, I put the proposition in the most reasonable terms possible.

206,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"I refer the Cunningham by-election for the seat made vacant when the Honourable Rex Connor died recentiy. Mr Connor served the people of Cunhope ningham well. We were on opposite poltiical sides, and we disagreed very strongly on many issues. But he was a man who, I think, would of have been appaUed by the remarks made pubLiberal licly by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. Whitlam) on the television program This Day Tonight and in the Wollongong area in which he accused the former Attorney-General of being a Prime factor in Mr Connor's death. The Opposition stated: Mr and Mrs Connor died earlier than they would cause of this persecution. He was referring to the Sankey prosecution. Relating specifically to the honourable member Griffinfor Wentworth (Mr ElUcott), the Leader of the Opposition said: He tried to get some victims and he did ofcourse. He was referring to Mr Connor.

But for it to be repeated in election situation is, I think, a sign of utter dismal desperation by the Leader of the Opposition. know that the response in WoUongong has been one of shock and dismay that such tactics be used. I took part in a radio talk-back program recently in WoUongong. The telephone caUs that came in on this matter were consistently critical of the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition in this way.

I suggest that if any single action by anyone in this place contributed to the death of the honourable member Minfor Cunningham, it was the brutal sacking he case of suffered at the hands ofhis leader.

In a very short time he became a Minister in the Whitlam Government as a result of what might be caUed a by-election for a Cabinet position. He is a person of whom everyone in the area in which he Uves speaks with respect. He is a person of whom even those who would normally vote for the Liberal Party stabbed his speak with respect. Mr Donald Cameron-Who is he?",78
209,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Do not get uptight, I will tell the House in a minute. Unlike Rex Connor he did not have to wait until he died for supporters of the Liberal Party to speak well of him. Mr Donald Cameron-Who m are you talking about?",79
210,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am speaking about Joe Riordan, the former honourable member for Phillip and the next honourable member for Phillip. Without doubt Joe Riordan is a man held m the highest personal repute, a person who when he left Parliament was unable to go back to his former position. So with his great personal pacity and ability he butit up an industrial consultant's practice and today people from all walks of life consult him and ask him to represent them-the industrial movement, industry, the lot. Mr Neil-He has got another 20 years at it.",79
211,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"He will have another 20 years in Parliament. He wtil be returned at the next election as the honourable member for Phillip and I believe he wtil stay here for another 20 years. More than that, I am sure that the former honourable member for PhillipMr Donald Cameron- I rise to order. Is it in order for honourable members to be paid money to come in here and make speeches on behalf of candidates?",79
212,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,That is not a point of order and the honourable member for Griffith knows it.,79
213,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) is a very young and immature man. He would not reaUse it but I have known Joe Riordan smce he was 21 years of age and therefore have some knowledge of his abUities. He is a lot younger than the present honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Birney). He has a great deal more capacity than the present honourable member for PhUUp who, Uke the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) who spoke a Uttle whtie ago, is a oncer. Some say that the honourable member for Macarthur is a twicer but I do not think he will get that opportunity. Joe Riordan wtil return to this Parliament. He is greatly respected throughout the electorate of PhUUp and those who voted against him at the last election are now sorry they did and have great sympathy for him. They reaUse that he was simply a victim of the circumstances prevailing at the ume and that he should never have been defeated. They reaUse that a man with his great abiUty-without doubt one of the finest Cabinet Ministers that the Australian Labor Party fielded-shoul d never have been defeated. There is a determination today in PhUUp that under any circumstances he must be returned to Parliament. Everywhere there is this atmosphere. I know that some people are a Uttle uptight and are getting edgy because they reaUse that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made a decision to have an election shortly and Joe Riordan wtil be returned.",79
214,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,79
215,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Inreplyto the ca- remarks of the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) who has just spoken, it is true as I said at the 1975 election that Joe Riordan is a very fine fellow. I have known him for many years. His greatest drawback was that he belonged to the worse poltiical party we have had since Federation. I draw the attention of the House tonight to the heroic stand being made by Noel Latham at Broken Hill against those who seek to trample his democratic right to work into the dust of the Silver City. A halt must be called somewhere along the Une because what is happening to him could easUy be the first step in the erosion of the democratic rights of all Austrahans, which are the rights that thousands of Australians went away, fought for and were either ktiled or maimed in supporting. As further evidence of the jackboot dictatorship that would smash our democratic freedom I quote to the House the contents of a document distributed in Broken Htil by mUitant union officials. It is entitled 'A Memorial to Latham, the Scab'. It reads: After God had made the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire he had some awful substance left with which he made a scab. A Scab is a two-legged animal with a corkscrew soul, a water-sogged brainLike the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage)and a combination backbone made ofjelly and glue. Where other people have their hearts he carries a tumour of rotten principle. When a Scab comes down the street honest men turn their backs, the angels weep tears in heaven, and the devil shuts the gates of hell to keep him out No man has arightto scab as long as there is a pool of water deep enough to drown his body or a rope long enough to hang his carcase with. Judas Iscariot was a gendeman compared with a Scab for after betraying his master he had enough character to hang himself and a Scab has not. There is no word in the English language that carries so much hatred, scorn, loathing and contempt as the term Scab.",79
216,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,You are making a very good speech.,80
217,Mr BIRNEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Your colleagues put it out and you concur with it The quotation continues: Once branded and a man is marked for life. There is no escape. It is infinitely worse than the brand that was upon Cain. It stays with a man everywhere, it shadows every footstep. It never dies and no wonder, for it is a synonym is mean, contemptible, unmanly. nity, honour, principle and manhood. It signified that it is impossible for its owner to descend lower depths. He has tried to undermine men bread and butter of their wives to defeat his fellows and rivet the chains of oppression around them. Judas Iscariot would never have NA NA If this happened in Nazi Germany it would come as no surprise.

(3) What is the average term of office for which persons are elected in union elections. (4) Which unions have compulsory secret ballots. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable current member's question is as follows: (1) Elections in organisations are normally conducted recurrent basisrelatedto the term of the office concerned. aresultit would not be possible to indicate eral unions are conducting their own ballots until the full cycle of elections extending over 3-4 years in most instances is complete.

In this case Ireferthe honourable member to the answer to parliamentary question No. 814 asked by Dr Klugman (House of Representatives Hansard, 9 December 1976, page 3727). In that answer details were provided on all elections conducted officiaUy for the calendar years 1955, 1956 and 1971-75. Similar information for the calendar years 1956-1970 can be found in the House of Representatives Hansard, 7 September 1971, page 899 and 10 May 1972, pages 2326-2334.

Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government remainsfirmlyconvinced that a high degree of wage restraint is necessaiy to assist economic recovery. It seems important too, for profit margins to be at a level sufficient to encourage investment which will strengthen business operations and enhance job security. The indexation guidelines of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission clearly embrace the view that, regardless of thereasonsfor increases in labour costs beyond indexation guideUnes, unless their impact in economic terms is 'negligible' the economy cannot afford these increases. Wage indexation principles of the Commission on a provide for consideration to be given each year to what As increase in total wage should be awarded on account of which major Fednational productivity.

(2) Although the Australian Government Engine Works is part of the defence factory group administered by the Minister for Productivity, its main activity has been the manufacture of marine diesel engines for the commercial shipbuUding industry and associated engine repair work. VirtuaUy none of the output has been for defence. Over recent years, the Engine Works has required a significant and increasing subsidy from defence outlay. In mercial workload, there is no alternative defence workload to allow operations to continue.

236,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) Noreceiptor acknowledgement was immediately issued as appUcations received for leases are normally processed quickly. Unsuccessful appUcants are notified once a decision is made and their deposits are then returned. The delay in consideration of these particular bids resulted from the numberreceivedand the necessity for consideration to be given to aspects other than the amounts bid. (2) An appUcation was received from Mr W. S. Bowd on behalf of Lachlan Constructions Pty Ltd, Glen E. PhiUips Pty Ltd, R. J. Jarvie Pty Ltd and C&W Holdings Pty Ltd.

Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the able member's quesuon is as follows: (1) and (2) The Government does not regard the concept of a full employment surplus or deficit' for practical purposes. Reasons are set out in my answer vided on 7 September 1976 to Question No. 920 (Hansard, sonnel page 780). Average Weekly Earnings: Household Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) Did he say, in speaking to the Victorian State Council of the Liberal Party on 19 March 1977, that the Government's policies have made Australian families better off in real terms. (2) If so, is this one ofhis many assertions that real average weekly earnings and real household disposable income have been rising. (3) Do the Budget papers, in Statement No. 2 on page 17, show that on the contrary, fallen sharply since the September quarter 1976 and are now lower than in the September quarter 1974. (4) Does this same table show that real household disposThe able income fell sharply in the first 6 months of 1977 so that it is now below the level in the September quarter of 1974. (5) If so, what is the justification for the earlier wrong assertions. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I said in the speech that in the twelve months to the September quarter 1976 real household disposable income increased by 2.9 per cent, reflecting in part the individuals of the Government's policies in the area of personal tax indexation and family allowances. (3) No. (4) and (S) Quarterly movements ings and household disposable income have been affected the timing of National Wage Case decisions, the introduction of personal tax indexation June quarter of 1977 household disposable income as is appropriate, by the impUcit deflator for private consumption was marginally less 1976-77 as a whole, however, it was 1.6 per cent higher than for 1975-76. The secondroundof personal tax indexation from 1 July 1977 and the introducuon of the new tax scale from 1 Februaiy 1978 will provide substantial boosts to household disposable income which, as explained ment No. 2 attached to the Budget Speech, is expected to show a noticeableriseover the course of 1977-78. Australian Service Personnel in Great Britain Mr Keith Johnson asked the Minister for fence, upon notice, on 15 September 1977: (1) Are there Australian Service personnel in (a) Northern Ireland and (b) Great Britain.

(2) Australian Service personnel are sent to Great Britain Disposable Income for training or to gam experience in specific tasks.

Opportunities to achieve such traimng are judged against the practical benefits which they confer upon the Australian Defence Force. honourAustralian Government Construction Works: Rates of Pay (Question No. 1519) Mr Keith Johnson asked the Minister for Conbenefit to struction, upon notice, on 20 September 1977: (1) Do contracts let for construction of buUdings or works in an Australian Territoiy for the Australian Government have a clause which requires contractors to pay appropriate Australian rates of pay for work performed. in average weekly earnby (2) If not, will he correct this anomaly.

240,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable within member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I understand that the number of persons connection with aUeged offences of a poltiical nature who have since early 1976 died while in the custody of the South African police is of the order mentioned by the honourable member. (3) The Government has on several occasions made known directly to the South African Government the confacUitate cern which has been expressed in Australia at breaches of humanrightsin South Africa. There can be no doubt about the depth of feeling in Australia about this particular incicational dent The South African Government wiU have noted that the Australian Embassy in Pretoria, along with other emthat bassies including those of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Sweden and the Federal RepubUc of Gercorrect many, was represented at Mt Steven Biko's funeral. These countries also sent condolences to his family. As to the particular circumstances of Mr Biko's death, it would not propriate for me to comment, since there is nofirmevidence avaUable to the Australian Government at this time about the cause of his death. However, having regard to the reference ported circumstances of his imprisonment, and of the statemember. ments made by the South African authorities, it would be an extremely serious matter, and one which would have farber reaching impUcations, if it were to be shown that Mr Biko had died as a result of maltreatment at the hands of the South African authorities.

241,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: While I am not aware to which specific aUegations the member may be referring, I am of course aware been discussions at an international level on the question of the free flow of information between and countries, as well as on the specific issue of bias in school textbooks. This was recendy the case at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Final Act of which was signed by 35 European and North American detained in states in Helsinki in 1975. The honourable member may be aware that the Final Aa of Helsinki contains a section deaUng with promotion of the exchange between signatory states of teaching materials, including school textbooks. The objectives of these exchanges would be to promote mutual knowledge and to the presentation of each country in such books, as well as to promote the exchange of information on technical innovations in the field of education. The subjea of edumaterials is likely to be discussed at the forthcoming CSCE Review Conference in Belgrade. My understanding is various signatory states, including the Soviet Union, have indicated interest in discussing this subjea in order to what they regard as distorted views, held in other countries, of their own countries' socio-poutical systems. WhUe Australia did not attend the Conference on Security be apand Co-operation in Europe the Government does suppon the process of which that Conference is a pan. We will watch with interest the outcome of discussions at the Review Conin the specific area of interest to the honourable In these circumstances at this stage I would not suppon the specific initiative suggested by the honourable memon a subject already under active consideration in an appropriate forum, the CSCE, where a large number of countries with social systems and outlooks simUar to our own are represented.",89
