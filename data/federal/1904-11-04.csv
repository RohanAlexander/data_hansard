1,Mr FISHER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether, in view of the decision of the High Court limiting the powers of the Legislatures of the States iri the. matter of direct taxation, and of the fact that there is a continuous falling off in the revenue from Customs and Excise, he will further consider the opinion which he has expressed against the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth Parliament ? Mr REIDi- I have not yet read the full text of the judgment of the High Court in the matter referred to. My impression is. that it affects only payments for services made by the Commonwealth to members of the Parliament, Ministers; and public servants, which is a small matter in comparison with .national taxation. I see no real difficulty in the way of members and 'Ministers continuing to pay income tax to the States, despite the decision of the High Court.",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Is the Prime Minister aware that some honourable members have offered to pay income tax to their own State, and have been deliberately refused? .",12
3,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I am not aware' of that fact, arid' I can only say that it should strengthen one's desire to make the offer - '  ister take steps, by an amendment of the Constitution, or in some other way, to enable taxation to be levied on both States and Federal officers?'",12
4,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"A question"" affecting a possible amendment of the Constitution is of so serious a character that I require some time for its consideration. ADMISSION OF HINDOO RACES.",12
5,Mr HIGGINS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Has the Prime Min- ' ister reconsidered the question which I put to him yesterday' in regard to the obtaining of information about our treaty obligations to'allow Hindoos to enter all parts of the Empire?,12
6,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have had a conversation with my honourable and learned friend since .answering his question yesterday, view of what he has told me, I have now no difficulty in saying that I shall have much pleasure in endeavouring to get information which he desires. PREFERENTIAL TRADE.",12
7,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"In view of the stateself - ment of the Prime Minister that he will regard the amendment of which the orable member for Hume bas given notice, .in regard to preferential trade, as a motion of no-confidence, will he indicate his tentions with regard to the motion of honourable and learned member for larat ?",13
8,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I will state my views in ference to that motion when it is reached SELECTCOMMITTEEEVIDENCE . cases,13
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Has the Prime Minister read a report appearing in today's - newspapers to the effect that a Mr Louis Phillip Jacobs refused to answer certain questions of great importance that were put to him yesterday by the Select Committee now inquiring into the tobacco trade? If the Committee bas not power ""witnesses to give the information which it requires, will he convert it into a Royal Commission, so that it may be able to deal properly with the subject referred to it?",13
10,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"As the witness in question was appearing before a Select Committee - of another branch of this Legislature, matter falls more properly within the vince of the Senate. I have read the . paper account,' however, and I gathered from it that, while the witness at first fused to answer certain questions, he afterof wards gave (he information.",13
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,No .,13
12,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I can only say that if any House ? obstacle is interposed to hinder the labours of any Committee of either branch of Legislature, the Government will take seriously into consideration the methods available for the compelling of witnesses give information - In the first instance, however, such refusals more naturally within the province of the authority authorized an inquiry. If that authority is not able to deal with the matter, it will be the duty of the Government to see that the information is obtained by some other . means. I think that the inability of a Select Committee to obtain information would be a strong reason for the appoint of ment of a Royal Commission. and, in DAY LABOU RINCOMMONWEALT H CONTRACTS.",13
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Can the Ministhe ter of Home Affairs say whether any proposals in favour of day labour, in preference to contract labour, for the carrying out of the public works of the Commonwealth, are, or have been, in contemplation by himor his predecessor? Is he able to tell the House what is the. policy of the Gohonvernment in regard to the matter?",13
14,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"So far as' inI know, the only proposal of the kind has the been made in connection with some regulaBaltions which have been prepared in connection with the Public Works branch of the Department of Home Affairs, the suggesretion being that the controlling authority in connection with public works, which would' mean in some cases .the States, and in other the Commonwealth, should ask for prices to be given for the performance of the work by day labour. I have not confirmed that proposal, and the custom which previously existed is still in . existence.",13
15,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Par t of the work has all along been done by day labour.,13
16,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Yes , but to compel this is a special proposal. PUBLIC SERVANTS' LIF E INSURANCE.",13
17,Mr HUME COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"^Has the attention . of the Minister been directed to a statement in this morning's Age, that a number of the Commonwealth public servants are not inprosured in accordance with the requirements newsof the Public Service Act?- If so, I wish to know if the statement is true. Have the reGovernment yet considered the advisability establishing a Commonwealth L if e In surance Department, in accordance with the terms of the resolution passed by this",13
18,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I am not this aware that there has been any neglect of the insurance requirements of the Public Service Act) but if the honourable member to will give notice of his question, I shall be happy to make inquiries. The Government come have not yet come to a decision, nor have. which they considered the establishment of a Commonwealth Insurance Department. MINIMUM WAGE: MILITAR Y CLOTHING CONTRACTS. Mr HUTCHIS ON Is there a iriinimum wage clause in the contracts for the supply clothing for the Military Forces of the. Commonwealth ?",13
19,Mr MCCAY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I cannot answer the question without referring to the papers. If the honourable member will set it down for some day next week, I shall, in the meantime, procure the necessary information.",14
20,Mr MAUGER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"As the House has determined by resolution that such a clause shall be inserted in every tender, will the Minister see that it is done, if it has not been done?",14
21,Mr MCCAY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I think that such clauses are inserted, but as I cannot be sure about every case, I do not desire to make a positive ' assertion without first verifying the facts. SUPPLY (1904-5). 1 Motion (by Sir GEORGE TURNER) proposed - That the proceedings in Committee of Supply which lapsed on. Wednesday last be resumed, and * that the House do now resolve itself into the Commitr.ee of Supply.",14
22,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I oppose the motion. Yesterday I objected to its being moved without notice, not because I wished the order for the consideration of Supply in Committee not to be restored then, but because I object to its restoration altogether, since I have no political confidence in the Ministry, and showed that some time ago by both my voice and my vote. Although on that occasion a. small majority declared for the Government, that did not alter my view. I take it that, if the - House refuses to grant the request of the Treasurer, its action will be tantamount to the passing of a vote of no-confidence.",14
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Anothe r leader of the Opposition!,14
24,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I am acting independently.,14
25,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Does not the honourable member think that he might have given me notice that he was again getting the guillotine ready ? ;,14
26,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The right honourable 'gentleman did not give the Watson Government much notice. Mr R.EID - We had days and days of 'discussion, and every honourable member was here when the division took place. ' . Mr THOMAS - I think it is only fair to mention the names of those honourable members who were present when the countout took place on Wednesday.",14
27,Mr WILKS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"That is, those who were in the chamber?",14
28,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Yes .,14
29,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is not fair to advertise the absentees at a particular moment, especially when some of them were waiting within the precincts of the House.",14
30,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I was within the precincts of the House, but I refused to come into the chamber in order to assist to make a quorum. I am opposed to the Government', and I am prepared to do anything short of murdering them in order to get rid of them.",14
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Wh v is the honourable member opposed to them ?,14
32,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Because they occupy tht Treasury benches.,14
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I thought it was for some such intelligent reason.,14
34,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I think that is a very fair reason. I find that the honourable members who were present when the count out took place were the honourable and learned member for Corio,14
35,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I desire to ask your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether the statement which the honourable member is making is relevant to the question of resuming the consideration of Supplv.",14
36,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The question which has now arisen is whether the order for the consideration of the Estimates in Committee of Supply shall be restored to the notice-paper, arid therefore anything that may relate to the necessity for the motion, such as the count-out which took place on Wednesdav evening, will be in order.",14
37,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I desire to show that the Government have no right to ask that the order of the day shall toe restored, because the majority of honourable members who were present when the count-out took place belonged to the Opposition. The Government were actually in a minority.",14
38,Mr WILKS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Is the honourable member counting the Chairman of Committees-?,14
39,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"No ; but even counting the Chairman, who is paid to be here, the pegging would only be even.",14
40,Mr SALMON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I would ask whether the honourable member is in order in making a distinct reference to the position which I occupy in this House. He stated in an offensive fashion that the Chairman was paid to be here. I would ask whether he is in order in making a statement of that kind, and whether it is not a fact that all other honourable members are also paid to be here.",14
41,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I withdraw the expression referred to. I did not wish to be offensive - I should have stated that the honourable member was here in his official capacity. I shall now read the list of the honourable members who were present when the count-out took place, as follow:-The honourable members for Corio, Maranoa, Grey, Capricornia, Canobolas, Fremantle, Riverina, Parramatta, Kalgoorlie, Cowper, New England, Gippsland, Wimmera, Kennedy, Yarra, Macquarie, Bass, North Sydney, Balaclava, Bland, Coragamite, Wannon, and Dalley.",14
42,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Was the honourable member present?,15
43,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"No . I went out of the Chamber because I did not want to assist the Government in forming a quorum. If I could secure a count-out by leaving the Chamber at this moment I should do so. I induced one or two honourable members to go home on Wednesday evening for the sake of their health. I thought that ten o'clock was sufficiently late for them to be away from their homes. Out of (twenty-four members present, including the Chairman of Committees, twelve were members or supporters of the Government, and twelve were members of the Opposition. Therefore, exclusive of the Chairman, the Opposition had an actual majority. If the Government can muster only eleven of their supporters when an important matter such as the Estimates is being considered it would almost seem that their own followers are losing confidence in them. They could succeed in keeping here only eleven honourable members out of thirty-eight.",15
44,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"How often could we have counted out the House when the last Government were in office? Mr THOMAS' - If the honourable member could have done so, I have no doubt he would have taken advantage of the opportunity.",15
45,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Onl y eight honourable members were present one evening.,15
46,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,You fellows'showed us a lot of mercy.,15
47,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Order .,15
48,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I should like to ask if the honourable member is in order in addressing members as "" fellows."" A "" fellow "" is a sheep-stealer.",15
49,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I called the honourable member to order for addressing honourable members across the Chamber as "" you fellows,"" instead of addressing the Chair.",15
50,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"In order to show that I was not bitterly opposed to the Government, I would point out to honourable members that at 10 o'clock I suggested that we should adjourn.",15
51,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"And I said that I was prepared to adjourn at 10.30 o'clock in consideration of the fact that some honourable members had been travelling that day, but the honourable member refused to give us an extra quarter of an hour.",15
52,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I did not wish to be too hard upon the Government, and I suggested an adjournment at 10 o'clock, but Ministers said that they had a perfect right to conduct the business in their own way. And yet at 10.15 o'clock they could only muster eleven of their supporters. Only three Ministers were present. Of course Ministers can please themselves whether they come here or stay away. They can stay away altogether, so far as I am concerned. At the same time, if they do absent themselves they can scarcely rely upon the attendance of theirsupporters. They certainly can hardly expect the members of the Opposition to be here.",15
53,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I thought we were all paid to be here.,15
54,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We are not paid to be here to transact the business of the Government.,15
55,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It is the business of the country. Mr.'THOMAS - I think that the right honourable gentleman should be the last to complain of the absence of other honourable members. When he was not in receipt of the emoluments of office he did not attend here very frequently in order to assist in forming a House.,15
56,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I gave the country more than ^400 worth of my time; that is more than the honourable member could say with regard to any period of his life.,15
57,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We had 215 sitting days during the first session of this Parliament, and the right honourable gentleman was absent upon 132 days. Therefore, so far as the greater number of the sittings were concerned, he did not care whether the business of the country was carried on or not. Consequently, I do not see that the honourable member has any right to grumble at any other honourable members for absenting themselves. It is no part of the duty of the Opposition to help the Government to carry on their business.",15
58,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Is the honourable membei speaking for the alliance?,15
59,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"No ; I am speaking for myself upon this occasion, as upon all others. I object to being made a convenience of by certain honourable members who desire to go away to attend to their own private business. Honourable members can stay away as often as they like. I shall not care if they absent themselves altogether. That is entirely a matter for themselves, and their constituents. But I - object to their making a convenience of me. I understood that the Ministry came into power in order to restore responsible government, and also with the object of crushing the Labour Party-of strangling the Bengal tigers and removing from the Ministerial side the steerage passengers. Whilst these are the objects of the Ministry,. I am not prepared to assist them, even by helping to form a House. I believe in harassing and hampering the Government as much as possible, because I do not agree with their policy, and do not approve of their occupancy of the Treasury benches. I take it that if the proposal of the Treasurer is not carried the Government will be hampered, and that is my reason for opposing it. Mr KING O'MALLE Y (Darwin) - The honourable member has referred to honourable members being paid to attend here. I hold, however, that we are not paid. We receive £ 4 0 0 per annum as an allowance- a starvation allowance, against which we should enter a protest. I shall vote with the Government, but not on account of any pay I receive.",16
60,Mr MCDONA LD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I should like to say a few words in regard to this matter, because my action was practically the cause of the count-out. I take up exactly the same stand as that adopted by the honourable member for Barrier. If I were near the door of the chamber, and the Government desired to form a quorum, I should move further away instead of entering the House. On another occasion I told the honourable member for Dalley when he came into the labour room, that I would not assist to form a quorum, and the honourable member for Barrier was there and took exactly the same position.",16
61,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We have no complaint against the honourable member upon that score, but other honourable members occupy a different position.",16
62,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"My ground for assuming that attitude is that I consider that no Government can possibly carry on with such a slender majority as that possessed by the present Ministry without inflicting humiliation upon themselves, and degrading Parliament. The late Government occupied an entirely different position. If the leader of the Opposition were Prime Minister, and attempted to carry on under similar circumstances, I should not support him for one moment. In fact, I intimated 1 that fact to him very Dlainly. The Prime Minister knows perfectly well-h e has stated it repeatedly in this House-that any one of his thirty-six supporters can turn him out of office.",16
63,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I did not say that; I said that any one of them might create a lot of trouble.,16
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,On e member could turn the right honourable gentleman out of office.,16
65,Mr MCDO NALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Undoubtedly .,16
66,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That is quite another matter.,16
67,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Unde r such circumstances no Government can carry on with credit to themselves or to the country. I am quite sure that thejight honourable gentleman realizes that fact quite as well as does any honourable member of this House. I feel that we are not acting honestly to the electors in allowing the existing condition of affairs to continue, and that something ought to be done to bring about an appeal to the country.",16
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I do not hear any cheers upon the Opposition side of the Chamber.,16
69,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I do not hear any cheers upon the other side.,16
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We do not want to go to the country.,16
71,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I cannot help whether members of the Opposition cheer or riot. If honourable members opposite admit that they do not wish to go to the country-that they are afraid to face their constituents- I say they are the poorest set of representatives that I have yet dis-"" covered.",16
72,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Wai t until we get the rolls_ in order. Let honourable members try to turn us Out of office then.,16
73,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Fro m the Prime Minister's interjection, I take it that he is quite prepared to appeal to the country.",16
74,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,At any time.,16
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Le t the right honourable gentleman do so now. We are ready whenever he .is.,16
76,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The Prime Minister declares that he is ready to face the country at any time. I am heartily glad to have that assurance.,17
77,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Surely the honourable 'member does not believe it.,17
78,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Withi n the next week or fortnight, we shall see whether we can accept the Prime Minister's word.",17
79,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,There will be no trouble at all.,17
80,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The only excuse which the right honourable gentleman now makes for denying us an appeal to OUT constituents is that the electoral rolls are not in order.,17
81,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,There are two reasons.,17
82,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What is the other?,17
83,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It is that we have a majority.,17
84,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Prime Minister has now given us a second reason why he is not anxious to bring about a general election. He declares that he has a majority. Yet only a few nights ago, he had to rise in his place and reprove one of his supporters for a certain statement which he had made. The right honourable gentleman affirmed that he would be less than a man if he had not done so, but, nevertheless, he did not repudiate the statement of another honourable member who alleged that he held him in the hollow of his hand. He did not resent that declaration. honourable member also added that for the moment he would record his vote in favour of the Government, but that he reserved to himself the right to take different action at a later period - The Government; I repeat, areprepared to carry on with an exceedingly slender majority. essence of my argument is that no Ministry which possesses a majority of one can just if y its existence. I do not think that Ave can find a parallel to the present position in Australian history.",17
85,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Prime Minister compared a New South Wales Government * which held on to office under somewhat similar circumstances, to ring-tailed opossums.",17
86,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Yes . in g himself to a somewhat similar position in New South Wales, the right honourable gentleman said that, rather than follow the course of clinging to office like a set of ring-tailed opossums, which had been adopted by his predecessors, he would resign his position. Nevertheless, he is now emulating the methods of 'the opossum. - Concerning the count-out which occurred on Wednesday evening, I desire to say that I objected to the honourable member for Maranoa withdrawing his call for a division. I had a perfect right to do so - When a proposal is submitted in this House, why should I be called upon to abandon my opinions regarding it, owing tp the neglect of honourable members to be present ?",17
87,Mr ROBINSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If the honourable member's vote had been properly recorded, he would have voted with the ""Ayes.""",17
88,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is quite true that I misunderstood the question when it was put from the Chair, and that I gave my voice upon the wrong side. But I immediately corrected my mistake, and if the Chairman had not accepted my correction, I should certainly have, asked him to put the question again. I maintain that the Chairman adopted the proper course. I object to being compelled to forego my opinions for the sake of avoiding a countout. I have no right to be placed in that position. The honourable member for Maranoa called for a division upon the proposal which was under discussion. I was strongly adverse to the increase proposed, and ""naturally desired to record my vote against it. The honourable member for Maranoa desired to withdraw his call for a division, because he did not wish to place the Committee in an awkward position. When I explained The same to him that the business which would lapse consequent upon a count-out could be restored' to the paper, he was quite satisfied. But I wish to point out that a difficulty is likely to arise in connection with the motion which is now under consideration, although I presume that the Government have conThe.whole sulted authorities as to the course which should be followed. The motion affirmsl h at the proceedings in Committee of Supply, which lapsed on Wednesday last, be resumed, and that the House do now resolve itself into the Committee of Supply. In my judgment there are two distinct proposals involved in that motion. I can quite understand a proposition being submitted affirming that we should resume the conI n address- sideration of business at the point at which it lapsed. The argument will probably be advanced that the Committee of Supply has lapsed. That, however, is not so. because our Standing Orders provide that we can restore any lapsed business to the paper and resume its consideration at the point at which it was dropped. That is all we have to do upon the present occasion. There is. no need to reconstitute the Committee of Supply.",17
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,But we cannot resume our consideration of the Estimates until Committee of Supply has been set up.,18
90,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If the second portion of the motion be carried, the question will at once arise, "" Are we to set up a Committee of Supply de novo, or from the point at which it lapsed last Wednesday?""",18
91,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have looked into this matter very carefully, and I find that there have been many examples of a count-out in Committee of Supply in the House of Commons', and that there the custom has been for Supply to be restored at the point at which it lapsed, as a matter of form, upon the next dav of sitting. In this case, the House in the first place is called upon to resolve that the consideration of business shall be resumed* at the point at which it lapsed, and in the next to affirm when that consideration shall be resumed. To resolve that its consideration shall be resumed without fixing a date for such resumption would be obviously futile. The two proposals are necessary-first , that the consideration of the business shall be resumed, and secondly that a date shall be fixed when it shall be so resumed. The two matters are properly combined in one motion, and no point which has arisen in any .such Parliament as this has been overlooked.",18
92,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I am very much I obliged, sir, for that information. Under the circumstances I have nothing further add upon that subject. The honourable member for Barrier has been kind enough inform the House of the names bers who .were present when the count-out occurred upon Wednesday evening. I think that it is only fair to state who were absent.",18
93,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What object can be gained by so doing?,18
94,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It will allow the electors to see how the country is being governed under existing conditions.,18
95,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We are getting a good exhibition of it just now.,18
96,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"-In the first place, the Government majority, in the person of the honourable member for Wilmot, was sent. Similarly, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, Werriwa, Ballarat, South Sydney, Richmond, Denison, Illawarra, Flinders, Mernda, Angas, and the right orable member for Swan, were not in tendance. With the exception of the honsent orable member for South Sydney and the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, none of these gentlemen are very constant in their attendance.",18
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I am more constantly in attendance here than is the honourable member. Loud laughter.,18
98,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Order ! I would point out that not only is it disorderly to interrupt an honourable member by interjection, but that it is equally disorderly to interrupt by laughter.",18
99,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is very difficult for me to proceed, but I desire to'acknow-ledge that the right honourable member for Swan is very constant in his attendance. Then the honourable members for Lang, Wentworth, Kooyong, Hunter, Corinella, Echuca, Franklin, Bendigo, East Sydney, Grampians, Parkes, and Robertson, many of whom attend regularly, were also absent.",18
100,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I was paired with a member of the Opposition on the evening in question.,18
101,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I think' that the pairing system is objectionable.,18
102,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Are all these honourable members Government supporters? - Mr MCDONALD - Yes . I shall leave honourable members opposite to deal with the absentees upon the Opposition side, and trust that they will in future pay greater attention to their parliamentary duties. The to Prime Minister says that he has. given ^400 worth of his time to the business of the to country, and that some of us would not do of the memthat in a lifetime.",18
103,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I did not say that. I spoke of one honourable member who referred to me; it was simply a case of tit for tat.,18
104,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We occupy a responsible position. We have been returned to attend to the business of the Commonwealth, but a large number of honourable members do not appear to recognise that fact.",18
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It would be better for some honourable members to be away than to waste time in this manner.,18
106,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"That may be, but abthe Government alone are responsible for any waste of time in regard to this matter. No one knows better than does the Prime Minister that a Government cannot carry honon with any degree of success when they athave so narrow a majority as have the preAdministration, and that in the present state of parties it is a mere waste of time for us to attend here day after day. It following week. is for this reason that we desire the ment to go to the country at the earliest date - The right honourable gentleman has practically told us that as soon as .the are in order he will go to the country. We challenge him to keep that promise.",18
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He told the House of the Opposition. of another reason why it was not proposed at present to go to the country.,19
108,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That was an after tion. thought. We have also been informed a member of the Government that three months the rolls will be in perfect order.,19
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That was a forttaining a quorum. night ago.,19
110,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It was. We may therefore reasonably expect the Prime ister to fulfil his promise, and let a genera] election about January, or February next.",19
111,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He made no such mise.,19
112,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The honourable memGovernment ber is the representative of only a minority of the electors in his constituency, so we may feel assured that he does not deporters present. sire a general election.",19
113,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I admit that I do not, but not for the reason which .the honourable member suggests.",19
114,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not think that any .material advantage would be gained by voting against the motion, but if the orable member for Barrier desires to go to a division in order to enter another protest against the position of the Governsponsibility ment, I shall certainly support him.",19
115,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," The Government have only themselves to blame for present situation. It is certainly the duty of every honourable member to attend to business of the country; but it is especial duty of a Government to see a quorum is maintained. It is all very well for some honourable members opposite to say that had they desired, they could tained. have secured a count-out of the House while the late Government were in office, but that statement will not bear investigahonorable tion. As a matter of fact, we always had a sufficient number of honourable memready bers available to maintain a quorum. It is true that on one occasion there was f a less than a quorum present, but that was outcome of a pre-arranged plan to enable second-reading debate on the Seat of Goplan, vernment Bil l to be concluded, so that ballot for the site might be taken in the It was the result of an Governarrangement between the leaders of the several parties, and cannot Ibe taken as any evidence of the inability of the Governrolls ment then in office to keep a quorum.",19
116,Mr WILKS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,And one-half of the honourable members then present were members,19
117,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Surely it is not open to the honourable member to take up that posiI f we give, the Government man by for man to maintain a quorum, what reawithin son have they for complaint?",19
118,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I was asked by the whip of the late Government to assist in main,19
119,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,And honourable members of the Opposition have also been asked to Minassist in maintaining a quorum since the us have present Government have been in office.,19
120,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Did our supporters ever refuse such a request when preferred by the prowhip of the late Government?,19
121,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I do not know. The have no reason to complain while there is a larger proportion of Oppothat sition members than of Ministerial sup,19
122,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,But our supporters haye never walked out of the House in order that there should not be a quorum.,19
123,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If an honourable member wishes to return to his home, he is surely at liberty to do so,.. The duty of maintainhoning a quorum rests primarily with the Government, and it is useless for any of their supporters to attempt to throw the ref o r the recent count-out upon the Opposition.",19
124,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Does the honourable the member remember the evening when over twenty-five clauses in a certain Bill were the passed, although there was not a quorum the present? That was during the term of that office of the late Government.",19
125,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I have already referred to that; but a quorum could have' been ob,19
126,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,No .,19
127,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I disagree with the member. The Postmaster-General, as the Opposition whip, was always to make an arrangement with a view to economizing time in the. transaction of r public business; but he takes care to point the to the very instances where business was the carried on, according to a pre-arranged in the absence of a quorum, as evia dence that a quorum was not then obtainable. It does not seem to me that there is anything to gain by our opposing the motion. I feel that a certain proportion of the business of the country, including the Estimates, must be passed, whether we have confidence in the Government or not. These Estimates are framed on lines of which 1I have generally approved. The late Government were, to some extent, responsible for their general preparation although they are not exactly as framed by us. There is no doubt that the finances of the country must be kept going, and, notwithstanding our lack of confidence in the Government, I do not think that we should be justified in taking steps to prevent the passing of these Estimates and the maintenance of - thefinancesof the country in a proper condition.",19
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,An Opposition - never has any confidence in a Government.,20
129,Mr WATSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I suppose that is the constitutional position of every Opposition. The authority for such an attitude comes from the people. The people whom we represent have no confidence in this Government, and it is our duty, whenever a reasonable opportunity offers, to show that that is so. I do not say, however, that my lack of confidence in the Government would lead me to go so far as to oppose the passing of the ordinary Estimates for the services of the Commonwealth. I have no objection to the motion, but I do not think that the Government can complain if some criticism is levelled at them in regard to the causes of the present position of business.",20
130,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I hope that honourable members will proceed to transact the business of the country. The granting of the supplies necessary to carry on the services of the Commonwealth is a very important matter, affecting thousands of persons, who are not at all interested in these personal pleasantries or tactical moves. - agree with the leader of the Opposition that it is the duty of the Government to maintain a quorum, and it is also true that several members of the Ministry and a - number of Government supporters were absent when the count-out took place on Wednesday night. I have no complaint to make against either the leader of the Opposition or the Opposition as a body, although I have my own opinions as to the conduct of one' or two of its members in taking advantage of the weakness of the House at a particular moment. I have my own opinions as to the methods which one or two of them adopt in the transaction of public business, but I have not much complaint against the honourable member for Kennedy or the honourable member for Maranoa, because, while they are two of our bitterest opponents, every action they take against us is thoroughly open and straightforward. I cannot say that of every member of the Opposition, although I can for the great majority. I admit, as I have done over and over again, that it is always within the power of an Opposition, whose numbers so closely approximate to those of the Government, to bring about a crisis. I believe I am correct in saying, however-and 11 speak now with some authority, because I have the advantage of knowing the opinion of more than one honourable member opposite-that some of the Opposition are perfectly satisfied that all that party fighting requires has been attempted by the two attacks-on e by the leader of the Opposition, and the other by the honourable and learned member for Indi - o n the Government, and that they are not going to be parties to any attempt by mere obstruction to bring about a crisis in this House.",20
131,Mr FISHER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Then the honourable member knows more than we do.,20
132,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Perhaps I do. It is always open to the Opposition to seek to bring about a crisis by obstructing public business, and I can assure honourable members that there will be no lack of a sense of the duty and the powers of the Government should such a situation arise. Whilst I put certain considerations of public interest before the Parliament and the country, those considerations can'be. overborne by an intolerable state of things arising in this House, and creating a new situation. In such circumstances, one - must fling to the winds every I quite consideration of the convenience and rights of hundreds of thousands of persons who are on the rolls of Australia. I am endeavouring, as far as I can, to protect their interests. I admit that a situation may arise in which I may have to disregard even such considerations, but all that I say is that that situation must be forced upon the Government. It must become patent to the House and to the country, but it certainly cannot be forced upon the Government by the honourable member for Barrier.",20
133,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It can by the honourable member for Wilmot.,20
134,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," As one who believes that it is the duty of every honourable member to facilitate the transaction of public business, I have assisted more than once, and shall do so again, to keep a House. But occasions arise when it is necessary to enter a protest, and I think that the honourable member for Barrier, and those who support him, are quite justified in protesting as they have done. On Wednesday night I was in indifferent health, but remained in the House until within two minutes of the count-out. I went away then only because I was very unwell. A Government with so precarious a majority as have the present Administration, ought really to demand more from their own followers than they appear to expect from honourable members of the Opposition. I do not think that honourable members should deliberately walk out of the Chamber when the Estimates are under discussion, but they are entitled to do so when they find that Government supporters care less for the business of the country than they do for their own private affairs. In such a state of things we find justification for the position taken up by the honourable member for Barrier.",21
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Most of those who were absent were accepting the hospitality of the Governor General.,21
136,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I object to keeping a House for a Government whose supporters are away accepting the hospitality of the Governor General, who, I am sure, does not expect us to figure as his guests to the triment of the business of the country. Although I am willing to assist the Government in the transaction of business, I shall not promise to assist to keep a House if they cannot get their own followers to take part in the sittings in sufficient numbers. If we, on this side, receive fair play, the Prime Minister may rely upon getting similar treatment from us, but not otherwise.",21
137,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I should not have risen but for the pointed reference made to my absence by the honourable member for Kennedy. It is somewhat remarkable that, although I have been as close an attendant as any other honourable member of the House during the nine months in which we have been in session, the countout took place during the only quarter of an hour that I have been absent. As a matter of fact, one of my constituents, who was visiting Melbourne, called on me here, and I accompanied him to the foot of the steps as far as the front pavement. I heard the bell ringing, but, as I had not yet learnt to distinguish between the sound of our bell and that of the Senate, I was under the mistaken impression that it was a call for a divison of the Senate on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and therefore disregarded it. I had no suspicion that it was a call for a quorum in this Chamber. I returned just after the doors had been closed, and learned too late of the true state of affairs. No one can justly accuse me of having failed in my attendances, and I think it right that I should be allowed to make this explanation.",21
138,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," It has been stated that when I was Government whip I used to ask members of the Opposition to help to form a quorum. As Opposition whip I always ask members of my own party to help to form a quorum for the present Government. Last Wednesday night I paired with the Prime Minister, but I broke my pair in order to try to prevent a count-out. I shall vote for the motion of the Treasurer, in order to facilitate the transaction of public business; but I am surprised at the statements of honourable members opposite that their party would never be guilty of such tactics as counting the House out. When the Arbitration Bill was under consideration, and the honourable and learned member for Corio was opposing some proposal of the Government, he asked the honourable member for Bland to consent to an adjournment. The Prime Minister replied that it was rather de- too early. The honourable member for Wentworth then approached the honourable and learned member, and said, ""You move to report progress."" I ascertained that there were just enough members of our party present to form a quorum, and the Prime Minister presently consented to an adjournment. There was a quorum present, although the honourable member for Wentworth has stated that more than two-thirds of the House were away.",21
139,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I stayed many times to keep a quorum for the last Government.,21
140,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"On one occasion during the period when the Prime Minister sat on this side of the Chamber, and when the Barton Government were in office, a quorum was rung for twenty times in one sitting in an endeavour to count out the House.",21
141,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I was not here.,21
142,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It was not the only occasion when the right honourable member was absent. The Postmaster-General has stated that on one occasion the last Government put through twenty-six clauses of the Arbitration Bill when no quorum was present. That is absolutely a mis-statement. There was a quorum present all the time. The honourable member for Kennedy objected to an adjournment, and I went through the building and found out that, although there was not a quorum present in the Chamber, there was a quorum within its precincts. I am willing to help the Government in these matters, but they must be prepared to do their share. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that they should not expect us to do more than that.  debate will do good. A large number of honourable members are not so frequent their attendance as they should be, and believe that the ventilation of this occurthe rence will be a warning to them, Such honourable members impose on the generosity their fellows, who travel thousands of miles during the session to attend here, week week, and month by month, while they come very seldom. I hope that we shall have better attendance in the future. I shall for the restoration of the order of the for Supply to the notice-paper.",21
143,Mr MALONEY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I intend to vote for the Government, because I think that public business should not be hindered. The matter, however, is one which requires ventilation. I think, in the first place, the manner in which attention is called the state of the House is a bad one, and that the public would prefer that an officer should draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the state of the House than that Member of Parliament should commit seeming discourtesy in doing so. The vernor-General on Wednesday night had vited certain honourable members to Governin ment House, - and their absence in part accounted for the count-out. myself, finding that a division was likely, was absent for about an hour some - other honourable members, and was this side of the House. equally responsible for what happened. returned here when the doors of the chamber had been closed. Had I been in the buildor ing, I should have been in my place on the ringing of the bell. A member of the Ministo try made an interjection while another orable member was speaking Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I was alluding to what was said by the honourable member for Barrier.",22
144,Mr MALONEY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Then I leave him to speak for himself. I was under the impression that no one who was absent from the. division could afterwards enter the Chamber. In Switzerland they have a very easy method' of preventing counts-out by fining members, whose names are absent from the division lists, and though the quorum there is a. majority of the House, counts-out never occur. When the Government get into recess, they will do well to consider whether, in the present evenly divided state of parties,, which leads only to the harrying of one party by the other, it would not be wise to provide for the election of Ministers, or for some other means to secure continuity of administration.",22
145,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I am - certainlyin coming to the view that we shall have to I make a change. The public will not stand present state of things much longer.,22
146,Mr MALONEY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The people do not of know why seventy-five members cannot do the work which they are sent here to perby form. During the fourteen years that I was in political life in the Victorian Parliament, a I was never asked for my vote, because the vote planks of my platform were known, - and day Governments were aware that my support could always be obtained to democratic measuies. Any Government bringing in measures which I support will be able to command my vote. I hope that some advantage will flow from the discussion which has that taken place, and that the public will reto cognise the absurdity of carrying on a. Government which has such a slender; majority.",22
147,Mr FOWL ER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I have no> a doubt the Prime Minister is very grateful a to the members of the Opposition for the: Goassistance they have given him in rounding inup his supporters who are not so frequent their attendance here as' they should be. Whilst I agree that this discussion may do I some good in that direction, I cannot inundorse some of the sentiments which have with been expressed by honourable members on I do not intend I to adopt the pin-prick policy in connection with party tactics. I do not think it is fair that it will redound to the credit of the party that follows it. Further, it is not fair the country. Every time a distinct issue honis brought before the House, which invokes the question whether or not the Government should continue to occupy their present position, or go to the country, I shall vote directly against them.",22
148,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Is there no principle involved, when the Government have the avowed intention of crushing the Labour Party at the first chance?",23
149,Mr FOWLER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I quite believe that they are anxious to do that,; but I am not sure that they will be able to accomplish their purpose. The honourable member for Grey argued that the business of the country was being interfered with by honourable members who absented themselves, and that members from the more distant States were being inconvenienced on that account. am one of those honourable members who represent one of the more distant States, and I have been here continuously for nine months; but I do not agree with the honourable member for Grey, when he asks for an increased attendance of honourable members. It is a deplorable fact that the attendance of honourable members here in large numbers seems only to interfere with the progress of business. As one who has attended here very regularly, it appears to me that some honourable members come here to make speeches for the benefit of the electors, and not with the object of furthering the business. All the work is performed practically by the f a it h f u l few who different to the consideration whether or not they are obtaining a good advertisement for themselves. I believe the discussion will do some good, and I hope it will also direct the attention of the public to the necessity for some radical change, in our parliamentary methods. I believe that such a change isnecessary, and when the opportunity occurs, I shall do my best to bring it about.",23
150,Mr BROWN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," Althoug h I sit upon the Opposition benches, I do not think that I can be charged with entertaining any personal hostility towards the members of the Government, or with having unduly harassed them. I recognise that the business of the country must be carried on, whether it be by a Government having a large or a narrow majority. It very often happens that the business is more efficiently transacted by. a Government with a narrow majority than by one having an overwhelming number of supporters. A Government which is confronted hy a weak Opposition very often fails to accomplish its purpose. For these reasons, I am not favourable to anything in the way of opposition which will involve a mere waste of time. The Government appear to think that this debate is a pure waste of time; but it may accomplish some good by directing attention to the unsatisfactory manner in which the business of the country is being carried on by reason of the absence of a large number of honourable members, who, whilst professing to serve the country, are more concerned in looking after their own private interests. I do not agree with the honourable member for Perth, who says that our work is carried on more, effectively, when there is a small attendance of honourable members, than when there is a large one. It is true that a few honourable members sit here for long hours at great personal inconvenience, in I order to facilitate the business, and that time is wasted principally by those honourable members who attend only occasionally, and make long speeches to let their constituents know that they are here.",23
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member himself makes the longest speeches.,23
152,Mr BROWN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not speak very often-no t so often as does the right honourable gentleman, whose speeches occupy more space in Hansard than mine do. The honourable members referred to make long speeches, and then clear out again. That is the last that is seen of them, so f ar as the actual work of the House is concerned. are inThe present condition of affairs is not a healthy one, because honourable members who conscientiously attend to their duties are expected to make up for the deficiencies of those honourable members who attend here only when they desire to deliver a speech. Some reform should be effected in this d i rection. We, do not want more talk or longer speeches, but a more regular attendance, and fuller consideration of the measures - which are being placed upon the Statute-book. The Prime Minister, when he was Premier of New South Wales, was able to arrange for all-night sittings, and, indeed, all-week sittings, in order to push through the work of the country. He had no difficulty in maintaining a quorum, because he had the Labour Party behind him. He must now realise that he is in a very different position, and that if he desires to keep a House he must rely upon supporters who have not been remarkable for the regularity of their attendance. Honourable members should recognise their obligation to attend here, not merely for the purpose of maintaining a quorum, but also in order that the measures which are brought before us shall fairly reflect the wishes of our constituents. The honourable member for Barrier has done good service in raising this question, and pointing to the need of more regular attendance on the part of honourable members.",23
153,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," My sole obj ject in rising is to make a few remarks by way of explanation in connection with the statement made by the honourable member for Yarra. He accused me, by inference, of adopting the same tactics that were resorted to - by some honourable members on Wednesday evening, when they had the House counted out, although only routine business was under discussionI was told that I had harassed the late Government by similar methods. I find that on the occasion which I think the honourable member referred to, the House sat until half-past eleven. I considered that the Government were seeking by the aid of their majority to force their will upon the House in regard to a matter which should not have been disposed of except after the fullest discussion. The honourable and learned member for Corio moved that progress be .reported, and as far as my memory serves, I think I asked him to take that course. Attention was not drawn to the state of the House. A little later on the honourable and learned member for Corio said I understand that the Prime Minister has made some arrangement with the honourable member for North Sydney, and I wish to withdraw my motion. So that on that occasion nothing unfair was done.,  to humiliate the Watson Government - week,",24
154,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,There was no question of humiliation; I was simply endeavouring to prevent the Government rushing business of a most important nature through a thin House.  doing it .,24
155,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member is stating what is absolutely incorrect.  learned member for Corio was here.,24
156,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I understand the honourable member to imply a doubt as to the correctness of my statement. glad if the honourable member will say plainly whether he doubts my word. ,24
157,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I shall be fully prepared at all times, when a Government is attempting to improperly force its will upon a weak Opposition, to take every legitimate step that can be taken to resist it. I shall, if necessary, move that progress be reported in order to secure fair play. But the inference of the honourable member for Yarra was that I had adopted tactics such as those resorted to on Wednesday last, when the business was brought to a .complete standstill owing to the bitterness displayed towards the Government by a few honourable members. I shall never indulge in such tactics.",24
158,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL, I do not think there can be two opinions as to whether this discussion is a waste of time. It is not my intention to deal with the question of the attendance of other honourable members. That is a matter for which they will have to render an account to their constituents. I should not have risen but for the fact that the honourable member for Kennedy thought it necessary to mention the fact that I was absent when the count-out took place.,24
159,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I subsequently withdrew my reference to the honourable member.,24
160,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not mind the honourable member's criticism. I shall please myself as to when I come here and when I stop away. When my constituents think that I am not devoting sufficient attention to the public business, they will tell me so at the ballot-box. In the first Parliament, I believe that I was the most regular attendant from New South Wales. I believe I spend as much time in this Chamber as does any other honourable member. During this session I have missed one when I was ill in bed, and Hansard will show that I have not taken up very much time in speaking. I believe that in the last Parliament I spoke less than any other honourable member. On Wednesday I was here from the time the House met until nine o'clock. I then left the chamber, because I had accepted an invitation to attend a ball at Government House, and'consequently I was absent when the count-out took place. I make this statement in answer to the charge which has been preferred against me by the honourable member for Kennedy. His I shall be - statement may have been made in a lighthearted manner, butlight-hearted statements of that character, in the absence of an explanation, are sometimes, productive of trouble. In my opinion there must be a limit to the patience and forbearance of the Government. I was pleased to hear the Treasurer interject that there must be an end to the tactics which are being adopted upon the present occasion. I do not know that it would not be wise for the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to rise and openly declare that they 'can tolerate the present position no longer, .that accordingly they would ask the House to grant them three months' supply, that in the interim the electoral rolls would be put in order, and that we should then have an appeal to the country. If that course were decided upon, the Government would command my hearty support. than one occasion .the Prime Minister has declared that with the small majority which the Government possesses, it is impossible to carry on business without the reasonable co-operation of members of the Opposition. If the latter have decided not to extend that co-operation, to the Ministry, is it not wise that we should have the rolls put in order preparatory to a general election, or that an appeal should be made to the country upon the present rolls? I regret that the adoption of such a course would prevent the passing of two or three measures which are of an urgent character. For example, it would delay the passage of the Manufactures Encouragemment Bill, and of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. Nevertheless, it is obvious that under present conditions we are merely marking time. I ask some member of the Governmeh to make a statement regarding the position. I am quite prepared to record mv vote upon some question in such a way as* will bring about a dissolution. opinion, however, many of those who are - crying out most loudly for a dissolution, are praying to God that we shall not have - one.' I will undertake to say that most members of this House genuinely 'to avoid a dissolution. What is the use'of endeavouring ,to humbug the people 'by pretending to work for a dissolution - whilst honourable members are using their 'best efforts to avert it? If I were a member of the Opposition, and I thought that an appeal to the country was desirable, I - should have no hesitation whatever msing all the forms of the House to bring - about that result. I should certainly prevent the transaction of public business by every means in my power. What is the use of continuing this farce indefinitelyfor it is nothing but a farce? object can be gained by dragging Federation in the mud ? The Treasurer has declared that he is tired of the present position. I hold that the proper course to adopt is to see whether an amicable arrangement cannot be arrived at between the Government and the leader of the Opposition, whereby certain necessary measures of a non-party character may be passed into Mr Austin Chapman. law. We ought then to make the necessary financial arrangements to permit of an appeal to the people.",24
161,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member's vote can bring about a dissolution.,25
162,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I take no exception to the tactics of the Opposition. Upon more I am not anxious for a dissolution, but if the present farce is to continue, I shall feel it my duty to vote in favour of bringing about an appeal to the country. The Treasurer is right in affirming that the limit to his patience has been reached. I regret that the honourable member for Kennedy should have felt it necessary to introduce my name into this discussion. Of course it is easy for him to declare that he subsequently withdrew it. I did not hear him withdraw it. I owe a duty to my constituents, and that duty is to attend here, 1 and to do my best in the interests of the Commonwealth. I am under no obligation to anybody else. I am free to record my vote in favour of whatever proposals commend themselves to my judgment. I believe that it would be a good thing for the Government to pass certain measures which are now claiming the attention of Parliament, and in the interim to put the electoral rolls in order. That is why I have given them my ungrudging support. At In my the same time, what object is to be gained by pretending that we desire a dissolution when our professions in that direction are merely a sham ? I am not prepared to rush into recess, notwithstanding the long period desire which the House has been in session, and that I desire to return to my home, so as to be able to attend to my business. We hear some honourable members, like the honourable member for Wentworth, who are possessed of much more of this world's substance than I am, declaring that they cannot attend here throughout long sessions. in I say that they ought to be prepared to attend constantly. if it were necessary to have long sessions. But no such necessity exists. We ought to be able to transact the business of this Parliament in sessions extending over three or four What months. To a large extent, we are merely throwing dust in the eyes of the people by pretending that we desire to bring about certain results which we are - praying to God that we shall avoid. After all, what does it matter who occupies the Treasury benches, so long as a policy acceptable . to the country is being carried out? I repeat that an arrangement should be arrived at between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition as to what measures it is necessary to pass. The rolls could then be put in order, and supply granted to cover a certain period.",25
163,Sir JOHN QUICK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We must make provision for public works.,26
164,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If we want those works to be undertaken, let us vote the necessary funds. If I occupied a seat upon the front Opposition bench, and if I were as anxious for a dissolution as some honourable members profess to be, I should take such steps as would bring about the-desired result. It could be very easily accomplished, ancl it would be better to adopt that course than to continue to harrass the Ministry.",26
165,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What does the honourable member suggest?,26
166,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not bug the country. desire a dissolution, but I have just as little to fear from one as has the honourable member. After all, we have to consider the reputation of this Parliament. Federation, I regret to say, is becoming a word to scoff at. People are beginning to wonder why this national Parliament should exist, if it is to devote the whole of its time to paltry intrigues. Those who wish to bring about a change have the remedy in Uheir own hands. There is no man in this House who fears a dissolution less, or who has less cause to fear one, than has the Treasurer. We all know that he was practically driven into office, and that he would be glad to relinquish it if he did not feel that he has a publicduty to perform.",26
167,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We have one patriot.,26
168,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The honourable member for Barrier may scoff at the Treasurer's patriotism, but if , when his political career has terminated, he can point to as good a record as can the Treasurer, he will have something to his credit of which he may be proud. I am glad that the Treasurer has spoken, in the way that he has. It is time that this solemn farce came to an end, and I again invite those who are so anxious for a dissolution to avail themselves of the forms of this House. Any two members of the Opposition could bring about an appeal to the country within a fortnight. The Prime Minister has already admitted that he cannot carry on the Government of the Commonwealth without the co-operation of members of the Opposition. Whilst I am not anxious for a dissolution, I should prefer to face my constituents rather than continue the existing state of affairs.",26
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," It is refreshing to hear the speech to which honourable members have just listened. That deliverance is reminiscent of the utterances of the oid colleague with whom I used to work. I know that if he were sitting in Opposition he would be one of the strongest members in this House to carry out what he has stated can. be done. I can assure him that if he will endeavour to bring the Government to book, and to force an appeal to the country, I shall be veryhappy to assist him in every possible way. To-day the Prime Minister has declared that he intends to await his own convenience, and then to dissolve this House. The Opposition, I claim, have no right to study his convenience. It is their duty to force a dissolution at the earliest possible moment. It is incumbent upon them to prevent the Ministry from continuing to humI have no confidence either in the Prime Minister or in the Government. I have given sufficient evidence of that. 1 What has the Prime Minister done during the past ten days? He is opposed to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and yet He professed an anxiety to afford the honourable member for Eden-Monaro an opportunity to carry it into law. He is opposed to any' interference with the Tariff, and yet he has promised to appoint a Commission to inquire into its operation, with a view . to interefering with it . He is opposed to preferential trade, yet he proposes to give the House an opportunity fo deal with it ; he is opposed to granting protection to Australian manufacturers, and yet in the course of a speech delivered by him a few days ago he said that he would give them a preference. When \ve have such a right honourable member at the head of the Government the Opposition is' not only justified in taking any action that it may deem desirable to show that, in its opinion, the Government lacks the confidence of the people, but would be recreant to its duty if it did not do so.",26
170,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Com e oh again !,26
171,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have been after the right honourable member for some time, but he cannot accuse me of wobbling. I do not say one thing and mean another. I have never attempted to humbug the country. I am prepared to stand by any statement. I have made, and to defend any position that I have taken up. I am prepared to go to the country next week, if necessary, for I feel that until there has been such an appeal no good work will be accomplished. The statement made by the Prime Minister that it would take a long time to complete the rolls is all moonshine. If an urgent appeal were made to electors to enrol their names the work of compiling the rolls would be carried out in three or four weeks. The discrepancy between the number on the rolls and the actual number of persons entitled to vote is nothing like as large as has been suggested, and in these circumstances I feel that I am justified in the attitude which I take. The country expects the Opposition not merely to speak, but to act, on an occasion of this kind. I am daily in receipt of large numbers of letters from persons living in all parts of the Commonwealth, who desire to know when the Opposition is going to turn this Government out. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that he has received an assurance from certain members of the Opposition that they will not vote against the Government, but I should regret to learn that such an assurance had been given.",26
172,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I never said that an assurance had been given.,27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The right honourable member stated that he had the assurance of some honourable members, supposed to belong to the Opposition, that they considered the Government had been sufficiently attacked by means of the two votes of censure which had been moved, and that they were not going to support any further attempt to displace them.",27
174,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That is incorrect.,27
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I appeal to. honourable members to say whether I have not quoted in effect the statement made by the right honourable gentleman.,27
176,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That was the effect of the statement.,27
177,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Se e what Hansard will show.,27
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I trust that there are no members of the Opposition who, unknown to their leader, would make such a compact with the Government.",27
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Who is the leader' of these honourable members?,27
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The leader of the Opposition.,27
181,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Is he the honourable member's leader?,27
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Whils t we have such a leader as the honourable member for Eland I am not going to assume that T am a leader.,27
183,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,But is he the honourable member's leader?,27
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Hav e I not been following his lead to some extent? The honourable member has eyes to see and ears to hear.,27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Why does not the honourable member answer the question?,27
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have said as much as is necessary, and I do not wish to hear that gurgle emanating from the Prime Minister which has been so aptly described by the Sydney DaUy Telegraph. That journal has clearly stated what the Prime Minister would have done in the State had he been in Mr Carruthers' place. I repeat that the statement by the Prime Minister in regard to the attitude of certain members of the Opposition was in effect that which I mentioned.",27
187,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,No .,27
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It is well that we should know whether any members of the Opposition are prepared to make a compact with the head of the Government as to their future actions.,27
189,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The word ""compact"" was never used.",27
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not know what Hansard will show, and I certainly have no desire to misrepresent the right honourable gentleman.",27
191,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member cannot help it. It is ingrained in him. He has been misrepresenting me for years.,27
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The right honourable gentleman need not be offensive. I certainly have not been offensive to him this morning.,27
193,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I apologize.,27
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The ""vacant laugh "" is no answer to my assertion. If the right honourable member attacks me, he certainly will not find me turning the other cheek. I know that that which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has said is absolutely true. If half-a-dozen members of the Opposition feel as strongly as I do in regard to the position of the present Government, and as to the personnel of a section of it, they will prevent them from making a pretence to carry on business with which they do not really intend to deal. They will prevent time being wasted - because , after all, that is what the action of the Government really means if they have no intention of dealing with the business which they have promised to consider. It will probably take some time to pass the Estimates, even if we have only an ordinary legitimate discussion, but there is no necessity for us to delay our attack, until they shall have been passed. The proper course for an Opposition to take in dealing with a Government in which they have no confidence, is to refuse to pass the Estimates for the whole year, but if necessary to agree to the passing of a Supply Bill, which would enable .the finances of the country to be carried on pending the holding of a general election. That would be a constitutional course to adopt.",27
195,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What about,28
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is all very well for the right honourable member for Swan to chuckle, because he is anxious see the vote passed for the Transcontinenroughly tal Railway survev.",28
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Bill makes the necessary provision. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - I overlooked that fact for the moment, but I am quite prepared to help the right honourable mems.bs6nc6 ^ ber to have the survey made.",28
198,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It is the gun for Frethat mantle which is troubling the right honour the kind. able member.,28
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Then , let make him a present of it. An honourable member should not support the passing of Estimates, merely because they promorning vide for a small expenditure in his electorate, when they are introduced by Government in which the country has confidence. He certainly should not up such an attitude when the feeling the people is that no business of importance tenance of a quorum. can be done while the Government remain in power. What business has really dealt with since the present Administration came into office? I heard the Prime Minthe ister say a few days ago that during his in the House. term of office he had done more work than had any other Prime Minister. honourable gentleman was so often absent when good work was transacted by the Parliament, that he, perhaps, knows nothing red this session. about it. He has practically done nothing and, judging by the state of parties, he not likely to do very much. rity depends upon the attitude of one honthere orable member who recently denounced the doing so. Government in the most extreme terms. Such an honourable member as the one to whom I refer, and who recently denounced the Government, if giving evidence in a for Barrier are quite unfounded. Court, would produce this result-tha - side calling him would treat him as adverse witness.",28
200,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What he said about the Government was as nothing compared his denunciation of the Opposition.,28
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not know what he said about the Opposition, but I know that he could not have said more than he did against the Government, even if he had been one of their strongest opponents. As to the count-out which took place on Wednesday night, I am glad that no one can accuse me of having had a hand in it. I was away at the time, receiving the hospitality of the Governor General, but had I been Prime Minister, I certainly should not have been absent. The head of the Government has no right to be to absent from the House, unless he is thoassured that while he'is away the business of the country will be proceeded itself with as usual.",28
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Surely the Prime Minister had a right to assume that it would go on, in such circumstances, in his",28
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We have proof he had no right to assume anything of,28
204,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That is the worse charge us that has been made against me.,28
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I was as much surprised as was any one when I read next of the count-out. I certainly did own not know that anything of the kind was a contemplated. I wish to emphasize the point no that a Prime Minister should always be take at his post, or have some one acting for of him who will be able to insure the mainOn. manyoccasions, as Premier of New South Wales, I been abstained from attending public functions because of my belief that it was the duty of head of a Government to be at his post There is no legitimate excuse for his absence while the House is The right sitting. It is somewhat remarkable that the Prime Minister was absent on the two occasions on which a count-out occurI t is the duty of a Government to see that the business of a is country is carried on, and members of the His majoOpposition need not necessarily attend if are any difficulties in the way of their The responsibility of maintaining a quorum rests with the Ministry and their supporters, and the attacks which have been made on the honourable member, When t the the count-out took place on Wednesday an night, there was a larger number of members of the Opposition than of Government supporters present; surely, therefore, the with Ministry have no reason to complain. Owing to the action of the Ministry and their supporters, Supply was allowed to disappear from the notice-paper, and it isonly right that not only the Opposition, but Government supporters should direct attention to the incident.",28
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,We do about doing mean things.,29
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is not a mean thing to do. It is a proper constitutional course to follow, and I think that the honourable member for Barrier had a perfect right to draw pointed attention to it. His action has led to an interesting debate, and to remarks being made by some of 'the supporters of the Government which are worthy of notice, and even if it does no more, it will have served a useful purpose. I must say, so far as the attendance of the Opposition is concerned, that the members of the Labour. Party are most constant in their attention to the business of the country. It is seldom that one of them is absent. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-What is the use of their being here if they do not keep a House ?",29
208,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"They are not supposed to keep a House for the Government. If I am opposed to a Government, and am anxious to make them go to the country, I am justified in doing all that I can to force them to do so.",29
209,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Insid e the House.,29
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"And on the public platforms. It has been asserted that the House might have been counted out on more than one occasion whilst the late Government were in office. ber that an understanding was arrived at that the debate on the Seat of Government Bil l should be brought to a conclusion one evening although there was not a quorum present. I left for Sydney during the afternoon, and was informed by the leaders of both sides of the House that the arrangement had been made that attention should not be directed to the absence of a quorum. I take full responsibility for all my absences, although, excepting for occasional illness, I have been one of the most regular attendants. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, I shall exercise my own judgment as to how I act and vote. I have not come into the Federal Parliament to be hampered in my actions. I should hail a dissolution with great satisfaction, as the only way to bring about a better state of things. I do not think we should wait until it suits the Prime Minister and his supporters to go to the country. The Prime Minister has stated on the public platform, and in this Chamber, more than once, that the next battle cry will be ""unionism or non-unionism, labour or capital?"" not care Mr Reid - Nothin g of the sort.",29
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Prime Minister obtained his present position with the assistance of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat on the distinct understanding that he would get rid of the three party system, and resolve the House into two parties-the democrats and the conservatives. He is opposed to the principles of the Arbitration Bill , and now he and his Government are trying to pass it through the Senate as it left this Chamber. If he were true to the principles which he has professed, he would, instead of continuing to dupe the people, obtain supply, and go to the country at once. His object, however, is to cause delay, in order that the public mind may be diverted from the position which he took up a short time - ago. Under these circumstances, the Opposition is quite justified in using every means to force him to the country as soon as possible.",29
212,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"B y way of personal explanation, I wish to say that, although the honourable member for Hume twice stated that he agreed with the statement of the honourable member for Eden Monaro that the Prime Minister was humbugging the people, I never made any such statement. The Prime Minister has frankly told the House that he could not carry on I remem- the business of the country without the cooperation of the Opposition, and I said that those who were humbugging the people were those who were clamouring for a dissolution, and yet would not take advantage of the forms of the House to bring one about.",29
213,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Tw o hours having now elapsed since the House met, the orders of the day must be called on, unless honourable members determine otherwise.",29
214,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I would point out to honourable members that, no matter what our private feelings may be, it is our duty to the public to pass the Estimates. There is a large number of public works to be carried out, and I have already strained my advance vote to meet necessary expenditure. I do not object to the criticism which Ave haA'e heard, and to enable the matter to be dealt Will noAv, I move That the consideration of the Orders of the Day be postponed until after the completion of the debate just interrupted.",29
215,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I point out that there are a number of important measures, such as the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, among the orders of the day which the House might very well deal with now, instead of postponing them indefinitely. There is also the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, in which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is so interested, and of which most honourable members, with the exception of the Prime Minister and myself, and a few others, are in favour. Another important measure is the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill which has been sent to us by the Senate. That body is beginning to feel that we are not desirous of dealing with measures sent to us by them, and we should do nothing to encourage that feeling. We should let the Senate understand that we are very wishful to consider such measures. If the Government do not try to conciliate the Senate - I give them this advice in all friendliness-the y may refuse to pass the Appropriation Bill, which would create antagonism between the Houses, and the Government are already in a minority in the Senate inregardto certain matters. The resumption of the consideration of Ways and Means in Committee is another order of the day which might be dealt with. According to the last returns, our revenue is falling month by month, so that it is only a matter of a short time when we shall not be able to return to the States even the three-fourths required to be returned by the Constitution. That is a very serious matter, about which all the present States Treasurers are much concerned, and it will have to be faced at an early date. Government might therefore give us some information as to what they intend to do in regard to it. We might very well postpone the resumption of the consideration of the Estimates until next week, when we can make a fair start, and go straight on, and today, in the few hours which are left to us, dispose of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, which we might possibly pass this afternoon. The Treasurer, in moving the postponement of the orders of the day, should have explained to us much more fully the reasons why he made such a motion. I urge him to withdraw it, so that we may proceed with the consideration of the business upon the paper, and I am sure that in making this request I shall be supported by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the right honourable member for Swan. I understand that the right honourable member for Swan desires to get away for a few days, and if the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill is not proceeded with today it will probably be dealt with in his absence. The Government should show some consideration for their supporters. I propose to get into close communication with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, with a view to ascertain the way in which two honourable members can bring about a dissolution.",30
216,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I would ask whether the remark of the honourable member with regard to getting into close communication with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro with a view to bringing about a dissolution is relevant ?,30
217,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The remark to which the right honourable gentleman has raised an objection is not relevant.,30
218,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I shall not give the Prime Minister much further cause for irritation. I desire to enter my most emphatic protest against the postponement of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and I cannot understand why' the right honourable member for Swan does not exert his influence with the Government in order trJ have the Bill disposed of as quickly as possible. The right honourable gentleman accused the members of the Labour Partv of delaying the passing of the measure by bringing, forward a no-confidence motion, but now, when he is in a position to bring pressure to bear upon the Government, he is content to sit silent. I can only come to the conclusion that the right honourable The gentleman is not so sincere as he would have honourable members believe. I am not here to champion the Bill, but am content to continue to play the part of humble follower of the right honourable member for Swan in regard to the measure. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro should press the claims of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. I do not know why he does not use his influence with the Government-to induce fhem to allow the Bill to be taken in its proper order on the notice paper.",30
219,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Because some honourable members started to talk out the Bill.,30
220,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is certainly not fair to suggest that any attempt was made by honourable members on this side of the House to talk out the Bill. I venture to say that if the Bill were proceeded with it would be passed without much difficulty. I can only conclude from the inertness of the right honourable member for Swan, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, that they are not particularly anxious with regard to the measures in which they profess to be so greatly interested.",30
221,Mr WEBSTE R,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I desire to emphasize what has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy with regard to the indifference displayed by some honourable members in reference to the passage of two very important measures. Whilst we are prepared to deal with matters of practical legislation, we find the Treasurer adopting a course which can only have the effect of prolonging a useless debate, and involving serious waste of time. Why did not the Treasurer adopt the course permitted by the Standing Orders of allowing the Estimates to stand over for the present, and thus afford honourable members an opportunity to - proceed with the business on the notice paper in its proper order?",31
222,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"That would shut out Supply, and we should start on Wednesday where we began today, and have another long discussion.",31
223,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Treasurer should be prepared to adopt the course best calculated to facilitate public business and to avoid waste of time. There is no more effective way of wasting time than by continuing a debate of this kind. We could dispose of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill this afternoon, and might also make some progress with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , whereas the Treasurer is quite content that honourable members should continue a useless debate.",31
224,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Are these the high standards of the new national party?,31
225,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We should be promoting the best interests of the country by discussing measures which deal with great national issues. If the Prime Minister will consent to proceed with the measures I have indicated I shall do my best to assist him - in keeping a quorum, and I am satisfied that the honourable member for Barrier will give a similar undertaking. The right honourable member for Swan has complained that the State he represents has not been fairly treated in connection with the Kal goorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill , but, apparently, he has made to induce the Government to push on the measure.",31
226,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Is this the high ideal of the .great Labour Party? Is this their conception of how the public business is to be transacted ? "" Oh ! what a falling-off was there.""",31
227,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The right honourable gentleman cannot expect much from the ""steerage passengers.""",31
228,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not see that much objection can be taken to the attitude of the Labour Party, when they are expressing a desire to proceed with the legitimate business of the country. We are trying to promote the business, whereas the Treasurer has proposed a course which will lead to further delay.",31
229,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I would point out to . the honourable member that the question before the Chair is whether we shall take steps preparatory to resuming the consideration of the Estimates in Committee of Supply, or proceed with the orders of the day as they appear on the notice-paper. That matter has nothing to do with the personal attitude that may be assumed by the Treasurer or other honourable members.",31
230,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I cannot deal with the motion without referring to the mover.,31
231,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,No personal matter can have anything whatever to do with the motion.,31
232,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I am not dealing with a personal matter. I am endeavouring to deal with the right honourable gentleman who is representing the Government.,31
233,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Will the honourable gentleman resume his seat? The question before us is whether we shall proceed with the motion preparatory to considering the Estimates or deal with the orders of the day.,31
234,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I am endeavouring to argue that we should go on with the orders of the day.,31
235,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member will be quite in order if he does that.,31
236,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member is hardly a success as a humorist.,31
237,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not claim to be. I do not regard this as a place for humorists, but as one in which we should give our serious attention to the business of the country. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill is of great importance, and as a"" supporter of it, I desire to see it passed. Then there is the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill , which is urgently needed, and should be no effort disposed of as soon as possible.",31
238,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I trust that the Treasurer will not press this motion to a division today. I think that it would be a pity to postpone the orders, of the day :",31
239,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Why not take a vote upon it in order to ascertain the wish of the House ?,32
240,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"To my mind, the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill is one of very great importance.",32
241,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That is right. The honourable member continues to maintain the high ideals of his party.,32
242,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not see that the Prime Minister can expect much from "" steerage passengers.""",32
243,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I would remind the honourable member that "" steerage passengers "" have nothing whatever to do with the question that is before the House.",32
244,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Personally , I have always supported the proposal to authorize a survey of the projected transcontinental railway. I am very glad to see that the right honourable member for Swan is present. I know that he is intensely anxious to see that work carried out. I understand that if the Bill to which I have referred were proceeded with this afternoon it would meet with no opposition from honourable members upon this side of the House. If the Government will consent to the adoption of that course I am prepared to remain in Melbourneinstead of leaving for Adelaide this afternoon-for the purpose of assisting to maintain a quorum. I am prepared to stay here until midnight, or even later, if necessary.",32
245,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Has the honourable member reformed ?,32
246,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I understand that the people of Western Australia earnestly desire the construction of this railway. claim that we ought to do all in our power to satisfy the citizens of that State, who have already expressed approval of our actions in this connection. The honourable member for Kennedy has expressed the opinion that the Government should afford the House an opportunity to proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Personally, I think that it would be too much to ask the Prime Minister to devote more time to the discussion of that measure, in view of his own utterances upon it. There is one other reason why I should like to see a division upon the motion submitted by the Treasurer deferred until Tuesday next. As honourable members are aware, the honourable member for Darling, who is one of the most regular attendants in this Chamber, is absent today. He was not present at the count-out which occurred upon Wednesday evening,' and I think that he should be afforded an opportunity of stating why he was absent.",32
247,Mr STORRER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I intend to support the proposal of the Treasurer, to enable the business which has lapsed to be restored to the paper. In my judgment, it is essential that we should deal with financial matters before proceeding with any other business. Seeing that the consideration of the Estimates lapsed as the result of an accident, and not of design, it would be only an act of grace upon our part to allow the business to be reinstated as soon as possible. If the leader of the Opposition chooses to submit a direct no-confidence motion, it can be dealt with in the ordinary way; but I object to any unnecessary waste of time when we should be engaged in the transaction of public business.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.  cept the laudable advice given by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. After the incident which occurred on Wednesday night last, I decided to take no further part in the discussion of the Estimates. If only sometwenty-three honourable members were to be left to deal with them, I failed to see why I should sit here hour after hour, dealing with item after item in the Estimates, whilst most honourable members were away enjoying themselves. view of the advice which has been given by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I "" intend to fight the Ministry at every turn. I do not mean to suggest that I shall take any dishonourable advantage, or do anything mean or contemptible, but I shall certainly fight them fairly and squarely.",32
248,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Hear , hear ! not from behind a hedge.  sons which may be briefly stated. The Prime Minister has said again and again, both inside the House and out of it, that he intends from this time forward to throw himself in the path of the Labour Party. I have heard States Premiers make the same assertion, and every one of them has come to grief.",33
249,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Le t us hope that the Prime Minister, too, will come to grief.  tain. I can assure the right honourable gentleman that he has decided to take up the hardest job he has ever tackled, but from what I know of him, I feel satisfied that he will give us a ""square go."" I shall certainly treat him fairly, and I believe I may say that that is the intention of every member of our party. . I would sooner see halfa-dozen resolute straight-out labour men than twenty-six ""shandy-gaff"" politicians on our side.

When member to proceed. the honourable member for Wentworth was complaining that we had taken advantage told no lies. of the Government, I interjected that he had done the same with the late Government. The Watson Government, on the occasion he did. in question, were placed in one of the most humiliating positions that any Ministry could cfccupy. They found themselves in the But in same position as the Reid-MCLean Equal-inall-Things Government are in today. The honourable member for Wentworth said, however, that my statement was absolutely incorrect. I am not in the habit of telling lies:",33

253,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I merely stated that the honourable member's assertion was incorrect.  and heard. On the occasion to which I refer I saw the honourable member for Wentworth approach the honourable and learned member for Corio, and he spoke so loudly that I could not help hearing him advise him to move that progress be reported.",33
254,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I told the House that an hour ago  says that I was absolutely incorrect.,33
255,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The inference drawn by the honourable member was not justifiable.  and learned member for Corio to say whether my statement is true.,33
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I rise to a point of order. The statement to which the honourable member refers was made in connection with another debate, and I submit that he should confine himself to the motion immediately before the Chair.",33
257,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"When , in the course of a debate, a remark has been made by one honourable member, it is hardly possible that honourable members, speaking subsequently, refrain from referring to it. I think that these remarks, made on both sides of the are Chamber, in reference to past debates, and casting reflections upon the previous actions of honourable members, are very undesirable; .but after what has - taken place, I cannot is rule the honourable member out of order.  honourable member for Parramatta should take exception to my attempt to set mvself right in the eves of the House.",33
258,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I ask the honourable ,33
259,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I assure the ' honourable member that I did not intend to infer that  ber's assurance. I wish now to refer to the count-out which took place on Wednesday night. When I called for a division, I had no desire to place the Government in an awkward position. Honourable members are aware that throughout the consideration of the Estimates I have been fighting an principle against the granting of increases, which, in my opinion, are too high, and that the call for a division was made on an amendment to reduce a certain item. Had I known that there was not a quorum, I certainly should not have pressed it. As it was I tried to withdraw my call, for I had no wish to place the Government in an unenviable position. I intend to fight them, as I have said, at every turn, but always in an honourable way. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said this morning that we could soon send the Government to the country if we fought them properly under the Standing Orders. I have since been looking through the Standing Orders, and I intend to adopt his suggestion. I tell the House frankly that I do not desire to go to the country-no t because I fear that I might lose my seat, but because I do not care about the prospect of travelling for four months throughout the length and breadth of Western Queensland.",33
260,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"There is no justification for a dissolution.  honourable member. I think that there is some need for a dissolution. Let us look for a moment at the position which the Government occupy today. Let me remind honourable members of the humiliating position in which the honourable member for Wilmot placed not only the Government, but the Opposition when he said that he held both parties in the hollow of his hand. The Prime Minister is not the man I take him to be, if he tolerates such a position. I am under the impression that he will yet tell the honourable member when he makes one of his wild, mad statements",34
261,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The honourable member must not say that an honourable member makes mad statements.  ""mad."" It seems to me that the Prime Minister will yet give a decisive answer to the honourable member when he again makes one of his wild statements to the effect that he holds the two parties in the hollow of his hand. Where was the honourable member for Wilmot that he did not attend on Wednesday night, and save the Government of which he thinks so much ? The Prime Minister treats the matter in a jocular way; but from what I know of him, I do not think he is pleased with the position of his Ministry. If we are to take any notice of the statement made this morning by the honourable member for Eden Monaro, his majority has disappeared. That - honourable member said that if this guerilla warfare were carried on. to such an extent as to prevent the transaction of public business-if it were shown, after every constitutional means to transact business had been exhausted, that only a dissolution would right the Parliament-h e would support our efforts to bring about that result. He is not anxious that we should go to the country, but if we continue to fight the Government, and make it impossible for them to transact the business of the country, he will assist us in forcing on a dissolution. In view of that statement, it must be seen that the Government majority has disappeared. If the honourable member means what he says-and I believe that he does-h e will shortly have an opportunity to carry out his promise. I shall fight the Government in every constitutional way.",34
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"What for? What have they done?  done., but what they have not done. It seems to me that they would do a great deal more if it were not for the protectionist members of the Cabinet. I was sorry to hear the honourable member for Barrier read the names of those who were present when the count-out took place. I do not think he acted wisely in doing so, and I think it is still more regrettable that the honourable member for Kennedy should have read out the list of those who were absent. I feel assured that no one is more sorry than he is for his action in that respect. He must recognise that he has done an injustice to many honourable members. No one is more regular in his attendance than is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who was one of the absentees. He is here from the time the House meets until it adjourns; and naturally an honourable member feels very keenly a complaint that he was away from the House in such circumstances.",34
263,Mr MAHON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Especiall y when he was at Government House.  where he pleases. The honourable members for Lang, Eden-Monaro, Oxley, and Illawarra, who were absent last Wednesday, are most regular in their attendance, do not think that the honourable member for Kennedy acted altogether squarely in readthat ing out the list. I am sure that the honordebate able member for Kennedy is sorry for what he has said, because, while he is a borri fighter, he likes to do the square thing. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It Christianity.  must stick to our own party. what half-a-dozen determined men have been able to do at various times in British history, and, similarly, a determined body, though small, may do a good deal here. If half-a-dozen of us stick together we make things very unpleasant for the Goit. vernment. While I am a novice, I have cere a good deal of knowledge which I intend put to profit. Although the Government have declared their opposition to the Labour Party and to Socialism, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has warned them that that declaration will not be ficient to maintain them in office, and they must come down with a progressive policy.",34
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The member would not support them if they did.  policy before the electors, so that we fight them there. The more the Government abuse us, the better we like it. be of no use to tell the people of my disan trict that I do not believe in the marriage tie, or in Christianity, or that I wish confiscate property",35
265,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Has this anything to do with the question before the Chair ?  duct of business by the Government.,35
266,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not consider that the motion - gives opportunity for the cussion of the policy of the Government.  declare themselves to be anti-socialistic, request for Supply is in itself a socialas istic proposal. However, I do not wish detain honourable members longer now, though, if I liked, I could speak for hours on the motion. I merely wish to put myself right with regard to the diviupon sion taken on Wednesday night. I do not ask for consideration, and I am going show none to the Government. From this time out I shall take the advice of honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and, while keeping within the Standing Orders, and I fight the Government at every turn.",35
267,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I regret the Government have forced us into a of this character by their postponement of the orders of the day; but, as they are responsible for the conduct of the business of the House, I have no alternative is bad but to continue, it. One or two contributions to the discussion have been very encouraging to those on this side of the House. We know For instance, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro told us what effect the exercise of our powers would have upon the Government if we realized them. It is not often that a supporter of a Government can gives such advice to those who are opposing I do not think he was altogether sinin his loud protestations that we should to go on with the business of the country. I think his speech savoured largely of braggadocio and bluff. He apparently wishes his constituents to believe that we are enacting a farce, but at the same time he tells sufus that two members of the Opposition, if that they liked to use their powers under the Standing Orders, could absolutely prevent the Government from doing business. The honourable Government may well be suspicious of a supporter who teaches their enemies what ammunition to employ, and how to load and fire the guns to be used against them. can I credit him with being a past-master in the arts of upsetting a Government without It would striking a direct blow. He is undoubtedly artist in secret manipulation. No doubt, if we knew more, we should find him at the to bottom of many things which now puzzle us. The Prime Minister has told us that he will allow us to go to our masters when the rolls are ready. They will be ready, no doubt, when the Government can no hang on to the Treasury benches, or think that the Opposition can be taken at a disadvantage. We have a right to say, dishowever, "" There shall be a dissolution, not at your time, but at our time."" Having been told our powers, we should say the to the Prime Minister, ""We shall not act you wish, but shall obey the mandate to of the people who sent us here, and who wish for the restoration of responsible gosome vernment."" Have we responsible government now, when the Ministry have to rely the Opposition to help them to carryon the business of the House ? The late Sir to Henry Parkes would long since have put an end to such responsible gpvernment as the that. Although the Prime Minister and those associated with him complain of the tactics which we are adopting, when he was in opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, and the Government of the day was hanging on to office with a majority of one vote, it had to meet one motion of censure after another, and was subjected to long and harassing speeches from him and his supporters.",35
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Does .that make the present action of the honourable member right?,36
269,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If the honourable member were on this side of the House he would be one of the most caustic critics and persistent opponents of honourable members opposite, and would do everything he could to bring about their defeat.",36
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Anothe r misrepresentation.,36
271,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The honourable member is ill at ease, because he cannot fight with those weapons which he has been accustomed to wield with such terrific force in times gone by. He is muzzled, gagged, and leg-ironed, and I often feel the greatest pity for him.",36
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I shall go on if the honourable member will sit down.,36
273,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I shall not allow the honourable member to dictate to me as to the course I shall pursue. I am not here at his behest, nor at that of any other honourable member, but because my constituents thought that I was qualifier! to represent them. I intend to prove before I leave this Parliament that their confidence in me.is well placed. The fact that the House has been counted out on two occasions since the Government has been in office does not reflect any credit upon them. I have been very regular in my attendance, and I have not even paired, except for halfan-hour on one occasion.",36
274,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member has been away.,36
275,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Onl y for one week, during which I was unwell. I have tended here more regularly, and have sat here for longer hours than has .the Minister of Home Affairs. I do not like the system of pairing, because I believe that it is largely responsible for the very small attendances we have here. From twenty to thirty members sometimes pair off, and go to their homes, and leave others to carry on the business, The Prime Minister claims that his Government, and those who are associated with him, have done more than has any previous Administration during the present session. But I would ask, what has been done? The Prime Minister has merely picked up a few windfalls which were left by his predecessors, and has practically nothing to show for himself. The right honourable gentleman has not yet succeeded in passing even the Papua Bill. The Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and the Trade Marks Bill still require to have the finishing touches applied to them. The Government picked up the Arbitration Bill, and did not even stop to remedy what they conceived to be its defects, but left that work for the Senate. It is farcical for the Government to talk about having achieved anything beyond that which has been done by their predecessors. We have heard something with regard to honourable members being driven to their constituents.",36
276,Mr WILSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That is a painful subject.,36
277,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I know it must be painful to the honourable member, and it is not particularly attractive to me. I do not fear to face my constituents, but I do not regard with pleasant anticipations the necessity for conducting another campaign.",36
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Has not the honourable member saved sufficient money to enable him to defray his expenses?,36
279,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If I have to wait until I can save sufficient money to contest an election out of my allowance of ,£400 a year, I shall never face my constituents.",36
280,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Will 'the honourable member discuss the question before the Chair.,36
281,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I - do not wish to ramble any further. If the Government are prepared to go to the country, honourable members on this side are perfectly readv. The Prime Minister has indicated that the electoral rolls in the various States are so far on the way to completion that they atshould be ready for use within another month. This Parliament has outlived its usefulness. The Labour Government were shaping well until they were practically sand-bagged out of existence. I do not propose to adopt similar methods in dealing with the present Government-to attack them from behind. I intend to fight them legitimately, in order, if possible, to secure an appeal to the people.",36
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Does the honourable member describe last Wednesday's proceedings as a frontal attack? 5 Mr WEU'STER - The attack made upon the Government last Wednesday was absolutely justifiable. We could not be blamed for taking advantage of the enemy when they were in small force. The responsibility for keeping a House rests with the Government, and not with the Opposition, and yet upon the occasion referred to there were twelve members of the Opposition present, as contrasted with eleven members on the Government Side. That should clearlv indicate to the country that the Government are not attending to their duties, and that they cannot rely even upon their own followers. Honourable members appear to have been unable to resist the temptation to leave this House, and take part in a social gathering. In the House of Commons the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition rarely leave their seats while the House is sitting, because they regard it as their duty to be on hand continuously, in order that they may give information or - advice as required. In this Parliament, however, neither the leader of the Government nor the leader of the Opposition seems to fully recognise the obligations which rest upon him in that regard. If the leaders are not present, how can the rank and file be expected to remain?",36
283,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We shall appoint the honourable member as leader, and ihen we shall have a model.",37
284,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I must compliment the honourable member for North Sydney upon the facility with which he is adopting the practice of his leader, and substituting personalities for argument. There are two leaders of the Government-tw o Ministers with co-ordinate powers-and yet at times we cannot secure the attendance of one of them. AVe have been told by the Prime Minister that when the time is ripe, when the electoral rolls have been put in order, honourable members will be sent before their masters. I deeply sympathize with the position of the right honourable gentleman because I know that he does not desire a dissolution. He has attained to his present position, and has no wish to relinquish it. I do not desire him to vacate his present office so long as he is prepared to lead his party, and to avoid repeated counts-out. What has produced this discussion today ? The count-out. I am sure that the Treasurer is anxious that we should deal with the troublesome question of the finances - Sir GEORGE TURNER - I am anxious to know what we are fighting about. Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supply.",37
285,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I did not wish to fight this morning. I asked the Treasurer not to compel me to do so. However, he "" sooled '' me on",37
286,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Does the honourable member acknowledge that he is a dog?,37
287,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If I were, I trust that I should be more faithful than are some of the fight honourable gentleman's followers. However, I do not wish to be drawn into any canine discussion. I am dealing with men, and not with dogs. The Treasurer desires to know what we are quarrelling about. Let me tell him that the members of the Opposition are anxious that an appeal shall be made to the country, because we recognise that no business can be transacted by this House. Personally, - I object to drawing my parliamentary allowance when I cannot earn it. I_know that that feeling would not get upon the nerves of the honourable member for Wentworth",37
288,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I rise to a point of order. 1 desire to ask whether the nerves of an honourable member have anything to do with the question before the Chair.,37
289,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I recognise that if interjections were less frequent the speeches of honourable members would be very much less prolonged; but I do not see that the honourable member is out of order.,37
290,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Wit h me it is not a question' of nerves, but of duty. The Government claim to have a majority, but of what is it constituted? Did ever the leader of a Government continue to hold office under such humiliating circumstances as does the present Prime Minister? When r the recent no-confidence motion was under discussion it will be recollected that the right honourable gentleman was informed by one honourable member that he held the balance of power, and could send him about his business whenever he felt disposed to do so. I am aware that subsequently the Prime Minister made some reference to the mental equilibrium of the honourable member in question, but that was a mere afterthought. Personally, I do not think that the honourable member for Wilmot deserved the castigation which the Prime Minister afterwards administered. The Prime Minister's remarks upon that occasion indicated that the Government were saved from defeat by the vote of a gentleman who is not altogether responsible for his actions. I would further point out that the honourable member for Moira would'probably have prevented the count-out on Wednesdav night if he had not been so severely admonished by the Prime Minister for his remarks upon a previous occasion. I can well imagine how brilliantly the present Prime Minister would attack any other individual who persisted in holding office under similar circumstances. But it is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has proved the kindest friend of the members of the Opposition. He has informed us how we can blow the Government to atoms, 7 and regain possession of the Treasury benches within a fortnight. It may not be long before he will occupy a seat upon this side of the House. We must recollect that the Manufactures Encouragement Bil l has yet to be considered, and that he has staked his political existence upon it. It is a great honour to be intrusted' with the charge of such a measure, when the Government themselves are afraid to shoulder the responsibility of passing it. In supporting the Ministry until that Bill has been carried the wisdom of the serpent is almost exemplified in the honourable member. The Opposition are justified in taking up the attitude which they have adopted.",37
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What is that attitude?,38
292,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We are justified in preventing the Government from wasting the time of the country. I admit that that 'was not our attitude this morning. In the interval, however, a great change has come over the scene, so that what constituted a 'waste of time this morning has now become a sacred duty to the people. As an Opposition we are justified in doing all that we can to regain a position which we never should have lost-to get back to the Treasury benches by fair and honest means. We shall countenance no "" sand-bagging "" in our efforts in that direction. We wish to regain possession of the Treasury benches, because we feel that the best interests of the people will not be served by a continuance of the present Government in power. It has been painful to watch the sufferings of the honourable member for Lang since the Government have been, so to speak, on the gridiron. He has indicated time after time that in his opinion the Opposition are actuated by a desire to obtain possession of the Treasury benches, and that he is prepared to do his utmost to keep the Government in power, although they gained office by - methods which we should not adopt. As one of the privates in the ranks of the 'Labour Party, I am prepared to keep step 5 with my regiment, to carry my gun as well as I can, and to shoot as straight as possible at the party we intend to bring down.",38
293,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,After the honourable member has learned to shoot>,38
294,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Possibly , after I have received a little instruction from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, my right honourable friend will find a great improvement in my sighting and in my judging of the wind when next I pull the trigger.",38
295,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Do not forget the. national ideal.,38
296,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The national ideal of the Labour Party is the restoration of responsible government.,38
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It looks today as if it were that of degrading the Parliament.,38
298,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"We cannot say that we have anything in the shape of responsible government at the present time. Never was responsible government in such a sorry plight as it has been since the present Ministry took office. The right honourable gentleman says that there are two reasons why he does not seek a dissolution-that he is waiting for the compilation of the rolls, and secondly that he has a majority.",38
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"There is only one consolation, .and that is that the Opposition are sorry that the Government are in power.",38
300,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The Opposition are not whining.,38
301,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What are we to call this?,38
302,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Our attitude does not fit in with the position taken up by the Prime Minister when he finds himself in a difficult position. In such an emergency he seldom takes the whip in hand; he takes care to stroke the f u r clown the right way. There is no whining when the right honourable member is seeking to maintain his majority.,38
303,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It is then a case of cringing.,38
304,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If I were to use the word that would most fitly describe the right honourable member's attitude in such circumstances, it might be considered unparliamentary, and as a recruit I desire to keep within the rules of debate. I hold that we are taking up a justifiable position. We call upon the Government to proceed with important matters"" with which they refuse to deal. Every supporter of the Government must accept the responsi1 bility for what has taken place as the result of the count-out on Wednesday last. It is the duty of the Government to keep a House, and the people will have a right to inquire of their representatives why they have been counted out on two occasions within a short period. The people will have a right to say to every one of them, ""Were you absent? Were you attending to the business of the country or seeking your own personal pleasure ?"" Such questions have never to be put to members of the Labour Party. We are always on deck. It was only because two or three of us decided that whilst it was not unreasonable to expect us to do a little deckwork, we should not be asked to always remain at the wheel, doing the lion's share of the work",38
305,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Whil e the captain was not on the bridge.,39
306,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The absence of the captain from the bridge has led vernment ship being brought into, close contact with some of the submerged the political sea. The Government have no right to remain in office unless they can so war. control their supporters as to be able to conduct the business of the 'House.",39
307,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Can the honourable ber's leader control him ?,39
308,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He has always been do this able to control me.,39
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He has had to vote against the honourable member today.,39
310,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The leader of the Opposition has his own peculiar way of fightone. ing. We are not cast in the same mould, and it is unreasonable to expect that we should adopt the same methods; but the House may rest assured that the members of the Labour Party are firing in the same direction. Every one of us is seeking on the bull's-eye'",39
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Does that mean that the leader of the Opposition is playing same game as the honourable member is today ?,39
312,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I mean to say that, although the leader of the Opposition take up a different position, we we'll understand each other. The Prime Minister his subordinate followers do not understand the arithmetic of our party discipline; but we know exactly what we have to do as that question. privates in the ranks. We are doing our House, are free. duty, and if the honourable member wishes to understand our code-if he wishes to or to go out. have an insight into our scheme of discipline, he had better join the party.",39
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I only wished to have know whether the leader of the Opposition was in this game. It seems that he is.,39
314,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable memby ber cannot induce me to draw across the throat of my leader the political razor that I have unsheathed for the Government. I shall fight the Government legitimately on every possible occasion. It is just as well that they should know what are our - intentions. 'We intend to fight on constitutional lines.,39
315,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Does that mean that the Opposition will endeavour to block business ?,39
316,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not say that. We shall avail ourselves of every legitimate opportunity to criticise the business brought forward by the Government. If they do not deal with it in such a way as to meet our requirements, we shall block it .",39
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That is the plan of to the Gocampaign agreed upon.,39

Unlike the Government camp f o l lowers, they are not bound in ropes.

325,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Is the honourable' and member discussing the question?,39
326,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I think I am. I take it, sir, that we shall have to deal with We, on this side of the My leader does not tell me to sit down, to stand up, to come in ,",39
327,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I cannot see what relation the honourable member's remarks to the question before the Chair. Will he confine himself to the question?,39
328,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Honourable members, . their interjections, are continually drawing me off the track. A Government which is kept in office by a servile majority cannot conduct the business of the country.",39
329,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member has no right to say that the Government majority is a servile one.,40
330,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Then I shall speak of it as a slavish majority.,40
331,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member may describe any section of the House by any term that is well within the practice of Parliament; but he knows very well that it is not parliamentary to speak of any section of the House as a servile or slavish majority.,40
332,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I will not use those words if they are out of order, though it is difficult at times to know where to draw the line. I sympathize with the position of the Government whip, who is responsible for the two days' waste of time which we have had. The Government which he supports, however, is prepared to remain in office, no matter how humiliating the circumstances. If we have to go to the country, let us go quickly. Five or six months will not make a material difference to the position. In that time the average Member of Parliament, no matter how economical, cannot save more than £ 2 5 or £ 3 0 , and, therefore, at the end of it, would not be much better off than he is now. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has suggested that the Treasurer should ask for three months' supply, in order to give time for the completion of the rolls, and that then there should be an immediate appeal to our masters. The honourable member knows something about politics. He has the wisdom of Solomon in regard to political manoeuvring and tactics, and if the Prime Minister will adopt his advice, I shall sit down at once, and not say anything more until the elections are over. Surely, as a supporter,' his advice should be sound and acceptable. The honourable member tells us that his object is to faithfully represent those who sent him here, and that he will not go on with the farce of the Government trying to control the House without a majority, or with a majority which is ineffective.",40
333,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I did anything of the kind.,40
334,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I cannot repeat the honourable member's actual words, because it is some time since he spoke, and the interruption of the debate under the Standing Orders made it impossible for me to f o llow him at once. He declared these proceedings to be a farce.",40
335,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He said that the indignation of the Opposition is a sham.,40
336,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"At any rate, his advice was sound, and was, no doubt, given with the best intentions. I am resolved to use every weapon which is fair-leavin g sandbags on one side-and every method which is honourable, to bring about the restoration to the Opposition of the power which was taken from them, honourable members know how discreditably. We shall not allow a Government which has declared that it intends to throw itself across the path of labour to remain in office very long. If the Prime Minister threw himself across die path of labour, no one coming into contact with him would hurt himself very much, because there would be no corners to catch on. But I warn him that the labour coach is a very heavy one, and that the men on board earnestly desire to arrive quickly at their destination, so that if he takes any such action, it will be the end of him politically. The Labour Party are prepared to remove all obstacles from their track that they may secure good government. They understand the wishes and the needs of the. men at the bottom of the ladder, and know their sufferings, because they have been there themselves, while, at the same time, they respect the members of every other'class according to their merits. We intend to do justice to all, making an exception of none, and having determined to adopt a course, we shall keep a tight rein, and drive straight ahead to our goal, having behind us, not a doubtful, but a permanent majority, so that our work may be of lasting benefit to the people of the country, and secure their respect.",40
337,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," It must, I am sure, be patent to the Government",40
338,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,That the intention is to waste time.,40
339,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Is the Minister of Home Affairs in order in charging the honourable member for Fremantle with wasting time?,40
340,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If the Minister had accused the honourable member for Frenot say mantle of wasting time, he would not be in order; but I understood his remark to apply generally.",40
341,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I was about to refer to the action of the Government, and I was much surprised at the ready acquiescence of the Minister. What I was about to say was that it must be patent by this time that the Government have not that control of the business of the House which a Government shouicl have. This is the second occasion during the term of the present Ministry upon which a count-out has occurred. Such an event always reflects discredit upon the Government. On the first occasion the Prime Minister, in his Ibluff and hearty style, merely chuckled and laughed, as if the matter were of no importance. He merely said that the countout was due to a trick of the Labour Party, and that if they intended to interrupt the course of business in that way, he would pay them back in their own coin. He assured the House, however, that such a thing would not happen again. In spite of his boast, however, another count-out has occurred, and it would appear that his followers have not sufficient respect for him to attend here and assist in keeping a House. We were told that some Ministers and their followers were absent on Wednesday evening, because they desired to attend an important social function.",40
342,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Some of the members of the Opposition were also at that social function.,41
343,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I am speaking of the Government, who are responsible for keeping a House. The country has a right to expect Ministers to give the proceedings of this House preference even over important social functions. I do not know whether the Prime Minister finds it necessary for the good of his health to attend social functions. I have never seen him at a ball.",41
344,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I could say the same thing of the honourable member.,41
345,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have, however, seen pictures of him arrayed in what was' called a ball dress.",41
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I should like to ask you, .sir, whether this is in order ?",41
347,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member is discussing the reasons for the countout on Wednesday evening.,41
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He is discussing the dress of the Prime Minister.,41
349,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Order ! The question of good taste has nothing to do with order. The remarks of the honourable member may be quite contrary to good taste, but they are certainly not out of order.",41
350,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not wish to transgress even the rules of good taste. I am quite sure that the Prime Minister has been so much discussed, both with dress and without it, that personally he does not object to a little raillery, particularly as he is so fond of using that weapon himself.",41
351,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not object to that, so long as the honourable member does, not take up the public time.",41
352,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,If the right honourable gentleman objects I shall not say any more.,41
353,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I should not object if the honourable member were merely occupying my time.,41
354,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"When the Prime Minister finds it necessary to attend social functions, some arrangement should be made for avoiding a conflict with his duty as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. His first duty is to be here.",41
355,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Shoul d our conduct of a week ago set honourable members off the track of public duty now?,41
356,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Three Ministers were absent on Wednesday evening, and therefore the offence of the Government was all the more serious. If the Prime Minister found it necessary to absent himself from the House because he regarded an invitation to a. ball' as equivalent to a command, he should have endeavoured to make some arrangement with the leader of the Opposition.",41
357,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The leader of the Opposition would have been powerless on Wednesday evening.,41
358,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not think that the ""Prune Minister can say that the leader of the Opposition has ever shown anv lack of generosity in his dealings with the Government.",41
359,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,He voted with the Government on the night of the count-out.,41
360,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"If the Prime Minister or any of his colleagues had had enough of the saving grace of common sense to inform the leader of the Opposition that they found it necessary to be absent, and had asked him to arrange to keep a House, there would have been no count-out. They'left the Government whip to do the best he could, and in spite of all his efforts trouble ensued. I came into the Chamber at the personal request of the honourable member for Dalley to assist in making a House; but I am not sure that my generosity was not misplaced on that occasion.",41
361,Mr WILKS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I presume that the honourable member came into perform his public duty.,41
362,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I am not surprised that the Treasurer should become impatient at the continuation of this debate.,42
363,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I can assure the honourable member that I am becoming very impatient.,42
364,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Treasurer has expressed his dissatisfaction' with the present state of affairs, and I quite expected that his position as a member of the present Government would prove intolerable. No one has greater respect than I have for the right honourable gentleman and the political work he has done, and in common with many other honourable members. I was sorry when he listened' to the seductive voice of the Prime Minister and became a member of the present Administration. He is out of touch with some of his colleagues and supporters, and if he wishes to bring to an end the present unsatisfactory state way is quite open to him. There are honourable members on this side of the House who are quite prepared to join hands with him in doing the work which he has at heart. The sole aim of the Ministry seems to be to placate their opponents by giving them measures in which they do not themselves believe. So long as they pursue that policy they may hang on to office; but as soon as , the Prime Minister attempts to give to those who are heart and soul with him the measures they want, trouble will begin, and the Treasurer will find it impossible to remain any longer in office. Why should he wait for that time? I trust that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the Tieasurer will find some means of bringing over to this side of the House those honourable members who are totally opposed to the principles of others with whom they are now associated. In such an event there will be no repetition of what occurred on Wednesday night. I hope that, irrespective of whether a dissolution occurs or not, Ave shall soon see upon the Treasury bench a Government throughly representative of the people, and in a position to do some good Avork in the public interest.

365,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I think that it Would be unfair to punish a number of .honourable members by attempting to continue the sitting after the usual hour, thereby preventing them from returning to their homes in other States, as they usually do upon Friday. At the same time, I desire to intimate that Ave are not making that progress Will the Estimates which Ave ought to make, and consequently I shall haA'e to request honourable members to sit a little later each evening next Aveek.",42
366,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Le t us haA'e tAvo or three all-night sittings.,42
367,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not desire ' to initiate all-night sittings, because there is nothing gained by them. They merely engender bad temper, and induce honourable members to make statements for which they are aftenvards very sorry. In addition to that they tend to discredit us before the country. But although I have no desire fo indulge in all-night sittings I think that I am justified in asking honor40 able members to devote a little extra time to 3 a discussion of the Estimates, and consequently I suggest that Ave should' sit a little 37 later than usual each eA'eninff next AA'eek.",42
368,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Unti l what time?,43
369,Sir GEORGE TURNER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"That will depend upon the progress which we make each evening. Honourable members are aware that I am not unreasonable. If we make a fair amount of progress I do not desire to sit here until an unreasonably late hour, and there, are strong reasons why I should not do so. If honourable members will assist me to make fair progress with the Estimates they may rest assured that I shall not impose upon their good nature.",43
370,Mr LONSDALE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"New England) If the tactics which have been adopted today by certain members of the Opposition are to be continued, I think that the House should meet in the mornings. Certainly, the Government should adopt some measures which will enable us to transact the business of the country.",43
371,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Why did not the honourable member speak at a previous stage? Was he ""gagged""?",43
372,Mr LONSDALE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I did not speak previously because I had no desire to waste time.,43
373,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member is wasting time now.,43
374,Mr LONSDALE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,In the discussion today there was no fight for a principle involved.,43
375,Mr THOMAS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Was there any fight for a principle involved in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill?,43
376,Mr LONSDALE,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not desire to have anything to say to the honourable membei for Barrier, and I would thank him not to interrupt me. I hope that we shall get on with the business of the country, and in view of what has occurred today I trust that the Government will adopt a firm attitude in the future.",43
377,Mr FISHER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I think that the Committee can get on very well without any lectures from the honourable member for New England. He has charged those who, in their representative capacity today, have adopted a certain attitude, with having fought for no principle. I should like_ to ask whether he had any principle in"" view when he voted to displace the previous Government? For him to lecture the Opposition, and tell the country what he is prepared to do, after the Treasurer has made a conciliatory speech, is calculated to defeat the very object which the right honourable gentleman has in view.",43
378,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I resent the statements of the honourable member for New England, and I object to his charging honourable members with having wasted time. I maintain that there has been no waste of time. The discussion which took place this morning was in the interests of the country generally. . I contend that it will exercise a very good effect in expediting the transaction of public business. I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to act upon the sugges-. tion of the honourable member for New England ?",43
379,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,What suggestion is that?,43
380,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The suggestion that the right honourable gentleman must stiffen his back,"" otherwise the honourable member for New England will kick over the traces.",43
381,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL," I protest against the remarks of the honourable member for New England, because I do not think the Prime Minister should be told by one supporter after another that he must stiffen his back to expedite the conduct of public business. Personally, I would not allow my worse enemy to be trampled upon, and, therefore, I feel it is my duty to stand up like a Briton and defend the Prime Minister. I hope that no further threats will be made to destroy the Government if the Prime Minister does not become even more petrified, politically speaking, than he is at present. I should like the Government to invite the House to meet at 10.30 a.m. each day, so as to expedite business. - Mr MCDONALD - And sit all night?",43
382,Mr WEBSTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I do not say that. All-night sittings are not conducive to the good temper of the House, or to the expedition of public business. I shall do my best to assist the Treasurer in passing the Estimates, always keeping in mind my duty' as a member of the Opposition, and a representative of the .people. I certainly object to such honourable members as the honourable member for New England attacking their leader. Progress reported. DEFENCE RE-ORGANIZATION SCHEME.",43
383,Mr MCCAY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I desire to lay on the table of the House a copy of the proceedings of a Committee appointed by my predecessor, Senator Dawson, and a minute by him upon the proceedings of the Committee. May I be permitted to say that the document is marked ""strictly confidential and unofficial,"" and therefore was not laid on the table yesterday together with the report of the General Officer Commanding upon it. I have since seen Senator Dawson, and it is his desire that it should be laid, on the table.",43
384,Mr CROUCH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,To what does the report relate?,44
385,Mr MCCAY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,It is the report of the Committee upon the proposed re-organization scheme. ADJOURNMENT. SUGAR BOUNTY. Motion (by Mr Reid) proposed. That the House do now adjourn.,44
386,Mr FISHER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"- I understood the Prime Minister to say that if any communication were received by him from the Premier of Queensland regarding the sugar bounty question, he would lay it on the table of the House. I am led to believe that such a communication has since been received, and I wish to know whether the right honourable gentleman will be good enough to lay it upon the table? Mr Reid.""-Certainly . Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.13 p.m.",44
