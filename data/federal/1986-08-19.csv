0,NA,HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"NA FIRST SESSION OF THE THIRTY-FOURTH PARLIAMENT Pursuant to the Resolution of the House House of Representatives met on Tuesday, 19 August 1986 Madam SPEAKER (Hon. Joan Child) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA NA",224
1,Madam SPEAKER,AND FORMER SENATOR POYSER,"I inform the House of the deaths, since the House last met, of former Senator S. A. Negus and former Senator A. G. Poyser. Sydney Ambrose Negus died on I August 1986. He represented the State of Western Australia in the Senate from 1971 to 1974. Arthur George Poyser died on 5 August 1986. He represented the State of Victoria from 1966 to 1975. As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having risen in their places",224
2,Madam SPEAKER,AND FORMER SENATOR POYSER,I thank the House. NA NA,224
3,Madam SPEAKER,SPEECH AND REPLY,"I remind honourable members that, in accordance with the resolution of 5 June, the House has authorised the televising of portions of the proceedings relating to Budget Speech of the Treasurer tonight and the Speech of the Leader of the Opposition on Thursday at 8 pm. NA Hansard 1986 (FOURTH PERIOD) of Representatives passed on 5 June 1986, the Tuesday, 19 August 1986, at 2 p.m. NA NA",224
4,Mr HOWARD,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I refer the Prime Minister to his wartime invocations and the generally alarming picture he now paints about the state of the Australian economy. I ask the honourable gentleman: Why was the Government's detailed submission to the 1986 national wage case virtually silent on the terms of trade crisis? Why did the Treasurer's major address to the Economic Planning Advisory Council in May express no concern about our terms of trade? Why did the Treasurer say only three months ago that the Australian economy was entirely robust and entirely healthy despite the then record high interest rates, very high inflation and major balance of payments troubles? Is the Prime Minister willing to offer the Australian public some apology and explanation for the appalling deception that he and his colleagues have practised for at least the past 12 months?",224
5,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition. I assert that, in respect of the submissions to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the other occasions encompassed in the honour the able gentleman's question, the Government and the Treasurer properly and with responsibility made the position of the Government quite clear. I am indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for giving me at the outset of the resumption of this session of the Parliament the opportunity to contrast the responsible position of this Government with that of the Opposition. Opposition members-Ha, hal",224
6,Mr HAWKE,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Honourable members opposite may laugh but they will not laugh when I have finished. This Government has a proper concern for the welfare of this community and does not seek in any way to obtain political advantage from the economic misfortune that has visited upon this country. I contrast that attitude of this Government with the position of the Opposition, including particularly the Leader of the Opposition and other members of his party. I refer simply to two examples of the total irresponsibility of the Liberal Party in this country. I refer first of all to the now infamous interview with the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Financial Review in which he said: 'The times will suit me'. He looked at the deteriorating economic situation, and his words were: 'The times will suit me'. He looks with eagerness to a deteriorating economic situation imposed upon his fellow countrymen by external circumstances. Perhaps the position of the Liberal Party, which the honourable gentleman leads, is best encapsulated by a letter which I wish to read to the House from a member of the Liberal Party, the honourable gentleman's Party, in Western Australia. I do not believe that members of the Australian community will be able to believe the truth of this, but I want it read fully into the record of this House so that the people of Australia will understand just where the Liberal Party puts the interests of this country. This letter was written by Mr Lightfoot, a Liberal member of the Western Australian Parliament, to George Shultz, the United States Secretary of State. He wrote: Dear Sir, May I urge you to stand fast on the proposed wheat sales to China and Russia. Your actions will have a detrimental trade effect on the two socialist Governments of my nation and New Zealand that those respective Administrations would have difficulty recovering from. He was saying that the United States should impose the greatest burden that it possibly can on the people of Australia. He went on: Were you to capitulate now, the effect would be twofold. It gets rather interesting now. The letter continues: Firstly, you will enhance the tarnished image of our Prime Minister Hawke and restore his previously held omnipotence, and that would not be in the interests of free peoples in this hemisphere. Hawke would be written up in the Australian media as the man who coerced you and your president into changing your mind-and that leads into the second effect-it would further entrench the socialist system and may deny the conservative parties the right to govern in 1988-89 because of the arresting of the decline in the Australian dollar and the easing of our balance of payments. No doubt you have already considered the hypothesis here to before outlined. Your decision now, not to go ahead with the sales, would have profound effects on our forming a Government-at the next election. I therefore again urge you to stand fast on your decision. If there has ever been a more treacherous action and treasonable action by a political party in the history of this country I would like to hear it. Here is the Liberal Party deliberately asking the United States Administration to visit upon the farmers of this country a continuing burden, knowing that that will not only adversely affect the rural community of this country but also impose burdens upon the whole of Australia. So that it may enhance its chances of governing in a later period, here is the Liberal Party saying to the United States: 'Punish Australia now, and punish it next year so that that increases our chances of governing'. I compare with pride the responsible attitudes of this Government and of our spokespersons with the miserable and treacherous attitude of the Opposition. NA NA NA",225
7,Ms FATIN,ORGANISATION,Is the Minister for Science aware that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is seriously underrepresented in Western Australia? Is he aware of the concerns that are being expressed in Western Australia that the existing division of ground water research will be transferred from Perth to Canberra? Can he give the House and the Western Australian Government any assurances on this matter?,225
8,Mr BARRY JONES,ORGANISATION,"The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has recently reorganised its water resources research through the formation of a CSIRO Division of Water Resources Research. Western Australian Ministers, particularly the Premier and the Deputy Premier, the West Australian Advisory Committee of the CSIRO and the West Australian-based CSIRO staff have made strong representations for the headquarters of the Division to be located in Perth. Canberra based staff, honourable members will be amazed to learn, have called for the headquarters to be located in the Australian Capital Territory. We are well aware that there is a serious historic under-representation of the CSIRO in Western Australia. The new Division of Water Resources Research will comprise the old Division of Groundwater Research in Perth, the Division of Water and Land Resources in Canberra and the hydrology group of the Division of Soils in Adelaide. About 200 staff are involved in the reorganisation and the Division will be responsible for developing CSIROs role in the nation's water resources research. Incidentally bringing it all together is a cause that the honourable member for Hawker has proposed for many years. Unfortunately, the honourable member is not with us this afternoon, but this move is a striking endorsement of something that he has wanted for so long. The new Division will deal with the maintenance of the quality and quantity of water supplies and the disposal of waste water. It will also work on projects of major national importance with substantial agency or user support. A world wide search for a chief of the new Division is under way and the Division will be established when the chief takes up his perch. I am glad the honourable member for Hawker is now with us. I was just saying that the establishment of the new Division of Water Resources Research is a tribute to a cause that he has pushed for a very long time. The bad news is that it will not be in his electorate; it will, in fact, be established in Perth. That is an earnest of our continuing determination to make sure the organisation is well represented in Perth, and I can assure honourable members that the West Australian Government is delighted by the outcome. NA",225
9,Mr SPENDER,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"Will the Attorney-General, as the Minister responsible for the administration of justice, state whether he endorses the return of Mr Justice Murphy to the High Court of Australia? Will he advise the House whether, since the establishment of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, there have been any changes to the constitutional considerations which led to that establishment and, if so, what they are? Will he inform us of the intentions of Mr Justice Murphy as to sitting on the Court? Will he confirm that it has been the practice of the High Court to sit a bench of seven in cases of public importance, especially constitutional cases, and advise us how this practice can be given effect to as long as the present situation persists?",226
10,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,I think it is a matter of regret that the matters that have now been raised by the honourable member should be in the context of there being something improper about Mr Justice Murphy going back to the Bench. I think it is known that the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry has reported that it has medical evidence that Mr Justice Murphy is suffering from a very serious illness. The prognosis shows very clearly that it is indeed a serious one. That Commission saw fit to say that because of that illness and in recognition of it His Honour would not be able to appear before the Commission-,226
11,Mr SPENDER,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,In Sydney?,226
12,Madam SPEAKER,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,Order! The honourable member has asked his question. He will now await the answer.,226
13,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,I will give the honourable member the answer. He does not like the answer he is getting because it is the truth. I am telling the honourable member what the Parliamentary Commission has established and he is trying to harangue somebody who is suffering grievously-,226
14,Mr HOWARD,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,We are not haranguing him; we are haranguing you.,226
15,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"Yes, you are. The honourable member should not point his finger at me, either. It would have been better if he had kept quiet from the point of view of what we are about in this context. Let us make it very clear indeed that Mr Justice Murphy voluntarily refrained from sitting on the Court.",226
16,Mr SPENDER,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,Which we all endorsed.,226
17,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"Very belatedly. Let us make it very clear that when Mr Justice Murphy was acquitted the honourable member, to his credit, was the first to issue a Press statement saying well, of course, they would not pursue the Murphy matter any further.",226
18,Mr SPENDER,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,That is not the position.,226
19,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"It is the position. The honourable member issued a Press statement on that basis. As a result of some discussions, to which I was not privy, that Mr Justice Murphy had with his colleagues on the High Court, they decided that he would agree to refrain from sitting so that he could give them some explanation. Subsequent to that, surprisingly for us as a government, the justices of the High Court issued a further Press statement saying that they did not really want to discuss that matter. They had discussed it, but they were not discussing it as a court. They merely wanted to know what might be Mr Justice Murphy's explanation. In recent days, I have had the benefit of talking to Mr Justice Murphy and he makes it very clear-",226
20,Mr SINCLAIR,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,Has he given you any information?,227
21,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"I think that he is a very sick person. He makes it very clear that in the discussions he had with his fellow judges there was never any suggestion that he should not sit with them. That is of some surprise to me, in view of other information given to me at the time. This is the important part. There we have the justices of the High Court not objecting to sitting with their brother judge. It was understandable then that he was certainly of such a mind. In view of the fact that he had received this dreadful diagnosis and that he has to think of the welfare of his family and his children and what they might think of their father, what was wrong with the man exercising his discretion to go back to the Bench from which there was no need for him to withdraw? What is wrong with that? The point that we want to emphasise todayI understand, Madam Speaker, that you have some matter to table later-is that we shall be introducing legislation tomorrow to terminate the Commission for reasons that relate directly to the illness and the advice of the Commission itself that it would be impossible to continue. Mr Justice Murphy is now considering six or seven reserve judgments in which he is obliged, naturally, to give his decision. On that basis, I understand that he is now seeking sick leave. That is a matter for the Court itself. In that process of time, it was thought that he would have sufficient time to complete those reserve judgments. Regrettably, it appears that because of the diagnosis and the nature of the illness, he is weakening and therefore may, not be able to resume sittings. I think when the medical evidence has been tabled, as it may, it will be conclusive as to that point. I would only hope, from the point of view of an ordinary human being and a fellow Australian, that there is a remission of his illness. I would hope that there is a chance that his health can be restored and that he can regain his position on the Court. He would then be able to meet any of the accusers that he may have, including those in the Opposition. TOURISTS' VISAS",227
22,Mr BEDDALL,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"Has the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs noted agitation on the part of tourist interests for the provision of visa-free entry to Australia, particularly for holidays, and have there been any developments in this regard?",227
23,Mr HURFORD,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"I have noted that agitation. Given the interest in the visa-free concept, particularly in the tourist industry, the Government has initiated a comprehensive assessment of the costs and benefits of the visa-free arrangement in the Australian context. I point out to the House that just because other countries find visa-free arrangements satisfactory does not mean that they will suit this country; we are in a unique situation in a number of ways. The whole issue is very complex. Further work has been done on this issue since the House last met. That work has addressed itself to the fact that visas do keep undesirable people out of this country, which is a very popular country for people to visit. For a start, over one million people want to come here every year for permanent residency and less than 100,000 places are available. This puts us in a very different situation from, for instance, Japan; there is no desire to any great extent on the part of people from outside Japan for permanent residence there. However, we will look at ways in which we can facilitate the tourist industry. But I ask the House to consider-I will be very pleased to receive any representation that any honourable member wishes to put to me on this issue-the fact that, if and when we do allow any visa-free arrangements of, say, a short term duration for tourists, we will have to be selective. We will have to select countries from which we do not take many permanent residents, countries from which there is not much demand for permanent residence. This will be tough and hard decisions will have to be taken as to the countries we will choose. I thank the honourable member for Rankin for allowing me to bring the House up to date on this matter. However, we will continue to give good service where visas are necessary, which is from everywhere but New Zealand. We aim to give a 48-hour turnaround service. We will look at helping the tourist industry by selectively allowing visa-free arrangements if these are at all possible. NA",227
24,Mr SPENDER,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his recent statement that the making of exgratia payments for Mr Justice Murphy's legal costs could be justified. I ask him to do that and, in so doing, to state the amounts involved and the precise facts and special circumstances said to justify the payments. He should state how the position of Mr Justice Murphy in respect of costs of the court proceedings-I emphasise the word 'court'-differs from the position of other defendants acquitted on criminal charges. He should state what proportion of the costs are to be borne by Mr Justice Murphy and what are the funds available in the trust fund established to help pay his costs. He should also table all the relevant documents.",227
25,Mr HAWKE,MR JUSTICE MURPHY,"It is fascinating to note on the resumption of this Parliament that the Opposition is not only treacherous to the economic interest of this country but also totally lacking in any semblance of decency and good taste. Nevertheless, I will respond to the second question in this area that has been pressed by the Opposition. There are two separate issues relating to the costs incurred by Mr Justice Murphy. That will probably be clear to most members of the House. The first concerns his costs arising out of the conduct of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry established by this Parliament. The second relates to his costs in defending criminal prosecutions. As to the first, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry Act, the Attorney-General has authorised the payment of the Judge's costs relating to the operation of the Commission. He did so following a request from the President and from yourself, Madam Speaker, on 2 June that these costs be met. Under the Act the Attorney-General is required to comply with that request. As yet no accounts have been received. As to the second, the costs of defending the criminal prosecution matters, the Acting Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, said on 1 August, in announcing the Government's decision: . . . the decision of the to initiate proceedings here was expressly made on the basis of special considerations said to be applicable to holders of public office. I conclude by saying that the Government has not yet looked in detail at this matter and has not decided at this stage what the appropriate payment will be. As far as the Government is concerned, that is all that will be said on this matter at this stage. NA",228
26,Mr MAHER,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Why does the Government intend to delete certain analgesics and 45 other preparations from the list of 2,500 pharmaceutical benefits now available on prescription free of charge to pensioners?",228
27,Dr BLEWETT,PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS,"There are three points to be made: First of all the decision was made on health grounds on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee which provides recommendations as to which drugs should go on the essential drug list in this country. Its advice in relation to the 46 formulations we are now discussing was that these were not drugs that could be justified on that essential drug list on grounds of their minor therapeutic effect. That is the first point. The second point that needs to be made in relation to this question is that concern has been expressed on both sides of the House and by medical authorities about the increase in the usage of drugs by pensioners in this country. It has been rising in the last three years by close to 20 per cent a year. If we are to provide free essential drugs to pensioners, certainly the lists have to be looked at in relation to inessential drugs. It will not be possible for any government to go on providing free drugs for pensioners unless those drugs are seen as essential drugs. That is another reason for looking at that particular list. Thirdly, the point needs to be made that nearly all of these drugs are drugs which are obtainable without prescription that is, they are simply across-the-counter drugs which can be bought for $2 and $3 or sometimes from the supermarkets for even less. But the present scheme means that in order for a pensioner to get that drug free he has to go to a doctor and get a consultation at a cost to the taxpayer of some $13. If the drug is then on prescription an extra $2.40 has to be paid as a dispensing fee to the pharmacist. So the taxpayer finishes up paying $16 or $17 for drugs available across the counter for $2 or $3 . Director of Public Prosecutions NA",228
28,Mr CARLTON,AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR,"Can the Treasurer confirm reports that the Reserve Bank of Australia spent in the order of $1 billion during July in support of the plummeting Australian dollar? If so, is he concerned that continued support of this order would result in a serious erosion in the level of our international reserves, currently around $13 billion?",228
29,Mr KEATING,AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR,"The Reserve Bank conducts its daily operations in the foreign exchange markets in the main doing, as it says, smoothing and testing in respect of particular transactions. If indeed there is a very large transaction which threatens to destabilise the rate, sometimes such a transaction is balanced off. Over the course of July the bank did spend considerable funds in the foreign exchange market. I do not think the bank or the Government regards that in any way as any long term solution to what is happening in the exchange markets; hence, the importance of tonight's Budget and the importance the Government places on seeing fundamental change in the structure of economic policy. But again the bank is following its normal role, that is, operating in the foreign exchange market as best and when it sees fit in respect of particular events. Over that period the exchange rate fell dramatically on a couple of days and the bank would be doing less than its task in not engaging in the foreign exchange market at that time. Certainly I concur with the import of the honourable gentleman's question. The Government would not regard simply throwing reserves at the rate as a solution to the exchange rate. NA NA",229
30,Mr STAPLES,INSTITUTIONS,"I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. It relates to the Government's decision to allow full fee overseas students to study in Australian higher education institutions. Does the Government support the establishment of private tertiary institutions, such as the proposed Bond university on the Gold Coast and the proposed development at Yanchep in Western Australia, to market such courses? Will the Government grant the same privilege to Australian students willing to pay a full fee?",229
31,Mr DA WKINS,INSTITUTIONS,"There have been a number of proposals, two quite prominent ones, to establish private universities for full fee paying students. The honourable member will be aware that some time ago the Government announced that it had approved the policy to existing tertiary institutions, that is, the ones funded by the Commonwealth, to admit overseas full fee paying students on the basis of fairly strict guidelines which would ensure that the full cost of providing the places for those overseas students would be met by the fees paid to them. The Government has decided not to extend this arrangement to Australians because the basic reason for providing these new arrangements is to provide an opportunity for essentially the export of education services to students from other countries, particularly those in the region. We have been able to identify a substantial market, particularly within the region, in competition with universities in Britain, United States of America and other places. I would expect that over the years we will see a fairly substantial growth in the number of full fee paying students entering Australia to undertake the courses. However, this has to be done with some sensitivity to ensure that there is a minimum of disruption to the ordinary ongoing work of the institutions themselves. In regard to fully private institutions, the Government does not intend to provide any support to these proposals. We are, however, intending to examine these proposals to ensure again that there is no disruption to the general provision of tertiary education services within Australia. There is one other· point I should make, and that is that as part of the policies announced by myself and the Minister for Education in relation to this matter, we have decided to examine, on a case by case basis, any proposals which involve the development of joint facilities between private and public institutions. If there is an intention of a university or college to get together with some private interests to provide these full fee paying courses for overseas students the Government would want to consider it on the basis of the proposals that are put up to us. TREASURER: PRESS ALLEGATIONS",229
32,Mr REITH,INSTITUTIONS,"I refer the Treasurer to an article in last Sunday's National Times on Sunday in which it is suggested that he sold antique clocks at inflated prices to his friend, the property developer, Mr Warren Anderson, thereby deriving an improper personal benefit. In view of the high responsibilities of his office and the need for total confidence in his integrity, what steps does the Treasurer intend to take to answer these and other allegations contained in the article?",229
33,Mr KEATING,INSTITUTIONS,"I would have thought that even the collection opposite would understand that Australia's economic problems should at this time be paramount in the thoughts of the nation and the Parliament. It is very interesting indeed that the Leader of the Opposition is apparently doing as the commentators are suggesting-taking the sleazy road to power, as the honourable member for Boothby once put it, by having one of his back benchers ask this kind of question. We will let the Australian people be the judges of where their best interests lie in terms of the people who operate the policy within the Government and this Parliament, and whether this Party is more capable of dealing with Australia's problems and more earnest about finding solutions to those problems than the current Opposition. I leave the public to make a judgment about the Leader of the Opposition's tactics, going back to the last session with his colleague from Western Australia, and now this tactic by this character-actually it is the first time. I have ever seen him-who is obviously in league with the desperado sitting opposite. NA NA ",229
34,Mr HOWARD,EMPLOYEES UNION,"Did Barrie give you this one?  member that, while ever he visits my electorate, I am safe. He can bring some of his sleazy mates with him too. He has a wide variety. Does he want to talk about it some more? My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Can the Minister inform the House of the Government's attitude to claims for, among other things, a $60 per week over-award payment and a 36-hour week which are being pursued by the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Unio-?",230
35,Mr WILLIS,EMPLOYEES UNION,"I am aware of the policy of the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union to pursue a 13-point log of claims which includes, as the honourable member said, claims for a $60 a week increase and a 36-hour week. Needless to say, the Government is totally opposed to this log of claims. In present circumstances it is difficult to imagine a more damaging action by any section of the Australian economy than for a union to pursue wage increases of this kind which are blatantly in breach of the accord and of the national wage fixing principles. I have conveyed the Government's strong opposition to this course of action to the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union which, nevertheless, is apparently determined to pursue this course. I have informed the union that if it proceeds the Government will take every step possible to ensure that it does not succeed because, as I have pointed out to the Union, if it were to succeed its action would certainly result in grave damage to this economy, and there would certainly be adverse effects on the exchange rate and interest rates. There would be a much higher level of unemployment if we were to have a wages blow-out in this area, spreading as it inevitably would to other areas of the building industry and then to the rest of the economy. We are determined to resist this claim, and I point out that building industry employers have a strong obligation also to resist it. I have pointed out to employers today that the government's code of conduct, which was established in the builders Labourers Federation case, will apply in relation to the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union claims. Essentially that code of conduct provides that building employers are bound to adhere to awards, industrial agreements and the national wage fixing principles. If they do not adhere to those matters, the government can take action against them to disqualify them from future government contracts. This tactic was used successfully by us in respect of the BLF and I expect that it would be successful if we needed to use it again. I believe that everything must be done to oppose these claims, which are extremely damaging. I regret greatly that the union has seen fit to go ahead with the claims. I note that it is doing so in isolationthat no other union affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, or indeed not affiliated, is pursuing this course. I advise the House that we expect that the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union will fail; the trade union movement of this country will demonstrate that it is a sensible organisation which is prepared to act to ensure the recovery of this nation, to get us out of the difficult circumstance we are in presently; and the accord will continue through difficult times to help this economy to get back to strong economic growth. NA",230
36,Mr MCGAURAN,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,"Will the Attorney-General confirm to the House the Government's intention to abandon the Bill of rights, for the time being at least? Does the government intend SUbmitting the Bill to the Constitutional Commission or any other body for examination and possible recommendation for further action by the Government? Finally, does the Government intend retaining all or most of the present staff of the Human Rights Commission in the new body which will supposedly succeed the Human Rights Commission at the expiration of its term later this year?",230
37,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,"In answer to the honourable gentleman, let me make it very clear that the present Human Rights Commission and its staff were, of course, constituted by the previous Government. I am well aware of the difficulties anybody has in trying to introduce legislation into this House which might encourage better electoral reform in Australia. Of course, it was my hope that the Senate would have been able to deal with the Bill of Rights that was passed by this House last year. In fact, since last year the Senate has debated that Bill for 36t hours, which is the longest debate since Federation, and has got up to clause 3.",230
38,Mr HOWARD,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,I don't think the Senate likes it.,231
39,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,The only reason it does not like it is because it might bring about some electoral reform.,231
40,Mr HOWARD,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,"It is a lousy Bill, Lionel.",231
41,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,"It is not the only lousy thing about the place, is it? Seriously, it is a tragedy to think that legislation passed through the House of Representatives has been deliberately delayed in the Senate for reasons that have nothing to do with the content of the Bill, but for the purpose of delaying its introduction. I accept the fact that the Bill would require introduction and certainly some opportunity to allow it to work before public opinion could accept some of the extraordinary interpretations that have been given to it, particularly by the people opposite. I want to make this point: At the present time the Senate has failed to deal with 27 other Bills that have already been passed by this House. One wonders how we will get the Senate to devote its time to what it is supposed to be doing; that is, reviewing legislation as a House of review. It is becoming a House of delay and obstruction. Having said that, the Bill will not be proceeded with. Something will need to be done about the problems we have in terms of obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mr MCGauran-Forget it.",231
42,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,"The honourable gentleman says 'forget it'. Of course, it was the Fraser Government that ratified the International Covenant. Honourable members opposite now say 'shame'. Mr HawkeYou can forget them too.",231
43,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,"The honourable gentleman says that we can forget them, too. As we are a signatory to that covenant with 79 other nations and we have a responsibility in the international sphere to monitor the position of human rights in Australia, there will need to be a commission that will deal not only with the monitoring aspects of the Covenant but also with the obligations we have in respect of the International Labour Organisation Convention on equal opportunity and the questions of race discrimination and sex discrimination under existing legislation. There will be a restructuring of the Commission. I have set in motion a task force to look at what sorts of people will be needed to assist that Commission. I accept the view that there will be a need for people who are directly related to those responsibilities and they will be fewer in number than is the case with the present Commission. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: WHEAT NA",231
44,Mr CAMPBELL,DUMPING,"My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry, follows what the Prime Minister was talking about concerning the outrageous Lightfoot letter. I ask the Minister: Is it true that, if Mr Lightfoot's exhortation to the American Government leads to a continuation of its policies, not only wheat growers but also cotton, sugar, rice and the soya beans-competing lupin growers will be affected? I further ask whether it is important for the salvation of the Australian industry that we maintain a bipartisan approach to the Americans on this issue of dumping. In that context, would it be important for the honourable member for O'Connor, who has an electorate very largely devoted to wheat growing and who was feigning boredom through the Prime Minister's answer, to dissociate himself from Mr Lightfoot's remarks?",231
45,Mr KERIN,DUMPING,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I concur fully with what the Prime Minister has already said on this. I am quite amazed that the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party or indeed the honourable member for O'Connor has not seen fit to repudiate the statement by one of their conservative colleagues. I guess that it is because they must agree with it. They are prepared to put petty politics ahead of the interests of farmers. Of course, that accords with the Liberal",231
46,Mr HOWARD,DUMPING,Do you repudiate Joan Coxsedge?,231
47,Mr KERIN,DUMPING,"Madam Speaker, could you keep this yabbering thing quiet?",231
48,Madam SPEAKER,DUMPING,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease talking across the table and he will also cease interjecting.,231
49,Mr KERIN,DUMPING,"Lightfoot and big mouth. I would like to comment on the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question because a recent all-party delegation went to Washington with a truly bipartisal1 if not tripartisan approach and we were all there for Australia. I hope that Mr Lightfoot's comments do not represent a change of view, given the seriousness with which we regarded the Dole amendment to the export-import Bill in the United States Senate and the Daschle Bill itself. The initial States subsidisation proposals-the Dole and Daschle proposals-could have cost Australian wheat growers $470m this year on top of the $1 billion that the United States Farm Act has already been calculated to have cost us. I find it difficult to imagine anything more reprehensible than for people in the Opposition parties to be seriously saying that they want to see this continuation of a detrimental trade effect to enhance the Liberal Party's and their own electoral prospects. Already the Leader of the Opposition has said that he is relying on an economic recession for his political salvation. I would simply like to say that, under this Government, honourable members opposite will get neither a recession nor their salvation. The honourable gentleman also asked a question about crops other than wheat. With respect to cotton and rice, one element of the United States farm program-the target export assistance program rather than the export enhancement program-will have an even more insidious and more devastating effect than some of the other measures under its farm program. With respect to sugar I do not think we can point the finger so much at the United States, even though it subsidises sugar production at US 18c a pound and the world price is US6c a pound. But the main cause of the problem in the sugar industry still remains with the European Economic Community where its degree and level of subsidisation are even more pronounced. Of course, I think we all regard with dismay, and I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the National Party and his colleague the honourable member for Hume regard with dismay, the fact that when we came back we had this fire sale proposition to China of sugar at a little bit over US4c a pound. All these things add up to an immense cost to Australian farmers and, as this Government has been trying to make quite clear, Australia's farm problems are very much a part of Australia's economic problem-that is, the problem with out balance of payments-and that is the reason why we have problems with our dollar. All these things are interdependent. I would have thought that all people in this House, when they are abroad and when they are reflecting on international matters, would speak with one voice rather than utter this damnable reprehensible nonsense.

I read a report of this letter in the Australian newspaper yesterday. The article also stated that the writer was not available as he was in Africa and therefore unable to confirm or deny the letter.

That is perfectly wrong. I never have, and I want to make that perfectly plain. There is not a single statement that can be pointed to in support of that assertion. That is the first point. The second is that it was said that I had, to my credit, first issued a Press statement saying that we would not pursue the matter any further. If that is to be understood as referring to general issues concerning Mr Justice Murphy's conduct, that was not correct. If it is to be understood as referring to the specific issues dealt with at the criminal trial, it is. The statement that I issued was directed only to questions based on the specific issues dealt with in the criminal trial, as appears from the statement of 29 April 1986.

86,The Clerk,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows: Graduated family allowances are of important assistance to families with more than one child. All family allowances, whether for one, two, three, or more children, have not kept pace with inflation. There are suggestions that all family allowances should be paid at the one flat rate. This would severely disadvantage families with more than one child. There are also suggestions that the dependent spouse rebate be reduced or removed. This would represent another blow to the family unit. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should: ask the Federal Government to increase the value of existing family allowance payments, and reject any moves to change the payments to a flat rate or to tamper with the spouse rebate; And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Aldred, Mr N. A. Brown, Mr Brumby,  Mr Howe, Mr Barry Jones, Mr Lamb, Mr Langmore, Mr Lloyd, Mr Macphee, Ms Mayer, Mr Mildren, Mr O'Keefe, Mr Reith and Mr Scholes. Petitions received. Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That taxpayers with dependent children have been gravely disadvantaged by a serious decline in the level of recognition provided in the taxation system for the costs of maintaining a family, in particular: the failure to index family allowances which has resulted in an erosion of more than 50 per cent in their real value since May 1976; the abolition of family allowances for dependents who have turned 18, even those still at school; the abolition of concessional tax rebates for education and other expenses. That this erosion in horizontal tax equity has placed an intolerable financial burden on many larger families, particularly those on middle incomes who fail to qualify for means-tested benefits such as TEAS but whose living standards are now well below average due to heavy expenses on necessities such as education, housing, food and clothing. Your petitioners humbly pray that: family allowances be restored to the 1976 value (in real terms), and indexed according to the CPI; PETITIONS the dependent spouse rebate be retained; The Federal Government take urgent measures to restore equitable provisions in the taxation system through the introduction of family income splitting. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Donald Cameron, Mr Carlton, Mr Cunningham, Mr Drummond, Mr Hodges, Mr Simmons, Mr White and Mr Wright. Petitions received. Family Allowances To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That families have been gravely disadvantaged by a serious decline in the level of their net disposable income through: Failure to index family allowances-resulting in a 50 per cent loss in their real value since 1976 Abolition of family allowances for dependants who have turned l8-even those still at school Failure to increase the spouse rebate since 1982 Discriminatory taxation system-which penalises single income families. Recognising the cost benefit to taxpayers when the intact family unit itself delivers essential care to the extended family. Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Government take immediate action to: Restore the lost value of family allowances and to index them to cover future price rises Introduce optional income-splitting for taxation purposes Retain the spouse rebate. And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Dubois. Petition received. Family Allowances To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. Your petitioners humbly pray that: family allowances be restored to the 1976 value (in real terms), and indexed according to the CPI; the dependent spouse rebate be retained; the Federal Government take urgent measures to restore equitable provisions in the taxation system through the introduction of family income splitting. And your petitioners, citizens of Australia, for the health and strength of society, will always pray. by Mr Hodges. Petition received. Family Allowances The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned plead that the Parliament implement pro-family policies. In particular we appeal for: I. the retention of the present graduated assessment system for payment of the Family Allowance; 2. indexation of the Family Allowance in order to keep pace with inflation; 3. an increase of 3.7% in the Family Allowance benefit to return it to 11.5% of the Average Award Wage (making it similar in value to the 11.5% of the Basic Wage when Child Endowment was first introduced by the Chifley Government in 1941. 4. retention of the Dependent Spouse Rebate and the amount of the Dependent Spouse Rebate adjusted so that it is equal in value to the tax-free threshold allowed when calculating taxable income. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Rocher. Petition received. Closure of Post Office Agencies To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we strenuously object to the proposal that many Post Office Agencies are to be closed. They provide a network of offices with postal and agency services to residential areas and small communities. They serve a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced if forced to travel further to purchase postal items or collect parcels. It would be an unnecessary expense particularly for pensioners without their own transport. We maintain that the purpose of Post Offices should be to serve the public for the variety of services they offer. They are a community centre particularly in country areas and if necessary they should be subsidised to retain them. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should take all possible steps to prevent the closure of Post Office Agencies and that the network should be extended, with the Agency services they offer expanded. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Andrew, Mr Cunningham, Mr Drummond, Mr Tim Fischer, Mr Holding, Mr Hollis, Mr Howe, Mr Jull, Mrs Kelly, Mr Langmore, Mr MCVeigh, Mr Mildren, Mr Millar, Mr Nehl,  Mr Wilson and Mr Young. Petitions received. First International Earth Repair Year To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will: Propose to the United Nations General Assembly at its 41 st Session in September 1986 that 1988 be proclaimed the 'First International Earth Repair Year'. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Baldwin, Mr Blunt, Mr Everingham, Mr Grace, Mr Steele Hall, Mr Holding, Mr MACKellar, Mr Macphee, Mr Sinclair, Mrs Sullivan, Mr West and Mr Wilson. Petitions received. National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and the honourable members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: I. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian national flag. 2. The are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation. 3. They know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. 5.

Prescription Drugs for Pensioners To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia shows: That the adoption of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation to charge Pensioners a $2.00 (Two Dollars) prescription fee would place a heavy financial burden on disabled people.

Petitions received. National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: \. The present Australian national flag is not distinctively and uniquely Australian and is confused with other national flags. 2. The people of Australia have never had an opportunity to express their views on an appropriate Australian national flag in a referendum. 3. The present Australian national flag does not properly represent Australia as a sovereign, independent nation. 4. The present Australian national flag falsely proclaims Australia as a colony, homeland, protectorate, dominion or government department of Great Britain. 5. The first condition in the flag competition of 1901 required that the design should show Australia's loyalty to the British Empire. The British Empire no longer exists. 6. A public opinion poll held in 1984 using the Gallup Method revealed that 52% of Australians surveyed wanted a competition for a new design for the Australian flag. 7. There is no inherent link between Australia proclaiming a unique and distinctive flag and the political issue of Australia moving to a republican form of government. 8. The adoption of a truly Australian national flag would serve as a focal point for Australia's bicentennial celebrations in 1988. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: (a) Appoint a Committee of the Parliament with representatives from both Houses and all parties to invite and consider proposals for the design of a new Australian national flag, and (b) Require that Committee to make recommendations on the form of a minimum cost referendum at the time of the next general elections, in which the electors will be given the opportunity to vote for a flag from a selection of at least three designs which will include the present Australian national flag and the winner of the AusflagBulletin-2MMM.FM competition of March 1985. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cohen, Mr Spender, Mr Willis and Mr Young. Petitions received.

Your petitioners humbly pray that the Hawke Government honour its commitment to the Import Partity Pricing policy. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ian Cameron, Mr Hawker, Mr Hunt, Mr Reith and Mr Ruddock. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Richmond electorate respectfully showeth that: The Hawke Labor Government's refusal to pass onto motorists, farmers and small businessmen, and the community as a whole, the full effect of the drop in world oil prices will decrease Australia's competitiveness as a trading nation. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Act immediately to adhere to the oil world parity pricing policy, and give the full flow-on of the drop in world oil prices to the Australian public and the business sector. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Blunt. Petition received. Film Censorship Board To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia assembled. We, the undersigned, plead that Parliament will legislate, or act in accordance with the present legislation to replace the current members of the Film Censorship Board who have admitted to Senator Harradine on 12th December, 1984 as reported in the Senate Select Committee on Video Material, (see attached extracts), that they are not applying either the blasphemy or obscenity tests as required under the provisions of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations, and that these persons be replaced by persons who will apply these and the other related test in accordance with the said Regulations. Your petitioners humbly pray that you will give this matter your earnest consideration. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

The petition of certain citizens of the Mallee electorate respectfully showeth: That all legitimate business expenses incurred in earning or producing assessable income should be allowable deductions. That the proposed Capital Gains Tax is an unwarranted burden on the rural sector, which will severely affect its long term viability. That the delay by the Government in introducing the legislation into Parliament is causing confusion and hindering farmers in the organisation of their affairs. Fuel Prices Your petitioners humbly pray that the Government introduces the Capital Gains Tax legislation without delay and that the Australian Democrats join with the Opposition to defeat the proposed legislation.  Mr Ruddock. Petitions received. School Language Programs To the Speaker and Honourable Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: We the undersigned residents of Australia totally reject any move to cut funding to Australia-wide English as a Second Language programs in schools.

The Sex Discrimination Act, passed by Parliament in 1984, will automatically make unenforceable from 1st August 1986 the weight lifting limits applicable to women employees and contained in State laws, regulations and awards. 2. These weight lifting limits have applied throughout Australia for many years and have acted to prevent many injuries at the workplace, thereby avoiding much suffering and loss of working time. 3. The removal of this protective legislation will increase the rate of injury among women employees and lead to greater Workers' Compensation costs for employers. 4. The weight lifting limits do not in any way hamper the achievement of equality and equal opportunity in employment for women employees in the workforce. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Parliament will amend the Sex Discrimination Act to enable the weight lifting limits for women employees to continue and your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Beazley and Mr Maher.

We, the undersigned, plead that Parliament becomes aware that the Public has no legal right to influence the setting of Standards for Television Programming, that we deplore the new Standards which came into force on 1st February, and that we call on Parliament to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, section 16 (2), so that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, when determining Television Standards, and screening hours, shall consult with the Australian people: because at present the Tribunal is compelled by law to consult only with television stations on these matters. because the new standards are a result of such consultation, and have already been implemented without public discussion, because the new Standards are ambiguous, and without definition, because the new Standards are composed of modifying terms which circumvent the proscriptions, because the media is only motivated by aspirations of pecuniary superiority, because, in contrast, the public is only motivated by their wish to exercise pastoral care over the nurturing home environment of their children, because we believe that the Standards wrongly ascribe extreme importance to ""the storyline"" of a film screened, because we believe that the Standards wrongly ascribe total unimportance to the effects of viewing, especially violent films, on the young, the impressionable, the immature, the unstable, or the socially disadvantaged, because we refuse to accept the media-imposed assessment of community standards, and because we wish to impart our demand to be consulted, our demand to have legal status in decision-making, and the right to counsel those whose decisions so deeply affect our homes. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter your earnest attention, and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Beazley. Petition received.

Armagh Gaol, Northern Ireland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the practice of strip searching of women prisoners in Armagh Gaol, Northern Ireland. We are appalled that the prison authorities have demandedWomen prisoners in Armagh Gaol to be strip searched up to 32 times more frequently, on average, than women prisoners in Britain. Individual women prisoners in Armagh to be strip searched up to 28 times in one month. The occasional participation of male prison officers in forcing women to undergo strip searches. The insistence that menstruating women remove their sanitary towels and tampons, in order to facilitate strip searches. The strip searches currently being practised are violent, degrading and humiliating. They are a blatant violation of human rights, clearly contravening Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Your petitioners gravely feel that the employment of strip searching in the North of Ireland, by the British Government is designed not for security purposes but to dehumanise and violate the basic dignity of these women prisoners. Your petitioners humbly call upon the Australian Government to lodge a protest with the British Government, calling upon the British Government and the Northern Ireland Office to discontinue the practice of strip searching women prisoners in Armagh Gaol in Northern Ireland immediately. by Mr Steele Hall.

Marsfield Post Office, New South Wales To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully howeth: That we strenuously object to the proposal that the Post Office at Marsfield be closed. The Post Office serves a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced by having to travel to another centre for our postal and banking requirements, or even to collect registered, certified letters and parcels. Many of us are pensioners and the cost of such travel would be an unnecessary imposition. The nearest Post Offices are about 2kms away with no convenient public transport. Also for those of us who work during the week, this is the only Post Office open on Saturday mornings where we can collect our parcels, do our mailing and other services it provides. We maintain that the purpose of Post Offices should be to serve the public for the variety of services they offer, and that they should not be closed merely to save money or help Australia Post make a profit. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should take all possible steps to prevent the closure of Marsfield Post Office. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ruddock. Petition received.

South West Africa People's Organisation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: S.WA.P.O. is recognised by the United Nations as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. The situation in Namibia is of particular importance to Australians, given Australia's position as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, in effect a member of the UN, the government for Namibia in exile and therefore has a legal international entrusted responsibility tq the people of Namibia, responsibilities which it must be prepared to take seriously in order to bring about social justice, freedom and independence for Namibia and genuine peace in that Region. Therefore this humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully requests the Government to urgently initiate the following steps: I. To fund a S.WA.P.O. Office in Australia, such funding to continue until a free Namibia is able to establish an Embassy in Canberra. 2.

Discrimination against Women To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas the Commonwealth of Australia ratified with the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1983, the Government of Victoria in passing the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 is in breach of Article 6 of the Convention which says that ""States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women"". That the Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 provides legal authority to brothel operators to traffic in and exploit the prostitution of women and to live off the earnings of prostitutes. That whereas the Federal Minister for Health has counselled citizens to shun promiscuity (The Australian 26/1/85) because of the serious and sometimes fatal health hazards, the operations of legalised brothels encourages promiscuity and the spread of diseases, including AIDS. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Government of Australia having ratified the UN Convention on Women remain consistent in its obligations to uphold the Articles of the Convention and request the Victorian Government to immediately repeal the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Saunderson. Petition received.

Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security. 2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded. 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognize that any system giving - property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust. 4. Recognize that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely: (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm, (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes, (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices, (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals, (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack. 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Scholes. Petition received. Native Birds: Trapping and Export To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: I. We oppose the export of Australian fauna and are concerned that some groups and individuals with a vested interest in the bird trade are lobbying to legalise the export of cockatoos and galahs. 2. We oppose trapping birds in the wild for commercial trade in our own country. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will: I. Maintain our laws which forbid the export of our native birds. 2. Bring pressure to bear on the States to outlaw the trapping of birds in the wild for commercial trade.

Petition received. Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens'of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 26th April 1986, the Soviet Union has not yet adequately explained to its citizens or those of the Soviet-occupied Baltic States, Ukraine and other areas affected by the radiation fall-out the potential short-term and long-term health hazards and the available modes of prevention or reduction of radiation poisoning. Neither have the appropriate medicines for substitution therapies to minimise bodily accumulation of radioactive elements been adequately provided. 2. That the Soviet Union operates many nuclear power stations without the elementary structural safeguards against radioactive spillage regarded as mandatory in the West. Of particular concern is the safety of the largest Soviet nuclear power station at Ignalina in Soviet occupied Lithuania, of similar design to Chernobyl, which already has a record of operational problems. Radioactive spillage at Ignalina would quickly contaminate the whole of Latvia, Lithuania as well as vast areas of Europe. We request that the Australian Government will, I. Through the World Health Organisation, provide Gold Tax medical aid and broadcast medical information to the victims of radiation exposure following the Chernobyl disaster. 2. Through the United Nations Organisation request the Soviet Union, (a) to close down all nuclear power stations similar to Chernobyl till protective structures are built. (b) permit international inspection of such safety structures. And your Petitioners, as in Duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Wilson. Petition received. Home Loan Interest Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of the Federal Division of Fisher in Queensland respectfully showeth: That the current policy pursued by the Hawke Government is causing an intolerable increase in home loan interest rates beyond the capacity of families to pay. That consequently this policy is causing grave hardship throughout Australia and is contributing to social problems and the breakup of the family unit. That unless the Government act urgently the Australian dream of home ownership is fast becoming shattered for many of our citizens. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government makes home loan interest rates tax deductible therefore alleviating the present crippling burden of current high interest rates on home owners and home buyers. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Slipper. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the electorate of Fisher respectfully showeth that: Whereas the present Government of the Commonwealth of Australia has purported to present the title deeds to Ayers Rock in Central Australia, in reality the joint property of the people of the Commonwealth to an Aboriginal Land Council on 26 October 1985. Whereas opinion polls and statements of representative groups, Members of Parliament and respected individuals show clearly that the Commonwealth Government had no mandate from the citizens of the Commonwealth to act in such a disgraceful manner. Whereas the present Government claims to be totally opposed to apartheid (separate development) in South Africa but purported to hand over Ayers Rock to an Aboriginal Council in support of a policy of apartheid (separate development) which has been shown to be detrimental to the Aboriginal people of Australia. Whereas it is pursuing this policy making it a crime for most white and many Aboriginals to enter, without permit, large areas of the Commonwealth designated apartheid (i.e., set aside for separate development), trary to our democratic traditions and experience of freedom of movement for citizens of all racial origins within Australia. Whereas Australian citizens have no present means available to them to prevent this violation of their natural rights to unfettered common ownership of, and access to, a treasured natural asset. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Seek means available for the protection of the peopie's interests to reverse this outrage aDd preserve the democratic traditions of Australia. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Slipper. Petition received. Fringe Benefits Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Federal Division of Fisher respectfully showeth that: The total disallowance by the Hawke Labor Government of tax deductibility for entertainment and hospitality expenses will unfairly penalise Australian and cost thousands of jobs for young and unskilled people. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to abandon its total ban on entertainment expenses and allow tax deductibility for legitimate and necessary expenses. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Slipper. Petition received. Ayers Rock Capital Gains Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to immediately abandon its ill-considered capital gains tax proposal. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Slipper. Petition received. Superannuation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Page conelectorate respectfully showeth that: The Hawke Labor government's productivity-superannuation accord with the ACTU and its support of the superannuation claims of the trade union movement will create an imbalance in industrial power and distort the future development of the Australian economy. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Reject the superannuation claim of the trade union movement, and allow superannuation to develop without trade union domination. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Blunt, Mr Hicks, Mr Nehl and Mr Ian Robinson. Petitions received.

Australian Bill of Rights Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

We, the undersigned petitioners of the Federal Electorate of Farrer, do respectfully show our opposition to the introduction of a Fringe Benefits Tax and a Capital Gains Tax, and related legislation. Your petitioners do humbly pray for the repeal of both these pieces of legislation. Such taxes are an additional burden upon Small Business, and lead to increased bureaucracy.

Australian Bill of Rights Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain electors of Dawson shows that the proposed Bill of Rights Overlooks basic rights concerning union membership, education and private property, is a basis for massive intrusion into State responsibilities, establishes a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission with powers similar to a Court but without accepted legal procedures and protections for the accused, and provides no avenue of appeal against decisions of the HR&EOC. The petition further shows that fundamental protection of human rights is already to be found in the Courts, in tolerance, in fair play, belief in democratic institutions and in support for rule of law. Your petitioners humbly pray that the Parliament will not allow the Australian Bill of Rights Bill to pass into law. by Mr Braithwaite. Petition received. Public Park, Nudgee, Queensland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain electors of the division of Lilley shows that there is an area of Commonwealth land surplus to the re-development of the Brisbane Airport site. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Federal Government give favourable consideration to entering into negotiations with the Brisbane City Council in order to provide parkland for the people of Nudgee and surrounding areas. We believe that the nearby residential area is deficient in parkland due to its development prior to the time when provision of parkland by the City Council became a condition of approval for the sub-division of land. Further development of adjoining areas following the opening of the new airport and Gateway Bridge can only make the situation worse. The land to which we refer is situated at the end of Buchanan Road, Nudgee, Queensland, and we believe that part of it would be ideal for use as parkland. by Mrs Darling. Petition received. Fringe Benefits Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The humble petition of citizens in the electorate of the Northern Territory respectfully showeth that the proposed introduction of fringe benefits tax in Australia will destroy the future economic growth of the Northern Territory.

The humble petition of the undersigned members of the Coptic community resident in New South Wales respectfully showeth: Whereas the Coptic Orthodox Church, Diocese of Australia, Parish of New South Wales has enjoyed funding under the Grant-In-Aid Scheme since 1980, and has used the funds granted to employ a full-time social worker to assist members of the Coptic community in Sydney in dealing with problems encountered particularly by ethnic minorities in our society. Whereas the problems of the Coptic community in Sydney are, if anything, greater today than they were in 1980. Whereas the Church's application for continued funding under the Grant-In-Aid Scheme for 1985-86 has been rejected by the Honourable the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Whereas the resultant loss of the services of a full time social worker will cause immense hardship and distress within the Coptic community in Sydney.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Ms HcHugh. Petition received.

The petition of certain citizens of the Pine Rivers Shire in Queensland respectfully showeth: That the actions of trade unions have gone beyond their traditional goals of protecting workers' conditions National Flag and rates of pay and have reached the point where they are seriously affecting the economic health of the nation and the people.

NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",256
88,Madam SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The tragically unnecessary state of economic crisis resulting from the Hawke Government's recklessness, deception and negligence. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",256
89,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"Last week and this week the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) came out of his Budget bunker to tell the Australian people that Australia was in a (In- state of economic crisis. He told us that we were to have a tough Budget, a fall in living standards, and a cut in real wages, and that there would have to be all-round sacrifices. The Prime Minister went on the 60 Minutes program on Sunday night and said 'The party is over-finito'. But whose party was it in the first place? Who started the binge in the first place? Who declared that it was a party in the first place? Who squandered Australia's resources over three years of a business upswing, and who then has the hide to come and tell the Australian people that the party he started in the first place is now over? The Prime Minister said that the present economic crisis was akin to a state of war in Australia. I ask the Prime Minister: 'Whose side are you on in this war?' Who started the assault on the Australian economy in 1974, when, as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Prime Minister was responsible for the highest level of strikes in Australia's history, the greatest single wage increase in one year that we have ever seen-35 per cent in one year-which, at one stroke, destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs in Australian industry, businesses, farms and individuals? The assault in this war on our economy was begun by the Prime Minister in 1974 and it has been continued by Hawke, Keating, Crean and their mates over the last few years. The case that my colleague the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and I will put here this afternoon in this chamber is that this economic crisis is tragically unnecessary. It is brought not by any external assault on the Australian economy, but by the recklessness followed by the deception and negligence of the HawkeKeating Administration.",256
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS,Order! The honourable member will refer to Ministers by their titles.,257
91,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"I shall be delighted to, Mr Deputy Speaker. I shall call the Minister Assisting the Treasurer the Minister for replying to fringe benefits tax complaint letters.",257
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS,Order! The Minister's title is known to the honourable member and he will use it.,257
93,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"Well, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer who, in the course of his duties, spends most of his time replying to letters complaining about the fringe benefits tax. Let me take the House back for a moment to 1983, because it was back in 1983 that the present phase of the assault on the economy began. It was in this very chamber in April 1983 that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) stood up and told the assembled group here and the nation on television that the Government's economic strategy had two principal elements. The first of these was to bring about a more rapid rate of recovery than would otherwise be possible by spending and borrowing at a much higher rate than any government in Australia's peacetime history. That was the first principal mistake. It was to drive the Australian economy at a higher rate than any of the economies in the developed world and to do it on borrowed money. That was mistake No.1. Mistake No. 2 was to link wages to inflation. This was an insane step when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and all its member countries were advising against it and when the experience of developed economies over the previous decade had shown that linking wages to inflation was a disastrous policy. But the Treasurer adopted these two elements of policy as central to Labor's economic strategy. It was inevitable that if we were to do that-given the basic incapacity in many respects of Australian industry to adapt quickly-we would run into serious balance of payments problems, and indeed we did. These balance of payments problems started to become very clear last year and they were exacerbated by a deterioration in Australia's terms of trade. I mention this because the deterioration in terms of trade is being used as the Government's alibi for all its mistakes. But Australia has had deteriorations in the terms of about trade before. We have also had other external shocks. We have had massive rises in the price of oil on two occasions; we have had a terrible deterioration in the world economy on a number of occasions; and we have had very bad droughts on a number of occasions. But one way or another we have managed to cope with those external pressures and disasters and get the economy back on the track. This time the Government is trying to use the deterioration in the terms of trade as an excuse for the fundamental mistakes it made in economic strategy in 1983. It was inevitable, regardless of what happened to the terms of trade, that if one did what the Treasurer did, one would run into massive balance of payments problems. Indeed, we did. When did the deterioration become evident? Certainly it was evident to the Treasurer-at least on the terms of trade side-in the last Budget. I quote from Budget Paper No. 1 page 73, of last August: A marked deterioration in the terms of trade is expected, reflecting primarily the relative weakness of world prices for our commodity-based products. Mr Braithwaite-How long ago was that?",257
94,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"That was a year ago and that was the first clear sign given to us by the Treasurer himself that Australia should brace itself for terms of trade problems. Other things became clear shortly after that. In October of last year we had a record balance of payments deficit of $1.6 billion. That was a very serious set of figures. The rest of the world could see what was going on, the Opposition was drawing attention to what was going on and a few economic observers and commentators in Australia were prepared to rock the Keating band-wagon and point out what was going on. People in the foreign capitals knew what was going on even earlier in February 1985. They had marked the Australian dollar down by 25 per cent following the Prime Minister's MX missile fiasco. But it was the underlying economics of the situation which originally led to the fall in the dollar. It was triggered by a perception that the Prime Minister was not fully in control of his Government. By the end of 1985 everybody around the world knew the fundamentals of the Australian economy. They knew exactly what would happen to it as a result of the Hawke-Keating policies because in November they marked the dollar down again.",257
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS, Order! I have asked the honourable member to refer to Ministers by their titles. It will make life easier for all of us if he does so.,258
96,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"We are referring then to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and their combined disastrous economic policies. I was referring to the fact that in November last year, because nothing had been done about the terrible balance of payments figures in October and nothing had been done as a result of terrible inflation figures or about excessive wage settlements in October, the dollar was marked down again on foreign markets. Indeed, it was marked down at the very time the Treasurer was travelling to New York and London to try to talk it up. The dollar dropped when the Treasurer went to New York. It dropped again when he went to London. It dropped because the foreign markets knew-they knew last November-that the game was up. The Government panicked and pushed up interest rates to their highest level since the Great Depression. Every small businessman, every farmer and every home owner with a mortgage lives to rue the day last November when the Government had to resort to a high interests rates policy because of the crumbling of its fiscal and wages policies. That happened last November. So everybody externally knew about this, but apparently the Government did not. On 3 January the Opposition put out its four point plan to arrest this situation and to get the economy back on track. It is to the eternal discredit of this Government that it did not accept any of that advice in January. Let the Australian people know that had the Government accepted that advice in January we would not have the need for a tough Budget tonight. The Government did not accept our proposals, which provided for a cut in Government spending; abandonment of the wages and productivity case then before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; removal of the antibusiness tax policies-the fringe benefits tax. the capital gains tax and all that other rubbish: and a relaxation of foreign investment controls. These proposals, which I remind honourable members were made in January of this year, were ridiculed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The tragedy of this situation is that many more people will be out of jobs, will lose their farms and businesses and will suffer supreme hardship because of the failure of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to heed our advice in January. I merely quote something the Treasurer said in response to what we were saying as late as March. He said: This reveals something about the rhetoric of the Opposition about there being some sort of economic crisis, which are the words used in the matter of public importance coming up for discussion today.",258
97,Mr HUNT,ECONOMIC CRISIS,When did he say that?,258
98,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"That was on 20 March 1986. He went on: It is some crisis when we have a 7.7 per cent nonfarm growth! The so-called words of crisis and pessimism coming from the Opposition on the economic outcomes are, of course, absolutely hollow. That is what the Treasurer said on 20 March. ije has said a number of other things. This was the deceptive phase as far as the Australian public was concerned-the attitude of 'let us lead them up the garden path'. In February the Prime Minister said: As far as the Government is concerned, we assert that the economic fundamentals of policy making in this country are right and will continue to deliver to this country the economic and the employment growth which has put the performance of this country so far ahead of anywhere in the rest of the world. That is what was said by the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke AC, MP, as recorded in Hansard of 13 February 1986.",258
99,Mr HOWARD,ECONOMIC CRISIS,Was that this year?,258
100,Mr CARLTON,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"That was this year. On 20 March the Treasurer said in this House: The fact is that the Government's policy settings this year have been totally correct. Now we come to the really scandalous part of this, because on 9 May-only a few months ago-the Treasurer went to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, the main advisory body, and said: Overall, 1986 is emerging as a year of slower, but still satisfactory growth, a year in which we will see consolidation of the very strong gains of the past three years and-wait for itin which the economy can deal with the imbalance on our external account. That was on 9 May. Five days later, one day after disastrous balance of payments figures were released, we had gone from that supreme position to a banana republic. On 14May the Treasurer said that we were going down the shute. Obviously, if any more evidence were needed that this was a planned campaign of deception of the Australian community, it has to be provided by the juxtaposition of those two statements because one of them has to be an untruth. One of them has to be totally deceptive. I ask honourable members: Which of those statements is totally deceptive? Then there was the period of negligence. Did the Government do anything about the situation even in May? No, it did not. The Prime Minister decided to make a public address to the nation on television. So he did and he called for sacrifice. About a week later his mates in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia responded to this call for national effort and sacrifice by closing the docks for a week. That is what happened. Then, still ignoring the requirement for a mini-Budget, still ignoring the request to cut back on wages, members of the Australian Labor Party went down to their national conference in Hobart and conducted a sham battle against the Left. But the enemy was on their side because while they were in Hobart talking about economic responsibility, Mr Sword, Mr Crean's successor as head of the Federated Storeman and Packers Union, was bringing Melbourne and Sydney to a halt by cutting off their petrol supplies just to demonstrate that union's economic responsibility. The tragedy of this economic crisis which is what it is; there is no about it-is that it need never have happened. The warnings were there. The warnings were in the Government's own publications if people had looked deeply enough into them. The warnings were there for foreign observers and were provided by the Opposition. But time and again the Government would not respond and, as a result, it stands condemned and will be responsible for the hardships that it will inflict on Australian people for the rest of this year and beyond.",258
101,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,259
102,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (3.32)-Two months recess certainly has not done anything for the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). That was a very pathetic effort. No wonder the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) is being pressed out of this place in order that Professor John Huson can come in and take over as shadow Treasurer. We have certainly just heard 15 minutes of a very pathetic effort which would make that at least something worthwhile for this Parliament. Nobody could do a worse job. One of the many contrasts between the Hawke Labor Government and the coalition Opposition relates to credibility. Credibility is a very important word in politics-a very important concept. This matter of public importance before the House today should be examined with that word 'credibility' in mind. We need just to look at the words in the matter of public importance. Let us just drag some of them out-emotional words such as 'recklessness', 'deception' and 'negligence'. They show a very small mind and certainly show the hypocrisy of the Opposition when it talks in those sorts of terms. It is not something that is worthy of this Parliament. If we want to have a look at irresponsibility let us look at those words such as 'recklessness', 'deception' and 'negligence' and let us just consider for a moment what their real meaning is. Let us just consider those words in terms of the Opposition's behaviour at Question Time today. Opposition members were so reckless, at a time when we have had two months recess from this place, that they brought into this Parliament not the grave concerns that there are at this time of economic difficulties for this country-they did not bring in such major concerns basically at Question Time-but matters relating to Mr Jusdoubt tice Lionel Murphy and his position. They brought in matters such as the discredited National Times article on the Treasurer (Mr Keating). They are the sorts of things that they have raised. If they want recklessness that certainly gives us an idea of what recklessness is. Mr Hand-Gutter politics.",259
103,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"As the honourable member the for Melbourne has just said, they are pursuing gutter politics and that is what we ought to be nailing on them. In talking about recklessness I note more significantly the example of the recklessness of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the $9.6 billion blowout in the last Budget that he sought to bring to this country. That is what recklessness means. Let us look at the word 'deception'. What about the Opposition being in favour of tax cuts on the one hand but being unable or unwilling to identify any major cuts in expenditure on the other hand? I just need to point out to the House that the Leader of the Opposition's promise to abolish the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the tax on lump sum superannuation payouts and the assets test would add an annual cost to the Budget of no less than $940m. How does anybody who pretends to be credible, reconcile that tax cut-type rhetoric with the expenditure promises made by the same Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar, from whom we have just heard, when they list their wanted expenditure cuts to the order of $1.5 billion? Since then the National Party of Australia has gone haywire and has promised a further $500m package of goodies for the rural sector. That gives us some idea of the lack of credibility of the people opposite. If the Leader of the Opposition sadly ever took over as leader of the Government of this country there are only two ways in which he could finance his tax cuts and expenditure promises. The first would be irresponsibly to increase the deficit, as he did as Federal Treasurer in 1982-83 when the Liberals were thrown out of office with an election eve deficit projection, as I mentioned earlier, of $9.6 billion. The second would be to hold a massive sale of public sector assets such as Telecom Australia and the Commonwealth Bank in the same way as the Leader of the Opposition in my home State of South Australia wanted to do during his unsuccessful 1985 State election campaign and, indeed, as the Thatcher Government is doing in the United Kingdom. If we want credibility let us hear from the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar, in this House as to exactly what the Opposition would be doing in these circumstances. Instead we have these massive giveaways by way of promises relating to tax cuts on the one hand and promises of increased expenditure, such as the irresponsible $500m package of the National Party on the other hand. As I have said, all the Opposition has come up with is increases. So we can put in one phrase that it is reckless, deceptive and negligent. The Opposition's total and blatant hypocrisy in bringing this matter of public importance forward is evident, therefore, from the words of the matter itself. In contrast, let me say, in as measured a way as I possibly can, that the Government has a balanced and coherent strategy. This strategy will work and we have no intention of altering it. Of course, the strategy will be explained in further detail tonight when the Treasurer talks to the House and to the nation when giving his 1986-87 Budget Speech. Since this Government came to office we have made fundamental reforms aimed at restructuring the debilitated economy we inherited. Let me go through some of those reforms which will mean a far better structure for us to revive this country's economy in the near future. Deregulating the financial markets so that we have an efficient and innovative financial sector is just one of those reforms. We are ready now to respond to the needs of entrepreneurs in the business community generally. On the other hand, the coalition parties when in government could only aspire to deregulation but they never did things. Without floating the dollar we would never have had the depreciation that this country so desperately needs. This economy has needed it. For 20 years we have had an overvalued dollar and the result of an over-valued dollar was the decimation of our manufacturing industry. Now a whole range of previously uncompetitive industries is competitive again, particularly and most importantly our manufacturing industry. We brought down the most fundamental and far-reaching post-war tax reform despite the dishonest and self-interested bleatings of people in the Opposition. The rorts have been removed and still more will be removed. Personal marginal tax rates will be lowered and the company tax system reformed to remove the double taxation of dividends. The coalition always talked of tax reforms but it never did anything about them. Of course, the leader of the Opposition presided over the most scandalous explosion of tax avoidance and evasion that this country has ever experienced. He could not or would not do anything about it then, and now he has lost his chance forever, I am glad to be able to say for the sake of this country. I shall say something about wages policy. We have negotiated the accords marks I and II under which over 600,000 new jobs have been created, reducing the unemployment rate from over 10 per cent to just over 8 per cent and this occurred despite an increase in the participation rate to record levels, We have had three years of strong, positive and real growth in the economy, thanks to the accords mark I and II. Let us contrast that with the promised actions of the Opposition. It would have us having a market for wages. It would have us having a situation such as that which is being demonstrated by the plumbers and gas fitters right now with what they are seeking to impose on Australia-namely, a breakout from the accord. It would have us determining wages in the law of the jungle with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. That is the sort of wages determination policy that it would have, and it would be in such strong contrast to the accord. I pay tribute to the trade union movement, which has been the other great party to the accord. It has meant that those in the work force have made their sacrifices in wage restraint for those outside the work force. Without that restraint and without the accord, we would not have had the great advance in creating over 600,000 new jobs. There is a sharp contrast between the coalition's policies and ours in relation to the manufacturing sector. We even had an interjection from the honourable member for Forde (Dr Watson) about our currency being undervalued now. I think that that was the effect of his intervention. He certainly suggested that he did not agree with me saying that our currency had been overvalued. I say to him that it is necessary to look only at the lack of competitiveness in our manufacturing industry to realise that that is not so. The need was there to do something about an overvalued dollar, and now that we have done so we shaH be in a position to re-industrialise this country. Under the Opposition's policies we had doubledigit unemployment, with hundreds of thousands of families thrown into poverty. Under those policies we had double-digit inflation as well, and we had a blow-out in the deficit. I have mentioned the deficit of $9.6 billion that we inherited. We had industrial disputes three times higher than they are now. Company profits were destroyed and there was accordingly a lack of investment. We had a 17 per cent wages blowout. Let me contrast that with the fine record of achievement during the three years of the Hawke Labor Government, I am proud to be able to remind the House of the results of our economic management. Real gross domestic product had declined by nearly one per cent in 1982-83, the last year of the previous Government. Over the past three years it has averaged an annual growth rate of 4.7 per cent. I have mentioned employment increasing and unemployment falling. Australia has one of the best records in this and in industrial disputation statistics of any other country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Generally, living standards have increased. I repeat that the Government has a fine record. I remind the House once again of what has happened in this latest crisis which we are addressing, and that is the decline in the terms of trade. Last year alone the figures fell by 14 per cent, to a post-depression low. The honour be speaking after me, will give some examples of what this has meant in the decline in the prices that we are getting for many of our products that we export. For instance, between 198182 and 1985-86, average coal export prices fell from $US54.85 a tonne to $US39.41 a tonne, a fall of 28 per cent. The most recent price is about $US38.72 a tonne. I could go on. The honourable member for Barton may find time to talk about wheat, wool, iron ore, alumina, beef and other items. He may have time to give examples of how things are affecting us over which we have no control. The price of our exports has driven Australia to the difficulties which we are now facing and which the Government is addressing, and we shall hear more about the Government's policies this evening. The Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying: 'The times will suit me'. He is gleeful at the troubles that Australia is suffering. I tell him that the times will not suit him. He wiJI have to put his policies on record in detail very soon. In fact, he will have to do so on Thursday night. The people will not put up with more vacillating on his part and mere rhetoric. The people will want details. I draw attention to a leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald of only a couple of days ago. It is headed 'The Budget and Mr Howard'. The editorial asks how tough he is. It states: When Mr Keating unveils his . . . Budget, and the disadvantaged interest groups are squealing, Mr Howard must remind voters that his Budget would have been even tougher. He will have to get that on record. I opened my remarks today by talking about credibility, and there is not much credibility on the benches opposite. There is even less credibility now, and that will remain the position unless the Leader of the Opposition, in replying on Thursday night, gives details of what his so-called Budget would be.",259
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,261
105,Mr COBB,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"The people of Australia who have listened to the psuedo Treasurer, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford), could be forgiven if they thought that the economy was in great shape, bearing in mind the diatribe that they would have heard. Everyone in Australia knows that the country is on its knees. The economy is in a mess and yet the Minister handed out to us the sort of stuff that we have just heard. In the short three years that the Government has been in office it already stands condemned on just about every issue that it has touched. For example, in ministeries as diverse as those dealing with foreign policy and Aboriginal affairs we have had the ridiculous MX missile decision and the absurd land rights decision. On social security, we have had the unjust asset-test pension decision. I could continue. In no area, however, has negligence been more prevalent than in that of economic policy. In the eyes of the Australian people the 'world's greatest Treasurer' is now fighting to save his medal from rusting away. The chicken Hawke is seeing all his chickens come home to roost. The economic plug has been pulled and we have now moved into a downward vortex. We are running twentythird out of twenty-four OECD countries in several of the major economic indicators. Let us go through some of those. Inflation in this country is running between 8 per cent and 9 per cent. At the same time, the inflation rate of our trading partners is running between 0 per cent and 2 per cent. I am thinking of countries such as West Germany, the United States of America and Japan. We are falling behind. We have virtually the highest interest rates in the world and the highest real interest rates in this country since the Great Depression. The Government has been trumpeting about the growth rate. It is slowing down, and that is because it was built on high spending and borrowed money. I could give any family of this nation $100,000 and it could live well while it was spending that sum. However, the day comes when money has to be paid back, and that is what is happening now. The Government has trumpeted also about job creation; it has bragged about it. It is now turning round and we are moving into a period of spiralling unemployment, which will continue right through this year and next year. The Government's job creation has been based on borrowed money, the bulk of which has been spent in non-productive areas, such as jobs in the Public Service and in other shonky job creation schemes. In the Community Employment Program area alone, $1,1 OOm has been spent. There have been things like Priority One. The deficit is just about the most devastating economic indicator of all. Let us look at the overseas debt. When this crew took over the overseas debt was running, in round figures, at about $25 billion gross. That was high enough, but what is it today? It has gone over $80 billion. It took 83 years since Federation to get to $25 billion. In three years it has more than trebled to over $80 billion, and next year it will go over $100 billion. In comparing this Government with the Whitlam Government, which everyone condemns, I think we should look at certain factors. The Whitlam Government was condemned, but at least it was open about the things it did. I think this Government is more devious and more cunning and it is getting away with things far worse. Let us look at how our dollar is going. It has dropped to around US60c, or 50c on the trade weighted index basket, and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the world's greatest Treasurer, is using interest rates to prop it up. At the end of last year he went through the exercise of shoving interest rates up from about 14 per cent to 21 per cent, which nearly crippled every small business and farmer in this country, the wealth producers of this country. He finally saw the error of that method and he laid off that for a while. But what happened two or three weeks ago when the dollar started to plummet again? He rang up the Reserve Bank again and in a period of one week alone interest rates went up 3.4 per cent. He is back to his old tricks. All this will mean is that all available money will go into servicing interest rates and there will be none left over to spend elsewhere in the community. Let us look at the tax indicator. This Government has gone tax mad. In the last 12 months alone we have had tax after tax after tax introduced. The superannuation lump sum tax has been brought in. There has been an attempt to bring in a compulsory 3 per cent superannuation tax. The negative gearing measures have almost destroyed the rental industry. We have had the entertainment tax and the assets test tax on pensioners. Mr Nehl-Disgraceful.",261
106,Mr COBB,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"It is disgraceful. We have had the introduction of the capital gains tax and now we have the fringe benefits tax. This Government seems to have a motto: If it moves, tax it; if it does not move, apply a death duty to it. Let us look at the fringe benefits tax. What does the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Burke, say about the fringe benefits tax? He is against it. What does Mr Bannon of South Australia say about the fringe benefits tax? He thinks it is ridiculous. What does Mr Cain of Victoria say about the fringe benefits tax? He thinks it is iniquitous. What does Mr Unsworth of New South Wales say about the tax? He thinks it is an administrative nightmare. What does Mr Warburton of Queensland think about the tax? He also thinks it is ridiculous. The fringe benefits tax, the latest in a long list of taxes, will only create three Ps in this country: Poverty, paper and public servants. The most stupid example surfaced just recently. Last night after midnight, at a quarter past twelve a doctor was called out to an urgent caesarian. But before he started his car to drive away he had to make eight entries in his log book. - MJ: Chynoweth-What a load of rubbish.",262
107,Mr COBB,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"It is not rubbish; it is the truth. A person· from a bllsiness in Dubbo came into my office the other day. His business has already make 16,000 entries in its log books in the first month alone. People In my electorate are saying: 'To hell with the log books'. They are putting them in the glove box and saying that at the end of the three month period they will fabricate the entries and fill in their log books. This is what this measure is doing; it is making cheats out of honest people because it is so ridiculous. As every Labor Premier in Australia has said, it is an administrative nightmare; it is absolute nonsense. The Government has completely lost its grip on reality. It has no concept of how to apply these taxes. It is killing people's initiative to work. It is abolishing the incentive of the people in this country to invest. It is rewarding failure and idleness. If one looks around the Government benchesthere are not many Government members here today; only about thtee-one sees that they are awash with trendies and academics, most of whom have never done a day's work in the real world in their live-. They would not know what it was like to rake up the money at the end of the week to meet a pay cheque for their employees. They have never known what it is like to toss and turn at night wondering how one is going to make the next interest payment. If one has a look at the record of the man running the show, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), one sees that he has only come through the trade union movement and that when he led that all he did was introduce violence and aggression into it. He introduced disruption - nd vandalism to the country and I doubt that th- country will ever get rid of it.",263
108,Mr HUNT,ECONOMIC CRISIS,Bourke- store.,263
109,Mr COBB,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"Exactly. When he headed the Australian Council of Trade Unions he tried to go into business. He tried to run Bourkes store. What happened to Bourkes store? It went broke. What happ-ned to the ACTU-Solo petrol venture that he went into? It went broke. What happened to the ACTU Jetset Travel Service Pty Ltd, which he was trying to run? It went broke. Now he is trying to run Australia. What is happening to Australia: It is going broke too. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are trying to bring down the economy of South Africa by putting on sanctions. If they want to bring down the economy of South Africa all they have to do is go over there and run the economy for a few months. Let us look at some of the work practices that grew out of the Prime Minister's ACTU and Australian Labor Party leadership. We need only go to today's paper to see the advertisement placed by Robe River Iron Associates. In the past three months to June 1986, $35m had already been lost through the ridiculous work practices there which this Government is backing up. Employees insist on driving water trucks even when it is raining because it is an easy job to do. It costs $80 to fill up a fire extinguisher if it is done after 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Because nine employees had only six litres of milk for their afternoon tea and they wanted a litre each they delayed the berthing of a ship which cost the customer and the company $42,000. So the story goes on. This epitomises what is wrong with this country. It is not going to improve until we have another election at which the Government will be defeated.",263
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC CRISIS,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired.  listening to this debate this afternoon have just had a perfect example of what has happened to this country in 30 of the last 36 years. Honourable members opposite can consign the nation's great ills to the fact that people have to fill in a log book and that workers have afternoon tea, and think that if we got rid of the log books and afternoon tea, the place would be hunkydory. Quite frankly, if at the next election people want to vote for that kind of substance-or lack of it, as has been so manifestly showngood luck to this country.   bers opposite something about Rockdale. The Liberal primary vote was down and if there was not a whole host of Independents stooging the public and doing their best to run a cover for the political party of those opposite, that sort of swing would not have occurred. What we are concerned with here today are the long term problems of the national economy which require long term solutions based on honesty, courage and the integrity of the interests of this nation, rather than the deceit, cynicism and failure to admit the mistakes of the past that characterises those opposite who have led this country into this predicament across 30 of the last 36 years. Today we have seen their perverted, distorted view of history and the way in which the nation's economy has panned out. Every national commentator who is respectable in the remotest sense agrees that this is a long term problem that requires long term solutions. The reality for those opposite, which they do not like to hear, is that for the vast majority of that time over which these problems have accrued they have been the people in government. To put a finer point on it, for five of the last seven years of conservative rule their present leader was the Treasurer of this nation, the man who had the opportunity to fix these long term problems but did not, and in fact went on to exacerbate them. It is those opposite and their political forefathers who created the economic and industrial structure of this economy that has left us as a nation vulnerable to the collapse in the price of our exports. Now, as usual, the Australian Labor Party-and we have been in office for a relatively short period-has to clean up the mess of those opposite. What are they doing in the meantime? They are busy playing politics, coming up with cliches, diversions from the national interest and destructive criticism. But worse still, as we have seen here today, they are proving to be most treacherous in their rhetoric. They are saying that this country cannot do it. They are saying that this country does not have the innate strength to come out of this predicament and to regain its place in the world. Those opposite take pride in belittling this country. They talk Australia down and, like that lightheaded Lightfoot from Western Australia, they are economic saboteurs of the first order. They seek to blame sections of the Australian population-the wage and salary earners-despite all the facts and all the statistics to the contrary. They seek to paint everybody who has ever had a social security benefit in his life as some sort of bludger and others as second-rate. Only they and their narrow-based constituency are reserved for anything but the worse. The truth of it is that history haunts the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his ramshackle team. I refer to Black Jack MCEwen and his political marriage over 20 years ago of the rural big farm interests and the big city manufacturers-what Paul Kelly in a recent article in the Australian called 'The incredible alliance'. The article contains some interesting quotes from what was written by Paul Kelly, one of Australia's most eminent journalists and, apart from myself, in all humility, one of the best at the Australian newspaper. He said: The MCEwen legacy has hounded the Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke governments. He went on to say that Black Jack MCEwen, the Opposition's political forefather, was the godfather of the banana republic. That, my friends opposite, is the sad truth. This country is in this predicament because of the policies of Opposition parties in the past; and, despite the 30 of the last 36 years, the Hawke Labor Government will bring this country out of those problems to a new era of prosperity. Let us have a look at the present Leader of the Opposition and what he has done. During his tenure as Treasurer, he actively brought about a worsening of this problem. In pursuit of the Fraser resources boom-a boom that never happened-the false pretensions created an even further over-valued exchange rate. Exporters and existing import-competing industries suffered intolerably and closed down by the dozen. This action exacerbated inflation. It caused a diversion of financial and entrepreneurial resources away from manufacturing in a process that was compounded by a warped tax system. The proof of this, if those opposite really want to measure their existing Leader, is in a very interesting quote from the November 1981 Stan Kelly memorial lecture by none other than John Stone, one of the Opposition's activists on the campaign trail. This quote, my friends, shows the deliberate approach by the honourable member for Bennelong to lead this nation, when he was Treasurer, further into international debt. This is what the servant of the former Treasurer, the current Leader of the Opposition, had to say: It is only the external option-that is, increasing the current account deficit on the balance of payments-which increases the totality of resources available to the community and thereby gives an immediate increase in growth potential. That is what was said by John Stone in November 1981. It is on record that there was a deliberate policy by the Howard-Fraser Government to plunge this country further into international debt. It is on the public record. It was a deliberate policy, and it was one that served only to exacerbate the damage caused by their political forefathers in their early years. Yet despite that, they come in here this afternoon with this matter of public importance to blame this Government and to try to make political capital. Let me say this here and now: It is not our credibility but the Opposition's credibility that is on the line. The Australian public will remember the current Leader of the Opposition as the Treasurer of those dark years and they will know-if they do not know now, we shall make sure that they do by the next election-what the alternative really means. In the few remaining minutes that I have, let me dispel a couple of myths. I have some interesting figures. In 1980-81, Australia's current account deficit leapt from 1.7 per cent to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1981-82, it leapt further to 6 per cent of GDP, which illustrates how suddenly and dramatically the current Leader of the Opposition, when he was Treasurer, put this country on the road to international indebtedness. The interesting point is that this Government has actually lowered the current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product compared with what it was when the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer-that is, in terms of gross domestic product, this Government has started to turn back the rot that the honourable member for Bennelong put into place. Another cliche put around the community by those opposite is that this foreign debt is somehow government-induced debt. This is not so. Of the $75 billion, only $15 billion is directly related to the Government; $60 billion of the foreign debt 'comes from the private sector. The other interesting point is this simple fact: If the prices of our commodities had not fallen in the manner in which they have-that is, if the terms of trade had not collapsed as they have-this country would be $6.5 billion better off and not only would there be no balance of payments crisis, as those opposite like to call it, but also there would not be a problem at all. The fact of the matter is that the world has cut our income by 3 per cent. This Government will not shirk from the hard task of bringing this country back to where it should be. But let us have no more of the hypocrisy from those opposite who for 30 of the past 36 years have run the country into the ground.",263

112,Mr BARRY JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Lalor-Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce) (4.07)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 7 to 13 (1986) and Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 5 to 8 (1986). The terms of the printed proposals are now being circulated to honourable members. The tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1982. The Proposals formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Gazette during the recent recess. Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 5,6 and 7 (1986), operative on and from 14 June, 26 July and 16 August respectively, provide for altered rates of excise duty on certain refined petroleum products resulting from the government's decisions on the pricing of indigenous crude oil and related issues. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 7, II and 13 (1986), operative on and from 14 June, 18 July and 16 August 1986 respectively, provide for corresponding alterations of rates of Customs duty. While rates of diesel fuel rebate alter in conjunction with these duty changes, the rebate rate for eligible primary production has been maintained as a 100 per cent rebate of the duty. The rebate rate changes for eligible mining operations also effectively mean no increase in duty payable. Excise Tariff Proposals No. 8 (1986), operative on and from 1 August 1986, reduce the top marginal rate of excise on old oil produced offshore from 87 per cent to 80 per cent. This concession, announced by the Government on 28 July 1986, will remain in force for the remainder of 1986-87. However, should the Bass Strait import parity price recover to $20 per barrel before the end of the financial year this arrangement will be reviewed. Customs Tariff Proposals No.8 (1986), operative on and from 15 April 1986, implement changes to remove the 2 per cent revenue duty on certain agricultural chemicals falling within item 38.11 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. This action has been taken to implement part of the Government's economic and rural policy statement announced by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) and permits the duty-free entry of these chemicals. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 9 and 12 (1986) provide for the duty-free entry of certain goods of New Zealand origin. Custom Tariff Proposals No. 9 (1986), operative on and from 1 May 1986, remove the 5 per cent duty previously applicable on certain powered lawnmowers. This action follows a further review under the intermediate goods provisions of the Australia New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 12 (1986) remove the 4 per cent duty which had applied to certain furniture and parts of New Zealand origin. As a result of representations by the Australian and New Zealand furniture industries to their respective governments, agreement has been reached to bring forward by 12 months the removal of trade restrictions on these goods. The relevant changes are therefore operative on and from I July 1986. The two changes contained in Customs Tariff Proposals No. 10 (1986) are operative on and from I July 1986. The first change removes the 2 per cent revenue duty on sulphur falling within item 25.03 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. This change forms part of the Government's decision on the report of the Government study group on fertiliser production and consumption in Australia and the Industries Assistance Commission's Report on Fertilisers. The other amendment provides for the continuity of the Government's decision on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on electric motors and generating sets. This decision was originally implemented by Customs Tariff Proposals No.5 (1986), operative on and from 18 April 1986, but some restructuring of the Customs Tariff Act was required on I July IP86 because of the introduction of the revised system of tariff preferences for developing countries on that date. The rates originally implemented by Customs Tariff Proposals No.5 (1986) are not altered in any way by the current proposals. Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Tuckey) adjourned. NA",265
113,Mr BARRY JONES,DISCHARGE OF TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Lalor-Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce) (4.\3): I ask leave of the House to move a motion to discharge certain customs tariff proposals which were moved earlier in the session and which constitute part of order of the day No. 46. These proposals were incorporated in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1986 which has now been assented to. Leave granted.",266
114,Mr BARRY JONES,DISCHARGE OF TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: That Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. \0 to 14 (1985) and Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. I and 2 (1986) constituting part of order of the day No. 46, Government Business be discharged. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA ALTERATION BILL 1986 Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Young, and read a first time. Second Reading",266
115,Mr YOUNG,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to several Government decisions relating to the remuneration of parliamentarians, judges and certain other public office holders. The prime purpose is to put into effect the Government's decision not to accept the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendation of an 11.7 per cent increase in parliamentary salaries. In presenting its 1986 review, the Tribunal stated that since I July 1984 the salary level of senators and members has been some 11.7 per cent less than ordinarily it should have been. The anomaly arose in the context of the 1984 review when the Tribunal established an equitable base for other groups in its jurisdiction by granting an II. 7 per cent increase, but this increase was not given to members by the Tribunal because of submissions by the Government and other parties. The same situation occurred in 1985 when the Tribunal drew attention to the anomaly but did not act in view of submissions by the Government and the Opposition parties. In 1986 the Tribunal noted similar submissions from the Government and the parties, but determined an II. 7 per cent increase on the basis of what the Tribunal saw as compliance with its statutory obligation and fairness and equity. The Government announced, on 1 July, its intention not to accept the increase. While we recognise that parliamentary salaries are subject to a considerable anomaly and that in some cases this may be placing some strain on the resources of individual members, we have agreed that parliamentarians must, in the current economic climate, forgo any recommended increase in salary above national wage case increases. This Act therefore amends Tribunal determinations 7 and 8, relating to additional salary for parliamentary office holders and basic salary of senators and members, so that existing salaries are increased only by the outcome of the recent national wage case. The basic salary of a member will then be $45,543; had the Tribunal's determination remained in force it would have been $50,871. As Remuneration Tribunal determinations come into effect on the date specified by the Tribunal, which in this case was I July 1986, the Act also allows for the alteration to the determinations to be effected retrospectively. The increased salary which has been paid to members since I July will therefore be required to be repaid and appropriate arrangements will be put in place. Because ministerial salaries are fixed by Government decision, Ministers have not received any payment by way of the anomaly element. The Bill also withdraws any entitlement to an 11.7 per cent increase in parliamentary superannuation benefits. Part III of the Bill amends the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act to give effect to Tribunal recommendations regarding the salary and allowances of judges and members of the Interstate Commission. It provides for salaries to be increased by national wage case decisions only; allowances are to be adjusted in line with cost of living increases. The opportunity has been taken in Part IV of the Bill to alter the mechanism for increasing the annual appropriation for ministerial salaries under the Ministers of State Act so as to avoid continual alterations to the Act. To remove the need for recurrent legislative amendment, it is proposed to amend the Ministers of State Act to provide that in future the limit should be fixed by regulation under the Act. The limit will continue to be set on the basis of the actual salaries payable to Ministers as decided by the Government following recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal. The regulations will of course be subject to the same parliamentary scrutiny and the same disallowance provisions as other regulations. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Leave granted for second reading debate to proceed forthwith.",266
116,Mr SPENDER,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"The reasons for the Remuneration and Allowances Alteration Bill 1986 have been outlined by the Special Minister of State (Mr Young), save for one which is the most important of the reasons. It is because of the parlous economic circumstances in which this country finds itself that Bill is being put up by this Government. Those economic circumstances are directly due to a matchless combination of arrogance, incompetence and recklessness that this Government has exhibited in its economic policy planning, if one could call what this Government has done for some time policy planning. The Special Minister of State has pointed out that there are anomalies. I agree that there are anomalies. Outside this House he has pointed to the need to pay parliamentarians a proper salary. I agree with those views but I also agree with the views that he has expressed on behalf of the Government to the effect that now is not the time for any anomalies to be dealt with. It is for members of parliament to present an example to people when it comes to restraint in these harsh economic times. As the honourable member for Denison says, it never is a time to catch up. He is in fact right. It is worthwhile recalling that in 1975 a Level 2 public servant was paid, I think, $20,000 and a member of parliament was also paid $20,000. In 1986 a Level 2 public servant is paid, I believe, $53,632 and a member of parliament is paid $45,543. The salary of a public servant has gone up by 168 per cent and the salary of a member of parliament has gone up by 127 per cent, which says something as to who runs things in this country. It is necessary to exercise restraint and, save for one qualification, we have no opposition to the Bill. The qualification relates to the provision in the Bill that provides that ministerial salaries be increased by regulation and not by amendment as required under the Members of State Act 1952. We oppose that provision and ordinarily we would have voted against it but in the circumstances, Budget day, we do not propose to call a division on it. We do not think it is appropriate that that kind of a matter be dealt with by regulation and we think it is better that the old procedure, even if it is somewhat cumbersome, be pursued so that a closer public scrutiny can be given to increases in ministerial salaries.",267
117,Mr RUDDOCK,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"1 do not intend to speak at any length on the Remuneration and Allowances Alteration Bill save to say that it is often suggested that members of parliament should set an example to other members of the community in relation to the way in which they are remunerated. That is often said against a background which people fail to readily understand and appreciate, that over the last this 12 years a very considerable example has been set to the community as a whole and I think in many respects has not been appreciated nor understood. I have had prepared from time to time, and most recently in May of this year, a table which sets out to compare the parliamentary salary as fixed in 1974 after a most thoroughgoing review by the Remuneration Tribunal, its most substantial review and second only to the report of His Honour, Mr Justice Kerr, of December 1971 for the thoroughness with which the matter of remuneration of members of parliament generally was examined. At that date a salary of $20,000 was fixed as the appropriate emolument for members of parliament. Since that time-that is until the most recent increase-the amount fixed in percentage terms was 122.6 per cent above that paid in 1974. Comparatively, for average weekly earnings the amount of increase was 246.9 per cent. The increase in the consumer price index was 206.5 per cent. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) when speaking on this matter mentioned the increases that occurred in relation to the Australian Public Service. It was the least advantageous group with which to make the Change in selected wage and salary indicators from June Series Average Weekly Earnings .

If one made this comparison with journalists, a D grade journalist had received over the same time a 198.8 per cent increase. If this comparison was taken with some of the newspapers of this country and looked at in terms of earnings per share, the percentage increase for News Corporation Ltd was 1,420 per cent. If one takes this in relation to the most needy people in the community the comparisons are similarly very marked, with increases generally well in excess of 200 per cent; in relation to doctors and medical practitioners, 231 per cent; and in relation to academics largely in excess of 200 per cent. I think that is a table that ought to be more widely distributed and understood. For that reason, I seek permission to have the table incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.

118,Mr YOUNG,PURPOSES,"in reply-I would like to thank those honourable members who have taken part in the debate. I think that most of what has been said is well known by honourable members. I do not think that the earlier remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) were quite accurate when he said that the decision is reflective of the state of the economy. I remind him that his former Prime Minister before he was a member of the House made similar decisions to this on about four occasions during his seven years of office. So it is not an unusual step to be taken by a government; it just seems to be one of our fates. Could I also say while I am on my feet, because I very rarely have the occasion to host visits from people in my electorate being so far away, that I have a couple of prominent Port Adelaideans, Mr and Mrs Fred Cook, in the audience. I hope they enjoy their trip to Canberra. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

119,Mr RUDDOCK,ACCOUNTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the 248th report of the Committee relating to the Report of the Auditor-General-April 1985, and- I seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted,",270
120,Mr RUDDOCK,ACCOUNTS,"I thank the House for its courtesy. Following the tabling of the report of the Auditor General in April 1985-honourable members will be aware that each year the Committee examines recently published reports of the Auditor-General-the Committee sought written submissions from 10 departments and five statutory authorities in respect of 22 items. Further information and clarification by way of supplementary submissions were sought from six departments and one statutory authority. Report 248 is a departure from the usual practice of the Committee. Due to an increasing work load the Committee decided that the Parliament's attention should be drawn to the salient features of the Auditor-General's report in future. Consequently the principal matters on which the Committee sought comment from departments and authorities were addressed but public hearings were not held on any of the matters raised on this occasion. This report comments on the responses of the departments and authorities to criticisms raised by the Auditor-General. Conclusions drawn by the Committee reflect remedial action taken or proposed to be taken in addressing those items. In particular there were three matters that the Committee wished to bring to the attention of members of Parliament. The first was the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations wage pause program; the second, the Department of Territories administration of the Commissioner for Housing loans scheme and, third, the financial statements of the Australian National University. The Special Employmentrelated Programs Act 1982 provided for the expenditure of up to $200m through a wage pause program of public sector job creation. The money partly represented expected savings from the 12 months suspension of salary increases for Commonwealth employees under the salaries and wages pause legislation. Under the established guidelines the States were required to submit employment projects to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and if considered suitable details were forwarded to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) for approval. Projects which were to receive consideration for approval were required to be labour intensive and to promote greater equality of opportunity particularly for the long term unemployed. The audit review of the scheme sought to establish whether the procedures introduced to administer the program within the area of Commonwealth responsibilities were consistent with the aims and objectives. The Committee was disturbed by the administrative difficulties developed following hasty implementation of the wage pause program, and in particular from the inadequacy of interdepartmental co-ordination. In view of this concern and the fact that this program ceased in mid-1984, the Committee sought supplementary submissions from both the Employment and Industrial Relations Department and the Finance Department with respect to another similar employment program. The House will be familiar with that program, the community employment program. While this program is not subject to audit, the Committee considered it important to assess the administrative arrangement governing it. From the respective departmental submissions, it is clear that the administrative and financial arrangements for the community employment program differ quite markedly from those which applied to the wage pause program. The Minister for Finance has limited executive responsibilities and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations clearly has carriage of the legislation and program administration. Clearer working guidelines and funding through annual appropriations have, to a large degree, clarified the obligations and responsibilities of the agencies concerned. The second matter was the housing loans scheme operational in the Australian Capital Territory. Under the Housing Ordinance 1982 the Commissioner for Housing in May, subject to the control of the Minister for Territories, administers schemes for providing or assisting in providing dwellings in the Australian Capital Territory. On 10 September 1984 the Minister for Finance, pursuant to concern expressed by Cabinet about the management of funds in the scheme, requested the Auditor-General to perform an audit of the recent operations of the scheme in the light of recent over-commitment of funds. Audit findings were that, first, the housing trust account was overexpended from 4 July 1984 to 18 July 1984 in breach of section 34 of the Audit Act, secondly, that there were deficiencies in the administration for controlling equipment; and, thirdly, that the estimated shortfall of $7.9m in funds was an unreliable estimate. The Committee was informed that the Department has now instituted amended procedures and practices in order to eliminate any future problems with over-commitment of funds. Further, the Department has implemented a range of measures to improve the financial and administrative procedures and staffing arrangements of the Housing Branch. These amended which procedures and arrangements implement many of the recommendations of a joint review of the scheme by the Public Service Board and the Department of Territories, conducted during September 1984, and of the Fisher Review conducted during the first half of 1985. The Steering Committee for Housing Loans is continuing to meet on a regular basis to implement the longer term recommendations of the joint review report and will continue to do so until all recommendations are satisfactorily implemented. The Committee notes that Audits comments on these amended schemes and procedures should eliminate future problems. However, I want to emphasise, as I particularly have this view, that the Committee will continue to monitor the Department's operation of the scheme and may subject it to further review in the light of future comments and the Committee's own consideration of more detailed information to be made available to it by the Department. The Auditor-General also reported on an inspection of the accounts and records of financial transactions of the Australian National University for the year ended 31 December 1983. Among other things audit noted serious deficiencies existed in supporting documentation for the university's 1983 draft financial statements, both in their original form and in the revised draft submitted some months later. Audit was concerned that in some respects the university's accounting practices were at variance with those prescribed in the guidelines on the form and standard of financial statements of Commonwealth undertakings issued by the Minister for Finance in May 1983. The Committee notes that the University has significantly reformed its financial administration and that this reform process is continuing. The Committee anticipates continued improvement in the University's financial administration, particularly with reference to its financial statements. The Auditor General now reports twice each year on audits undertaken. In addition separate reports are made throughout the year on efficiency audits performed by the Auditor-General, and annual reports on the financial statements and his activities. During the currency of the examination of the Auditor-General's report of April 1985 the Auditor-General presented an annual report for 1984-85 on his operations. This was the first time the Auditor-General had reported in this manner. The report referred to, amongst other things, a number of issues concerning the role and proper function of the Auditor-General, particularly his relationship with the Executive. The Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts looks forward to discussions with the Auditor-General on these matters. I commend this report to honourable members.",270
121,Mr HODGMAN,ACCOUNTS,"by leave-The report which has just been tabled by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) is a most important report because the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts is a watchdog of the Parliament and a watchdog of the public purse. As a member of parliament who is not a member of that Committee I want to make a brief comment in relation to one aspect of the report, and that is the first part of the three investigations referred to by the honourable member for Dundas relating to the manner in which $200m had been dispersed. Those funds came about as a result of the wage pause legislation of 1982 which, it should be remembered, was brought into this Parliament by the Fraser Government. It is important to note that it was as a result of that legislation that some $200m became available to this Government, the Hawke socialist Government, which was then supposed to do something about getting young people into the work force. I see that honourable members on the Government benches are finding some amusement in this. I do not think that $200m being put aside to help young people into employment, particularly those who have been unemployed for lengthy periods, as the honourable member for Dundas pointed out, is a laughing matter. I think it is a very sad thing that the report has revealed-Mr HoweYou are a joke.",272
122,Mr HODGMAN,ACCOUNTS,"It is all right for you, grave robber, to turn this debate-about which I am trying to make just a short comment-on your Government's failure to deliver $200m worth of efficient employment opportunities to the young people of Australia into a laughing matter. The young people have had the Government. It promised that it would get them jobs but in fact the level of youth unemployment today is higher than it was when Mr Fraser was Prime Minister. It cannot be laughed off either by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) or anybody else when the report contains comments such as 'hasty implementation', 'inadequacy of preparation' and 'non-compliance with guidelines'. This is not a laughing matter. We are talking about $200m provided as a result of a Fraser Government initiative which should have gone towards providing worth-while and permanent employment to young people in this country, and sadly it has not. In conclusion, I draw to the attention of the House the membership of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts so it will be seen that this is not just the view of the Opposition but also that it is the view of a committee which is broadly based, representing both Houses in this Parliament and both sides of this Parliament. Mr Ruddock-All factions of the Labor Party.",272
123,Mr HODGMAN,ACCOUNTS,"All factions of the Labor Party; the left wing, the right wing, the centre, the old guard, the new guard, the mudguard. They are all represented. The Liberal Party and National Party of Australia also are represented. We have representation also from both sides of the Senate. I would like to take this discussion further but I shall not abuse the indulgence that the House has granted. I simply say this: When this Committee reports to the Parliament that $200m of taxpayers' money, which was deliberately set aside to provide work for the young people of this country, has not been used to the best advantage, sadly this is yet another example of the utter financial incompetence, negligence and recklessness of the Hawke socialist Government, which is now on its last legs and, by divine providence, will be out of office at the next election.",273
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ACCOUNTS,"Order! I understand it would suit the convenience of the House for the sitting to be suspended until 8 p.m. If there is no objection, the chair will be resumed at 8 p.m.",273
125,Unknown,ACCOUNTS,"Sitting suspended from 4.40 to 8 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1986-87 Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Keating, and read a first time. Second Reading",273
126,Mr KEATING,ACCOUNTS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1986-87. Over the past year the factors which determine Australia's national prosperity have changed dramatically. The strong economic growth and the huge employment growth of the last three years have now been slowed due to the sudden collapse of our export earnings. The prospects for our future growth, built on the expectation that we could readily sell our traditional products, have been substantially diminished. Many Australians have wondered why the economy was doing so well in 1985 and yet, apparently, doing so poorly in 1986. The answer lies in the dramatic collapse in world commodity prices since late last year. We have been placed in a position where we are failing to cover the cost of our imports to the tune of more than a billion dollars a monthand inevitably our growth had to slow. With the world having slashed our national income by over $6 billion we could not continue on as though nothing had happened. To try would see the world force destructive adjustment on Australia making it hostage to the international financial community. And that is not a position acceptable to this Government. We believe that Australia must maintain control over its own destiny and this can only be done by facing the problem squarely and making the remedial changes quickly and decisively. This the Government will do through this Budget and other policy changes. It is imperative that our domestic economy and our standard of living adjust to our changed trading circumstances so that we can make an early return to higher growth and stronger employment. What precisely are the adjustments required? As a nation, if we are to become more independent and self-sufficient, we need to invest more and consume less. In other words, we must save for the future rather than spend for the present. The Government can help this process directly by spending less and borrowing less, thereby improving the climate for lower interest rates and for private sector investment. The savings and tax decisions in this Budget are also designed to restrain the growth of private consumption. But the Budget alone cannot achieve all of the changes Australia requires. It is also essential that Australians exercise restraint over wages and prices. We simply cannot allow the inevitable inflationary effects of the dollar's fall to feed into our cost structure. Contrary to the beliefs of some, Australia is well equipped to make the adjustments to rectify its problems. We have made enormous progress in the past 3 years in modernising and freeing up the economy. We have a much lower wage cost structure, a vibrant financial sector, and vastly more competitive industries than a few years ago. While we have now encountered serious difficulties in our primary export markets, through our combined efforts and continued restraint we can tllrn those efforts towards new opportunities. For these reasons, the Budget incorporates a very large cut in spending and a very large cut in Government borrowing. In making these vital decisions we have sought to ensure that the burden of change is spread as fairly as possible across the community. Even in difficulty, however, we have maintained the Labor Party's traditional commitment to the most needy. But we have not shirked our responsibility to take hard decisions where these have been required. Reflecting this, the Government has been able to bring the deficit down from $5,726 million last year to $3,503 million this year. I repeat, this Budget cuts the deficit by $2,223 million to $3,503 million. It is also important to understand that while in total the Commonwealth has budgeted for a deficit of $3.5 billion, much of this deficit arises from spending abroad on defence equipment and other items. Allowing for these overseas transactions there will be an estimated domestic budget surplus of $805 million. Combined with reductions in State borrowings, the large cut in the Budget deficit will dramatically lower government demand for borrowed funds. In fact, total public sector borrowings will be cut by more than $2t billion in 1986-87. The Government's bond selling program has been cut from $5.7 billion last year to around $3 billion this year. As a result, the net bond selling task will be zero. I would point out that the large reduction in the deficit this year has been made notwithstanding economic developments tending to increase it. Wage restraint tends to lower taxes more than outlays in the short term. As I shall discuss later, the Budget figuring incorporates a 2 per cent discount to wages in the next National Wage Case. Without that assumption, the deficit would have been some $400 million less. The Government's resolve and achievement in this Budget is well reflected in the fact that if we had taken no action on outlays or receipts the deficit would have been $7.5 billion. We have brought it down by $4 billion, or more than half. NA Madam Speaker, the deficit reduction in this Budget has been accomplished by an examination of outlays of unprecedented rigour. If we had done no more than provide for ongoing programs, outlays would have increased by 2.7 per cent in real terms. We have cut this back to zero real growth. To achieve this result, nearly $3 billion has been cut from existing programs. Cutbacks have been made in most areas, with major reductions falling on social security, health, education, defence and overseas aid. In social security, the Government has decided on cutbacks of over $500 million. Included in those decisions, future six monthly indexation increases to beneficiaries will continue to be paid in full but will be deferred for six weeks. This means that the 4 per cent increase due in early November will now be paid in midDecember. In addition, the measures announced last year to relax income testing arrangements for pensions and benefits will be delayed 8 months until July 1987. These are the only changes to the general pension and benefits area. While seeking a contribution from this part of the Budget towards the resolution of our national problems, the Government has ensured that there will be no reductions in any existing pension or benefit payments. What is being required is a minimal sacrifice when compared with that being asked of wage and salary earners. There will be a crackdown on cheating and fraud in the social security system. We will not compromise our deep commitment to assist the genuinely needy. But abuse of the system will not be tolerated. Special reviews will be conducted by teams of officers to identify and disqualify those wrongfully receiving unemployment benefits. Additionally, reporting requirements for all unemployment beneficiaries will be tightened and it will be much harder for New Zealand citizens who are visiting Australia to qualify for unemployment and other benefits. There will also be reviews of sole parent beneficiaries to verify continuing eligibility. The Government is committed to implementing the Australia Card with a photograph, which will also assist in combatting social security fraud. Child maintenance arrangements are being reformed so that non-custodial parents will shoulder more financial responsibility for their children, rather than throwing the burden onto the taxpayer. In line with the Government's aim to target welfare assistance to the most needy, the family allowance for student children aged 16 and 17 will be income tested so that families with household income exceeding $39,000 will no longer receive it. In the same vein, the Government will in this Budget provide further assistance to the most needy, low income families with children and to the handicapped. These discretionary adjustments are detailed in the Budget Papers. The Government has taken a range of measures to help contain the growing cost of Australia's health system. Spending in this area will be cut by $300 million. First, strict measures have been adopted to reduce what were clearly excessive pathology charges by some medical practitioners. Second, the wage restraint asked of the workforce at large has been extended to medical practitioners by deferring increases in schedule fees until I November 1986. Third, the maximum patient contribution for medical services-I stress the maximum, not the typical-is to be raised from $10 to $20 from 1 November. Fourth, the bed day subsidy to private hospitals will cease from 1 October 1986, but some charitable hospitals will continue to receive assistance. But even with these savings, and particularly with the recent increases in salaries for nurses, the cost of the health system is continuing to rise. The Government therefore believes that the Medicare levy should be increased so that it makes a greater contribution to health costs and so that Medicare is self-financing. Accordingly, the Medicare levy will rise by a quarter of a per cent to 1.25 per cent from 1 December. Increasing the levy is a more equitable means of responding to unavoidable increases in health costs than the alternative of severely curtailing Medicare benefits. Pharmaceutical benefits have been another area of burgeoning costs in the health system. This has been a concern to both the Government and the very sick. New arrangements will reduce costs to the health system and provide relief to those most in need. From 1 November prescription drug users now paying a $5 contribution will pay up to a $10 maximum. New safety net arrangements mean individuals and families requiring more than 25 prescriptions a year will receive prescriptions beyond that number free of charge. Pensioners will continue to receive items on the Pharmaceutical Benefits list free of any charge. The Government believes it is only fair that participants in the higher education system share some part of its costs. Consequently a charge of $250 per year for all higher education students will be introduced in 1987 to offset administration costs. This charge represents only a small part of the cost of providing higher education, and will contribute towards an additional student intake of 3000 in 1987. Lower income families will be protected; holders of tertiary allowances and post-graduate awards and overseas students paying the overseas student charge will not be affected. Spending on defence is to be held at 1 per cent real growth, saving $190 million, and overseas aid will be cut by $140 million from its forward estimate. Expenditure on the new Parliament House is to be reduced by $30 million, sports facilities by $8 million and the Bicentennial Program by $25 million. The number of Commonwealth public servants will be reduced by 2000 over the year to June 1987. The Government has made numerous other expenditure cuts in reaching its $3 billion expenditure savings; details are set out in the Budget Papers. Madam Speaker, the overwhelming concern of the Government in bringing down this Budget has been to achieve an outcome appropriate for a nation with a trading problem of the magnitude now facing Australia. That is why spending has been held to zero real increase. That is why we have sought to produce the lowest practicable budget deficit. The Government has held outlays and the deficit well below the trilogy requirements. Outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product have been reduced to 29.4 per cent, compared with 30.1 per cent last year and 30.4 per cent the year before. The deficit has been reduced to only 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product, back to the average prevailing during the late 1950s and the 1960s. It is the fourth consecutive fall from the 5 per cent in prospect that we inherited from the Coalition Government in 1983. In pursuit of this objective and given the urgency of our predicament the Government has decided to lift the tax ratio about half a per cent above the 1984-85 level. This decision has been taken to achieve an even larger reduction in the deficit, and to do so in an equitable way. Our trilogy of fiscal commitments was directed at restraining the size of Government over the medium-term and we reaffirm that fundamental objective. The Government has been spectacularly successful in lowering expenditure growth and the deficit. Moreover, it is our objective to bring the tax ratio back to 25 per cent of gross domestic product next year. This year, however, the first stage of the very substantial cuts in personal income tax provided by the tax reform program will be delayed three months. These cuts-at the previously announced rates-will now apply from I December this year. The second and final stage-reducing the top marginal tax rates to 49 cents and 40 centswill apply from I July 1987 as scheduled. Legislation implementing both stages is being introduced tonight. These cuts-as well as improving incentivewill return to taxpayers about three times the revenue raised by the tax reform package. Madam Speaker, the Government has adopted a number of other revenue measures. In the main, the measures will restrain real household disposable incomes and consumption, consistent with the need for our living standards to be trimmed for a time. Wholesale sales tax will be increased on a range of consumer products including luxury motor vehicles, wine, certain non-alcoholic beverages and swimming pools. The sales tax law is also to be amended with effect from midnight tonight to curtail avoidance of taxes on computer software. The excise on petrol and diesel fuel will increase by 3 cents per litre from tonight. Because of the existing diesel rebate arrangements, this additional excise will not fall upon farmers and miners. The rates of the Bank Account Debits Tax will be increased by up to a half from 1 December 1986. The tax deferral advantages enjoyed by some companies with substituted accounting periods will be phased out over three years. NA Madam Speaker, the Budget. I have outlined tonight will greatly assist Australia to adapt to the new international trading circumstances we face. However, budget policy must be supported by continued price and wage moderation. The restructuring of Australian industry facilitated by the depreciation of the dollar will accelerate provided we stay competitive with the rest of the world. Staying competitive means having a greater ability to supply our own market with Australian-made goods and to win a larger share of world markets. Over the past 3 years Australia's working men and women have shown commendable income restraint. More than any other single factor, their cooperation and good sense has been responsible for the creation of 630,000 jobs since April 1983. Over this period real labour costs have fallen by more than 7 per cent. It is not the fault of wage and salary earners that export prices have fallen. Just as it is not their fault that the dollar has fallen, pushing up import prices. But we cannot afford to let wages grow automatically in line with this price surge. If adverse trading conditions and a depreciating Australian dollar are the cause of the Consumer Price Index rising, it follows that to allow those increases to flow through automatically into wages would compound our problems. We would be adjusting our wages upwards not to compensate for the problem but to build the problem in. This would only lead Australia into a price and wage spiral. I am certain that all Australians will understand and accept that we cannot have our national income slashed by over $6 billion and at the same time seek to fully maintain our wages in real terms. Accordingly, at the next National Wage Case when the combined 4.0 per cent movement in the March and June quarter Consumer Price Index will be considered, the Government will argue to the Arbitration Commission that the proposed increase in wages be cut by 2 per cent. This means that wages will rise by 2 per cent less than the increase which would fully compensate for inflation. There are good and clear reasons for this. Last year award wages grew by 4 1/2 per cent. With a 2 per cent discount, wages are expected to grow at about the same moderate rates as in 1985-86. This means that over the course of the next year Australian wage increases will be broadly comparable with our major trading partners. A 2 per cent discount would therefore maintain our competitiveness and preserve our ability to compete on favourable terms with the rest of the world. The Government will also seek a further adjustment of the wage increase in the case commencing around April next year if economic conditions applying at the time warrant it. In determining its attitude to that case, the Government's main focus will continue to be on Australia's ongoing competitive position and our terms of trade performance. With its past record of success, the Government reaffirms its confidence in the Prices and Incomes Accord. The Accord framework will continue to deliver more economically and industrially responsible outcomes than any other real world alternative. The challenges now presented by severely depressed commodity prices demand a continuation of this approach. NA Madam Speaker, it will take some time for the ground lost in our export markets to be recovered, and a stronger growth path to be resumed. As a result, we expect growth in the non-farm economy to be around 2 1/2 per cent in 198687 compared with 4 per cent last financial year. Most of that growth will stem from our improved international competitiveness; it will show up in the winning of new export markets and the replacement of imports with locally produced goods. However, the lower growth rate means that fewer jobs will be created over the next year than in the last twelve months. Employment growth is expected to slow to between 1 1/2 and 2 per cent, and as a consequence, unemployment could rise a little. Just as it will take some time for the benefits of the depreciation of the dollar to flow through the economy, it will also take some time before the adverse price effects of the depreciation are behind us. Consequently, reflecting the recent falls in the dollar, we expect the Consumer Price Index to increase by around 8 per cent on average in 1986-87. However, the trend in the latter part of the year and beyond will be downward. Madam Speaker, the Budget. I am presenting tonight responds decisively to the new international challenge facing Australia. It constitutes one of the basic and fundamental responses required to permanently improve Australia's trading performance. It makes the major shift down in Government spending and borrowing that will permit the new investment opportunities to be seized: - real spending growth has been cut to zero; - the deficit has been dramatically brought back to its late 1950s and 60s levels; and - Government calls on the nation's savings have been substantially alleviated. This Budget provides Australia with the opportunity to surmount its economic problems and maintain control over its economic destiny. It demonstrates the Government's absolute determination to do what has to be done to safeguard Australia's economic future. It demonstrates once again that, by resolute action and by some sacrifice all round, there is no problem that we cannot face and defeat together. Madam Speaker, I now provide more details of the expenditure cuts that have been made. Budget outlays in 1986-87 are estimated to total $74,764 million. As I stated earlier, this represents zero growth in real terms. In the previous thirty years lower real rates of growth have been achieved on only three occasions. This outcome reflects the determined approach which the Government has adopted to expenditure control. Details of individual decisions are contained in the Measures section of Statement No 3; additional information will be provided, as appropriate, by the relevant Ministers. The Prime Minister will also be making a detailed statement on Public Service staffing matters in the next few weeks. NA I have already outlined our major initiatives in this area. I stress once again: The Government has a commendable record of directing assistance to those in greatest need. Over the term of the Hawke Government there have been significant increases in the real value of pensions and benefits, and large gains in assistance provided for children in low income families. This Budget continues the Government's focus on improving benefits for those in need, on removing anomalies and attacking fraud. In addition to the measures I have already announced, action is to be taken to prevent some people qualifying for dual benefits. From 1 November 1986, where a newly eligible war or defence widow pensioner is also eligible for a social security pension, the maximum level of the social security pension will be frozen at $60.05 a week. I mentioned earlier that some benefits to the most needy in the community were to be increased. To assist pensioners and low income families with children, there will be a $1 a week increase in the additional pension and benefit per child and a $1 a week increase in the rate of the Family Income Supplement from November 1986. OUTLAYS In recognition of the difficulties and additional costs facing disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training, the mobility allowance will increase to $11 a week from November this year. The handicapped child's allowance will increase by $7 per month to $92 per month from November 1986. And also from November, the orphan's pension will increase by $4.30 to $60 per month. A clear need has been established for the Government to provide additional income support for 16 and 17 year olds who are the victims of abuse within their own families or cannot live at home. Consequently, a Young Homeless Allowance of $23.28 a week has been introduced to supplement the income these young people receive from education allowances or unemployment benefits. Expenditure in 1986-87 for that purpose is estimated to be about $9 million. NA When dealing earlier with the Government's major proposals in the health portfolio, I stressed that we were adamant that health funding must be kept within reasonable bounds. Consequently, in addition to those other measures, we will investigate the payment of medical benefits which are growing at above average rates and review mechanisms for further restraining growth in health costs. The Isolated Patient Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme will be transferred to the States. Extra funding of $11 million this year and $22 million in a full year will be provided to the States and Territories to enable them to provide more effective arrangements. Funding has been increased in a number of important areas in the health portfolio. These include health promotion, public health, hepatitis B vaccinations, medical research, family planning and assistance to diabetics. NA I have already mentioned the Government's intention to impose an administration charge on higher education students. In addition, the overseas student charge currently applicable to university and CAE students will be extended to secondary, TAFE and other previously exempt higher education students from overseas. Together with increases in existing charges, this extension will yield $7.3 million, offsetting the costs of providing education to overseas students in Australia. An anomaly exists in current arrangements whereby some social security beneficiaries can receive both student allowances and pensions or benefits. This is to be removed for new entrants from the 1987 academic year, saving $4 million. A special payment of $15 per week will instead be made to invalid and sole parent pensioners who are also students to encourage their education and later employment prospects. NA There has been a significant re-ordering of priorities within this function and, overall, cut in spending. Flowing from last year's decision to implement the Priority One program, expenditure on job training programs will increase by $67 million, including an increased allocation of $33 million for the Australian Traineeship System. This accords with the Government's intention that training and education opportunities available to our young people be significantly enhanced. Increased emphasis on training is to be complemented by reduced emphasis on Government job creation schemes. Consequently, outlays under the Community Employment Program will be reduced by $90 million to $200 million. The 2 per cent wage discount recently applied to wages is to be extended to former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force personnel receiving Government superannuation benefits. NA Assistance to Aboriginals will undergo a significant change in emphasis following the Government's endorsement of the general principles espoused in the Miller Report on Aboriginal Employment Training. The emphasis of existing programs will be changed from short-term job creation and welfare measures towards policies to establish long term employment opportunities. Commonwealth expenditure directed towards Aboriginals will total $570 million in 1986-87. NA Real growth in defence spending has been cut to 1 per cent in 1986-87, a significant reduction on the 3.75 per cent allowed for in the Five Year Defence Program. Nevertheless, average real growth in defence spending under this Government remains greater than that under our predecessors. Recently the Government has begun the most thorough and comprehensive review of this country's defence priorities since the Second World War. In light of the Dibb Report and prevailing economic circumstances, the Government will now prepare a White Paper on Defence which will set down the development of Australia's defence capabilities well into the future. This report will reflect the need to maintain a real planning at achievable financial outcomes. Such a disciplined approach will ensure that essential changes can take place in equipment and force structure. NA The Special Broadcasting Service and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are to be amalgamated, and their combined funding reduced by $16 million from last year's allocation. The specialised charter of the SBS will be preserved under the amalgamation. Gross savings from shared facilities, accommodation, equipment and administration in the amalgamated organisations should be about $2 million in 1986-87 and much greater in future years. We are also reducing the cost of administrative assistance to the arts. As a first step, the Australia Council's istrative expenses for 1986-87 are to be reduced by $1 million to allow increased support for the arts. A wide-ranging review of the Commonwealth's funding of museums is to be undertaken. The construction of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra will not proceed on the timetable previously conceived; its future will be considered following this review. INDUSTR y ASSISTANCE All production bounties other than those applying to fertilisers and shipbuilding are to be reduced by 20 per cent from tonight, saving $43 million. There will be a phased reduction in the shipbuilding bounty rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. The consumption subsidy for fertilisers will no longer apply to imported products and the savings will be reallocated to increase subsidy rates on locally manufactured phosphatic fertilisers. The ban on uranium exports to France has failed to serve its original purpose and was in fact bestowing a benefit by allowing France to contract elsewhere for uranium at lower prices.",273

143,Mr KEATING,CULTURE AND RECREATION,"This means that total roads funding will be maintained at $1,250m, the same nominal level this year as last. The Government announced in May that it intended to recoup $40m in aviation expenditures by implementing a cost recovery plan. These savings are now to be expanded to $49 million. NA The cost of fulfilling Freedom of Information requests is currently estimated at some $14m a year, compared with offsetting revenue of $60,000. While the Government remains firmly committed to the principles of Freedom of Information, it believes that a greater proportion of the costs should be borne by users of this service. Charges will be increased but free access will be maintained for inquiries relating to personal income maintenance documents. NA NA The Commonwealth remains committed to sharing the cost of constructing Darwin's new power station but has informed the NT Government that it will be halving, as of tonight, assistance with operating costs reflecting in the main the lower costs of its oil feedstock. This will save $21 million this year. NA Commonwealth business enterprises receive a significant interest rate benefit due to the fact that their borrowings are guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government. From 1986-87 an annual charge will be applied to borrowings by the Commonwealth's business enterprises which are guaranteed by the Commonwealth. This measure is expected to raise about $7 million in 1986-87. NA Madam Speaker, I have already indicated the major revenue measures in the Budget. I shall now give further details. The measures are more extensively described in Statement No 4 of Budget Paper No I. NA Madam Speaker, the fundamental cuts to marginal income tax rates that I announced as the centrepiece of the Government's Tax Reform Package will proceed. The 60 cent rate wi1l be cut to 49 cents, the 48 cent and 46 cent rates to 40 cents and the other marginal tax rates to 29 and 24 cents. These massive income tax cuts wi1l produce a fairer and more efficient tax system, under which all Australian taxpayers will be better off. However, as I indicated earlier, the serious international economic predicament which Australia faces has required the deferral of the first stage of these tax cuts until 1 December this year, reducing the cost to revenue in 1986-87 from $2085 million to $1435 million. Legislation to give effect to the lower rates of tax, including those to apply from 1 July 1987, will be introduced tonight. These reductions are only possible because of the Government's moves to eliminate the inequities and abuses of our tax system which have persisted for so long and because of our demonstrated ability to restrain expenditures. They are an integral part of our overall program to establish the foundations for Australia's future economic growth and prosperity. NA To reduce the heavy tax discrimination against beer and spirits drinkers in favour of wine, the rate of sales tax on alcoholic wine and cider is to be increased from 10 per cent to the standard sales tax rate of 20 per cent from tonight. This is expected to increase revenue by $47 million in 1986-87. At present carbonated soft drinks and mineral waters are subject to sales tax of 20 per cent while other non-alcoholic beverages are exempt. In order to reduce this discrimination, sales tax at 10 per cent will apply from tonight to packaged flavoured milk, previously exempt fruit juice products and non-alcoholic wine and cider. This measure will yield revenue of $60 million in 1986-87. From tonight the rate of sales tax is to increase from 20 to 30 per cent on luxury cars and station wagons. This will affect broadly those vehicles whose retail price exceeds the depreciation cost limit for income tax purposes-that is $29,646 in 198687. The revenue yield in 1986-87 is $28 million. Avoidance of sales tax occurs through the device of selling only the discs and tapes on which computer software is embodied and licensing the consumer to use the software itself; sales tax is then payable only on the value of the discs, which is a small fraction of the total price. The sales tax law is to be amended, with effect from midnight tonight, to ensure that the taxable sale value of the computer discs or tapes encompasses the software on them. The production of ""in-house"" software will not be affected by the change, nor will exports of software or business purchases of software which are exempted as an aid to manufacture. Expected revenue raised from this measure is $80 million in 1986-87. Finally in the sales tax area, the Government has decided to change, with effect from midnight tonight, the classification for sales tax purposes of a number of goods so as to reduce anomalies and inconsistencies. The areas affected include swimming pools, hand tools, photographic developing and bathroom fittings. Details are provided in Statement No 4. NA The Bank Account Debits Tax rates will be increased from 1 December 1986. The highest rate will increase from $1.50 to $2.00; other rates will increase by up to a half. Revenue will increase by $45 million in 1986-87. NA I announced earlier that excise on petrol and diesel will increase 3 cents per litre with effect from tonight. This will yield $625 million in 1986-87 and $715 million in a full year. The decline in international oil prices and consequent reduction in import parity prices had substantially reduced Government revenue from the taxation of petroleum products. Even with this measure, total Commonwealth revenue from the taxation of petroleum products will be little changed from 1985-86. A.C.T. TAXES The Commonwealth Grants Commission has found that the financial contribution from the Australian Capital Territory continues to be low relative to that in the States. In those circumstances it is considered fair that revenue raised in the A.C.T. be increased. The Minister for Territories and I are releasing a separate statement detailing the measures to be taken, which include introduction of a land tax on business properties and increases in gambling taxes and stamp duties. NA An anti-avoidance measure will be introduced to overcome arrangements whereby members of closely held partnerships or trusts have sought to avoid provisional tax by manipulating the distribution of income between partners or beneficiaries from one year to the next. This will raise revenue by $50 million In 1986-87. NA NA The Economic and Rural Policy Statement of 15 April 1986 announced changes to stock valuation arrangements for animal stud breeders generally. As the tax deferral advantages associated with stock valuations are generally much greater for horse breeders, the Government has decided to restrict valuation changes to them, and then only in respect of service fees. Other animal breeders, such as sheep and cattle breeders, will not now be affected. A separate statement gives the details. NA A small number of companies receive substantial tax deferral benefits through adoption of an accounting year for tax purposes which finishes on a date earlier than 30 June. Relative to other companies, such companies are able to defer payment of tax for up to six months. To remove the tax deferral advantage, it is proposed to advance the due dates for payment of their quarterly instalments and assessments. This change, which affects only the timing of tax payments and not the size of tax liabilities, will be phased in over the three years starting 1986-87. Less than 5 per cent of all companies will be affected by the change, which is expected to yield about $220 million in 1986-87 and in each of the following two years. NA The Dibb Report on Australia's defence capability envisaged an enhanced role for the Defence Force Reserve. The Government has decided to reinstate full taxation exemption of the pay of Defence Force Reservists from I January 1987. At the same time the special reserve allowance will be discontinued as an offset. NA As I announced earlier, the Medicare levy will be increased from one per cent to It per cent, from 1 December 1986. The estimated gain to revenue is $175 million in 1986-87. Threshold levels are to be raised to ensure that low income earners continue not to pay the levy. NA The taxation rebates for people receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits will be increased again this year to ensure that people wholly or mainly dependent on such benefits are not liable to tax. NA NA NA From the 1986-87 income year, sportspersons and performing artists are to be eligible for income tax averaging provisions designed to smooth out tax liabilities on fluctuating incomes. Anomalies in the existing authors and inventors scheme are to be removed. NA The validity period of Australian passports will be extended from 5 to 10 years and the fee increased from $30 to $60. NA It is the Government's intention to shift some of the present burden from monetary policy. Lower interest rates would be compatible with stronger domestic economic activity and balance of payments adjustment provided other policies are taking more of the weight of that adjustment process. That is one reason why it has been so important to achieve substantial cuts in the Budget deficit and the public sector borrowing requirement in 1986-87. As I said earlier, total public sector gross borrowings are estimated to faU by over $2t billion this year. As a ratio to GOP, the gross PSBR will fall to about 4.4 per cent, compared with 6.0 per cent in 1985-86 and a peak of 8.1 per cent in 1983-84. Treasury Bond Tenders in 1986-87 are expected to total around $3 billion. In net terms there wi1l be no new bond raisings. The whole program will be accounted for by the roll-over of maturing debt. The gross program compares with $5.7 billion in 1985-86 and a peak of $9.7 billion in 198384. Consistent with this reduced program, the Treasury is announcing tonight details of the next Bond Tender for an amount of $400 miUion. Last year's move to a more even spread of tenders over the year was well received. A similar schedule is planned for this year. These measures will help to ease pressures on domestic financial markets and to lower interest rates. Actual interest rate movements will depend also on what happens to overseas interest rates and to inflationary and exchange rate expectations. In assessing the appropriateness of monetary policy, we will continue to review a wide range of current and prospective financial and general economic indicators. The Government's basic objective for monetary policy is for it to play its role in full support of other policies. We will maintain a firm monetary policy, consistent with the need to reduce inflation and to finance a current account deficit which is likely to remain large in 1986-87. NA Madam Speaker, in conclusion I wish to return to the main theme of tonight's Budget. I have made it clear that our prime concern was to set in place the pre-conditions for a turnaround in the current account deficit. Already there is clear evidence that the underlying forces are working as expected. Last financial year there was a 7.4 per cent increase in the volume of Australia's exports. Import volumes declined quite sharply-in the first half of 1986 they fell at an annual rate of more than 10 per cent. This is the beginning of the necessary structural adjustments which I have described-the switching to new products and activities. But this welcome improvement in export volumes and reduction in import volumes were over-shadowed by the big falls in world commodity prices. As quickly as we lifted export volumes, export prices feU. And in the shorter term, while we still maintain our heavy dependence on primary exports, our problem with commodity prices is not going to go away. Large falls in import volumes are in prospect this financial year, and further export growth is expected. But once again we must expect those positive outcomes to be masked by poor prices. As a result, on present indications, little change is expected in our current account deficit as a percentage of GDP for 1986-87 as a whole. For seasonal and other reasons, we expect a number of large monthly deficits over the remainder of this calendar year. Looking further ahead, the fundamental adjustments now underway in the economy should help to achieve substantial reductions beyond 1986-87. Madam Speaker, when this Government was elected to office in March 1983 we inherited from our Coalition predecessors a massively debilitated economy. We faced a Budget deficit of unprecedented magnitude, double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and the first negative growth in 30 years. Over the past three and a half years, with absolute determination and the co-operation of the Australian people, we have overcome these legacies. With historic levels of economic and employment growth and our sweeping reforms to the financial and taxation systems, our record of achievement is an enviable one. Now there are new challenges to overcome. The sudden collapse in the prices of our exports and the resulting loss of national income has forced a range of essential adjustments on the nation. The 1986-87 Budget which 1I have presented tonight rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy. Earlier 1 said that by resolute action and some sacrifice all round we can face and defeat any problem. This means staying competitive with the rest of the world and trading out of our difficulties. This is the only path to higher growth, real independence and greater prosperity. This will be this Budget's crowning achievement. 1 commend the Budget to the House.

144,Mr KEATING,CONCLUSION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1986-87 totalling $4,733,724,000. Of this amount, $2,108,520,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No.2) 198687: The balance of $2,625,204,000 will be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been approved previously. Provision is made also for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory. An amount of $130m is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, the same amount as was provided in the Supply Act (No.2) 1986-87 which this Bill, when enacted, will subsume.

ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR INTERNA Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading",285
148,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPEAL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to abolish the Advisory Council for InterGovernment Relations following on the report of the Task Force established in September 1985 to review the ACIR. The Task Group presented its report in January 1986 after extensive consultations with the contributing parties and written submissions from the public. I have tabled the report earlier today in the House. ACIR was established by the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations Act 1976 with the object of improving inter-government co-operation between the spheres of Federal, State and local government through research and recommendations made under directions provided by Premier's Conference. In addition to representatives of governments, the Council has included representatives from the Commonwealth Opposition, and citizen members. As noted in the Task Group report, ACIR has not established a reputation for high quality research generally, and has tended to be remote from the practice of inter-governmental relations. Nor have its recommendations on the whole been acted on by participating governments. As a result ACIR has had limited success in improving inter-governmental relations, particularly Commonwealth-State relations. The decision to abolish the Council has been agreed to by all States and the Northern Territory, with the exception of Tasmania. The Government considers that existing mechanisms, including Premiers' Conferences and Ministerial Councils, are adequate to provide effective inter-governmental consultations without the need for a separate research body. I commend the Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr N. A. Brown) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1986 Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read a first time. Second Reading BILL 1986 Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-SmithAttorney-General) (9.08)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill I am introducing tonight is to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Freedom of Information (Charges) Regulations to reduce administrative costs and increase revenues. The main points are: introduction of application fees for requests for access to documents and for internal review of decisions; to increase the hourly charge for search and retrieval of documents; to introduce an hourly charge for decision making time; to exempt persons seeking personal income maintenance documents from all charges and fees; to maintain after 1 December 1986 the present 45-day time limit for processing requests; to strengthen provisions for refusal of requests on workload grounds; to reduce the grounds for remission of charges; to reduce the obligations on agencies to publish section 8 and section 9 statements and to report statistics; and miscellaneous amendments of a minor nature. As is clear from the introduction of this Bill tonight, the Government continues to be concerned by the costs of operation and administration of the Freedom of Information Act and by the very low contribution made by users towards meeting those costs. Honourable members will recollect that in June 1985 the Government issued new directions designed to maximise disclosure of information whilst reducing the costs of administering the Freedom of Information Act. Administrative aspects of those measures, particularly the clearance role of my Department, have been valuable in reducing the number of disputes about release of information. Furthermore, costs of processing requests have continued to decrease as agencies gain experience and improve procedures. However, the other major aspect of the Government's directions-changes to the Charges Regulations designed to simplify charging procedures and recoup a more significant contribution by users of the legislationwere frustrated by the Senate when the amendments were disallowed on 13 November 1985. In 1984-85 the operation and administration of the FOI Act cost the Commonwealth between $16m and $19m, depending on the precise allowance made for overheads, and the preliminary figures for 1985-86 indicate a cost between $14m and $16m. Although there is some indication that the total number of requests is levelling off-preliminary estimates for 1985-86 are 36,000 to 37,000 requests as against 33,000 in 198485-it is clear that administration of the Act will continue to involve very substantial Commonwealth expenditure. It is also clear that under the present charging structure only very small contributions will be received from users of the legislation-about $22,000 in 1984-85 and perhaps $60,000 in 1985-86-or rather less than half a per cent of the administration costs. Australia simply cannot afford such a situation. The problems identified by the Government in June 1985 remain. Ways must be found to reduce costs and encourage efficient use of the Act. Economic circumstances are such that the Government must take action now. In recent months an inter-departmental committee has been examining options for FOI costs savings. This Bill draws on the work of that Committee, though there will doubtless be further possibilities for longer term consideration when it reports. The operation and administration of the FOI Act is also currently under review by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. That wide-ranging review will doubtless encompass costs questions. Background Whilst the urgency of the current economic situation requires government action now, this does not preclude further consideration of the issues in the light of the reports of the interdepartmental Committee and the Senate Standing Committee. I shall briefly describe the main features of this Bill. Further details may be obtained from the explanatory memorandum. (Quorum formed) Application Fees The Bill proposes a $30 application fee for all requests. This will cover the cost of basic administrative procedures involved in processing the request. The existing $8 charge in respect of administrative procedures will be subsumed in this fee. It will be necessary to pay the fee when making a request. Until the fee is paid there will be no obligation on the agency to deal with the request. Processing Charges The existing charge of $12 per hour in respect of time spent searching for and retrieving documents is to be increased to $15 per hour. This increase takes some account of increases in wages and other costs since the charge was set in 1982. Where requested documents cover sensitive areas such as security, law enforcement, business, policy development and the like, it is often necessary for agencies to consult widely about possible implications of disclosure and to give very careful consideration to the consequences. This can be a costly process which must often be carried out by senior officers. It has accordingly been decided to introduce a new charge of $20 per hour in respect of the time spent determining what access can be granted to a document.",285
149,Mr NA BROWN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS,What if they take all day to decide it?,286
150,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS,"Well, that is $20 an hour. Internal Reviews Whilst internal review is certainly less costly than review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and is therefore a desirable intermediate stage, there is nothing in the existing charges structure to encourage an applicant to first consider whether he has been properly treated by the agency. He can always hope that review will result in release of more material, or in other favourable action, at no cost to himself. It is accordingly proposed that there be a $40 application fee for internal review of agency decisions. Personal Income Maintenance Documents No fees or charges will be payable by persons seeking access to their own personal income maintenance documents. The only exception will be where the person has already had access during the preceding three months and there has been no material change to the documents concerned. The existing provision for remission of charges provides that account must be taken of whether a request relates to a person's personal affairs, whether payments would cause hardship and whether disclosure of the documents is in the public interest. The last criterion has caused particular administrative difficulty. In practice many claims for remission on public interest grounds have been generated by members of parliament who have other effective means of access to government information or by media organisations operating on a commercial basis which are well able to make some contribution towards meeting the costs of processing their requests. It is proposed to remove this as a mandatory consideration in considering remission of charges. The existing remission provisions are not procedurally suited to dealing with remission of the new application fees. A new section will permit remission of an application fee on the limited grounds that payment would cause financial hardship and that the documents related to the applicant's personal affairs. 45-Day Time Limit As the Act stands at present the time limit for responding to requests would reduce to 30 days from I December 1986. Meeting this reduced time limit would require extra agency staff. It is proposed to maintain the present 45-day time limit. Refusal on Work Load Grounds Some requests have absorbed very large resources, adding up to many staff-months or even staff-years. Three difficulties have been encountered in applying the existing provisions in the Act enabling refusal of requests on work load grounds: First, only large requests directed towards classes of documents can be refused. Requests for large numbers of individually specified documents cannot be refused; Secondly, there is no simple test of what constitutes an unreasonable work load; and Thirdly, the tests take account only of time spent searching for and retrieving documents but not, generally speaking, time spent in consultation and deliberation regarding exempt content. The first difficulty will be met by extending the exemption to cover requests for large numbers of identified documents. As for the second Remission difficulty, whilst it would seem to involve a substantial diversion of resources in a large department to spend, say, more than five full staffdays processing a single request, such a diversion of resources could totally disrupt a small agency or office, particularly if it arose when staff were heavily pressed by other commitments. It is not therefore at this stage proposed to introduce an absolute limit on work load. The test will simply be whether the likely total work in dealing with the request would substantially divert the resources of the agency from its other operations; would interfere substantially with the performance by the Minister of the Minister's functions; or would result in substantial delays in dealing with other requests. The last point has been introduced as it would seem quite unfair that one person who made a large request should be able to hinder access to government information by other persons. The third difficulty will be met by providing that the total work shall be estimated having regard not only to the location and retrieval of relevant documents but also to the consultation and deliberation involved in deciding upon exempt matter. Publication of Information on Agencies At present agencies are required to publish separately statements concerning their organisation and functions. This results in significant duplication of material normally included in agency annual reports. The Bill proposes that the publications be amalgamated. The Act also requires publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of an index of manuals, guidelines and other internal documents used by agencies in decision-making. There has been little evidence of public demand for such materials sufficient to justify printing and publication in bulk. The Bill proposes that copies of the index be available for inspection and purchase at the information access offices already established. This 'publication on demand' will avoid printing and publication costs without diminishing public access to the information. Agency Statistics I am currently required to report annually to Parliament on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. A wide range of statistical information must be provided to my Department by agencies for this purpose at considerable cost. It is proposed to very much simplify this statistical information which must be reported. The Bill proposes a reduction to the minimum considered necessary for monitoring the general operation of the Act. Miscellaneous Amendments Apart from minor amendments consequential on the major changes described above, the Bill makes an amendment of section 45 to ensure that material provided in confidence to government by non-government sources will be protected even where the information has been incorporated in internal working documents. As the Health Insurance Commission now has certain functions in relation to investigation of Medicare fraud and overservicing it is no longer appropriate that the Commission should be totally exempt from the operation of the Act. Its transfer from Part I to Part II of the Schedule will provide that it is exempt only in relation to documents concerning its competitive commercial activities. Application The new fees and charges in the Bill will take effect only in respect of future applications and requests. Conclusion It is estimated that total revenue to be derived from the above measures will be about $4m per year. Additionally, the measures in relation to publication, statistics and burdensome requests will result in cost savings of about $4m. Together, the measures will reduce the net cost of the Freedom of Information Act by about $8m or 50 per cent. This is a significant contribution towards meeting the Government's budgetary objectives. Honourable members will note that these savings do not result from significantly reduced rights of access. The express exemption from fees and charges of persons seeking access to personal income maintenance documents will protect those who are most vulnerable in respect of access to information they need. The remission provisions will continue to protect other persons where hardship might otherwise prevent access to personal documents. In other cases requestors will make a contribution towards the costs of providing the benefit they receive. I commend the Bill to the House, I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

154,Mr DA WKINS,MARITIME COLLEGE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In the Budget Speech and in a statement issued tonight by the Minister for Education (Senator Ryan), the Government announced details of its tertiary education policies for 1987. The Government will maintain the momentum of its policies, including the maintenance of growth, provision for disadvantaged groups, the development of stronger links with industry, and the maintenance of rational steady planning as the basis for decision making. To support continued growth in the system, increased resources are required and, as a result of Budget decisions, funds available to tertiary education institutions will increase by 2.6 per cent in real terms in 1987. In the budgetary circumstances outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), however, the Government has decided to introduce an administraBILL 1986 tion charge of $250 per higher education student per annum from 1987 as a contribution towards the administrative costs of institutional budgets. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision in respect of higher education students in institutions in the States and Northern Territory funded by the Commonwealth. The charge will apply equally to all full time, part time and external students undertaking award course or courses which could form part of an award at a university, college of advanced education or other institutions where the Commonwealth funds higher education places. Institutions will be required to collect the administration charge at the time of enrolment. For each institution the Commonwealth general recurrent grant payable for a given year will be reduced by an amount equivalent to 90 per cent of the revenue estimated to be derived from the charge. The remaining 10 per cent of revenue, estimated at $9.306m for the States and the Northern Territory in 1987, will be retained by the institutions for expenditure within the institutions for their own purposes. The Bill provides for an appropriate adjustment to be made to payments in the following year where the reduction in grant does not match 90 per cent of the actual administration charge collected. The charge will be indexed on an annual basis according to CTEC processes for adjusting administrative-that is, non-academic-salary costs. The Bill provides for exemption from the charge for institutions' own award holders, full fee paying overseas students and both full time and part time students who are pensioners and beneficiaries in the categories eligible for an ucation allowance for full time studies. Beneficiaries under the age related education allowance scheme, incorporating TEAS, the post-graduate awards scheme, or PGA, and Abstudy grants, who are liable for the charge, will have their benefit increased by the value of the charge. Similarly, the overseas student charge applying to subsidised overseas students will be reduced by the amount of the administration charge. Under these arrangements the Government estimates gross revenue collections by institutions in the States and Northern Territory at $93.064m in 1986-87 of which the institutions will retain $9.306m for their purposes. Adjustments to student assistance benefits and the overseas students charge will cost $27.7m. Revenue from the charge is therefore estimated at $56.057m in 1986-87. Consequential changes in respect of Commonwealth institutions are being made in other Bills being introduced today. I commend the Bill to the House and take this opportunity to table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr N. A. Brown) adjourned.

155,Mr DA WKINS,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 4 of the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979, to extend the charge liability to overseas students who enrol in government and private secondary schools, and courses at technical and further education level institutions for which Commonwealth funding is received. The intention is to recoup a proportion of the cost to the Commonwealth of supporting places for overseas students at Australian education institutions. Charge liability is also extended to include diplomatic and consular representatives, their staff and dependants, who undertake tertiary courses. The further purpose of the Bill is to amend section 6 of the principal Act to fix the charge rates for the 1987 academic year. The new levels of charge are indicated in the Bill. As foreshadowed in 1985, the increase in the overseas students charge proposed in the Bill, for university and advanced education level courses, raises the contribution of a new student or one who comed- menced the course after 1 January 1986 to 45 per cent of the full average cost of a place. In respect of a student who commenced the course before 1 January 1986, the charge represents 32 per cent of the full average cost, or an increase of 15 per cent over the 1986 level. The amount of the overseas students charge will be reduced by $250, the amount of the higher education administration charge to be payable by all higher education students in respect of the enrolment. T AFE overseas students who commenced their courses prior to 1 January 1987 will pay 32 per cent of the average Commonwealth contribution to T AFE costs, and new T AFE students will pay 45 per cent.

156,Mr DA WKINS,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to vary the categories of students exempt from the overseas students charge. This is affected by including in the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act 1979, through inserting section 4A, those categories of students who are exempt from the charge. The current exemption provision relating to a postgraduate student who is the holder of a scholarship to the value of at least $3,500 per annum awarded by an Australian institution is now limited to a person who has been granted such a scholarship and commenced study before 1 January 1987. It is also proposed to withdraw the charge exemption provision for a postgraduate student who is the holder of a scholarship awarded by the Australian-American Educational Foundation. The proposed extension of the charge, as from 1 January 1987, to postgraduate students who are awarded a scholarship by an educational institution in Australia on or after 1 January 1987, and to all Australian-American Educational Foundation scholarship holders, is expected to raise approximately $1.2m in 1986-87. The further purpose of the Bill is to amend section 7 of the principal Act to restrict the capacity of a department or authority of the Commonwealth to discharge the liability of a student to whom that department or authority has granted a scholarship or like award, to postgraduate scholarship holders who commenced study before 1 January 1987. I commend the Bill to the House. I take the opportunity to table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. LOANS BILL 1986 Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Hurford, and read a first time. Second Reading",290
157,Mr HURFORD,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.35)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective Budget deficit in 1986-87 and in subsequent years together with the associated prospective deficits in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Legally, payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed moneys available to that Fund. In order to meet any prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund it is customary to seek legislative authority to charge defence and other Consolidated Revenue Fund expenditure to, or reimburse the Consolidated Revenue Fund from, the Loan Fund. This Bill therefore seeks authority to borrow money for defence and other purposes and to enable certain other expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I should make it clear, however, that the Bill does not authorise defence or other expenditures additional to those otherwise authorised by Parliament under annual Appropriation Acts and under Acts providing for special or standing appropriations. The Bill is simply a machinery financing measure-the provisions of the Bill in fact explicitly prohibit borrowings for expenditures additional to those authorised by the Parliament. Successive governments have, for many years, introduced legislation in the form of an annual Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures or to reimburse the Consolidated Revenue Fund from Loan Fund in respect of certain non-defence expenditures. In view of the non-controversial, accounting nature of the legislation, which has been acknowledged by all the major political parties in the Parliament, the Bill has been drafted as standing rather than annual legislation. That is, the Bill would provide authority for the necessary financing measures for 1986-87 and subsequent financial years to the extent necessary in the light of the respective years' Budget deficits. Standing loan legislation will in no way detract from Parliament's ability to debate the Budget, nor, as I have already stated, does it impinge upon the Parliament's prerogative to authorise, and appropriate moneys for, expenditures for particular purposes. In the Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that the Budget deficit in prospect for 1986-87 is estimated to be some $3.5 billion. This gives rise to a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of around $5.1 billion-the Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit can differ somewhat from the Budget deficit as some CRF expenditures and receipts are classified as financing transactions in the functional classification of Budget outlays and, for the purposes of the Budget figuring, certain Budget outlays are met direct from either the Loan Fund or the Trust Fund. Existing standing authorities enable some $2.5 billion of expenditure to be charged to Loan Fund in 1986-87, leaving a shortfall of some $2.6 billion for which separate funding authority is required. This Bill seeks authority to borrow moneys accordingly. The amount of borrowings that may be undertaken pursuant to the proposed legislation is, in the case of defence expenditure, the amount for which appropriation is sought for defence purposes in the Appropriation Bill (No. I)-some $7.2 billion in 198687-and any moneys for defence purposes that may be approved in subsequent appropriation Acts for a particular financial year. The effective limit in 1986-87 is likely to be significantly less than appropriations as defence expenditures cannot be charged to Loan Fund until the legislation is enacted. The legal limit for borrowing for non-defence purposes is determined by the level of borrowing authority approved by the Loan Council. It is estimated that the 1986-87 limits will be sufficient to enable the financing of the Budget deficit. In concluding, I emphasise that the Bill does not authorise expenditures in excess of those which have already been appropriated by the Parliament under Supply, appropriation or other Acts. It does not in any way impinge upon the Parliament's prerogative to appropriate public moneys but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. In commending the Bill to the House I table an explanatory memorandum related to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL Bill presented by Mr Hurford, and read a first time. Second Reading",291
158,Mr HURFORD,OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.42)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Earlier this evening the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced, as part of the 1986-87 Budget, a number of changes to the scope of the present wholesale sales tax system that are to operate from midnight tonight. This Bill, and two others I will introduce shortly, will amend the sales tax law to give effect to those changes. Given the comments already made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech and the details contained in statement No. 4 of Budget Paper No. 1 and the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members, I will do no more than outline briefly the changes proposed. Firstly, the rate of sales tax on alcoholic wine and cider and other similar fermented alcoholic beverages is to be increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. Secondly, certain presently exempt non-alcoholic beverages are to be taxed at the 10 per cent rate. These include packaged flavoured milk, non-alcoholic wine and cider and similar beverages and, broadly, all non-carbonated fruit juice products containing not less than 25 per cent by volume of Australian fruit juice. Another change concerns the rate of sales tax payable on luxury motor cars and station wagons, including four-wheel drive vehicles. Where the wholesale price for sales tax purposes of such vehicles exceeds $19,892, sales tax will be levied at the top rate of 30 per cent. The amount of $19,892 is the tax-exclusive wholesale price, on which sales tax is calculated, equivalent to a $29,646 retail price. This latter amount is the present upper cost limit on which depreciation is allowable on motor cars and station wagons for income tax purposes. This amount will be adjusted each 1 July in line with the indexation adjustment to the income tax depreciation limit. Finally, the Bill will correct a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the various schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The main changes are: Firstly, all swimming pools, spa pools, spa baths and hot tubs and accessories, which are currently exempt from tax or subject to tax at only 10 per cent, will become taxable at 20 per cent. Secondly, the tax payable on certain film and video recordings will increase from 10 per cent 1986 to 20 per cent. Thirdly, household fittings and sanitary ware will be subject to tax at the same rate as other household items, namely 10 per cent. Fourthly, the rate of tax on gardening and industrial hand tools and machinery for business or industrial use will be increased to 20 per cent. Next negatives, transparencies and film strips that are produced from exposed film, will be brought within the sales tax base, at the 20 per cent rate. Purchases of computers, calculators and other scientific equipment by individuals such as teachers, students and others for use in schools or universities will no longer be tax exempt. Such purchases by schools and universities themselves will remain exempt. All aircraft, including hot air balloons and other similar aircraft, are to be eligible for exemption from sales tax if used for business or industrial purposes. Finally, several exemption items will be amended to confirm the scope of exemptions currently reflected in decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I commend the Bill to the House. I table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. NA 1986 Bill presented by Mr Hurford, and read a first time. Second Reading",292
159,Mr HURFORD,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.47)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill will amend Sales Tax Assessment Acts (Nos 1 to 10) and the Sales Tax Regulations. The specific changes are as follows: The value of computer software has traditionally formed part of the Sales Tax base where its value has been reflected in the selling price of goods on which it is contained. However, in recent times those marketing such goods have, purportedly to protect copyright, used the technique of licensing the use of the software, thus separating its value for sales tax purposes from its carrying medium, for example, a disc or tape, which alone has minimal value. The Government could not stand idly by and allow this erosion of the sales tax base, nor permit its spread to other areas such as the marketing of sound recordings or videos. Measures in this Bill will ensure that the value of computer software, sounds or visual images when licensed separately from the carrying medium is brought back within the sales tax base. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has already indicated in his Budget Speech, in-house production of software will not be affected by these changes, nor will software produced for export. Software acquired as an aid-to-manufacture will also remain eligible for exemption. The Bill does not seek to tax the electronic transfer of software by means of the telephone system or satellite communications. The Government will, however, be giving further consideration to this question. The Bill will also change the sales tax ment of swimming pools that are constructed on site. In the past, their pools, which are at the top end of the market, were not subject to sales tax. From midnight tonight, the construction of the container or shell of such swimming pools will be treated as the manufacture of goods for sales tax purposes and subject to tax at the rate of 20 per cent. Until now the process of developing exposed photographic film did not constitute manufacture for sales tax purposes. This Bill will change that. The price charged for developing exposed film will be taxed at 20 per cent. Finally, the Bill will bring the Sales Tax Law into line with the Customs law, by ensuring that goods imported into Australia on a temporary basis may be entered for home consumption tax-free, where they will be for use in connection with an America's Cup yacht race in Australia or the Bicentennial celebrations. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Hurford, and read a first time. Second Reading",292

This is the last Bill in this package of three Bills. It will amend relevant sales tax rates Acts to remove references to the sixth schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. That schedule is being repealed by the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill. Details of this Bill are also set out in the explanatory memorandum that has already been circulated to honourable members.

161,Mr HURFORD,SALES TAX ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister treat- Assisting the Treasurer) (9.51)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will declare the rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1986-87 financial year and for the 1987-88 and subsequent years. In so doing, the Bill will give effect to the significant personal tax cuts announced as part of the September 1985 tax reform package, and their introduction from 1 December 1986 as announced earlier tonight by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech. The tax cuts are to be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 December 1986. Another tax reform measure to be implemented by this Bill will allow the tax-free threshold only on a pro rata basis in certain circumstances. The Bill will also declare the rates of income tax for 1986-87 payable on the 1985-86 incomes of companies, registered organisations and unit trusts treated as companies for tax purposes, as well as on the current year incomes of superannuation funds and certain other trusts. As announced in the September 1985 tax reform statement, the company tax rate is to be 1986 increased to 49 per cent in 1987-88 to help defray the cost of the new imputation system that is to apply from the commencement of that year. Legislation to declare that higher rate for 198788 and subsequent years, which will also be payable by trustees assessed in respect of trust income of non-resident company beneficiaries in 1986-87 and subsequent years, will be introduced later in these sittings. Accordingly, the rate of tax declared by this Bill for 1986-87 for companies and the other bodies taxed as companies will remain at 46 per cent. However, lower rates are to be declared by this Bill on the relevant income of some superannuation funds and on ineligible approved deposit funds as a consequence of the reductions in personal income tax rates. A further lowering of these rates, reflecting the second stage of the personal income tax cuts, will be contained in the later legislation to which I have just referred. I turn now in more detail to the personal income tax rate measures contained in this Bill. The personal income tax burden will be substantially reduced by an increase in the tax-free threshold from $4,595 to $5,100, and by a reduction of all marginal rates of tax, with major reductions in those rates applying at average and higher earnings. The reform of the rate scales will be in two stages. With effect from I December 1986 a five-step scale will apply and from I July 1987 this will reduce to a four-step scale. From 1 December 1986 the existing 25 per cent rate on income to $12,500 will be reduced to 24 per cent and the threshold level will increase to $12,600. The 30 per cent rate will reduce to 29 per cent and the next two rates of 46 per cent and 48 per cent will reduce to 43 per cent and 46 per cent respectively. There will be a significant drop in the highest marginal rate applied to incomes above $35,000 from 60 per cent to 55 per cent. From I July 1987 the marginal rates applying to income in the ranges $19,501 to $28,000 and $28,001 to $35,000 will both be reduced to 40 per cent, and the top marginal rate will drop from 55 per cent to 49 per cent. These changes to the rate scale will be reflected in the rates payable by non-residents. Because of the commencement date part-way into the 1986-87 financial year, the rate scale for that year is to be an average of the 1985-86 rate scale and the scale to apply from 1 December 1986-made up of five-twelfths of the 1985-86 scale and seven-twelfths of the new scale .. The average rate scale will mean a tax-free threshold of $4,890 for 1986-87 with the rate of tax on incomes to $12,500 being 24.42 per cent. A rate of 26.5 per cent will apply in the income range $12,501 to $12,600, 29.42 per cent in the range $12,601 to $19,500, while for taxable incomes in the range $19,501 to $28,000 and 428,001 to $35,000 the rates will be 44.25 per cent and 46.83 per cent respectively. The maximum marginal rate applying to income over $35,000 will be 57.08 per cent. An adjustment is to be made to the maximum rate of tax on the unearned income of minors for 1986-87 to reduce the 60 per cent rate now applying to income over $35,000 to 57.08 per cent. For 1987-88 and subsequent years a flat rate of 49 per cent will apply to all unearned income of minors, subject to shading-in arrangements for such income just over $416. The rate of tax on trustees assessed under section 99A of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be 57.08 per cent for 1986-87 and 49 per cent in 1987-88 and subsequent years. I referred earlier to the adjustment in certain circumstances of the level of the tax-free threshold. In 1986-87 and subsequent years, this threshold will be available only on a pro-rated basis in the year of income in which a person first ceases full time education at a school, college, university or similar institution. The adjusted threshold level will be the proportion of the full threshold that reflects the number of whole months in the year when the person was not engaged in full time education, including the month in which such education ceased. Where income is derived in the part of the year before the person ceases education, the adjusted threshold level will be increased by the lesser of the amount of that income or the balance of the full year threshold. The tax-free threshold will also be available only on a proportionate basis where a person becomes, or ceases to be, a resident of Australia in a year of income. This measure will not affect the present treatment of non-residents receiving Australian social security pensions and repatriation pensions that are taxable in Australia. The provisions of the bill are explained in detail in a memorandum, a copy of which I now table. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned.

162,Mr HURFORD,SALES TAX ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.58)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will formally impose income tax for the 1986-87 financial year at the rates declared by the Income Tax Rates Bill 1986 that I have just introduced. As explained in my second reading speech on that Bill, the rates imposed on individuals, and trustees generally, reflect the significant cuts in personal income tax that were announced in the September 1985 tax reform package and are to apply with effect from 1 December 1986. No change is proposed for the 1986-87 financial year in the rates of tax, which will also be imposed by this Bill, on companies, registered organisations and unit trusts treated as companies for tax purposes. However, for certain superannuation funds and for ineligible approved deposit funds the tax rates will be lowered. This Bill will also formally impose provisional tax payable for 1986-87, and authorise the collection of instalments of tax payable by companies and unit trusts treated as companies on income of 1986-87 year of income. Details of the various rates are set out in the explanatory memorandum that has been made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned.

163,Mr HURFORD,SALES TAX ACTS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (10.01 )-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend various taxation Acts, mainly as a consequence of the reforms to be made to the personal income tax rate scale by the Income Tax Rates Bill 1986. The Bill will also give effect to some 1986-87 Budget proposals. It will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to increase the taxable income level, at or below which the maximum pensioner rebate of $250 is available, from $5,595 to $5,914 in 1986-87 and to $6,142 in 1987-88 and subsequent years. The maximum levels of the beneficiary rebates will also be increased from $220 to $280 for married beneficiaries and from $170 to $190 for other beneficiaries. The income levels above which the rebates are to shade-out will also be increased. In addition, the Bill will extend the benefit of the beneficiary rebates to recipients of benefits or payments under the Commonwealth's Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme. The changes to the pensioner and beneficiary rebates are to take effect from the 1986-87 year. Other amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act will reduce the level of the rebates of tax available for net medical expenses in excess of $1,000, payments of home loan interest by a first home buyer and the assessable proceeds of certain life assurance policies. These rebates will be allowed at the rate of 29.42 per cent for 1986-87 and 29 per cent for 1987-88 and subsequent years. Also reflecting the changes in personal tax rates, another amendment proposed will adjust the method of calculating the amount of any rebate allowable where payments in consequence of a taxpayer's termination of employment are included in his or her assessable income. Other Acts that are proposed to be amended by this Bill as a consequence of the new personal tax rates are the Income Tax (Bearer Debentures) Act 1971, the Income Tax (Mining Withholding Tax) Act 1979, the Trust Recoupment Tax Act 1985 and the Trust Recoupment Tax Assessment Act 1985.

The Medicare Levy Bill 1986 will declare the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1986-87 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for 198788. As announced in the Budget, the basic rate of the levy is to be increased from one per cent to 1.25 per cent from 1 December 1986. Consequently, a composite rate of 1.145 per cent will apply for the 1986-87 financial year. The Bill also contains increases in the income threshold levels below which people with low incomes will not be called on to pay any levy. For 1986-87, individuals with taxable incomes of $8,030 or less, and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of $13,370 or less, will be exempt from the levy. The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will increase by a further $1,660 for each dependent child or student.

165,Mr HURFORD,MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS REPEAL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs Act 1979 and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs Amendment Act 1985. The legislation will commence on a day to be proclaimed. Its effect will be to abolish the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs-AIMA. I remind honourable members of the communique of the National Economic Summit Conference in April 1983, which stated: . . . the future well-being of this country depends upon the acceptance of the cultural, social and economic implications of a multicultural Australia. That aspiration is an important objective of the Hawke Labor Government and our hopes were expressed during the debate last year about the proper role of AlMA. We believe that enormous improvements were made to AlMA over the ensuing year but not sufficient to avoid a further re-evaluation. The Review of Migrant and Multicultural Programs and Services, ROMAMPAS, under the chairmanship of Dr James Jupp, which has recently reported, has convinced us of the need for a range of approaches that will more effectively ensure that multicultural principles are accepted. In dealing with diversity, we must use diverse approaches to achieve acceptance of the values and benefits of our developing identity built on multiculturalism. Government must take direct responsibility for achieving objectives, and we believe we are now embarking on an improved strategy for that purpose. Part of our strategy involves the setting up of an office of multicultural and ethnic affairs to be staffed and funded within my portfolio in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The Government appreciates the contribution made by the Council and staff of the Institute to the cause of multiculturalism in our community. However, in our view the continuing life of AlMA is no longer the most effective means of achieving our objectives. The Institute will therefore be wound down and abolished before the end of this year at a saving of $1 m during 198687 and $2m in a full year. This Bill protects the Commonwealth's interests in that process. In commending the Bill to the House I table a copy BILL 1986 of the explanatory memorandum.

166,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Lalor-Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce) (lO.10)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1986 which is now before the House proposes the removal of the 2 per cent revenue duty applicable to imports from general tariff sources under item 71.07 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. This item covers gold, including platinum-plated gold, unwrought or semi-manufactured. The removal of the duty is to take effect on the third day after the legislation receives the royal assent. The main commodity involved in the removal of the revenue duty is gold bullion. It is accepted by the Government that the duty is impeding the development of the Australian gold market by restricting imports and preventing the necessary liquidity in periods of peak demand. The gold market could become in important source or foreign exchange earnings as an export oriented service industry. With the removal of the duty, Australia could become an attractive alternative for secure storage of gold bullion because of its geographical remoteness from Europe and political stability, thus earning foreign exchange from storage fees and commissions. The removal of the import duty should have no adverse effect on domestic producers. In accordance with the Government's commitment to simplification of the Customs tariff, the removal of the duty has been extended to the whole of the tariff item which includes gold bullion, rather than splitting the item to remove the duty from bullion alone. Financial Impact The removal of the duty from the relevant item is estimated to result in a loss to the revenue of the order of $20,000 per annum.

I do so in the terms of the printed proposals which are now being circulated to honourable members. Excise Tariff Proposals No.9 (1986), Customs Tariff Proposals No. 14 (1986) and Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No.1 (1986), which I have just tabled, introduce certain tariff changes in relation to manufactured tobacco, refined petroleum products and to uranium concentrate from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory. These changes give effect to measures contained in the 1986 Budget. These proposals are operative from 8 o'clock this evening by standard time in the Australian Capital Territory. Excise Tariff Proposals No.9 (1986) increase the rate of duty on manufactured tobacco and certain refined petroleum products for the purposes of the Excise Tariff Act. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 14 (1986) make complementary changes to the Customs Tariff Act in respect of duties applying to imported manufactured tobacco and refined petroleum products. The increase of $1.90 per kilogram in the rate of duty applicable to manufactured tobacco in the Budget completes the alignment of the tobacco rate with that for cigarettes which was begun in the 1983 Budget. Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. I (1986) increase the export duty on uranium concentrate produced from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory from Ilc to 80c per kilogram of anhydrous triuranium octoxide contained in the uranium concentrate. The duty, which has been imposed since 1980, is in recognition of the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region. The increase reflects the Government's decision, made within the budgetary context, to move closer to recovery of the costs of this monitoring and research. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals are being circulated to honourable members. I also advise honourable members that the rates of diesel fuel rebate will increase in conjunction with the duty changes on refined petroleum products. The new rebate rates for currently eligible use of diesel fuel will be 23.884c per litre in respect of primary production, 21.496c per litre for mining operations and 18.l85c per litre for other prescribed use in residential premises, homes for aged persons, nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions providing medical or nursing care. Honourable members will note that the rebate for eligible primary production remains a 100 per cent rebate of the duty and the new rebate rate for eligible mining operations effectively means no increase in duty payable. I commend the proposals to the House. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Deputy Speaker, this is part of the reason why those three Government members walked out tonight on the Budget, making history.",297
