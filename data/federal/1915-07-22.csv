1,Mr CHARLTON,WOUNDED SOLDIER TRAVELLIN G,"Has the Minister for the Navy read a report of the question asked by Mr Fitzpatrick last night in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, from which it appears that a' wounded soldier, travelling from Melbourne to Sydney, waB provided by the Department with only one meal, although ho left Melbourne at 4 o'clock one afternoon and did not arrive in Sydney until half-past 12 the next day. Will the Minister ascertain if this has happened, and, if so, will he take action to prevent similar occurrences in the future""",5

4,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIER TRAVELLIN G,"They have £1,000,000 in freight ",6
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIER TRAVELLIN G,"I ask the Minister how he reconciles that statement with the statement of the Minister of Defence that the earnings are something over £200,000 ? I should also like to know whether the money is paid into the Consolidated Revenue, or is held as a setoff against war expenditure generally ?",6
6,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIER TRAVELLIN G,"The information that £1,000,000 has been received in freights for work done by the transports in carrying cargo between Australia and England comes from the Director of Transports, and is reliable.",6

8,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIER TRAVELLIN G,"Yes . As a set-off there must be put perhaps £180,000 for agency costs, and demurrage and other expenses. I shall ascertain whether the money earned is paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.",6

13,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIER TRAVELLIN G,"I ask the Minister Tor the Navy if he is satisfied with the lack of expedition shown in informing relatives of casualties to men fighting on 'Gallipoli? 'Cases have frequently come earned under my notice in which relatives have received cables from men, announcing that they had been wounded, three or four weeks before any official information has been received. I ask the Minister if he will see that, if possible, casualties are notified to relatives within a reasonable period ? The trouble seems to occur in Egypt.",6

UNIONIST STOCKBROKERS.",6
15,Mr HIGGS,COST OF SUGAR,"In giving a commission of 5 per cent, to brokers who persuade their clients to invest in t'he war loan, will the Prime Minister give preference to unionists? Does he intend to decline to give any commission to non-unionist stockbrokers ?",6
16,Mr FISHER,COST OF SUGAR,"In consulting them, I did not inquire whether they were members of a union or not. I kuow, however, that there is a union of sharebrokers. Those in the union are probably the "" recognised brokers"" to whom reference is made in the prospectus. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. DENTAL UNITS .",6

24,Mr TUDOR,EXPO RT OF SHEEP SKINS TO,"The lionorable member recently drew my attention to the fact that the export of sheep skinsfcoAmerica had considerably increased. I think he stated that the export to America at present is not 20 per cent., but twenty four times greater than the export at the same time for twelve months ago. The honourable member presented me with a statement on the matter, and I am causing inquiries to be made into it.« U n fortunately, owing to the depletion of our flocks, the export of mutton is less than it was before the war, and consequently we have fewer skins to export. WAR EXPENDITURE. ELIMINATION OF HIGH PROFITS.",7
25,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF SHEEP SKINS TO,"Accordin g to the London Times, the war expenditure of the Imperial Government is materially increased by the high profits made in connection with the supply of commodities, and the Home Government are considering the desirableness of eliminating all high profits. Prime Minister take similar action here to insure that the Defence Department is not overcharged in respect of any supstill plies?",7
26,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF SHEEP SKINS TO,"I have grave doubts as to whether this Parliament has power as that which is proposed to be used by the Government of the United Kingdom. The power is certainly onefchafc ought to be exercised by those Governments whioh possess it . I think I . can speak for all parties in this Parliament when I say that, so far as we havepower to prevent it , no exploitation of"" any kind should be permitted at the present time, whatever maybe done after the war is over. That I am convinced is the policy of all parties and of the people: generally. SHORTAGE OF SUGAR. first Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Will the At torney-General state when the arrangement with the Colonial Sugar Refining AMERICA. Company will be completed, and whether he is aware that the supply of sugar to householders is in the meantime being held up ? I am told that the deprivation of sugar in households is becoming very acute. It is so in our own. When may we expect some from Grocer Hughes ?",7
27,Mr HUGHES,EXPO RT OF SHEEP SKINS TO,"In reply to Orchardist and Jam-maker Cook, I am inclined to regard his question as a personal reflection upon myself. As nn honest, though budding, tradesman, I shall endeavour to see that he gets thesugar he needs. Speaking quite seriously, there ought to be, and there will be, nodifficulty in obtaining sugar. There was a difficulty yesterday and the day before, owing to the fact that the sugar now beingplaced on the market is for the most part imported, and that a misunderstandingarose regarding the payment of duty upon it: That duty, however, was paid yesterday by the Government, and, consequently, there will be no further shortage.

Mr. JENSEN - I have gone into this Will the matter with the Director of Transports, and we believe that we can see our way clear next year, provided that the war is going on, and that we have charge of"" these transports",7
29,Mr FISHER,TRANSPORTS ANDWHEA T,"And provided that theany such sea routes are free. - Mr JENSEN - Quite so. I hope that the war will be over before then; but, is not, then, in the circumstances I have mentioned, we believe we can see our way clear to ship by onr transports to England 250,000 tons of wheat. AUSTRALIA DAY. ADJOURNMENT OF PARLIAMENT.  ister take into consideration the advisableness of adjourning this House from tomorrow until Tuesday week, so that honourable members may be able to attend the Australia Day celebrations in the different States, and also take part in the recruiting meetings to be held next week?",7
30,Mr EISHER,TRANSPORTS ANDWHEA T,"I have already expressed in this House the opinion of the - Government, and my own strong personal - conviction, that this Parliament ought not to adjourn because of a recruiting week in any State. We did not do so in connection with the recruiting campaign in Victoria, although the Seat of Government is in this State, and I do not think we should be called upon to adjourn be-cause of a recruiting campaign in any of the other States. At the same time, we shall be pleased to continue the arrangement made on a previous occasion to .allow honourable members representing the States concerned to . attend recruiting meetings.",8
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRANSPORTS ANDWHEA T,I understand that the recruiting campaign in New South Wales does not begin until the end of next week. May we not complete the work - of the Parliament before then?,8
32,Mr FISHER,TRANSPORTS ANDWHEA T,"I am very pleased to receive so favourable a suggestion, and can - only say that we shall assiduously attend to our duties, and endeavour to free hon- able members within the time named. BRITISH COAL SUPPLIES. - OFFER BY COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.",8
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,TRANSPORTS ANDWHEA T,"Wit h regard to the Prime Minister's very generous offer to supply England with coal from Newcastle, New South Wales, is the right honourable gentleman aware that, according to recent statistics published in the Times, the whole output of coal from Newcastle for one year would provide only two and a half days' supply of coal for the Old Country? Even then it - would not be smokeless coal.",8
34,Mr EISHER,TRANSPORTS ANDWHEA T,"I am well acquainted if it with that fact. In my younger days I earned my living as a coal-miner, and know all the circumstances connected with the industry; but in making this offer my ambition and desire was to do a service to the Mother Country, and at the same time afford an opportunity to our own coal-miners to be fully employed.

NA - SERVICE.  ter for the Navy a question relating to that great organ, the Argus. Has his at- tention been drawn to the fact that in some cases where employees of the Argus have volunteered for the front no provision is made for keeping their positions open for them? Considering that the Argus is asking other private employers to do this, should not the wealthy proprietors of this great organ, like the proprietors of other Melbourne newspapers, make good the difference between civilian and military pay in the case of their employees who volunteer?",8
35,Mr JENSEN,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"I have not seen any reference to the matter in the Argus, but no doubt the position is as the honourable member suggests. I take it that the Argus will, at least, endeavour to do what it tells other people to do. GERMAN METAL TRANSACTIONS.",8
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"In the statement the Attorney-General made yesterday regarding the base metal industry, he said that a .certain copper mine was selling its output through Merton and Sons. Later he said that two directors of that same company had applied to him for permission to act as sole agents for Merton and Company.",9
37,Mr HUGHES,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,Not quite that.,9
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,The honourable gentleman said that an Australian firm had made application.,9
39,Mr HUGHES,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,-That is right.,9
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"And he also said, "" I shall add nothing to this except to say that the two directors in this firm are also directors of the mining company above referred to . "" Seeing that there are several copper concerns in Australia, and that an imputation now rests on them all, will the Attorney-General, in order to free those who are not included in this imputation, announce the name of the mining company and the names of the directors referred to in his statement?",9
41,Mr HUGHES,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"I will do that if it is necessary. I do not know that it is necessary, but if it is I can have no possible reason for refusing to disclose the information. The responsibility for tha disclosure, however, must rest upon the honourable member who asks the question. The companies involved are the Mount Morgan Company-bot h directly and through the refining company the Electrolytic Company-and Goldsbrough, Mor t and Company.",9
42,Mr MASSYGREENE,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"In addition to the i formation he has just given to the House, will the Attorney-General. also give the names of the two directors?",9
43,Mr HUGHES,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,Yes . The names are Casey and Niall. WAR CENSUS INFORMATION .,9
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"May I ask the Attorney-General whether I understand correctly that he is.either not prepared, or has some objection, to accept the suggestion I put to him yesterday, to the effect that he should ask the Government Statistician to report upon the two sohedules in the War Census Bill as to what part of the information required could be obtained from the Land Tax and Statistical Departments of both Commonwealth and States, and as to what information is not so obtainable; also, as to the manner in which the Government Statistician himself thinks that all the information required in the two schedules could be most easily and quickly obtained ?",9
45,Mr HUGHES,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"The questions' how this information is to be obtained, and to what extent it should go, are for the Government and Parliament to determine, and for nobody else. The Government takes the advice of, and seeks assistance from , its expert officers in carrying out its policy, but what that policy is to be is for the Government itself to determine. CASUALTY INFORMATION.",9
46,Mr THOMAS,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether his attention has yet been directed to the statement that a regulation has been issued by the Postal Department to the effect that telegrams conveying information regarding casualties to people living in the country, upon which porterage has to be paid, must wait for delivery by the mail carriers ?",9
47,Mr SPENCE,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"The Postal Department co-operates with the Defence Department in the matter, and I think that where a porterage charge was incurred in the delivery of a telegram, the direction from the Defence Department was that the telegram should be sent out by letter-carrier, that being the only way to avoid porterage charges.",9
48,Mr THOMAS,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"Will the Minister for the Navy bring that answer under the n - notice of the Minister of Defence, and ascertain whether it is his wish that such a course should be followed ?",9
49,Mr JENSEN,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"I will bring the matter under the notice of the Minister of Defence, but my own view is that the relatives of the wounded should get theinformation as quickly as possible.

Then the middleman comesalong, and charges Is. 6d., b ut the people to whom the Defence Department has referred the nurses charge the handsome sum of 6s. 6d. for each badge. Will ' the Department endeavour to get thesebadges direct from the manufacturers, and themselves sell them to the nurses at cost price ?",9
50,Mr JENSEN,ARGUS EMPLOYEES AND ACTIVE,"If the position is as stated by the honourable member, I think the Department will do quite right in agreeing to comply with the honourable member's request. NA RECRUIT S.",10
51,Mr WEST,BADGES EOR REJECTED,"As many of the men who have offered their services to the Defence Department have been rejected on medical grounds, and owing to other disabilities, I should like to ask the Minister for the Navy if the Government will make arrangement whereby men who have been rejected on these grounds may receive disclosed. medallions, or cards, or certificates, so that they may not have the white feather sent to them by people who do not know the circumstances?",10
52,Mr JENSEN,BADGES EOR REJECTED,"That provision has already been made. INSPECTION "" OFMEAT FOR",10
53,Mr RODGERS,BADGES EOR REJECTED,Has the Minister Trade and Customs taken action yet to have full y qualified veterinary surgeons placed in charge of the inspection and certification of meat for export?,10
54,Mr TUDOR,BADGES EOR REJECTED,I think I sent to the honourable member a letter setting for t h the facts in regard to the - veterinary gentlemen he referred to.

70,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Swan) [3.7]. - All parties are in accord as to the necessity for this loan and for sinking all political controversy at the present time. We all recognise that this is a time of diffianswer culty and danger, and that it is the duty of every honourable member in the House to assist the Government to carry on the business of the country in the easiest and most satisfactory way. The proposed loan is an absolute necessity, and I hope and believe that, so far as the resources of Australia are concerned, there will be a great effort on the part of men emeverybody to make the issue a success. I should like to point out, howworke'ct ever, more especially in view of some statements that were made yesterday, that, a proposal to raise an immense sum of War Loan money by loan must be viewed to a large extent as a business matter. scriptions to the loan must appeal to those who have money largely from a business point of view. It is all very well to be philanthropic, but it is not quite reasonable to expect those who possess wealth-acquire d for the most part by long and arduous toil-to invest it except on some reasonable business foundation. The loan has been proposed by the Government as a business proposition, and it is based upon principles that seem to me to be fair as well as expedient. In due course we shall receive from the Treasurer, I am sure, a full statement in regard to the ways 'and means, the mode which it is intended to adopt in regard to finding the revenue witli which to pay interest and the sinking f u n d provided by Statute in regard to the raising of inscribed stock. Therefore, it is not necessary to discuss that side of the question now. When parliamentary authority to raise a loan is being sought, it is not unusual to have a statement from the Treasurer as to the ways and means and the mode proposed to be adopted to raise the money necessary for the paying of interest and sinking f u n d , but on this occasion I take no exception to the course followed by the Treasurer in postponing such a statement until the Bill has received parliamentary sanction. the Treasurer deals with the Budgetwhich he, no doubt, will do at the earliest opportunity- a full statement from him as to ways and means will be convenient, both for himself and for honourable members. My desire now is to urge economy in. regard to the administration of public affairs, but not economy that will interfere with efficiency. We must have efficiency at all times, but we need it more particularly at the present time, when we are engaged in an arduous and dangerous war. To urge economy at this time might be construed to mean that economy is to be obtained by lessening efficiency- a result which is far from my mind, because efficiency should be our main object at the present time. is, nevertheless, necessary that we «should have economy in all Departments. It is not usually expected that the soldiers who fight our battles should be financiers-the two functions do not usually combine; and my [22 JULY , 1915.] Bill (No. 1). 5243 desire in urging the need for economy is The sub- not dictated by what has happened in the past, though I believe that there has been a good deal of extravagance. I simply wish to urge the need for economy in all Departments of the Public Service, especially in the Defence Department, with its enormous expenditure. There are financial Departments which may be expected to scrutinize expenditure more carefully than others, but is there any officer whose special duty it is to keep a special watch on the expenditure of the Defence Department ?",11
71,Mr MAHON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Mr MCCheyne Anderson has just been through the Defence Department making an investigation of the accounts.,12
72,Sir JOHNFORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I should like to see his services continued, if not permanently, at any rate during the period of the war. In fact, there should be an Inspector-General of Accounts, whose whole duty should be the supervision of expenditure of all Departments.",12
73,Mr MAHON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The Auditor General supervises the expenditure very carefully.,12
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The Auditor General merely supervises expenditure after it has been made.,12
75,Mr MAHON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,He can compel a refund.,12
76,Sir JOHNFORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I m aware of a that, but the Auditor-General has a great When deal to do, and his main business is to see that the people entitled to payment receive their money, and that the vouchers retained by the Departments are correct. I believe that if we had an officer such as I have indicated he would save his salary a dozen times. We need some one of considerable standing in authority who w i ll deal with economy in the Public Service generally. If it has been found necessary to depute an experienced gentleman to look into the accounts of the Departments-and he has found a good deal to complain of-ho w much more powerful would he be, and how much more would he be able to bring about efficiency and economy, if he was permanently ""appointed ? I hope that even if the gentleman to whom the Minister has just referred is not permanently It appointed he will remain at his task during the continuance of the war. There should be some one to exercise this supervision, and I am sure that if an oflicer were appointed he would earn his salary a dozen times over. My object in making these remarks is to see that in these times of great difficulty and heavy expenditure we have economy practised consistently with the maintenance of efficiency.",12
77,Mr BURCHELL,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Do you think that one officer would be able to exercise supervision right through the Commonwealth? Sir ' JOHN FORREST - Not necessarily; he would need assistance.,13
78,Mr BURCHELL,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,That would mean the creation of another Department.,13
79,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,In any case it would be doing good work.,13
80,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The r i g ht honourable gentleman is merely proposing this in regard to war expenditure?,13
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Generally for war expenditure, but we need more control over the expenditure of Departments. Ministers do their best, but they are only in office for a time.",13

He seems to think that others should give what little wealth they have gathered by long years of toil and care, while he has nothing to give away. The honourable member had better remain silent. I have a more serious matter with which to deal. There is a great danger to our Federation ahead of usif it is not already upon us. I refer to the double' taxation which now exists, and is likely to continue to a somewhat larger extent in the future-doubl e taxation of the same people by two Legislatures. One great defect in our Federal Constitution which is becomng more and more apparent every day is the equal power of the States and the Commonwealth to impose taxation upon the same people and in the same manner. It was thought by the framers of that in strument that the Commonwealth would not levy taxation on land, incomes, and estates submitted for probate, except in times of great stress and difficulty. Of course, at the present juncture, my remarks on this subject have not the force that they would otherwise have, because our necessities are now so great, but the defect to which I draw attention has caused a great deal of friction, and, if it continues, will be worse than a blunder; it will be a crime. The present situation is unjust and intolerable, and, in my opinion, cannot continue. We have now two Legislatures engaged in taxing the one set of people, each almost regardless of what the other is doing. When the framers of the Constitution gave the Commonwealth authority an unlimited power patriots to tax, they thought, in their unwisdomI was one of them-that taxation of the kind to which I have just mentioned, would not be resorted to except in times He of great difficulty. We have been rudely awakened from that belief. Let us consider the financial state of Australia. Then - exact figures are not obtainable, but the public debts of the States now amount to * probably £350,000,000, and the public debt of the Commonwealth, if the £9,000,000 owed to the States for transferred properties is taken into account, about £40,000,000. Therewealth fore, at the end of the year, the public indebtedness of Australia will about £400,000,000, or about £ 8 for every mau, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. In some States the public indebtedness per head of population is now more than that, and in others, of course, it is less. the States to continue to pay their way if the Commonwealth continues to deStates plete their taxable resources? of the present war loan, because it is absolutely necessary in this time of danger, but it accentuates the position. administration also. To honourable members opposite I give the odium-becaus e they alone deserve it - for having invaded the taxable resources of the States, a thing that was never done by any Government holding power during the first ten years of Federation. result has heen to impoverish the States in a way that was not anticipated by the framers of the Constitution. There now a Federal land tax, which is anticiwealth pated to produce this year £2,500,000, and Federal probate duties, which are anticipated to produce £1,000,000, making togetlier £3,500,000. The Prime MinisCommonwealth ter has told us today that a Federal in - taxation ? come tax is also to be imposed. All tliese imposts are in addition to similar State taxation. The interest on the public debts of the States is now about with £11,000,000 a year, and I regret very much that the net return from the public works for which the money was borrowed is only about £9,000,000, or about £2,000,000 less than the interest paid in respect of them. The States Unification will become a necessity. have to make good this deficit;, and we may well ask, Where will they get the money to do this? The position is a very serious one for them, especially since the Federal authority has begun to deplete their sources of revenue. people of Australia have to pay municannot cipal and shire taxation, Federal and war. State land taxation, and Federal and State probate duties-amountin g in spect of large estates to about one-quarter of the value of the estate charged. They have also to pay a State income tax, and a Federal income tax is in prospeSt. This matter must engage the attention of all who take a live interest in Australian finance.

97,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Flinders) [3.34] - I agree very cordially with the last words that fell from the right honourable member for Swan. A f t e r the war is over-possibly even before-the Fededividual ral compact will have to be reviewed. As to the measure before us, the first point to be noticed is that, notwithstandwe ing its vast nnancial importance, we asked to discuss it before we have had a general statement of the financial tion which, under ordinary circumstances, would be a necessary preliminary to telligent discussion. I do not suggest that the Treasurer could make such statement at this time, but none the less, the fact that the necessities of Governwar ment have required the Bill to brought forward at this juncture throws upon the House, in the absence of such a financial statement, the obligation considering, as far as our lights will mit, the very serious financial position which we find ourselves. This is a war measure, and, as such, it will receive cordial support, but the very fact of being a war measure raises in one's mind considerations regarding the urgency the national struggle in which we are now engaged, which cannot fail to appeal to honourable members on both sides. In this connection I should like to put fore honourable members a view which may not have occurred to some of them, andi that is that our enemies in this struggle, whatever we may say of their conduct of the war, have at least already shown a capacity for national and wholeand hearted sacrifice such as we have not yet even begun to display. I take this opporwhich tunity of saying that not only is this not yet near its conclusion, but that will not and cannot conclude in the way which we should wish it to conclude until every part of the Empire to which we belong, as well as every citizen of is prepared to undergo sacrifices similar to those which at the present moment every man, woman, and child in Germany is undergoing. That is the first fact that we have to recognise. There is no exwe penditure that is deemed necessary for prosecuting this war to the end which ought not at this time to be undertaken by this Parliament. There is, however, another side to the question, and it that all the expenditure and all the sacrisimple fices that we are now making may be futile unless we are prepared henceforth to make them effective by engaging in course of both public and private economy throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Not merely economy in public expenditure, but Sir William Irvine. domestic economy must be practised by every citizen in the community unless the necessaryexpenditure which, are now called upon to make in the are prosecution of the war is to be rendered absolutely ineffective. While I recognise posithe desire of the Prime Minister to passthis measure as quickly as possible, and, intherefore, do not propose to take up more time than is absolutely necessary in disa cussing it, I would remind honourable members that since this is the first great financial proposal that we have had be put before us, it raises matters of immense moment to the - whole of the people of Australia, which it is not right of for us to pass by without calling attenpertion to those which appear to be of funin damental importance. We talk about, organization, and the Prime Minister and my the Government have already taken theits lead in putting forward a scheme for the organization of the resources of Australia of in connection with the war. But in the very forefront of any organization of that, kind there must be an organization of the finances, and of the whole of the expendibeture of the Commonwealth in all its Departments. The real position into which, we are drifting is to a large extent, masked from us by the necessities of the war, but whether it be masked or not we must face the facts sooner or later, the sooner we do the less likely are we to have that financial catastrophemust inevitably come unless we* war are prepared to face them as they should it lie faced. I should like very briefly to in draw attention to the fact that there has never been since the inception of the Commonwealth what has always appeared it, to me to be one of the first essentials, and that is a truly national balance sheet for Australia. This has been duepartly to the extraordinary financial provisions of the Constitution under which live, and partly to that mutual independence of the States and the Commonwealth in relation to finance and othermatters, which, rightly or wrongly, has been regarded as the guiding thought of is the framers of our Constitution. A statement-intelligibl e to the whole of the people of Australia, who are interested in finding the money, and a in the expenditure of that money-show ing the whole of the resources of Australia for taxation purposes, and the whole of the expenditure of that taxation, inhas never been brought forward, and? 1 never can be, it seems to me, unless a - drastic change be made. Many of the people of Australia were induced to vote ior Federation because of the argument that it would reduce the public expenditure. We were told that the co-operation between the States which was to be brought about by Federation would have the effect, not only of not increasing the - expenditure, but of reducing it , and that all that we should have to set off as against that reduction would be the slight amount of additional expenditure due to the establishment of the Federation itself.",14
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,But consider what has happened since then-somethin g of a nnancial orgy.,16
99,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The right honourable member for Swan is not far wrong in saying that what has happened .since then has been something like a financial orgy. I realise that it would not be permissible to deal in detail with this phase of the question, and, therefore, shall give only the figures showing what has actually happened-figure s which show that not only have these fond anticipations not been realized, but that the exact contrary has been the result. 'These figures are to be found in Mr . Knibbs' book, and carry their lesson on their own face. The total Commonwealth and State expenditure for 1902-3-and I take the figures for that year because the Commonwealth could hardly be said to have got on its feet in 1901-2-wa s £33,132,000. I am referring now to annual expenditure, and not to loan expenditure, which stands on a different - footing.",16

101,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"W o are - dealing now with the cost of the Government of Australia and the question of whether that Government is divided between several agencies does not touch my - argument. The Commonwealth and State expenditure in 1902-3 £33,132,000, whereas in 1913-14 it was £62,019,000, so that in eleven years the cost of maintaining the government of Australia had practically been doubled. Allowance, of course, must be made for the fact that during this time the population of Australia had increased. population, taking the nearest figures available for these two periods, increased from 3,083,000 to 4,600,000 in 1913. A very simple arithmetical calculation will show that, taking into account this in crease in population, the expenditure per head in that extremely short period in the l if e of our nation- a period of eleven years-increase d to the enormous extent of over 60 per cent. I shall be told, of course, that included in that increase is the cost of building up the great defence scheme that we now have. I am not going into details; I am dealing merely with the general financial position; but I would point out that this increase of expenditure is generally attributed by the man in the street to the necessity for the defence of Australia. In 1902-3. Australia's defence expenditure was £766,000; in 1913-14 it was £2,950,000, or an in crease of £2,184,000. If we subtract the whole of that difference, we find that the expenditure of Australia in respect of the ordinary pnrnoses of government, leaving the cost of defence out of the question altogether, increased in round numbers from £33,000,000 to £60,000,000. Every one knows that the whole of this money has not been wasted, but, undoubtedly, a great deal of it has been thrown away. I have not the slightest doubt that a caref u l , systematic investigation by responsible officers, such as the right honourable member for Swan has just insisted upon, would disclose that there are a thousand leaks, both in State and Federal Departments, through which our money has flowed. Not only is that so, hut a large proportion of this increased expenditure has been devoted to purposes which the people have demanded. Mr FISHER,-We have employed an that was accountant for the very purpose of making a systematic investigation.",16

108,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I am glad to hear it . I do not deny that a large portion of this expenditure has gone i directions which the people required, and in directions which, of course, ferred benefits on all sections of the people; and if we had unlimited moneys to expend I have no doubt that we could go on increasing our expenditure indefiParliament. nitely. But what I am concerned with now is to show that that expenditure has gone on, apart altogether from defence, and has increased in a very short period from £33,000,000 to £60,000,000.",17
109,Mr BAMFORD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The pity is we did not spend enough on defence.,17
110,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I agree with the honourable member, bu t for the reasou I have stated it is desirable leave defence out of this comparison, to deal only with the increase of expendiFederal ture that has occurred in the ordinary Departments of Governmeut quite apart amount. from defence expenditure. If you ask me the reason for this, I have no hesitaParliament tion in giving it . Apar t altogether from venue of between the undoubted period of prosperity £5,000,000 a year through which we have passed, as the result of which every one would expect some increase of expenditure, because we were growing richer-apar t altogether from that, you have not far to look see what it is that has removed every kind of political or economical safeguard from the finances of this country. W h has done that-and I do not hesias tate for one moment to say it ; the point was lightly touched upon by the right honourable member for Swan ; I have stated it in public before, and I desire to restate it here-ha s been the unconfixed trolled, mutually independent, and muwas tually irresponsible power of taxatiou given both to the States and to the Comexpenditure monwealth. The management of finance is at all times difficult in a Democracy. Every one recognises that. I u every kind of representative institution finance great difficulty, for reasons that I need not go into. You have the people seekCommonwealth ing, through their representatives, to their wants supplied, and expenditure tends to go up until it is brought to check by nothing short of necessity. Under ordinary circumstances, in unitary form of government, the check, and the only check, on penditure is the fact that the Parliament which authorizes the' spendwe ing of the money is also the Parliament endowed with the direct duty of n finding the money to spend, and, in order to do that, of depriving the people of consome benefit by the imposition of more taxation. In theory that applies both to the Federal Parliament and to the State Parliaments, just as it does to any single In practice it does nothing of the kind. Honourable members will recollect that during the first ten years of our history the Federal Parliament had complete control of the Customs and Excise revenue, with the constitutional obligation to give back three-fourths of the total collected to the States. When the Surplus Revenue Act was passed, in 1910, under which 25s. per head was given 'to the States for ten to years, there was a sudden and enormous and increase in the spending power of the Parliament. The available Customs revenue went up to a very large The mere fact of passing the Surplus Revenue Act endowed this with a sudden access of re£4,000,000 and for a number of years. And this Parliament, instead of conserving that increase or making any reserve to meet any great national obligation that sooner or later must arrive, has, to from the outset, expended the money as soon as it came in . That is just one of the facts which shows the absolute want at of ordinary check upon our Parliament a spending body. The same thing may be said with perhaps equal force, or with nearly equal force, of the State Parliaments, for , - notwithstanding that their revenues from Federal sources were at only 25s. per head, and that it supposed the States would take that fact as a warning not to permit their to .go on increasing in the way it had done before, but that they would at once set about putting their houses in order, we find, from an exis the aminationof the figures, that their expenditure has increased, just as the expenditure has increased. have There is the position. Neither in the Federal nor i u the State Parliament haB a there been any real attempt to set the financial house in order from the beginthe ning of Federation to this time.",17
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,They have borexrowed and borrowed and borrowed.,17
112,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Yes , u n t i l at last find that one of the greatest States of the Commonwealth has actually been reduced to the extraordinary device and contrivance of farming out its public works to a private syndicate. If such a thing as that had been suggested to a party such as that my right honourable friend now leads, at the initiation of Federation, or even five years ago, they would have declared that it was not only impossible in any representative Parliament, but that it would be doubly impossible in a Parliament. led by a Government which holds the opinions they do. Our States have acquired a momentum of expenditure that it is almost impossible to stop now. We in the Federation have also gone on. We have absorbed all the enormous increases of revenue as rapidly as they came in , and I have shown you by the figures already quoted that the defence of Australia up to the commencement of the war-becaus e I desire to entirely separate the enormous advance that has taken place since that time-account s for only a little over £2,000,000 a year of the total amount. That is one side of the question. An other side of the question is that of borrowing. The two matters cannot be separated. We cannot discuss any proposal like this for pledging the credit of Australia to the extent of £20,000,000 without discussing also the whole financial position. I do not know whether it has struck honourable members-the Prime Minister himself did not refer to it-bu t it strikes me as a matter that cannot for a moment be left out of account in this connection. The Prime Minister said that he welcomed this first opportunity upon which we were called upon to rely upon our own resources. In one sense i agree with him. I think the time had to come sooner or later, and I think, also, that a time when the people of this country are becoming alive to the very serious position which confronts them in many resoects is perhaps the best time for it to have come. But what I want to remind the Prime Minister of is this: that, - apart from the necessity of shouldering the burthen of finding our own money as far as we can, our having to find our own money is, economically speaking, an absolute disadvantage. Honourable members will see that hitherto we have been able to draw enormous sums of money, both for the States and the Commonwealth, from a perennial source of lending power in Great Britain , at low rates of interest, whereby we have beeu immensely aided in the development of this country. Now we are called upon, not for purposes of development, but for purposes of war, to borrow, not from outside sources, but from our own people. What will be the result? I should say that nine-tenths of the money which we borrow in Australia - will be ""money necessarily withdrawn from the active working capital of Australia. Do not forget that. The bulk of this money will come from the people who have placed their deposits in the banks. These moneys were deposited in the banks so that they might be invested in business affairs. They have ""gone to finance all kinds of businesses, as all small sums of this sort, which the depositors are necessarily unable to themselves in vest as capital, do go, through the medium of the Savings Banks aud the other banks. These small deposits are practically the only source enabling a variety of industries to find employment and wages for the - people. Whoever loses sight of that fact loses sight of the whole position, which is that the mere fact of borrowing within Australia, as compared with borrowing outside Australia.. is in itself an evil. It is an evil that we cannot help. Sooner or later it had to come.",17
113,Mr BAMFORD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Is that the honest conviction of the honourable member ?,18
114,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Yes ; I do not see how we can possibly get out of it . To borrow large sums of money in Australia, especially for unproductive purposes, is to draw away largely from the funds which now pass through the ordinary financial channels, ultimately in to the pockets of the workers as wages. That is the main thing that has to be looked at. I may, in this connection, make another general observation. E x actly the same thing that applies to such a loan applies-thoug h with a limitation-to heavy taxation. Undoubtedly it does not apply to such a great extent. It is perfectly true that if you can, by any human device, impose such forms of taxation as would compel rich men, or comparatively well-to-do men to sparesomething from the luxuries which they are enjoying, that possibly would be one of the best modes of taxation. The difficulty is that almost any form of"" wealth or property tax, and tb some extent of income tax, is also a direct tax upon the reproductive energies of the community. It must to some extent take away fro m that foun t of productive energy which supports the industrial life, of the people. The borrowing of money must result in the withdrawing of a large amount of money from the deposits in the banks. One may take a bucket of water from a current, and yet the stream so long as it continues to flow w i ll make the country f r u c t if y and support indust r y ; if the stream is baled dry, industry ceases.'So, too, if you carry taxation beyond a certain point, you get exactly the same result. I am perfectly aware that there is a section of people in this community - rather a large section, I am afraid-wh o think that in the realized wealth of the country there is an almost inexhaustible source from which we can - draw to feed the poor of the country and find work for them. I am not going to address arguments to those for whom history has no lessons. I am speaking to honourable members who, I presume, have studied the mere fundamental elements of our social life, and I will not attempt to argue with those people who think that we have an unlimited f u n d from which we can draw by taxation in order to give work and wages to the people. A more false, mischievous, and ruinous idea never entered the mind of a community, and .1 say to those honourable members who may have influence with the people who hold that idea that the best service they can render to the country is to use on the platform all the eloquence they possess in order to disabuse the minds of their followers of such a notion. Mr J"". H . CATTS - I do not think that idea is held by the representatives of the people in this House.",18
115,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do not think it is, but that it is held by many of those who support honourable members in this chamber I know, for I have encountered the idea many times. There is no country in the world where wealth is so evenly divided as it is in Australia, and where such a large proportion of the wealth is the actual productive, energising capital of the community. One of the results of the war census, which, I hope, will be speedily taken, will be to show to the whole world what has been to me, and to many others who have studied the - question, a patent fact for many years, viz., that ' in Australia the vast bulk of the realized wealth of the people consists in those things which constitute eitlier the fixed or circulating capital which supports, and is the working machinery of, all the industries of the country. Therefore, neither is it a good thing in itself to borrow in Australia, although it may be, and is, necessary, nor is it a good thing to tax the people more than can be avoided; and in both cases if you exceed the l i m it which ordinary common sense ought to teach you to impose upon the exercise of these powers, those who will feel the evil first and most are those on the lowest rung of the ladder.",19
116,Mr ARCHIBALD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,They always do.,19
117,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"They always do. That is so with regard to any abuse of the power of issuing notes. If you make mistakes in the fundamental principles of public economy in connection with either taxation, borrowing, or the issue of notes, you do so, not so much at the risk of those who are at the top of the social tree, as at the risk of the people whose bread and butter depend on their daily employment. I have pointed out what I think has inevitably led from the constitution of our Parliaments to this enormous aud overwhelming increase in public expenditure. We have seven Parliaments all independent of one another, each, under our Constitution-whic h in this respect is ridiculous-possessin g unco-ordinated and exhaustless powers of borrowing, all without relation to one another or mutual dependence, and all without obligations to jointly or separately place before the taxpayers of the community a knowledge of the full resources of the country, of the subjects of that taxation, or of the purposes of public expenditure. When you have such a position, and have no general national balance-sheet placed before the people who must find the money, you have all the circumstances* which not only destroy the , ordinary safeguards for public economy, weak as they are in the best of circumstances, but bring about conditions which must lead to continued and swelling extravagance in every Department. The result of that state of affairs has been that though for twelve months we have been engaged in this most terrible war, and threatened by the most dreadful peril that ever threatened us collectively or individually, we are all in dividually spending nearly as much as we ever spent. We are in every section of society, from the wage-earner to the millionaire, if there be such a person in this community, recklessly money. That huge swollen stream of public expenditure-mone y from every pore, leaking from a thousand holes in every channel, State and Federal - ha s been increasing since the war at quite as great a rate as during the period preceding the war. ' Mr ARCHIBALD - A good deal of that expenditure is caused by the drought. Sir WILLIAM IRVINE drought, so far as it operated at all, must have acted as a check on expenditure. But even the drought, which,. so far as it affected Victoria, has been certainly the worse this State has experienced, and one of the worse the whole Commonwealth has experienced, has not acted as a real check upon the enortnous growth of public expenditure. My views with regard to the necessary alteration which, sooner or later, must be made in the Constitution, are already published. I shall have an opportunity elsewhere to full y, and without any of the restrictions imposed by parliamentary procedure, place before the public my views on the necessary changes in the .structure of the Constitution. But there is one thing which, without any change of the Constitution, can be, and must be, done now. This Parliament cannot, even if it would, shirk the responsibility attaching to the National Parliament of the people of Australia. It can not shirk the responsibility which arises from the fact that it is, and must remain, the guardian of the finances of Australia, of the States as well as of the Commonwealth.",19
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Hav e we shown ourselves more economical than the State ment. Parliaments ?,20
119,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,It is not question of which Parliament has shown itself to be most economical; neither State nor Commonwealth has shown any economy.,20
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,A change of machinery will not necessarily give economy.,20
121,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Neithe r the State Parliaments nor the Federal that.

All the Parliaments placed in the position in which there every inducement towards extravagance, and that arises, in my opinion, from constitutional mutual independence, spending attempt at creating mutual independence in two authorities that cannot be bleeding mutually independent. Even since the outbreak of the war, mainly in order to give the States accommodation and to permit them to continue their expenditure, we have advanced to them a sum of £12,611,000. Before the end of this year, that sum will have increased - to £21,000,000, including the £18,000,000 - The and other advances made by the Commonwealth to them. For that purpose, the Commonwealth has engaged in a course of economical conduct which, from, the beginning, I have viewed with apprehension and anxiety. I refer to the issue of paper money to an extent, which, I ventured to predict a year ago, would reach probably not less than £40,000,000. Before this year of grace is finished, and without any fdrther commitments than those shown on paper, but with the completion of the advances to the States and. with the necessary issue of additionali paper money in order to obtain from thebanks the balance of the £10,000,000' worth of gold advanced by them to the 5 Commonwealth, the notes circulation will be between £45,000,000 and £46,000,000i. I view that prospect with very grave* apprehension. I am not going to debatethat question now, beyond saying that we have walked on that path which all history teaches us is beset with dangers, mainly for the purpose of financing the States, and, to a comparatively small extent, for the purpose of financing our own> obligations.",20
122,Mr ARCHIBALD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Our note issue is notworse than that of the British Govern,20
123,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do nota desire to be drawn into a discussion of"" the note issue at this stage. We haveengaged in this comparatively enormous note issue mainly for the purpose of financing the States. In addition, weprovide the States under the Surplus Reus venue Act with a sum of, approximately,. £6,000,000 annually.",20
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,A l it t l e more than,20
125,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I suggest to the Treasurer that there may be some were means whereby, without the creation of a was tremendous amount of new machinery for income taxation or any other mode of ' the taxation under the Commonwealth, some the arrangement might be made with theStares by which they could use the machinery thut they now have for the purpose of raising this taxation, and the Commonwealth should take the necessary amount out of the 25s. per head payable to the States. One thing above all others ought to be avoided, and that is duplication and reduplication of the services required for collecting taxation equally with the enormous additional labour and annoyance and trouble, it will give to the people of Australia.",20
126,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,We have been at that matter for three months.,21
127,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I felt sure that the Treasurer would not have overlooked it, and no doubt when introducing the promised taxing Bill he will give us the necessary information.",21
128,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I almost despair of what will happen.,21
129,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"To revert to the main point of my argument, we possess the power, and with it we are under a responsibility to the States. We finance the States; we have a constitutional obligation to do so. I remember that, though I declined tp accede to the Financial Agreement which my party proloosed to embody as part of the Constitution, I afterwards acceded to the proposition brought in by the Fisher Government immediately they came into office. I refer to the Surplus Revenue Bill, which gave the States 25s. per head. Mr. Deakin at that time put the position that the Bill was a sacred guarantee to the States that this payment of 25s. per head would be continued, but I ventured to take up the attitude that this Parliament <-ou!d not give any such guarantee, that the matter could not be allowed to go into the Constitution, and that whatever payment was made to the States might be modified or taken away by this Parliament if the national necessities required it.",21
130,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I am afraid that the States will not get the payments very much longer.,21
131,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do not wish to be misunderstood. I hope that the honourable member does not take me for one moment as suggesting that we - would be doing our duty if we set our own finances right by depriving the States of that payment without having any regard to their finances. Nothing is further 'from my thoughts. If any State should become insolvent, Australia would become insolvent.",21
132,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,No State can be allowed to become insolvent.,21
133,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"We cannot allow it. We are the guardians of the State finances, and that guardianship throws an obligation on us. During the debate on the Surplus Revenue Bill I said that I would never accede to the principle that this Parliament might not, in the extreme necessity of the State, or indeed, in any necessity, be obliged to repeal, modify, or alter the Act.",21
134,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The States are our partners; we cannot bring them down without bringing down ourselves.,21
135,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"They are partners, and not only is their solvency our solvency, but, moreover, every loan borrowed by a State is borrowed, not on the security of the State, but on the security of Australia. We must support every State loan.",21
136,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The Constitution provides for that.,21
137,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Constitution provides that we may give the States financial assistance, but I am not dealing Will the constitutional aspect of the question now. I wish to put that question on one side, and deal with the great practical difficulty that confronts us. Constitution or no Constitution, I say that the National Parliament of Australia cannot allow the solvency of any State of Australia to be affected seriously, and, therefore, it must support, as far as it can, the solvency of the States. But that fact does not free the Commonwealth from an obligation as guardian of the finances of Australia to see that both in the State and Federal Governments the necessary provisions for economy and sound finance are employed.",21
138,Mr FLEMING,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Should the Federal Government have prevented the New South Wales Government from farming out its public works?,21
139,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The honourable member has given a concrete case which it is very difficult to answer. I do not intend to deal with the past, but I make a suggestion to the Treasurer, feeling that the matter is really of urgent necessity. Our finances are getting into such a condition that we shall soon hot he able to go on; sooner or later we must comeup against the wall unless the position is taken in hand, and the sooner t l i at is done the better. allow this financial storm which looms in the distance to be masked from our eyes by the immediate necessities of the war.",21
140,Mr WEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Does the honourable member refer to the States or the Commonwealth ?,22
141,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I speak of Australia. I cannot free my mind from the fact that never in the history of this country were we more one people than we are now; we have one interest before us, and this Parliament is primarily and essentially charged with the maintenance of the financial interest of the whole of Australia i u all its channels. When I went to the Treasury the other day-it is not the faul t of the Treasury officials, it is the faul t of the system-and for the figures showing the amount of borrowings by the States since their last financial statements were made, I was told that they had no such records in the Treasury, and that they did not possess the information I required. I was ultimately, by the courtesy of the Treasurer, permitted to get at the only source from which the Commonwealth can know what the States are doing in the way of borrowing, namely, press cuttings collected from time to time. It seems to me absolutely absurd and mischievous that the Commonwealth Treasury, charged, as it indubitably is, with the responsibility for the State finances as well as its own - becaus e the States are now deeply in the Commonwealth Treasury books for moueys lent to them, and for them mainly we have embarked upon an issue of paper money which will soon amount to a little under £50,000,000 sterling",22
142,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"It is only £33,000,000 at present.",22
143,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Treasurer was not in the chamber when I pointed out that, even with existing obligations, the notes issued and to be issued before the end of the year, in order to get the gold of the banks, will amount to nearly £46,000,000.",22
144,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"That will be the case, but I interjected because I think that will be the limit . Sir WILLIAM ' IRVINE - I sincerely hope that it will be the limit . I do not wish to press the argument further than it wil l go. Seeing that there is this direct financial link between us and the States for which we are engaging ourselves so deeply in what must always Let us not be a highly dangerous enterprise, and that we are under an obligation to feed them with moneys out of the Customs and Excise, revenue as far as our resources will permit, no National Government can wash its hands of a certain responsibility for the State finances. It cannot say, "" A m I my brother's keeper?"" We in this Parliament are responsible, especially at the present time, for the whole of the finances of Australia. The suggestion that I make to the Prime Minister is this - it will have to be done sooner or later, and if it is not done in the way I suggest it may ultimately have to be done under a sudden cataclysm which we all desire to avoid; we should approach the matter in a business way - I maintain that the asked Prime Minister and his Government are under an obligation to take up aperfectly definite attitude towards the State Governments. We took it up partly at the . Conference which was held about eight or nine months ago, when it was agreed that there was to be a distinct limitation on State borrowings; the States were not to borrow except for conversions, except with the consent of the Commonwealth Treasurer. I know that there have been departures from that agreement, and we shall probably hear the reasons for those departures when the Treasurer's financial statement is made. The Commonwealth is not only under an obligation to come to a definite understanding with the States in regard to borrowings, but also to see that firm and direct steps are taken to bring ahout economy in every Department, Commonwealth and State. We are under an obligation to see that early and immediate steps are taken in connection with economy in the Federal Departments.",22
145,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I have no power.in the case of the States, except the persuasive power which the honourable member also has.",22
146,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Treasurer has a great deal more power than that. He is now the creditor of the States. He is practically financing the States. It is for the sake of the States themselves that I am making this suggestion. Moreover, the Constitution only gives 'to the States portion of the Customs revenue for so long as, in its wisdom, in the interests of the whole of Australia, this Parliament should think it necessary to hand it to them.",22
147,Mr EISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I go further, and say the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to enforce a claim against a sovereign State Government.",23
148,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"This Parliament has complete, unlimited control over the whole of the Customs revenue, and in that way holds complete control over the finances of the States.",23
149,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,That would he in the nature of a threat.,23
150,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Of course it would be. We cannot avoid our responsibility for the State finances. We have gone too far already. If we allow the matter to go further, we shall come to a point at which there will be a distinct clashing.",23
151,Mr HAMPSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,What about our agreement with the States?,23
152,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I think it is far better to .appeal to the common sense of the people.,23
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Hear , Through the referenda proposals.",23
154,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Let us put them aside for the moment. Of course, we must appeal to the common sense of the people to practise economy; but there is a more direct duty for the Commonyears wealth Government, and that is to enter into direct relations with to put this to them: "" There must be a definite effort in both the Commonwealth and - the States for economy in every branch of the Public Service. going to make it : what are you going to do? Let us know how you can reduce your expenditure. that we cannot afford to give you so much of the Customs revenue as we have been giving, though we wish to give you as much as before. It is a simple business proposition. What are you going to do; now are you going, in your spheres, take your part in the duty we all must perform of stopping the thousand leaks terthat occur in every detail of the Public Service?"" That is our duty, and it is « duty of prime necessity and also of the urgent necessity.",23
155,Mr WEBSTER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Can we interfere w it the per capita payment until the ten is years have expired?,23
156,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I have ready pointed out the position. If the promise made was one from which the Commonwealth Parliament could not recede the per capita payment for ten years might just as well have been put into the Constitution. When Mr Deakin said that he understood that the Commonwealth Parliament could not alter the Bill , I took up the position that if national necessity arose, the Bill could not be considered by the States as any promise binding the Commonwealth Parliament not to be at liberty at any time during the ten years to modify the measure.",23
157,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The strong point was that one Parliament cannot bind another.,23
158,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Not only that one Parliament cannot bind another, but that no understanding in one Parliament can be deemed to bind another Parliament.",23
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"We made a definite promise, to which we gave effect by legislation.",23
160,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I differ hear! absolutely from the right honourable member on that point. I took up the position-and I think that the then Leader of the Opposition agreed with me-in part at any rate-that Parliament would not do its duty if it bound itself for ten by any promise, since honourable members could not know what might hapthe States, and pen in the future.",23
161,Mr KELLY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,What was the attitude of the Prime Minister at the time?,23
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,He gave a definite We are and distinct promise for ten years.,23
163,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The statement of the Prime Minister made at the It may be time is the ruling statement, compared with which that of a private member is of small importance; I merely cite what I said then to show that I am justified in stating the view that I now hold. Mr . Deakin is reported, at page 423 of vol. to LV . of Hansard, to have said on this occasion-referrin g to the Prime MinisHo has given a deliberate pledge, not only for this, but for future Parliaments, during period for which the measure will operate. Although that assurance was unnecessary, so far as honourable members are concerned, it h is valuable and effective so far as the public concerned, because without it they might be misled. The Prime Minister laid a proper alemphasis on this understanding.",23
164,Mr WH IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do not think that his words went so far as the honourable member suggests. This, like any other measure, may be altered if the necessities of the Commonwealth require it.",23
165,Mr DEAKIN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Nothin g short of a cataclysm, such as cannot be foreseen or provided against, would justify any party in proposing an alteration of the measure.",24
166,Mr HIGGS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,We pledged ourselves to the people to continue the arrangement for ten years.,24
167,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I do not agree with that view. I think that the pledge was made subject to any overriding necessity of the Commonwealth. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK - As k the Prime Minister.,24
168,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"No doubt he will state his view when the time comes. Had it been otherwise, this Parliament would have deliberately surrendered an essential function. It might have to face an emergency at any moment. The attitude I took up was this. I said I agree with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that we ought to give the assurance-and we do by passing this Bill give the assurance-to the States that we contemplate nothing within the horizon of practical politics, to use ""the language of the Leader of the Opposition, which will be likely to induce us to alter the terms of this measure. That is the strongest declaration of intention that we can make. But I. decline to go further than that, and to consider that there can be anything in the nature of a pledge binding the conscience of any member of this House with regard to what may be the case should the ultimate necessities of the Commonwealth require a change. I understand that that view was generally assented to at the time, but I may be wrong.",24
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Her e is the measure itself.,24
170,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do not for dispute the statement that the measure rovides for a period of ten years, but f . hold that it, like every other Act, may be repealed or altered.",24
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Not a measure like that.,24
172,Mr FLEMING,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,It is a mere scrap of paper.,24
173,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"An Act of Parliament is not a treaty. Is*it suggested that Acts under which municipalities are subsidized cannot be repealed or amended - without breach of faith by State Legislatures? The view that I now put forward is that which I expressed when the matter was originally under discussion. To take any other attitude is to assert that this Parliament then surrendered its freedom of action at a time of most serious responsibility, such as a crisis of the kind with which we are now faced.",24
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"When a Parliament says that an agreement shall continue for ten years, I think that that constitutes a binding promise.",24
175,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I disagree with the right honourable member, though he is entitled to his opinion. I now hold by the view that I expressed at the time.",24

177,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Our efforts to finance the huge obligations that this war imposes on ns may, after a time, be rendered, if not futile, to some degree ineffective, unless we couple with them a rigid economy, both State and Federal. The primary obligation of leading in, and insisting upon, that economy lies upon the Prime Minister of Australia.",24
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,We should begin by setting an example to the States.,24
179,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Yes ; but we must not wait. The finances of Australia are one concern; those of the States cannot be divorced from those of the Commonwealth. To attempt - such a divorce means ruin. In finance divided responsibility means no responsibility. That is what has led to all the trouble, aud it may lead to infinitely more trouble. Not only is a determined effort, led by this Parliament, necessary to effect drastic and complete reforms in the finances of both the States and the Commonwealth the purposes of the war, it is necessary also to secure our position after the war. When peace is concluded we shall be in vested with new rights and new responsibilities, such as no community of our size has ever yet enjoyed. At the end of a successful war, not only shall we be intrusted with the development of the whole of Australia, but we shall also be charged with the policing and the care of huge interests, outside Australia, in the Southern Ocean. If we are to be in a position not merely to do what is necessary to win the war, but also to take upon ourselves, and support worthily, the burden of a noble heritage, such as has never yet fallen to a people of our size-the development of the great country that we now hold and the care of many surroundingislands and archipelagoes, together with the obligations resulting from the international relations which will necessarily be included in these arrangements-the first and most necessary step that we must take is to proceed at once to set our house in order.",24
180,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Maribyrnong) [4.45]. - It is well, in this time of stress and storm, to take stock of things, especially things nnancial. Whether it means a longer session of this Parliament or not, the time will be well occupied which is spent in reviewing our nnancial situation. The last speaker laid considerable emphasis upon the fact that in recent years our expenditurehas been considerable. I think that every member will agree with him, though we may not agree with his deductions. Ours is a young community, and if there is any place in the world where there should be a liberal expenditure for developmental purposes it is Australia. Between 1901, when Federation was consummated, and the present time, the population of the Commonwealth has increased by 1,10S,000 persons.",25
181,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I took that account. Mr .FENTON - We must also take into account the increase in the necessities of the population.,25
182,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I took that into account in arriving at the conclusion that our expenditure had increased by 60 per cent.,25
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,And our production by 100 per cent.,25
184,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"To my mind, the honourable member for Flinders did not place enough value upon the fact that is largely in regard to defence that expenditure has increased so rapidly of late years. While no one would claim that every penny spent on defence has been wisely spent, there is a general ment that for the most part our defence expenditure is the best that we have made. In the year 1910-11 our defence expenditure was about £3,000,000- a great increase on the expenditure of prements vious years-, in 1911-12 it was £4,081,000; in 1912-13, £4,346,000; and in 1913-14, £4,750,000, or £16,183,000 in four years. That expenditure has given very good remust sults during the present trying times. Without it, it is more than likely that least two of our chief ports would have been blocked for a considerable period after the commencement of the war. Our defence expenditure for the financial year just closed - 1914-15 - amounted to £18,250,000, which, of course, includes the outgoings in respect of the war; We must scrutinize every item of expenditure, but it must be remembered that there is economy which may bring disaster. It would, I think, be criminal to curtail expenditure on public works, especially on reproductive works, even in time of war. Our people must be fed, clothed, and housed.",25
185,Mr ATKINSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Does not the honourable member *hink that something could be saved in connection with the Federal Capital scheme?,25
186,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"If we closed down at Canberra within, say, a month, the men now at work there would be out of employment.",25
187,Mr ATKINSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,There is a difference between doing a reasonable amount of work at Canberra and shutting down altogether.,25
188,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,What would the into honourable member call a reasonable amount of work?,25
189,Mr CARR,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,What would the honourable member do when we had no more money ?,25
190,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I am afraid that the honourable member is taking an exceptionally doleful view of the situation. Mr C.ARR - I am not expressing any view; I am merely seeking information.,25
191,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do not think such a time will ever arrive. Reproductive works, or works that are likely to prove it reproductive in the near future, should our be prosecuted with the utmost vigour. Unless this be done, we shall have within the-Commonwealth a condition of affairs almost as bad as the state of war outside. agree If by any mistaken policy on our part thousands of men are thrown out of employment, very serious trouble will be created-within our own borders. Neither the Commonwealth nor the State Governhave done all they might have done in this direction. Whilst it is necessary that we should preserve the financial equilibrium of the Commonwealth, we at the same time see that our people are. fed, clothed, and housed, and it is at better to employ them on reproductive works at reasonable rates of wages in tbese tunes of high prices than to close down our whole public works policy. It is because of tbese considerations that I pay special attention to the use of the word "" economy"" by honourable members opposite. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Flinders have urged that economy must be exercised.' We are all agreed that economy is desirable, and that the man who lives in a frugal way, even in time of plenty, is a better citizen than is a spendt h r if t . A certain expenditure, however, is necessary for the upkeep of every community. There is, no doubt, a certain amount of waste going on. I was very much impressed by some figures given recently by Mr Chiozza Money, a member of the British House of Conimons, who is also a member of the Finance Committee appointed by the British Government to carry out the work of financial organization in the United Kingdom. Discussing the habits of the Britisl i people, Mr Chiozza Money, in the March number of the Fortnightly Beview, mentions the fact that in respect of a few luxurieshe does not include all luxuriesthe people of the United Kingdom spend at the rate of £350,000,000 per annum, and he makes the comment that a nation that can spend. £350,000,000 per annum, on luxuries should not find it very difficult to find £500,000,000 to carry on a big war. When we are speaking of the necessity of every member of the community contributing his or her quota to the upkeep of the country, I hope we shall always remember that out of £15,000,000 raised by Customs and Excise duties, no less than £12,500,000 comes out of the pockets of the poorer people of the community. It is well for us, when dealing, at a time like the present, with the finances of the country, to consider how these people have been contributing to the maintenance of government in the years gone by. In proportion to the wealth they possess, the poorer sections of the community are already contributing, and have been contributing year after year, very handsomely indeed to the revenue of the Commonwealth. Surely the proportion I have mentioned is more than a fair contribution on their part to the governmental expenses of the country. Another point which must not be overlooked is that the working classes have to buy in small quantities, and, therefore, as a rule, have to contribute to the profits of all engaged in industry.. It is they who deal chiefly with the retail man. I think I may safely say that the richest men in the community live at wholesale rates. It is the poorest, and not the richest, section of the community that pays the biggest price for the goods it consumes. The wealthy section of the community is prepared to pay big prices for luxuries, but in respect of their general livin g requirements they purchase at wholesale rates.",25
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,That is not so.,26
193,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"All goods consumed in the household of the squatter or the big farmer, as well as the food required for their employees, are purchased at wholesale rates.",26
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I thought that the honourable member was referring to the wealthy people living in our cities.,26
195,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The same remark will apply to them. Thousands of wealthy city people deal directly with the wholesale houses. As one who has conducted a business in the country, I know that many large farmers and others are supplied by the wholesale houses.",26
196,Mr ATKINSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,But will a wholesale house supply a suburban resident?,26
197,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The honourable member, I am afraid, is professing an innocence which he does not possess - I make the statement, with ample proof at the back of it , that the rich people in every community in Australia are living at a cheaper rate than are the poorest members of the community. Excluding luxuries, such as motor cars, they are able to huy what they want for less than it costs the poor man who has to make his purchases in small quantities. Thus the poorer classes are not only paying more than two-thirds of the Customs and Excise taxation, but they have to pay more than the rich for the goods they require. Y e t another consideration is the fact that, as a rule, the workers have the largest families. As every one knows, the man with a large family to feed and clothe contributes more to the cost of the upkeep of government than does the man with a small f a m i l y; and I hope that, in connection with any new taxation that may be imposed, there will be not only a liberal exemption but special regard for the number of the taxpayer's family. Already in some of the States the number of a man's family is taken into account in the imposition of taxation, and I think that such a principle might well be introduced into the Commonwealth scheme of taxation. The consideration is one that cannot be ignored when taxation is being imposed. If we are going to place additional taxation on the man who already finds it difficult to provide for his wife and family, we shall do a very serious in j u r y to the most deserving members of the community, and I , for one, shall not be prepared to tolerate such a thing for any length of time. A great economic question is involved in the consideration of this measure. It has always been said that the heaviest burden should be placed on the strongest shoulders. The weaker portions of our community must be protected by the stronger, and in respect of taxation the biggest burden should be borne by those best able financially to hear it . On the outbreak of this war there much confusion in all countries. Thouthere sands of men were thrown out of employin the community generally. ment in the United Kingdom, and there was something in the nature of a general panic; but, owing to the strong measures taken by the British Government, confia dence was quickly restored. In August, 1914, the month in which the war broke out, there were 71 per 1,000 out of em-Many ployment in Great B r it a in ; but in DecemHouse have suggested ber that percentage was reduced to per 1,000, the proportion of unemployed be made. then being less than in December, 1913.",26
198,Sir JOH NFOBBEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"A great many gone to the war in December, 1914.",27
199,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"That , no doubt, was one of the contributing factors. In a expenditure. young community like ours there should not be such a lack of employment as preproximate vails in the older countries of the world. We often boast of our railway systems, our water supply schemes, and many other revenue-producing public utilities; but, having regard to our vast potentialities, we are as yet only at the beginning of our developmental work. they pay in interest? Where there is so much to do and so little actually done there should hot so many out of employment as there are. So far we have already sent, or are sendmember ing, to the front about 105,000 men, if enlistments continue at the present rate I believe that by the end of the calendar year about 150,000 men will eitlier have gone to the front or be in preparation for active service. At the same timethere will be nearly 100,000 engaged in work that has to do with the provision of clothing and equipment for our troops, or, in other words, somethinglike a quarter of a million will be exclusively engaged either at the front or at home in war operations. I believe that, with 250,000 people employed either in the theatre of war o r in preparing themselves or others for the war, even with our limited finances and the trouble the States may have in obtaining loan money, we ought to be able tokeep our own people in employment. Particular attention has been paid to this matter in Great Britain . That is why, in December last, the percentage of unemployed was so small, and we ought to be able to do something of the same sort here. I am prepared to admit there isroom for economy in many of our big was spending Departments, just as we know is need to abstain from wastefulness I believe that in the Post Office just as in the Defence Department-bot h on the naval, side as well as the military branchesgood deal of money could be saved. I have no objection to our finances beingsubjected to a very severe scrutiny. honourable members of this on previous 25 occasions that this scrutiny should They have realized that it is necessary to have a stocktaking, and that if we desired to conduct our business had in a way that would lead to the very best work being done, it was necessary that we should keep a close hand On public I have not the complete figures for 1914-15 by me. but they apthe figures for the previous year, during whicn I find that State expenditure amounted to £46,000,000 and loan expenditure £20,700,000, making a total expenditure of £66,000,000.",27

The possible creation of one borrowing authority was one of the reasons that led to the Federation. It is - quite likely that this war will do some .good if it only forces upon us the gamation of the State debts into one stock with one borrowing authority for the think whole of Australia. At any rate, lieve strongly that this question of debts should be examined.

We might not save monev on interest charged at the start, but I think that, later, siderable sums would be saved. A £ or ^ per cent, would mean a great amount on so large a sum. There is one aspect of this Bill that may be referred to : A - sum of money will have to be paid i interest on the loan of £20,000,000, most of which will come back to our own peothink ple. I do not know that there is anything in the proposal before the House to exclude outsiders from investing in this loan, the big proportion of the money will be subscribed within the Commonwealth, and the interest will be paid in desire ..Australia, and will, no doubt, be qualify, the re-invested, and this will give emI cordially support the Bill under the emergency circumstances in which we find ourselves. I do not think that in either this or the from other House it will receive anything rebut approval and sanction. I believe also that the loan itself will be a success. If ever there was an opportunity given to we the Australian people to display their to patriotism it is now. I believe many people, even if they can spare only a £ 1 0 note, will be prepared to purchase a loan I bond, and so help to make the success that we are hoping to see. I believe the loan will be a good advertisement for If we can finance ourselves right through these troublesome times-if we can not only send 150,000 or 200,000 men away, equipping and transporting them to the other side of the world, paylead ing them handsomely in comparison to doles that are meted out to soldiers in other parts of the world - if we can do this and finance ourselves to the end of the war, Australia will have achieved for herself a higher place than she ever preamalviously occupied. I do not wish to make any pessimistic prophecy, hut I do not that we have yet reached I be the worse times we may expect. In State my view, the most trying time for not this country, as well as for other countries, will be when the war drums have ceased to beat. The task of dealing attenwith the thousands of men now fighting the country's battles when they come back us, as we hope the great majority of them will , will tax statesmanship of the highest kind at a time when the world t will be more or less disarranged as a result of the war. It is for us to so legislate and act now that when that most conserious time does come along, we shall be able to meet it as it should be met. That period will require that we should show the mettle of which we are made, but our legislation now should tend towards helping us to meet such difficulties as will big arise then. I take an optimistic view of n the general war situation. I know the position does not look bright now; but I we shall come through triumphantly in the end, and when we do, I hope we shall be i u a position to meet the most but acute stage that is certain then to arise.",27
202,Mr GLYJSTN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Angas) [ 5 . 1 8 ] - I only to refer to this Bill in order to I will not say the pessimistic utterances of honourable members, because there is scarcely pessimism Australia after the action men at Gallipoli, and the response of new recruits, but to qualify anything in the nature of that may arise on our entering upon the first stage of what may be an extended loan policy. Before doing so, may I be permitted to refer to one or two remarks by the honourable member for Many of the problems to which he gave expression in the course of his speech this afternoon were not being stated for the first time. With my right friend the member for Swan, I had the honour of being a member of the Federal Convention, and it may not be amiss, as we have to some extent dealt with history which, though not ancient, is perhaps somewhat remote spect, if I point out that many of the questions that naturally arise during a discussion of the limits of the Federal idea-the unification or tion of finances and control-were dealt with by the Convention. But what is most to the subject under discussion is the fact that more than one motion was tabled at the Convention for the consolidation of the debts of I brought the matter to an issue by moving in this very House, the Melbourne Convention on the 25th February, 1898, for an immediate transfer of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth. that action for some of the reasons urged by the honourable member for namely, that we could not possibly allow six States and one Commonwealth dependently deal with the same assets, to perhaps heap responsibilities upon the same source from which these financial obligations would have to be discharged. It may serve my purpose for a moment if I briefly refer without quoting, some of the appeals I have made to this House on previous occasions to deal with the question, and when I not merely offered more or less destructive criticism in regard to the position we were placed in by the separate borrowing powers of the various Governments, but put forward two or three alternative solutions which the end we had in view might be accomplished.' On the question of double Mr Glynn. pressure of taxation, I said in this House in on the 21st August, 1912of our We must remember that the States use the splendid same sources of taxation, excepting Customs and Excise, that we do, and the State taxation, despondency which falls on the same people, has risen from 14s. Id. per head in 1901-2 to 19s. per head in 1910-11. Reverting to the Convention, I suggested that we might at once better what had Flinders. been done in Canada, where it was decided to take over all the debts at once, by consolidating our debts in this way. We have, in final analysis, one security honourable and one responsibility. There were differences in the - per capita liability of the States. Speaking from memory, Victoria owed in 1898 about £ 4 2 per head, and South Australia about £ 6 9 , and there was an average per capita in in retro- debtedness for all the States of approximately £ 5 2 . It seemed to me that all we had to do, knowing the absolute power of payment which the States and the co-ordina- Commonwealth had, was to transfer those of Federal debts to the Commonwealth, debiting those States which had an indebtedness germane per head over the average, and crediting those whose indebtedness was under the average. I investigated the matter very immediate carefully, and found that, although someAustralia. thing of that character was attempted in Canada, the scheme there adopted was where not from an actuarial point of view perwas sitting, fect. Transfer of the debts of Canada took place at once, but was brought into force, subject to arrangements to equate I took differences, that lasted for some years. On more than one occasion I have sugFlinders, gested various methods of dealing with the debts problem. to in",28
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The provinces of Canada can borrow. in future,29
204,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"That is so, and I have just said that their method is not as perfect as that which it is within our power to, to adopt. In order to show that the Convention was not asleep in regard to this matter, and as many of the younger debts generation of politicians do not know what took place at the Convention, I may be permitted to give the text of an amendment I moved. On clause 98 I moved an amendment which, if carried, would have added to the clause these wordsby Existing public debts of the States shall be taken over by the Commonwealth at the date of its establishment, and the interest thereon shall be a charge on the Consolidated Fund. Each State shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the amount by which its debts exceed the average amount of the debts of all the States, after such debts have, for the purpose of ascertaining their relative values, been reduced to and expressed in a debt of the average currency and rate of interest of the debts of all the States. The Commonwealth shall be deemed to be indebte'd to a State in the amount so ascertained by which the reduced debt of the State is less than the average amount of the reduced debts of all the States. The debts of the States being extended over different terms, and carrying different rates of interest, it was necessary to express in terms of one common stock the relative indebtedness of the States and having equated all the stocks under one denomination, we were to take the average and fix the credits and debits accordingly. I have more than once suggested in this House that that method be adopted and a limitation placed on the borrowing powers of the States. There are various logical ways of prescribing how that limitation could be imposed, but this is not the time for debating that matter. agree with the honourable member for Flinders that there are times when there must be a national stocktaking, and it is better not to wart until the emergency has arrived to arouse us from our slumbers and lethargy and to awaken, when the best of the opportunity has passed, to the necessity for prescience and economy. Speaking on the Budget, on the 21st August, 19.12, I saidNations, like men, occasionally take stock. They must endeavour to ascertain the proportion between tlieir effective resources and their responsibilities-to what extent they can meet without any undue disturbance of their normal social and industrial conditions the calls that an emergency may at anj' time make, which must, of course, with becoming fortitude, be fncetl. Were it not for the continued change we are undergoing in international relations, I personally should not be much disquieted by the perceptible fastness of the financial pace. But we must remember that we are part of an Empire, the stability of which directlj' touches at least one-fifth of the human racenn Empire so colossal in its proportions, and so vast in its extent, that there is, perhaps, scarcely a moment of our lives when it does not touch or afreet the enterprises or ambitions of some otlier country or people. I proceeded to show that there were clouds on the horizon, the significance of which we should take some notice of. Referring to the delusions that arose, both at Home and in Australia, from the fact [192] that at the moment our .prosperity was exceptional, I saidImperial prosperity is exceptional; and the same may be said about our own. Should war arise, then, the test of our capacity to meet our responsibilities will be applied. War, we know, is always wasteful; and, ou one side at least, is generally wanton. At the same time, we are proud to feel that the Empire makes for peace; but the maintenance of peace depends on conditions and circumstances which we ourselves cannot prescribe or control. Even if the issue of peace or war did lie with the Imperial choice, we must recognise the fact that, at any time, the incapacity, haste, blundering, or petulance of a Foreign Minister may precipitate a crisis big with the fate of nations. t ""We have to justify our position sometimes in order to avoid any possible idea that we were insensible of the financial problems and possibilities that were before us. May I refer with the greatest possible respect to one or two opinions expressed by the honourable member for Flinders? I do not agree with the honourable member that it is bad for a State to borrow internally. I Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - It is largely a question of degree.",29
205,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"No doubt. The TJnited Kingdom is the great lending country of the world. I shall show the pace at which it does lend money to other nations, and, commercially speaking, it is perhaps the most prosperous country in the world. That circumstance may not be conclusive. It is a fact, also, that Australia's prosperity and progress have been greatest since we began to borrow internally. Turning to the figures issued by the Board of Trade for the last decade, we find that the proportion of our indebtedness which is local has been substantially increased during the last ten years. It is somewhat significant that when that canon of financial prudence which the honourable member for Flinders has laid down was not applied, our prosperity seemed to be most on the increase. T f we look at the apparent aggregated wealth, in the for m of bank deposits, we find that there is a large surplus always awaiting an outlet, far more than the banks can apply profitably, aud I cannot see that the applying of our own capital to the development of our own resources, and preventing the expansion of that drain by way of interest to the outside world, which has been in progress for the last for t y years, does not give a ""balance of advantage in our favour.",30
206,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I should be in clined to agree with the honourable member if he treated this question as one of degree-that is to say, if we only take from the wealth of the country by that means what it can easily spare at the time. _M.r. GLYNN - That is the point. So ""long as we have common premises there is no difference of opinion between the honourable member for Elinders and myself; but I am afraid that,, as his argument struck the House, his opinion may have seemed more pronounced against local borrowing than on closer investigation it proves to be. ""Whether we should borrow from abroad depends on whether we reproduce the interest and make a proSt, directly or indirectly, .on the amount borrowed. If we only reproduce the interest .and .the cost of the loan, we are just as we were before; we have a Suce ostponed obligation. But if we - do promore than fhat, then, on the balance, we .gain by borrowing from .abroad. And, of course, young countries, not having capitalized 'their .resources - to any extent in the beginning, .and not at all in proportion to their .possibilities of development,, must borrow for a time from abroad. But if it be asked which is better for a country, which is in a position to adopt either for m of finance, I say that local borrowing is better, as it tends to foster that independence of spirit and that nnancial standing and self-reliance which we all desire to see established. honourable member for Elinders has touched on mauy matters which are not quite directly related to the Bill , and are of too great importance to be discussed in connection with this loan proposal. I think it would be a dangerous expedient, unless we were driven to it by a sense of overpowering necessity, to interfere with a grant that the States had received by an Act of Parliament, though that Act be capable of alteration, modification, or repeal. We should therefore assume that the payment was to be continued for a period of ten years. A man should never tell a lie, but I suppose that sometimes he is not obliged to tell the truth . Silence is, at times, in the case of. politicians, a necessity as well as a virtue I confess that I have felt a great deal of sympathy with the views expressed by the honourable member for Flinders as to not fixing the payments to the States. was a member of the Ministry that advocated placing the per capita payment of 25 per - cent, per annum in the Constitution. I do not know what stand I would have taken up had I not been bound at the time by a sort of corporate conscience to believe that the Bill brought down for the purpose of altering the Constitution in that regard was the last word in political wisdom. Personally, I am not altogether sorry that the power to meet a great emergency by keeping back, or not extending, the 25s. per head, which is given to us by the Constitution, was conferred upon us by the better judgment of the electors of Australia. ",31
207,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"We should not make a bigger mistake - now by going back on the other alternative on which the electors acted, which was that there was to be an assurance that for a further experimental period of ten years the States were to receive from 'the Commonwealth a per capita payment of 25s. per annum-the very payment which the electors did not wish to see embodied in the Constitution. Though it may be necessary in a great national crisis to call up every available revenue that we have, I say that unless there is an overpowering sense of necessity We should not do so.  would not be a party to repudiating a solemn compact with the States? ' Mr Glynn - I hope that there will The be no misunderstanding. I - say that we should not break what the States have regarded as a kind of contractual obligation. Though we have the power to repeal it , the understanding was that, though the Constitution was not to be amended in order to insert in it a - per capita payment of 25s. as a fixed provision, at least the payment of the same amount per head to the States should continue for au experimental period of ten years.",31
208,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The whole point is whether it was a contract.,31
209,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I know that it. was not a contract; but we should not settle questions of general policy by the mere text or test of an ordinary agreement. It was not technically a contract, but it was an understanding that affected the trend of political opinion at the time the referendum was taken. I We are now faced with the greatest war in history and the necessity for exceptional expedients. To realise the extant of the obligations ""we may have to face is almost impossible. When we think of the territorial extent of the war-from Switzerland to the Atlantic at Ostend, from Ostend to the Baltic, from the Baltio across half of Europe to Boumania, and from the eastern frontier of Austria across to the Italia Irredenta; when we consider also-what appeals to us more directly-the conflict in the Dardanelles, stretching from the iEgean Sea to the Bosphorus, in regions of immortal memories, which our own brave boys have crowned-vre must realise that the war is one of the most colossal in history. When tested by the number of nations engaged, by the wastage in life and energy, by its effect on commerical relationships, and by its far-reaching moral and racial possibilities,' we realise that there' has never been so vast a struggle since the world experienced the meddlesomeness, the passions, and the heroic ardour of mankind. But while recognising the tremendous responsibilities before us, there, are one or two matters to which one can draw attention as showing what, as time goes on, will 'be our cauacity to hear these obligations. I may begin' by mentioning the change in the burden of a nation's debt as its population and prosperity increase. I am .speaking as one who has never been an advocate of a borrowing policy. In 1902, when Sir George Turner brought in his first extraordinary Bill for borrowing £571,000, of which about £220,000 was. to go to works in New South Wales-all States receiving their shares of the expenditure-that State received through the Customs, after the Commonwealth had taken its one-fourth, .as provided under the Braddon section, - about £1,200,000 more than it had received in the previous yeaT. So obsessed were the' people of Australia with the idea of borrowing that it became as a sort of reflex action on the part of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to ask for a loan whether he needed it or not. I do not think that Sir George Turner was enthusiastic over his loan proposal, biit as he was a Minister, he was driven to it in that corporate sense that"" sometimes drives people in a direction contrary to that in which their own personal wishes Would guide them. However, I am glad - to say that we threw out that Bill or [192]-2 resolution, my vote helping that decision. Let us take the position of the TJnited Kingdom during the last fifty years. There has been a marked development, which we can compare with the position of a young community like ours with the potentialities and powers of development which we possess. Until 1846, unfortunately, there was not much change in the conditions of the United Kingdom. Factory legislation was blocked on all hands. There were extraordinary ideas about trade, aud as to what prosperity consisted of. Thanks to Sir Robert Feel, and others, a new era began about 1850, brought a'bout by the relaxation of the grip that existed in regard to external commerce, and hy paying more attention to the condition of the masses by meanB of beneficent factory and social legislation. The results were, perhaps, greater than were hoped for' by those who had given attention to political matters in the preceding generation - The national debt of the United Kingdom fifty years ago .<*s £821,000,000, or £28 per head. To show that increased population and increased prosperity .gradually diminish the .burden of a .national debt, that of the United Kingdom on the 23rd April, 1913, was £661,000,000,, or only £14 per head. During the fifty years the decline in the indebtedness per head was from £28 to £14. On the 31st March the national debt of the United Kingdom, owing-to the war, had increased by £458,000,000. The Budget statement of Mr Lloyd George showed that the total indebtedness was £1,165,802,000, but it is encouraging to know that the British Chancellor had been reducing it at the rate of about £12,000,000 per year. The Liberal Government in Great Britain, during their term of office, struck off by redemption £107,000,000 of the national debt. I am not speaking as an advocate of borrowing, but because I think the people ought to be shown that there is a light in which borrowing in a great national crisis such as this should he viewed, enabling them to look with the brighter outlook which I am sure is in store for Australia at the obligations which are now so willingly recognised by those who have the means at their disposal to pay; because 'these obligations, if the development of Australia is equal to the magnificence of. its resources, should - be more lightly borne in the future, always assuming that we do not abuse our powers of borrowing OF taxation by extravagance. Let me take the position of the TJnited Kingdom. The property value in 1812 was £2,700,000,000, and the national debt was £900,000,000, or equal to a mortgage pressure of 33 per cent. That was at a period when the Napoleonic wars were concluding, and some people, according to their means, were paying up to two-thirds of their incomes in order to meet the obligations imposed by those wars. The value of property in the TJnited Kingdom in 1909 was £14,000,000,000, and the national debt at that time was £754,000,000, or a mortgage pressure of only 5 per cent. If the figures of 1913 are taken, when the national debt was £707,000,000, and the accumulations are assumed to have increased at the rate they have been doing during the last ten years, the pressure would be only 4 per cent, on the capital resources of the United Kingdom. A comparison of the indebtedness of the United Kingdom with that of the other belligerent nations shows that Great Britain stands in the strongest poeition. I do not propose to give all the figures. On the 31st December, 1915, the national debt of Prance will probably be £2,253,000,000, while that of G-reat Britain is set down at £1,587,000,000. Passing on, let us look at the resources of the TJnited Kinsrdom. The British investments during the six years from 1906 to 1011 were £829,000,000. I refer to foreign investments and ship earnings, which are always taken into account as external investments. These had been proceeding at the rate of £2,500,000 a day up to the beginning of the war, when this form of investment was practically stopped. It is in these tremendous resources that are now entirely devoted to the purpose of enabling the people of Great Britain to meet their loan necessities, and the call for revenue to meet annual expenditure, that we see the source of the fortitude and ease with which, happily, the Imperial Government have met their obligations.",31
210,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I think that the total investments of British capital amount to £4,000,000,000.",33
211,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"'The private and semi-public ' investments abroad of the people of . Great Britain earn £200,000,000 a year in interest. In his Budget speech Lloyd George mentions that the well-to-do, as he calls them, have £4,000,000,000 invested in . foreign and Colonial securities. The investments of the Imperial Government are not very large. They were summed up in the Budget, aud consist of Suez Canal shares, among other things; but the State property of Great Britain is insignificant compared with the property of individuals. Then there are annual savings amounting to £300,000,000 or £400,000,000.",33
212,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Does the honourable member know what sums have been lent to Austria and to Germany?,33
213,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I haye not that information here. As much as 95 per cent, of the £200,000,000 earned by external investments come from couutries not affected by the operations of the war. Germany's foreign investments, however, are ' mostly in countries affected by the war. Many other facts of that kind, when summed up, show the tremendous financial strength, and consequently great borrowing power, of the Imperial Government of Great Britain. Since the war, the trade of Great Britain has diminished by £170,000,000; but her foreign trade still amounts to £1,223,269,000. I am glad that our proposed loan is to be made the subject of an appeal to the general public. In the first instance, the Imperial Government was niggardly in its recognition of the small investor. There were 100,000 applications for the loan floated in November, £700,000,000 being tendered to cover a loan of £350,000,000. In the case of the first German loan, which was for £2a3 036,445, 75 per cent, of the ap; plications were for less than £100 worth of stock. The'loan was mentioned at the time as a magnificent .expression of the grit of Germany, and of the German capacity to meet internal obligations. In connection with the German loan, which was issued in, I think, February last, there were 2,691,060 applications, and of these 1,694,359 .were for sums of £50 and under, and over 911,000 for sums of between £50 and £500. That was another splendid example of the spirit of the people of Germany with which we have to contend. The last Imperial loan showed that when a similar appeal was made to the people of Great Britain the response wascommensurate, and I believe that the same thing will happen here. In regard to the note issue, I think that no harm can be done by dwelling on the necessity for caution. The States which are at war seem to have reached the limits of that borrowing which is done under the guise of a note issue. Let us consider the position of the Bix great national banks. In March last, the Bank of England had increased. its note issue, including the Treasury notes, by £43,500,000, as compared with the issue of March-, 1914; the Bank of France had increased its issue by £212,000,000; the issue of the Imperial Bank of Germany had been increased £157,000,000; that of the Bank of Bussia by £150,000,000; and that of the Austro-Hungary Bank by £89,000,000, the total increase being £262,000,000, or fro m £601,500,000 .to £1,253,000,000. If we consider the gold reserves of these banks, we shall see how cautious they have all been. The Bank of England had a gold reserve against Bank and Treasury notes of 117 per cent.; the Bank of France, a gold reserve of 38 per cent.; the Imperial Bank of Germany, a gold reserve of 46 per cent.; the Bank of Bussia, a gold reserve of 50 per cent.; and the AustroHungary Bank, a gold reserve of 45 per cent., the gold reserve in every case being greater than ours, which is about 33 per cent. The gold reserves of these banks have increased by £149,000,000, and their note currency by about £652,000,000. Let us see what they say about theset matters at Home. Lloy d George, in that part of his Budget speech which was headed *' The Paper Bridge, "" Tefers to the note borrowing of Germany, and saysThere is, first of all, a paper bridge-wha t is known as dilution of the currency. Disguise it as they will, there are many girders in the' .German financial bridge which are made of paper, and no amount of paint and varnish wiU hide the fact. It is an easy and very tempting'method. You appear to get over - your difficulties in the simplest way, and it is very difficult for any one to point out the way you are going wrong for some time. Looking at it most carefully, it is simply an indirect method of levying taxes upon the income of the people. You water the currency, and the prices go up. . A country that bas no foreign trade, which is the case in Germany, can do it . A' country which has still got a great international trade cannot do it. Gold would - vanish, and there would be a rise in the price of provisions which would be fatal to any Phancellor of the Exchequer. Therefore, that is a course which would be fatal for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to pursue in order to get over his difficulties in 'meeting the deficiency. It ' is as well that we should bear in min d in regard to our financing the trend of. Imperial opinion.",33
214,Mr FENTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Can the honourable member say why there has been such an in crease of the note issues of Germany and France compared with that of England? Is it due to the greater use of cheques in England ?,34
215,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Yes . Ninety-eight per cent, of the financial currency of the city by of London consists of cheques and bills of exchange, less than 1 per cent, consists of gold, and about 1 per cent, consists of notes. The Scotch' note currency is about about 10 or 12 per cent. In connection with the Bank of France, u n t i l ' recently practically everything was done by means of notes, the cheque system not being in vogue, and in Germany they have been dealing not so much in cheques as in notes; but about three years ago they passed a law under which the development of the cheque system is marked. As regards the imposition of income tax, I would urge caution upon the Treasurer in fixing the scale. The income' taxation of the State Governments brings in £2,881,055 a year, my figures being for the year ended 30th June, 1914'.",34
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Since then Mr. Holman has increased the income taxation of New South Wales by about £1,000,000, and the State direct taxation is now about £4,000,000.",34
217,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The figures which I have are not absolutely reliable for the purposes of comparison. If you take Mr Lloyd George's speech of the 5th March, you will see that the yield of the British income tax,, the rate of which has been doubled, is now £59,279,000, but the yield of the previous year, which I take fro m other sources/ was £47,249,000, so that the doubling of the rate has not greatly increased the return. There has been very heavy pressure on some classes, without corresponding benefit to the Treasury. The war supertax brings in about £10,000,000. It is paid by 26,000 persons, about 15,000 of whom were new taxpayers after the war budget was framed. The increased pressure upon individuals has been great, but the in -, creased return to the Treasury has been comparatively small. In this morning's newspaper there is published a telegram in which it is stated that the'war taxation for th© year 1914-15 was £18,000,000, and that it was estimated that for 1916-16 it would be £68,000,000, and for 1916-17 £72,000,000. They must therefore find some better means than a blind increasing of rates, without oare and discrimination. I agree with the honourable members for Parramatta, Flinders, and Swan that we should have had a comprehensive survey of the whole position before being asked to decide as to the taxation to be imposed, and the manner of imposition. We should have the opinion of financiers, or Treasury officials, as to the comparative effect of various expedients",34
218,Mr RILEY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,There is no taxation proposal now before the House.,35
219,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I think I may with some truth say that, unfortunatelv, once a proposal is Drought before the House it cannot be altered. The only opportunity an honourable member has of compassing his desire is by speaking before those private meetings are held of which we hear so much, and which make the House the mere register of unalterable opinions.",35

221,Mr GLYNN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Mr Lloyd'George has appealed to the people to economize, but I am afraid that very often if you do not spend you embarrass other persons. It is extravagance that we ought to avoid; parsimony and meanness, restriction in the wrong direction, .would strike at those whom we wish to assist. The subject is one ih regard to whioh many opinions are held to which expression is not always given. Another matter to whioh I should like to make reference is the spirit with which the German people are meeting appeals made to them. In sneaking on the last German Loan Bill, Dr Delbruck, the Vice-President of the Prussian State Department, mentioned that this was not only a war of nations and of armies, bnt of people against people; and the sooner we recognise that the better. He saidThe war upon which we are now engaged is .altogether different from those of former centuries. Then the Army went forth; the people at home sent their good wishes after them, and rejoiced in thiir victories. To-day England's attempt to starve us out has made* this war a war of people against people-nay , of man against man-so that every one, no matter wliether he be in the field or at home, under arms or at work, without distinction of age OT sex, must devote his whole being to the simple service of war. Every one of ns must from morn till night direct every activity by the one question-no w to injure the enemy ana serve onr country.",35

226,Mr CARR,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Macquarie) [6.8] - The diBCUssion of this measure naturally opens up a vista of the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and State Governments, and of the whole financial position. The Commonwealth aud State Governments, having joint powers in regard tb the taxation of the same sources of wealth, are certainly acting in a most irregular manner. The honourable member for Flinders dealt very effectively with this aspect of the situation, and one cannot but endorse his fear as to what the consequences - may be. The honourable member has expressed the opinion that the Commonwealth, is the guardian of the State finances. That is a new doctrine to be laid down in this House. Nbmin-ally we may be the guardian of the State finances, but in fact we have absolutely no control over them. The State Governments are sovereign within their own sphere, and instead of approaching them with the air of dictators, as has been done, I am sorry to say, in some cases, by M in isters, Ave should meet them as equals with propositions to be discussed. ;thus reasoning together Ave might arrive at a satisfactory solution of the problem of hoAV the joint finances of the whole country should be conducted. It is the height of absurdity that Governments that are in no way acting in concert - should be levying upon the same people, - and draAving in the same way upon the - same sources of Avealth. This system has - continued too long. We have not yet - even been able to bring about the consolidation of the State debts. A proposal for their consolidation was carried, but I understand that, owing to limitations which the State Governments insisted aipon maintaining, in respect qf their right to borrow independently of the - CommonAvealth, the proposition fel l through, and the motion has never been put into effect. If it is necessary that the Constitution should be amended, in - order that a better nnancial arrangement may be arrived at, then such an - amendment should have been included in the other proposals which have - been submitted by this Government, and which it is proposed to place before the people. Finance is admittedly one - of the most difficult questions Will which Ave have to deal, but, apparently, the more immediate troubles under which we labour-the questions of the determination of industrial conditions, the - control of monopolies, and like subjectshave obscured every other consideration. I take the view that behind all these there - still remains the great financial problem which threatens to, and undoubtedly will, - swamp us if the several separate Governments of the Commonwealth and the States are to continue, each in their own way, heedless of all other considerations. We have to recognise that the States, Avithin their respective spheres, are sovereign powers, and that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot do as it pleases with them. It is open to us, of course, to act independently of them, and to go to the extent of discontinuing the present payment to the States of 25s. per head of the population; bu t I do not say that that should be done. An y such action would still further estrange the States, and the estrangement between the State and Commonwealth Governments is already too marked. There appears to be, on the part of the Government of the Commonwealth, a tendency to emphasize By its supremacy, although, in fact, it has no real supremacy. The sovereign States, in their respective spheres, are just as dominant as Ave are in our sphere of government. As a matter of fact, their sphere is wider than our own, since all that is not specifically conveyed toils by the Commonwealth Constitution remains within their control. In these circumstances, therefore, there should be ou the part of our leaders a sense of the fitness of things in approaching the State Governments. There has been displayed too much bitterness, and this bitterness is being fanned even now. The State Governments should have been approached before this loan proposal was brought forward. There should have been consultations between the Commonwealth and State Governments, and a decision, as far as possible unanimous, arrived at in regard to it . If we are going to exercise our presumed authority, and, as the Prime Minister suggested this afternoon, to look to the people to give us the power to do that which we cannot do now, then we should at once submit, with our other referenda proposals, a Bill to give us the poAver that we seek.",35
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Government called in the bankers of the States, but not the State Governments.",36
228,Mr CARR,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"That in itself Avas a slap in the face to the responsible State Governments exercising sovereign power within their own jurisdiction. We cannot afford to do anything of the kind. We cannot afford to permit ill-feeling to be engendered and fostered by the continuous ignoring of the State Governments. I take the view that some form of unification in respect of finance must be brought about very shortly, but we are not likely to secure it by acting as we have been doing, unless we succeed in winning the people to our side on an appeal to them by way of referendum, and to do that in the face of the opposition of the State Governments would be no easy task. It is for the Commonwealth to give a lead in this matter. If the Commonwealth Government, by virtue of its position, claims to be supreme, it should justify its claim by displaying that strength to concede, which, to my mind, is the hall-mark of superiority. Commonwealth Government is giving no evidence of such strength. Although I support the Government, I say, unhesitatingly, that one of its weak spots is that it has not sufficiently considered the importance of the States. It has not treated with the State Governments with the object of bringing about, by common consent, a better system of finance, and of doing away with the present system under which each helps itself at will to this and that source of the wealth of the country. The responsibility of guardianship of the States, as suggested by the honourable member for Flinders, seems to me to be a responsibility without power. The Commonwealth is not in a position to act as the guardian of the States, and, that being so, I object to the assumption of that responsibility. The obligation, apparently, is all on our side. To put on the screw, as has been hinted at, by actually foreclosing as a mortgagee would do, because, to some extent, we have them in our power as debtors, would simply be to make confusion worse confounded, and to add insult to injury. Such a thing could not be tolerated for one moment. If one State became bankrupt, it would be to the discredit of the whole Commonwealth, and to talk of putting on the screw in that way is to suggest that which could not be given a moment's consideration. On the other hand, an advance with a view to a compromise, such as that to which a sovereign State is entitled, should at once be made. longer we delay the more Australia will suffer. Coming to the war expenditure, I would point out that, whilst it is easy tc vote supplies, and whilst war supplies must be voted, their expenditure has not been as carefully guarded as it should have been. Contracts have been let here, there, and everywhere under .1 system th.it has resulted in the Government being called upon to pay for many of its requirements far more than it has any need to do. If attention had been given to certiiia information that has been placed at the disposal of the Government at different times-and by myself amongst Mr Carr. ' others-larg e sums could have been saved. I make this statement here because it is useless to mention it elsewhere. In respect of certain contracts which have been let, 100 per cent, more has been paid for goods than need have been paid for them. The That I am in a position to prove.",36
229,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"That , perhaps, is because of the union label condition in the contracts.",37
230,Mr CARR,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The increase has nothing whatever to do with any such consideration. When mentioning this matter I had in mind certain imported lines, with the facts relating to which I am familiar. One line indented by a keen business man ac a cost of 22s. 6d. per gross was bought by the Defence Department at prices running up to 46s. per gross. The expenditure in respect of this one item ran into thousands of pounds. In another caseand there are quite a number of themthe Department Avere paying 15s. per dozen for a certain article which I advised them could be landed here by the Government and supplied to the troops at a cost of 7s. per dozen. This advice was not acted upon. If the responsible authorities would only make inquiries from some of our keen commercial men, they would be put in the way of obtaining goods at first cost, instead of having to purchase them, even by tender, from rings of com.mercial men who will not cut against each other, but who will command their own jjrice whatever it may be. This sort of thing is still going on. I am in a position to show that, in respect of some of the requirements of the Department a saving of 100 per cent, could be effected. OlTicialdom, however, is such that it cannot be overcome. One appeals to the Minister, who, in turn, appeals to his The officers, and is informed by them that what is suggested cannot be done. No intelligent, thoughtful interest is displayed in the business affairs of the country. No keen desire is shown to avoid unnccessarv expenditure of the kind I have just indicated. I recognise that Ministers are more or less at the behest of their officials under the present system of government, which, on the one hand, secures an evanescent responsibility to the Minister, and, on the other, permanence of control to the officers. Under such a system the preponderance of power must, and does, rest with the officers. If the Department could only be remodelled by the infusion now and then of new blood from outside, the position would be improved. I give the Prime Minister credit for the appointment of Mr R. MCC. Anderson, but one man is not sufficient. There are keen and patriotic men in this country who are prepared to place the whole of their special knowledge and qualities at the disposal of the Government. I leave the matter there.",37
231,Mr FLEMING,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Robertson) [6.21] Whilst a good deal has been said upon the subject of general finance during this - debate, which I have listened to very carefully, I have heard very little that to this particular Bill, though no time - that Ave can spend in discussing it Avill be in any Avay wasted. I feel very strongly that as our young fellows at the front haA'e shown the material of which they are made-the y have alarmed and - astonished the Avorld by their A^igourso Ave here ought to perform our duty just as thoroughly and support in every possible way the young felloAvs we have sent to the front. It should be rather ;a proud moment for Australia to think 'that she is noAv called upon, not only to - do her share in the fighting, but also in - the financing of the greatest Avar that the Avorld has ever seen. This Bill appeals not only to our loyalty and patriotism, but also to our self-reliance, and if .all our energies are focussed on this one point Ave shall make the proposed loan, not only a success, but an absolute .triumph. I do not desire to say much .about the CommonAvealth Bank in connection Will the Loan Bill. To my mind, .the Bank has been a failure. It could - not very Avell have been othervfise, because it had neither cash nor credit. The Bank cannot help us in this crisis, for, though we are told that it has the credit of the CommonAvealth behind it , that is .all idle talk. So long as the Treasurer has control of the note issue the CommonAvealth Bank cannot have the credit of the Commonwealth behind it. So that we can put the CommonAvealth Bank absolutely on one side so far as the present crisis is concerned. With the private banks, hoAvever, the position is quite ferent. If these banks are treated in a proper spirit they can do a great deal more than they have yet done. Although 4hey have advanced ';£10,000,000 to the Government Avithout interest, that docs not by any means exhaust their resources, and if they are approached in a friendly way I have no doubt that they will be ahle to do much to assure the success of this loan. I have gone to some trouble to get figures relating to the operations of the private banks, and I find that their assets on the 30th June, 1914, Avere £176,000,000. At the same time, their liabilities were £168,000,000. A very important matter in connection Will the liabilities and assets of these private banks is that the banks have been gradually, but continuously, reducing the sums they had invested in land. Their interest in the relates OAvnership of land was reduced from £6,000,000 in 1900 to £4,500,000 in 1914. That seems to indicate a very serious position. Surely our production is worth fostering. Surely our production ought to be a field of financial enterprise sound enough to encourage the banks to increase their advances rather than decrease them, and the position is one which I think needs attention. If the Government showed sympathy tOAvards the producing interests, I haA'e not much doubt that Ave should largely increase production, and so restore the confidence of the banks in this type of investment. Deposits not bearing interest-the ordinary trading accounts-in the private banks increased from £37,000,000 in 1905 to £70,000,000 in 1914. The deposits bearing interest-and these deposits Avill undoubtedly provide a proportion of this war loan-hav e increased from £61,000,000 in 1905 to £93,500,000 in 3914. During the same period the deposits in the Savings Banks increasedfrom £35,500,000 to £83,500,000; and the total of interest-bearing deposits in all banks increased to no less , than £177,000,000 last year. That,is a very serious position for a young country like this to be in. With all the possibilities we have for the investment of money, the fact that we have £177,000,000 - probably £180,000,000^-locked up at 3 to 3£ per cent, interest shows that there is something wrong somewhere. To my mind, this is due to an absence of confidence; and the principal thing that we can do at the present moment to make this loan a success, not only so far as difconcerns the present issue, but allits issues, and to establish a feeling of confidence in Australian finance, is to do all that can be done to show that we in this House are in sympathy with production. The bank notes in circulation today represent nearly nine times greater. value than ever before-and this is just at the beginning of the war. Such a position is serious, and needs close supervision. The previous highest issue was £3,750,000, - in 1910. As the honourable member for Flinders pointed out, before the end of the year we shall have notes issued representing £40,000,000 £45,000,000. It seems to me that if the Prime Minister and the Government show more sympathy towards the private banks they will get a great deal of the money on interest-bearing deposit, whether rightly or wrongly, for in the loan. Some people think that this money ought not to be withdrawn the banks. With that view I differ. my opinion, the present is the time for those people who have deposits in the banks, and for the banks themselves, come forward and do what they can to make this loan the tremendous we all hope it is going to be. companies provide another source from which we may hope to wet a great deal cf money, and I want to say a word or two to the Prime Minister on the subject of those companies. In 1914 the assets of the Australian-owned insurance companies represented an amount of between £60,000,000 and £70,000,000, nearly the whole of which is invested at an average of 4£ per cent - exactly the amount the Government propose to pay for this loan. It seems to me that it is hardly that we shall be able insurance companies to withdraw great amount of the money have already invested in order to reinvest it at the same rate of but these insurance companies, hitherto have been trusted and worthy, and which have done and are doing a great deal for the nnancial stability of the Commonwealth, plus funds amounting approximately £2,000,000 a year. Recently Government brought forward surance Amendment Bill. assure the Government, and I to assure the Prime Minister ticularly, that this Insurance ment Bill is creating a great deal of fear - I might almost say consternationamongst the big insurance companies. have it from one of the greatest ties connected with insurance in Australia ilfr. Fleming. that if that Bill becomes law it will do more harm to insurance and to the big: insurance companies than anything that', could reasonably be allowed, and I would urge upon the Prime Minister to recognisethat at a time like the present, when-, financial stability is more important to this country than almost anything elsewhen it is more desirable than it has ever been that there should be a feeling of to financial security in the country-that he should not do anything to injure the big will insurance companies that have so much to lose, and stand for so much that s good in the community by permitting this Bill to go through in anything like itsinvestment present shape.",38

Discovering that the British Government were ready to lend a further"" sum to us, we approached them, and got £6,500,000 for war purposes, in addition to the £18,000,000, on the same terms as we had got the latter-and very good terms, indeed. It was subsequent to that period that the market hardened in favour of the investor, and new conditions arose. I am sorry to say that the Commonwealth Government raised this £6,500,000, as it had raised the £18,000,000, without parliamentary authority; but I hope that what I might, perhaps, call our precipitate act will be condoned under the circumstances. The only regret I have is that it was not a larger sum; but, at the same time, we did what we considered to be the right thing. We asked for a little more than the British Government thought was a fair thing at the time.",40

We must make no complaint; indeed, we ought to be very grateful to the Home Government. It was subsequent to this loan that the statement came, of which I have before informed the House, that is, on the 6th July of this year.

Perhaps the right honourable gentleman can tell us how he is going to finance this £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for public works this year.

252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I know; but we have heard much lately about the necessity for organizing our finances and putting them on a war basis. We have had many homilies- I have delivered one myself-o n the necessity for retrenchment and economy-for drawing in sail, and utilizing every pound we can lay our hands on for war purposes, and war purposes alone, while minimizing our expenditure in many other directions. confess I was surprised at the range that the ' debate took this afternoon. seemed to me that we were not merely debating our own loan proposals, but actually the whole range and scale of our constitutional powers, particularly as they affect finance. There is no use disguising the fact that the whole crux of the Constitution centres on the question of financial control. In my judgment, before we can point the finger at the States, either warningly or in any minatory way, we ought to resolutely set our own house in order. The best thing we can do for the States, and to the States, is to set them an excellent example. If we are responsible, as has been allegedand there is no doubt that in the eyes of the world Australia is held to its responsibility as associated with the Federal Parliament, and that in that high sense the statement is true-if we are responsible for the whole financial credit of Australia, then the best thing we can do is to set an example in economy and rigidly review our own position. I d o n ot think we can say anything to the States until we have begun to do that. But are we getting the best out of the Federal .compact at the present time? Why should the Commonwealth stand over the States and tell them what they must do perforce ; or why should the States, on the other hand, criticise the Federal Government and tell them what they must almost not do? I have always held the opinion that we have scarcely begun to work our Constitution constructively. As I understand Federation, it means that there should be amicable relations between the two entities.",41

He stands in this House and talks to the people of that State as if they were inferior and had inferior functions. I do not understand my Federal "" book "" in that way. The essence of Federation to me means amicability of relationship between the two governing entities of Australia.

270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I do not see how a general debate can be avoided. do not see the difference between this motion and a similar motion concerning an Appropriation Bill .,42
271,The CHAIRMAN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The motion deals entirely with the War Loan Bill , with which the States are not in any way connected.",42
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I take it that, as the motion will grant supplies for our public services, the discussion upon it should take in the whole of the financial relations of the Commonwealth, particularly as the war affects not only State relations to the Commonwealth, but also the whole of the Commonwealth as an Federal entity. A great deal has been said today as to whether there should be financial unification. We have been arguing the question of whether there should be one or two Governments controlling finances, and that is the only point on which I am speaking at the present moment. My contention is that we do not need to recast and reconstruct the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth if we treat the matter of the finances in a Federal spirit, and consult the States, and act harmoniously with The Treasurer has consulted the bankers, and they have advised him. Has he consulted the States with regard to his and their further borrowing?",42

275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"But since then . all borrowing from London has been interwe are told that we must not borrow at all. That decision profoundly affects the States as much as the ComWe shall have no trouble to in raising this £20,000,000 for war purposes, but what the States are going to do to raise money, as they will have to do immediately, I do not pretend to know. I think that we shall not need beto stand by and tell them that they will have to draw in their horns. The very of things will compel them to do t to an extent they perhaps will not. aphim preciate. But since the whole of the London market has been closed to them and to us, and we have been thrown on to our own resources, the proper thing I to have been done was to pall a financial conference and discuss the whole matter in the light of the state of the London money market. The statement that has come out from London affects the States as much as it affects us. Our relations are affected in the same way, because we both have to appeal to the one nnancial - source in Australia. It is to our in terests, as well as to the interests of the States, that there should be a complete and cordial consultation with regard to the whole of our borrowing requirements and the steps to be taken to suit the needs of each. If ever there was a time when amicability and complete and cordial consultation should exist between the States and the Commonwealth, it is the present, when we are both meeting an .unprecedented set of circumstances. I do ?oot know what has been the experience - of otner Administrations. I know that whenever I have been in consultation with -.the States I have not found it impossible to get on with them.",42
276,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"But the right honourable gentleman has not been taking anything away from them. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not think that we should take from the States more than we can help taking. We have our functions to perform, and they have theirs. I am merely suggesting now that our attitude should not be an arm'slength attitude. It should, rather, be one of complete and close co-operation, which is the very spirit and essence of the Federal bond. I do not care how we re-arrange our machinery, we can never make the Commonwealth absolutely independent of the States, or make the States absolutely independent, of the Commonwealth. It is the very essence of Federation that each should subscribe to its own limitations. Federation begins with the recognition of the limitations of the Commonwealth; therefore there is in a Federal system of government, perhaps more than in any other system, a greater call for the display of the Federal spirit, altogether apart from the mere cold machinery of it . I admit freely and frankl y that there has been extravagance, wild extravagance; but can any honourable member say that we are to change all this by a mere alteration of machinery! Extravagance is a personal matter; it is not an impersonal matter, to be affected by machinery, as such. By machinery we may make extravagance easier or a little more difficult, but whatever the machinery may be, there will always be extravagance if the machinery is operated by extravagant people with extravagant notions, who seek to spend money for political and other purposes merely to put it round and make themselves popular in doing so. No machinery that I know of can stop Governments from doing this, and that is precisely what has been done in Australia in late years.",43
277,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Surely the check on extravagance will not be as great in a business where there is a bad system that lends itself to extravagance as in business where there is a good system.,43
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,We can have no check which will stop extravagance if people are disposed to be extravagant.,43
279,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Some systems lend themselves to extravagance. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The honourable member has been interjecting "" Hear, hear,"" to every proposal which has been made today for seeking further power for the Commonwealth as against the States. I ask him a simple question: Does he believe that there is extravagance and costly control in his own State of New South Wales ?",43
280,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I believe that there is costly control in all the States.,43
281,The CHAIRMAN,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Order ! The de-. bate is getting beyond the question before the Chair, which has no connection with the administration of the States.",43
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I come back to my point. The mere alteration or readjustment of our machinery of government will not necessarily give economy. Everything will depend on how we operate the machinery that is in existence. If that machinery is operated by Socialistic Governments, who believe in extending the functions of the State and in the State doing things which themselves are not economical, we cannot have economical government; we must spend the people's money unnecessarily. Everything depends, not on the machinery we operate, so much as on the man behind who is operating the machine-in other words, the various Governments of Australia, who find it popular to spend money and to raise money so long as the people will give it .",43
283,Mr RILEY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,This Loan Bill is for war purnoses only.,43
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I know that it is for war purposes, and because the war has cut off the financial supplies of the States Ave in this Federal Parliament are entitled to consider the financial relationship of the States to ourselves and to the war, ivhich is the only point that I am putting before the Committee. What We need above all things UOAV is financial consultation and co-operation. Let us all get together under this burden, and try to sheer down the Avhole cost of it by cutting off every trapping and every form of political frippery on which Ave can put our hands. That is the attitude that we should adopt all through these proposals. I regret very much to hear that the Prime .Minister has not been in consultation with the States since he received the intimation from London that we need not look to the London money market for further loans. In not doing so he is paying the States scant courtesy. I suggest that he should do it even now. It is not too late. He knoAvs the difficulties of the States, and because he has the supreme power, the control of the purse, and all those other matters that are to be held in reserve, he, being strong, should consult with those who are financially weaker, and find themselves confronting a sudden condition of affairs which threatens to make a tremendous call on their resources and statesmanship. That is the first thing that, I think, it should have occurred to the Prime Minister, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, to do. This loan is imperative. We haA'e already spent a good - deal of the money. No one can cavil at it . But I suggest to my right honourable friend that he should, as soon as possible, give us a rough-and-ready review of the whole position as it affects Australia as a whole, as well as the Commonwealth in particular. I am not asking for a scientific Budget, but I think we are entitled to have that rough-and-ready review that I speak of, and if we can get that we shall be on much stronger ground i 'i voting these supplies from time to time.

We arc IIOAV in July, the first month of the Commonwealth financial year, and the right honourable gentleman knows, or ought to know, that the books cannot be balanced until about the 21st of the month; yet, on the 1st day of July, I made a frank and full statement, as detailed as it possibly could be made, of the receipts and expenditure of the year ending the 30th June last, a thing unheard of until then in any Parliament. I handed to the Leader of the Opposition a brief memorandum showing everything that could be shown, and it is to be found in our Hansard record. What is the meaning, then, of these constant appeals for another financial statement? What is the meaning of these requests to be told exactly Avhat is being done? There is nothing being done that the right honourable member does not know of.",44
286,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Leader of the Opposition asked, not for a complete financial statement, but for an outline of what the right honourable gentleman proposes to do.",44

The prospectus of the loan ought to be issued on Monday next at latest, to give the public an opportunity to apply for stock, and to enable us to obtain the instalments in time to provide for war expenditure already incurred, and being incurred from day to day. We cannot raise money in a moment. No one can say exactly what we shall need; I could give only an estimate. Ten per cent, of the loan is to be subscribed on application, 15"" per cent, more on the 15th September, 20 per cent, more on the 15th October, 25 per cent, more Tjn the 15th November, and the final 30 per cent, on the 30th November.",44

We could not go on the money market tomorrow. £6,500,000, of course, will be available, and there are still resources from the note issue. Before the House rises, I shall make as complete a financial statement of our past operations, and as accurate a forecast of the future, as it is , possible to put before honourable memhivrs. As to our not consulting the States, the honourable member for Flinders has - put liis finger upon the very spot. Never, to my recollection, have the States consulted the Commonwealth about a loan, except when they have wished to borrow money from us. I do not complain of that; but it is a fact that in my official capacity I have iiot been able to obtain information as to the prices at which their loans have been floated, or any particulars of these transactions, which were of any guidance or assistance to me. In saying that, I do not reflect on the States. Their powers are sovereign in the matter of borrowing, and they can do as they please.",45
295,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I do not think that the New South Wales Ministry gives such information to the State Parliament.,45

301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I believe that you can ascertain from official papers what almost every loan raised by Australia has cost.,45
302,Mr FLEMING,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The honourable member for Hunter knows that this information was given to the New South Wales Parliament, of which both he and I were members.",45
303,Mr CHARLTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The fullest information was given.,45

Another We had to seek information from the Auditor-General. I am happy that this question has been raised. We are not working with the States, and no amount of conciliation will enable us to work together. The States are not working in unison for the benefit of Australia. They are working individually, each seeking the best opportunities for borrowing money for its own purposes, and they will not let each other know what their necessities are. They have declined to cooperate with the Commonwealth in regard to the raising of loans.",45
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Has the right honourable gentleman tried them since the war began ?,45
306,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Yes . I can say now publicly what has not been said before, that, when the £18,000,000 was borrowed by the Commonwealth recently, the British Government would under no circumstances advance money except for war purposes.",45

The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Flinders were present at the Conference at which the Premiers demanded to know whence the money was coming, and why I would not say how it would be obtained. I replied that I could not tell them, and I did uot tell them. Money could not be borrowed then except for war purposes; but we were able to advance the States £18,000,000 by using our own resources, and obtaining £18,000,000 from the Britisli Government for war purposes.",45

317,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"We told it everything. Now that we are dealing with national rather than political matters, may I say that it was the greatest regret of my life that the Commonwealth Government had to do this. It was my ambition, as Treasurer, to finance our war expenditure without asking the Imperial Government for a penny. We could have obtained from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000 for the equipment of our Expeditionary Forces without going outside of Australia, and without disturbing the local money market. I say this in defence of the Commonwealth Goverument, not to attack the States. We had to put our own wishes on one side in order to assist and protect the States. As the honourable and learned member for Flinders has said, the credit of the States is intimately connected with that of the Commonwealth, and we put our national Australian feeling on one side to secure and sustain that credit. That was done without any waving of flags or demonstration of any kind. is now said that we have failed to communicate with the States. of fact, I have communicated with them three or four times since the agreement was arrived at with them.",46

The point made by the right honourable member will be sufficiently answered by the .statement that, since the States entered is only a into an agreement not to borrow money until November of this year, there has been no great necessity to consult them during the interval. They have pledged themselves uot to raise any money by way of loan, either inside or outside Australia, except in accordance with the agreement signed by their representatives. That being so, we are not called upon at press the present time to consult the States, seeing that they have been provided for until November next.",46

What I have had occasion to suggest to the States-and I take occasion now to warn them of it is that their difficulties in regard to the raising of money, either here or elsewhere, are not limited in number. Their difficulties will be great, but whatever they may be, the Commonwealth will be associated with the States in trying to minimize their troubles in that respect. publicly appealed to the representatives of the States again and again to arrive at an agreemeut in regard to common borrowing, or, in other words, as to the desirableness of having only one borrower.",46

If they were not in trouble, they might tell if we approached them, to mind our own business. They have a right to come the market individually when and they please. One or more have exercised that right to the full even during the rency of the present agreement, but that I am not complaining. If they express any desire to meet us, we shall meet them; but we were not in a position to afford them any relief in connection with this loan, nor can we see any reasonable prospect of helping them in the near f u t u r e. We are ready, however, to confer and deliberate with them on this important question, and to give them all the assistI have ance we can, as a Government, and, I believe, as a Parliament, in meeting their present and pending difficulties. In conclusion, I have only to repeat the statement. I made at the outset of my remarks,. that if the right honourable gentleman wishes it , I shall hold over all the other matters pending the bringing down of a. financial statement in relation to thefuture.

It is, in fact, a motion to validate that which has already been done. The Prime Minister has informed the Committee that, acting in the interests of the Commonwealth, he borrowed this £6,500,000 on the best terms possible, taking into consideration the circumstances of the time as occasioned by the war itself. I do not think it is wise, therefore, for us to discuss in - connection with this motion the question of whether or not the States have been consulted, more especially as the States were actually consulted by both parties in this Parliament some ten months ago, and that an agreement was then entered into with respect to future borrowing. The Commonwealth, at that time, was solicitous for the welfare of the States during the war crisis, and, consequently, took steps to provide for them. A sum of £18,000,000 was made available, and under the agreement then arrived at, there was a definite arrangement with respect to all borrowing up to the end of the present year. In view of that fact, and the fact that this Parliament is charged with the conduct of the warand this, to my mind, is a most important point-the States surely will take no exception to this proposal. This Parliament, and not the Parliament of the States, has to find the funds necessary for defence purposes, and surely, in view of the agreement that has been arrived at, the States would not insist upon being consulted with respect to this particular transaction. To try to make it appear that they should have been consulted, and that they have been overlooked in some way, is hardly to meet the position fairly. The Commonwealth Government is charged with the great responsibility of finding the money necessary to enable us to carry on the war, and I think every honourable member will agree that, having regard to all the circumstances, the action taken by the Treasurer was the correct one. That being so, why should there be any complaint, some months later, in regard to the question of consulting the States? There is certainly some room for an endeavour to arrive at an agreement with the States in respect to future borrowing in the interests of both the States and the Commonwealth, and in such a way as to protect the taxpayers as a whole. I rose only to point out that it would be regrettable if it should go forth that there is any difference of opinion as to whether or not the States have received fair treatment. An y fair minded man, I think, will admit that the States have received reasonable consideration at the hands of both parties in this Parliament. Our defence expenditure is very heavy. If it were necessary to consult the States regarding this £6,500,000 it would be equally necessary to ask them whether they were agreeable to our floating the proposed loan of £20,000,000 to enable us to prosecute the war.",48
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,No one has suggested that.,48
338,Mr CHARLTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"But this £6,500,000 is for war purposes. The Prime Minister made it clear that he asked for £10,000,000, and that the British Government stated that, as £3,500,000 of that sum was for public works, we should ask only for £6,500,000.",48
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"We are not ' suggesting that there should be a conference with the States in regard to this £6,500,000.",48
340,Mr CHARLTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Jus t so. But what is the inference to be drawn from the honourable member's remarks regarding that sum? This is a specific motion dealing with £6,500,000 required for war purposes, and if the House agrees that it is necessary to obtain this money we ought not to allow the suggestion to go for t h that there ought to have been a consultation with the States. The inference the public will draw from honourable members' remarks in Hansard and from the press is that there ought to have been some conference between the head of this Government and the heads of the different State Governments so that they might have come to some common understanding.",48
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Not with regard to this matter at all.,49
342,Mr CHARLTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The gentleman's remarks were very pointed. He was dealing with this particular motion. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-He was thing of the kind.",49
343,Mr CHARLTON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"If the honourable member's remarks did not apply to this particular motion, what did they apply to? What does the public expect from members of this House but that they shall deal with particular questions as they come forward?",49

354,Mr BOYD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The honourable member said a lot of things last night that were not facts, so that I propose to leave him to stew in his own f at. What I was about to say in regard to the loans that what have already been raised was this: Whilst we have been raising money, ostensibly comfor war purposes, we should not have that money at all if we had kept the £18,000,000 that was lent to the States. We find ourselves, therefore, up against position: that owing to the fact that the war will probably last a good deal longer than some of us anticipated, we not be in the position regarding the raising of loans that we thought we We have already borrowed £18,000,000 from the British GovernHanment. We lent that £18,000,000 to the to carry on their public works, and be the fact is now being brought home to us that we shall shortlv have placed before this House Bills for the purpose of raising in order to pay for the war loans that we have given to the States, in many to squander on public works.",49
355,Mr WEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Do not say squander.,49
356,Mr BOYD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I should be prestatement . if time would permit, and if discussion I do not the honourable member's State, but it was about the grossest Goverument in the matter of extravagant expenditure in the Commonwealth. At the present time, as I think honourable members will agree, all the in dications are that we are in for a prolonged and strenuous war period, and we can only regard the future with a certain amount of trepidation. We know we shall have to borrow this year, next year, and possibly the year after that. And I would urge that the States should get into their minds, clearly and definitely, the impossibility of borrowing money from the Commonwealth for the purpose of carrying on their public works at the same rate that they have been borrowing in the past. The Commonwealth is not in a position to lend the money, and we have not illimit able sources of taxation. We may raise a certain amount of loan money, but if we go beyond that we may do a good deal more damage than many people imagine. I would like to say, in regard to the Loan Bill that we have just passed, that if the money comes in when the Treasurer is not absolutely in need of it , the wisest course will be for him, instead of withdrawing the money from the commercial community, to leave it in the hands of the institutions in which it is deposited, so that it may be available for commercial use. If we draw indefinitely large sums of money out of the ordinary channels of commerce, the result will be that men will be unable to extend their busiuesses, and that there will be a large number of men out of work. That situation stares us in the face as clearly as daylight. Unless we are particularly caref u l in the expenditure of the huge sums of money that are now being raised, we shall bring financial disaster upon this country. We are a rich country-pro bably there is none richer on the face of the earth-bu t there is a limi t to the amount of money that can be raised by loan for the benefit of the States if we are to allow commercial development to go along its natural lines.",49
357,Mr HAMPSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,How can you prevent the States from coining on to the Australian market?,50
358,Mr BOYD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The States will be prevented from borrowing when they know that they cannot get their loans floated; but as long as the States know that they can come to the Commonwealth and arrange for loans you will never stop them. The only thing that will stop a State from borrowing is the same thing' that stops the individual from borrowingthe fact that nobody will lend to him.,50
359,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,Some wise people stop before that time.,50
360,Mr HAMPSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Suppose the States"" offer a higher rate of interest than the Commonwealth ?",50
361,Mr BOYD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I am not going to predict what would happen if they offered exorbitant rates of interest, butno Government would be allowed to maintain its position on the Treasury benches if it persisted in borrowing inoney at exorbitant rates of interest. The wisest policy would be for the States to curtail tlieir expenditure. We cannot possibly curtail our war expenditure. We may prevent extravagances in particular directions, and I hope we shall do that ; but we are now creating a national debt exactly on the same lines as the national debts of the older countries in the w o r l d ; we are blowing the money away in powder and shot. We shall have no asset to show for it . The money that has been borrowed in the past by the States has been mostly spent upon public works. The Commonwealth is not doing that.",50
362,Mr FLEMING,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,What about the terri- tory we shall acquire in the Pacific?,50
363,Mr BOYD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I do not know how much that will be worth to us, but I . would like to urge upon the Government the necessity of making provision for sinking funds. I take it that no provision has been made in connection with the repayment of this money to the British Government for a sinking fund .",50
364,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Yes , there is- J per cent.",50
365,Mr BOYD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"In the A u d it Act there, is a clause dealing with trust funds provided by the Commonwealth, which reads as follows: A separate account shall be kept in the Treasury, to be called the Trust Fund Account, of all moneys that shall be placed to the credit of that fund, under such separate heads as may be directed by the Treasurer. Another clause in that Act states that no money shall be paid out of that fun d except by the authority of Parliament. I think it was the honourable member for Bourke who said last night that trust funds were piled up by an economical Treasurer for the benefit of the first Treasurer who came along short of cash and made an appeal to Parliament. I have had some experience in connection with trust funds in the State of Victoria. I was one of Trust Fund Trustees, opposed bitterly the attitude of niy own Government in taking money out of that fund , which was made up of revenues to do. from certain Mallee lands. The first time that the Treasurer struck bad times brought in a Bill to take a portion these funds. He apologized profusely for their mutual advantage. his action, and said it would not create a precedent, but next year he brought down another Bill and scooped - the There is no protection in the trust funds provisions of the Audi t Ac t for the ing funds that are being provided i nexion with these loans.",50

The debate has been proceeding this evenmarket ing upon the wrong assumption that we for all concerned. may treat the States as we like. Let honourable members get that notion out of their heads. The States have rights resources, just as the Commonwealth has, and there is nothing to prevent them exercising to the full their resources, which are as great as those of the monwealth. What could be more prehensible in this time of war than have the States, which are being treated in an off-hand way by the Federal Parup, liament, competing with the Commonence. wealth on the money markets? have only to offer a high enough order to receive the money in preference - to the Commonwealth.",51

It is to avoid unnecessary competition that I am pleading for a consinksultation with the States. Both the States n conand the Commonwealth are in trouble, owing to the cessation of the supply of money from London, and we may not brush the difficulty aside in the light and way in which honourable members on both sides of the House have attempted deal with it this evening. The States have resources which they can exercise f u n d if they choose; and I should bitterly regret any attitude on the part of this to Parliament which would force them to resort to a ruinous competition in rates The can States must have money. I understand they that the Government of New South - Wales has 20,000 men in its employ; and have yet to learn that any honourable be member representing that State is prepared to tell the New South Wales Gobevernment to discharge those men willyand that we of the Federal Parliaw ill not even consult with the State very Government in regard to methods of keeping those men employed. We must down, to bed-rock in regard to this by matter; and every consideration of prudence and statesmanship at this particular time suggests that we should combine together to exploit this restricted on the best terms and conditions",51
371,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Cook) [9.22] - I and am glad that the aspect of the matter dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition is now being considered. When I referred to the matter yesterday, there Comdid not appear to be any desire on the repart of honourable members to enter into to this phase of the question. But Opposition leaders are now taking the matter which seems to make all the differTo-day it appears to have deThey veloped into one of the serious issues rate in which challenge our attention. There has been no complaint on the part of the State Governments in regard to the financial position that they haye not been consulted; but the situation is developing in such a way that, if something is not done, both the Commonwealth and the States will suffer, and there will be resultant distress throughout the country. This is almost wholly due to the changed aspect that has come over the financial situation during the last few months. When the war broke out, the States were the only borrowers on the market. The Commonwealth did not publicly borrow: there was no necessity for it to do so. The States had access to the London market. Almost immediately after the outbreak of war, the London market was closed to the States, and an arrangement had to be made by the Commonwealth Government to raise the necessary loans in London, so that the Commonwealth could arrange such accommodation to the States as would enable them to carry on their loan works for the current year. When the Commonwealth went on the London market, the States had then access to the local market for loans beyond those which had been arranged for from the Commonwealth, and they had agreed not to raise loans in London while the Commonwealth was acting in England in their behalf. But. that agreement was abrogated by an arrangement between the Commonwealth Treasurer and the Treasurers of the States.",51
372,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The arrangement eased, but not abrogated. Mr J . JI . CATTS - In some cases the Commonwealth Treasurer released the States from the arrangements which they had made.",52
373,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"As far as I could do so, I agreed that I would not take serious exception to the States taking advantage of the market. Mr J . H . OATTS - If you make an agreement with a party, and he asks to be released from it , and you then say, "" I do not raise any serious objection^ to your taking advantage of the conditions that now prevail,"" surely that reply means releasing that party from the agreement.",52
374,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"No , because to release him from the agreement would mean that the other man's rights were at an end.",52
375,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"If a person has rights and does not insist upon them, he surrenders those rights.",52
376,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,No .,52
377,Mr HAMPSON,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,The States were released to some extent.,52
378,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,That is so.,52
379,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Treasurer allowed a little latitude, and a departure from the arrangement.",52
380,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I did not take exception to the States departing from the arrangement.,52
381,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Therefore , the States assumed, as I would have assumed, that they were free to make this departure.",52
382,Mr FISHEK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I do not agree with that view.,52
383,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Ver y well. The manner in which the relaxation occurred is now apparent. The States then had access to the local market. The next development has been that the London market is closed to the Commonwealth. No definite pronouncement on the matter has been made, but it is more than probable that the market has been closed to the States also.",52
384,Mr FISHER,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,It is not absolutely closed; but an appeal was made to us to . raise our own funds in Australia.,52
385,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The Imperial Government is itself appealing to the London market for many hundreds of millions of pounds, and it sends out a communication to the Commonwealth that Australian loans ought to be raised in Australia. Again I say that such a desire, expressed by the British Government at a time like was this, is tantamount to closing the London market against Australia, because Australia would never except as the very last extremity approach the London marketin the face of such an appeal. For all practical purposes, the London market in the way described is closed to Australia. The Commonwealth, with its huge commitments, both immediate and in prospect, is' compelled to raise large sums of loan money or credits. The London market being closed, an appeal is being made to the Australian market. The Commonwealth now comes into direct competition with the States. The latter have been appealing to the local market, and now the Commonwealth and the Stales will go to gether upon the local market as competitors to raise money for public purposesthe States for their developmental services-and the Commonwealth for prosecutingthis war. These, then, are the steps as the situation has developed: 1. States only public borrowers-Commonwealth did not publicly borrow. 2. A f t e r outbreak of war London market for the time closed to the States. 3. Commonwealth undertook to arrange with Imperial Government for State loan necessities. 4. States have access to Australian loan market. 5. London market closed to Commonwealth as described. -6. Commonwealth compelled to seek credits on Australian market. 7. Commonwealth and States now both preparing to appeal to the Australian market for credits. 8. All the elements in existence for ruinous competition for credit between Commonwealth and States. There are two kinds of credit in Australia-there is public credit, and the credit of private corporations viduals. The public credit of is disorganized, and in a state of almost chaos. Private credit is organized, and a great advantage is to be reaped by the organizations of private credit, the financial institutions, which are very associated and linked together - every financial operation of any kind in Australia is carried out by them in consultation and co-operation. public authorities are concerned, there is competition, but in the case of private authorities tliere is co-operation. - is necessity for co-operation on the part of the public authorities that we have not today. This tion can be brought about only by consultuents tation and arrangement between the Comwill monwealth and the States; and the vantages to both would be such that there ought to be no question *as to the digwhat nity of one Parliament contrasted the dignity of another. The wealth, as the national authority, to lead in the matter. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that, although the Commonwealth constitutional obligation directly it to safeguard the finances of the States, cation to the States. it cannot allow the States to become Mr J. B. Catts. rupfc or their credit to depreciate. Our national necessities, regardless of State divisions, imperatively demand united action. The circumstances in which we find ourselves are coercive and as mandatory as any written constitution could make it . It is the undeniable law of national necessity.",52
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,There is another motive for consultation - our own in terests.,53
387,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,That is what I have been hammering at for days; I ha;e said that co-operation is essential to both.,53
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"I am not sure that the States could not injure us as much as we could injure them, provided we tried.",53
389,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"If there is competition for credit both autliorities will be damaged, and the public will suffer greatly. The honourable member for Henty said that the States sliould be allowed to go on in their own way u n t i l they were pulled and indi- up with a round turn , when there was no Australia more credit for them to borrow. It would be a sorry day for us if the States could not get the necessary accommodation to keep their services going as at present. There would be wholesale unemployment closely and distress, and if it is in our power,'by so that suggestion, by proposals, by conferenceby anything we can do-to save the situation, the responsibility is upon us to act. So far as the It requires no stretch of the imagination to foresee wholesale unemployment; and should it take place, the responsibility There will be on us equally with the States if we have not done everything in our power co-operation to avert it . Those who would suffer are co-operaour constituents, as well as the constiof the State Parliaments; and they require from us, as from the repreadsentatives of the States, an account of our stewardship-the y will want to know has been our contribution to safewith guarding them from calamity.

If the Prime Minister of Australia takes that course, and the States absolutely refuse to meet him, then the responsibility, which will be a very heavy one, will be on their shoulders. We shall have done our best, and the situation demands that we should do nothing less.",53
390,Mr KELLY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Wentworth) [9.25] A great deal of the trouble to which the honourable member for Cook has just referred-the continued loan expenditure of the various States and of ourselves-is due to a cardinal misapprehension as to the future loan position. Immediately after the war broke out, some of the Premiers showed very considerable apprehension; and I think the Premier of New South Wales showed a keener apprehension than any of the others. State it seemed to be recognised that they were right up against the beginning of the end of their loan policy; indeed, it was actually discussed whether even the arbitration awards should not go. seriousness of the position was such at that time that the Premier of New South Wales was prepared for almost any method of handling the sudden emergency. Since then the British Government has shown itself a ready assister; and the whole scene has changed, apparently, in the minds of the State Premiers. When I use the words "" State Premiers,"" I make no particular attack upon the States, because we have been all more or less sinners in this regard. A f t e r all, despite the fact that the world is struggling for the existence, of the social fabric-in spite of the absolute dislocation of a vast number of the industries of the civilized world-it was thought that, after all, the British Government would come to our help, and after the war ""everything in the garden"" would, as usual, be "" lovely."" The feeling I have is that after the war the tightness will be much greater for some time than it has been during the war. A f t e r the war, half of Europe will have to be rebuilt. Belgium will have to be rebuilt, industries will have to be restarted, machinery recreated, and the torn fragments of some of the greatest industrial nations of the world, so to speak, k n it together by the little remaining capital. When all is said and done, capital is only a sort of stored industry; and that stored industry, instead of being used today for the continuance of human activities of a reproductive nature, is going up in the smoke of shell-goin g to heaven in the flames of burning factories.",54
391,Mr ARCHIBALD,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,All waste!,54
392,Mr KELLY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"All waste; and not only will that actual immediate waste of war, munitions and human lives, have to be remedied after the war, but destroyed properties will have to be recreated, and cities rebuilt. From where is to come the stored industry to do this work? In the past London has been the great money market of the world, and let us hope it will again have that position, but for some years after the war is over the In that people of England will be hard put to it to make up for the waste that has occurred in defending their country's liberties. Money will be required, as I say, to rebuild Belgium, to rebuild the The factories which formerly used Australian wool in Northern France, and that money must come from wherever it can be. gotlargely, I believe, from America. But there will not be much capital available, except at an exorbitant rate of interest, for the Australian States to play with. For this reason I believe that the warning we have received from the Mother Country represents one of the friendliest actions on her part since the war started.",54
393,Mr WEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,It is very disagreeable!,54
394,Mr KELLY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"It is; but, all the same, it is one of the friendliest things that has been done to us. The idea of going on until we are pulled up with a round tur n means wholesale unemployment and absolute chaos in wages conditions; it means the very worse thing for the working people of the community. It is about up to us all, Commonwealth as well as States, to begin, in no hysterical way, but sanely, to pull in our horns in loan expenditure, and to look forward to that time when there will be no loan money from abroad, % when local loans will not have behind them the spur of patriotism, and when we shall have to compete in the local market for the comparatively little money there is on absolute terms of business equality with all other competitors. I am not in any way charging the Prime Minister with having failed to approach the Premiers of the States in the past-this is not the time for recrimination.

There is enorwould mous power inherent in the Commonwealth, and I think the time has come show the States, in the interests of Australian workingmen and Australian industries-in the interests of the Austraenough lian social fabric-that we are prepared to use the power we have to compel portance economy, if the States will not take those steps which sanity demands for the commonwealth mon weal.",55

I realized, as soon as the Comfinancial monwealth Government had to raise loans for the purposes of the war, that trouble would commence here. I think that the remarks of the honourable member for Parself. ramatta, derogatory to the States, and certainly to the Premier of New South Wales, were rather uncalled for; and also noted an interjection by the able member for Robertson in regard to the Norton-Griffiths proposal.",55
398,Mr FLEMING,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,I made that interjection honestly.,55

400,Mr WEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Perhaps the honourable* member will allow me to make my own speech. When the Norton-Griffiths proposal was first made. I took the same objection to it.that has been raised to-night, because I thought it was a bad and expensive policy, which gave ground for a certain amount of dread. The proposal was withdrawn, but was renewed in November of last year. When the Commonwealth Government accepted the loan of the British Government we were inone of formed that we were not the only people who were worrying the British Government for money. The municipalities aud county councils of England otheralso required assistance. Mr Lloyd I George said that it would be hopeless for the municipalities of Great Britain to borrow, but he was prepared to give them £10,000,000, and Mr Holman and those who were watching events came .to the conclusion that next year there possibly be a shortage of money to from any other source. I am not in the the confidence of the Premier of New South Wales, and I am not inquisitive to wish to know his business; but I understand that he realized the imof renewing the Norton-Griffiths proposal in view of the fact that the Comwould be compelled, owing to the closing of the London inoney market, to raise a large sum of money for war purposes within Australia, where the market is so limited. One benefit to be from this loan will be the fact most of the money will be spent in Australia, and that the interest will be paid in Australia. A great factor which has tended towards making London the centre of the world has been the payment of the interest on the British lean indebtedness within Great Britain itAnother factor has been the expenditure of much of the money raised by Great Britain in the British Isles. Even in the I case of the heavy borrowing for the Boer honorwar, most of the money was spent in Great Britain, and the portion which was spent in Africa, returned to Great Britain, because the manufacture of the appliances for carrying on the war was carried out there. The payment of interest on the British indebtedness is not such a drain on Great Britain as would be the case if the money had been raised abroad 'and the interest had to be sent out of the country, which, unfortunately, has been the position of Australia in the past. The Commonwealth election of 1910 was fought on the question of the wisdom of borrowing £3,500,000, which the Liberals proposed to do; and the party which came into power as the result of that election was a non-borrowing party, which stated that it would only borrow when the country was in peril, or facing some unforeseen disaster. I think honourable members opposite ought to give credit to the people of Australia for the wisdom and foresight displayed on that occasion, by putting into power a party which would not allow the National Government to enter on a borrowing policy. Borrowing is proposed now only under circumstances which compel it, and when the people of Australia are prepared to make extraordinary sacrifices in order to carry on the war. The people have placed the present party in power to carry on the war, and when for that purpose a Commonwealth loan has to be placed on the local money market, we are in a fortunate position in that we have not had to appeal to that market before, seeing that so far we have been able to obtain money from the Imperial Government. I am afraid that the loan that we propose to raise will not cover the expenditure, and we have also to see whether the State Governments will go on the Australian money market and offer higher rates of interest. However, I do not think that they will do so. I think that they will see the wisdom of acting conjointly with the Federal Government. ""When they arc driven to extremes they will find no better godfathers than the Federal Government. All the prognostications of our friends opposite-especiall y of the Leader of the Opposition-wil l be found to be wrong. I am quite satisfied that the States will appeal to the Labour Government which is in power in the Commonwealth, and that conjointly we shall be able to tide over difficulties such as have never occurred before in the history of Australia, and which I hope will not arise again. I hope that honourable members will take an optimistic view. In proportion to her population, Australia is the greatest producing country in the world. In 1913, her production'was £288,000,000, according to figures furnished to me by Mr Knibbs about four months ago.",55

402,Mr WEST,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"The right honourable gentleman's figures' are correct. I hope that all those in authority in Australia, even those managing public utilities and companies, will take a broad optimistic view of the situation, for I am certain that Australia will tide over her difficulties, and emerge from this time of trouble triumphantly and with every credit to the Empire of which it forms a portion.

420,Mr KELLY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Wentworth) [10.12] On the 1st July I offered some friendly suggestions to the Minister for the Navy, who was then Assistant Minister of Defence, as to the advisability of increasing the staff of the Central Administration to cope with the work of the Defence Department, or of re-allotting the work of the officers of the Department, so that delays such as those to which I drew attention might not recur. I instanced a case in which the money for a motor ambulance was sent from Sydney on the 8th or 9th February, and was not used by the Defence Department until the 30th March-that is, not until seven weeks had elapsed-and that information had come from the front that this ambulance was badly needed. In the Age of the 5tli July, the Minister is reported to have saidThe facts are that we had a communication from New South Wales to the inoney necessary for an ambulance would be donated. There are two ways in which we have been making use of money for ambuthat lances. First, by cabling money to England for an ambulance to be made there, and to be attached either to an Australian unit or to the British Army; secondly, to place the order in Australia, and attach the ambulance to a unit here. In the case mentioned by Mr Kelly communications passed in order to find out the views of the donor, and also with Tggard to the class of ambulance required. There wns no undue delay. By the courtesy of the Minister for .the Navy, I have obtained the papers in this case. The first of them, which is dated the 8th February, 1915, is a letter from Colonel Wallace, Commandant, to the Secretary of the Defence Department, and shows that the statement of the Minister was wholly incorrect, its concluding words beingThe donors have been suitably thanked, and they desire that this ambulance be made in England. From the file I find that, on the 12th March, some five weeks after the d r a f t was received in the central office, it was discovered that it was made payable to the New South Wales Commandant, and was returned to him f o i his endorsement, and to be paid iuto a Sydney account. On the 24th March, the Department was notified that the money had been paid in as in structed. I was given to understand by a letter which I received from the Department that, on the 30th March, the money was put into use, but I find from the file that on that date the Department of External Affairs was asked to send a cable to the High Commissioner stating that donations had been received for motor ambulances, of which a list was given, and the words "" letter following "" (vere added. There was no order given for ambulances; the communication contained merely the statement that certain moneys had been received. The next paper on the file is a decode of a telegram from the High Commissioner, dated 8th A p r i l , askingWith reference to your telegram 7th April, motor ambulances, shall I order at once? So far, the order had not been given. Apparently it took the Department of External Affairs from the 30th March to 7th A p r i l to send the cablegram it was effect that the asked to despatch.",58
421,Mr TUDOR,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,It is only fair to mention that happened to be Easter week.,58
422,Mr KELLY,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"In any case, the suggestion I make is that an arrangement should be made between the two Departments that the Department of Defence shall be free to send direct to the High Commissioner any cable that it wishes to transmit to him, merely notifying the Department of External Affairs of what is being done. In that way all this red tape could be short-circuited, and a great saving of time effected. Two days later, namely, on 10th A p r i l , the Department of Defence asked the Department of External Affairs to send to the H i gh Commissioner a cablegram requesting that the order for the motor ambulance mentioned in his cable message of 8th A p r i l , should be placed at once. It was then that the order for this ambulance was placed. The money left Sydney on the 8th February; it was put to use on the 10th A p r i l . I think honourable members will 'realise that there must be something wrong with the Central Administration when this is possible. No sooner had the Minister's statement appeared in the newspapers than I received a letter from another man who, with his wife, had forwarded to the Department a like donation of £500 for the purchase of a motor ambulance. He.informed me that for a time he did not receive even an acknowledgment, and that he had to write again to ascertain whether his cheque had been received. There are many other instances of delays in the Central Defence Office. I trespass on the patience of honourable members to-night solely because I believe it is the duty of all of us to endeavour to have these matters put right. I believe that the Central Ofiice has been glutted with work, but that a step has been taken quite recently to assist it with new abilities. One of the best officers in the Department over which I formerly presided has gone there, and a number of other officers of the same type, I believe, have also been sent to assist the Department. I hope that the utmost care will be taken to see that these delays do not again occur. If we allow them to continue, we shall utterly k ill all enthusiasm on the part of our people. I am grateful to the M ister for the opportunity he has given me to see the papers. The statement. I have made to-night will prove that the M in ister of Defence was completely misinformed by some one in his Department when' he gave the interview to which I have referred. Mr J. H , CATTS (Cook) [10.18] The prices of foodstuffs, particularly in the State of New South Wales, are becoming increasingly urgent. It will be remembered that on the 3rd. June last I submitted to this House a motion proposing that there should be a national stock-taking in respect of foodstuffs, and that the Government should formulate some'policy of dealing with this question. Following upon that action on my part, I received this letter from the secretary of the Trades H all Council, SydneyLABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH WALES. Trades Hall, Goulburn-street, Sydney, 1st July, 1915. Mr J. H. Catts, M.H.R., Parliament House, Melbourne. Dear Sir,- I have been directed by the above council to draw your attention to the very high prices of foodstuffs at present prevailing in New South Wales, and to request you and your colleagues in the Federal Parliament touse your best endeavours to have the import duty on foodstuffs removed until such time as the production of foodstuffs again reaches the normal level, particularly in those cases where the removal of duties will not cause unemployment of the workers. At the present time butter and sugar are almost unobtainable, and my Council belicvesthat this shortage might be remedied by the removal of duties on such articles. Trusting tnis request will meet with your approval, I am, yours faithfully, E. J. KAVANAGH, Secretary. That appeal is made on behalf of something like 150,000 members of unions, representing, in the aggregate, at the very least, 250,000 consumers. Following upon the receipt of this letter, I asked the Prime Minister, on 7th inst., whether the suggested action could be taken, and his answer, as reported in Hansard, page 4635, wasI know of no method by which revenue can be taken off, and, at the same time, debts paid. I also know of no way of pleasing everybody. Later on, in the ordinary way of business, I had a conversation with the At in - torney-General of New South Wales, who represents in the State Parliament portion of the electorate which I represent in the Federal Parliament, so that we often come into touch with each other. He mentioned that the shortage of butter in New South Wales was becoming a matter of some moment, and that the State Government had decided to import to meet the ascertained shortage. - expressed the desire to know whether the Commonwealth would be prepared to remit the duty of 3d. per lb. on the quant it y of butter required to meet this shortage. On the 8th instant I asked the Prime Minister in this House, as reported in Hansard, page 4.715, the following questionIn the event of the Government of New South VVales finding it necessary to import butter to meet an ascertained shortage in the 'State, will the Commonwealth Government remit the duty on the butter so imported, so that the price of this article may not be unduly in- creased to the people of New South Wales? The reply made by the Prime Minister was as followsOnly one answer can be given to questions duties on the necessaries of life. like this. As they refer to Tariff matters, our action in regard to them cannot be anticipated. Unfortunately, the statement has been made that the Tariff is not to be considered at the present time. It seems to be rally agreed on both sides of the House that there shall be no consideration of Tariff schedule for some considerable Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I do agree with that.",59
423,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"No r do I ; but it - seems to be the general feeling on both sides, and I am afraid that my honourable friend and I are in the minority. On 8th instant - the same day as that on which the question was answered-the Prime Minister, as reported in Hansard, page 4717, made the following statement in this House: There is, however, a feeling in the country that, while the Tariff may not be a party matter on either side, the discussion of create an atmosphere that would have an effect as bitter party strife. Furthermore, there are circumstances which would make postponement of the discussion of the Tariff a that it is considered .must valuable consideration. 'It would appear from a close examination - of this statement that the valuable conworking sideration referred to is that the Commona wealth Government desire to take advanand tage of the revenue coming from the Tariff .aiij it stands. Discussions-in the House that the feelings of the representatives the people here are such that the. revenue duties would be knocked off and the people would get their foodstuffs cheaper they are likely to obtain them while the Tariff remains as it is. . In that respect I regret that the Parliament has not an He opportunity to deal with it . Tn the Melbourne Age of 21st inst., under the heading of "" Price of Butter,"" there appeared the following statement: Because the Commonwealth Government have refused to remove the Customs duty on butter, the New South Wales State Government, which is about to become an importer, decided in Cabinet to increase the price of butter by 3d., the amount of the duty - A subsequent Executive meeting was held, fixing the price of butter at Is. lOd. per lb. I wish it to be known that, having received the letter I have quoted fro m the Labour Council of New South Wales, I brought it forward and asked that the request preferred should be complied with. I do not agree, and never have agreed, that revenue should be raised by I am in favour of the imposition of duties that will keep out foreign manufactures and encourage their production in Australia; but where there is an ascertained shortage geneof production in Australia-wher e it is necessary to import sugar, butter, or any the other foodstuff which cannot at the time time. be produced in Australia-the n I most emphatically protest against revenue not duties being collected on such commodities. We have placed fodder on the free list daring this war because there is a shortage in Australia, and also for the the reason that we do not desire to collect revenue from the farmers and the business men of this country who are using fodder. I hold that in regard to the working classes-the great consumers of butter, sugar, and other necessary commoditiesthere is no justification for the collection it may of revenue from them by resorting fo a as bad kind of side wind. We do not know exactly what the state of the public finances a are; but if their condition is so urgent expedient by the Government to impose revenue duties' upon the necessaries of life for the classes of this country, then such course should be taken directly, openly, clearly, by the express decision of the Commonwealth Parliament. If that were show done, although it would not take from of the objections of honourable members like myself, it would at least enable the people of Australia to fix the responsibility, and than understand the necessity for it . If the postponement of the Tariff means that there.is to be collected a large amount of Customs revenue from the masses of the people in regard to foodstuffs, because of a temporary shortage on account of the war or seasonable conditions, I can only say that I regret very much that sanction is be in 5 given to the postponement of the consideration of the Tariff. I have' objected to this Parliament being closed until the great issues upon which we were elected are dealt with. In making that protest, and in putting forward this plea, I am sorry to say I have not received any support. But I have played my part, and if this Parliament adjourns without dealing with tliese matters, then I shall have no responsibility for it . I can only express hope-and it is almost hoping against hope-that we shall have an early opportunity of considering the position of the people of Australia in regard to their supply of foodstuffs generally. It has been decided since the date on which I submitted my motion for a national stocktaking such a stocktaking shall be made. The result has not yet been communicated to the House, and what policy is to follow upon it we cannot say. I trust, however, that these matters will be speedily dealt with, and that we shall be given an opportunity to deal with the issues raised with the best information that we have at our disposal, so that we shall be able to say that, having regard to the powers and opportunities we possess, the very best possible has been done for the people.  I refer to one particular aspect of the question raised by the honourable member for Cook? In regard to butter, Victoria has undoubtedly experienced a worse season than New South Wales; yet there is not the same shortage in Victoria that there is in the other State. Why? Because the Government of New ' South Wales, in its wisdom, thought f it to fix the price of butter at - a level which did not permit producers to put it upon the market. They could only produce and sell at a loss, and no persons are mad enough to do that. So that the condition of things complained of by the honourable member for Cook has been brought about by the foolish policy of Government interference. Practically the same thing has happened in Victoria regarding wheat.",60
424,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"God only knows what the people would have done had there not been Government interference 1  any knowledge at all, the Government foolishly interfered with the price of wheat, with the result that the persons who otherwise would have imported wheat to meet the Australian demand were afraid to import, lest Government action might land them in a large loss. The consequence was that there did appear to be a shortage of wheat in Australia; yet not t ill the price of wheat had advanced in all"" parts of the world did the Government import supplies, so that the community has had to pay considerably more for its the bread. than would have been necessary had there been no Government interference.",61
425,Mr JH CATTS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"Is that the Liberal Government in Victoria?  ring to the Liberal Government of Victoria, which in this regard has been just that as mad as the Labour Government of New South Wales.",61
426,Mr RODGERS,RECIPROCAL TARIFFWIT H,"They paid more to the farmer of imported wheat than to the local farmer.  how foolish it is for a Government, which has neither body to be kicked nor soul to be damned, to act in matters it does not understand. ^Action taken with the object of reducing the cost of living has actually had the effect of increasing it . The price of bags also is important, if only in its bearing upon the price of wheat. A majority of the members of this House are opposed to the retention of the Tariff duty on bags; yet, in spite of that, we cannot get the duty removed. What is to be done? I certainly am of opinion that where a majority of members are in favour of the removal of a certain item in the Tariff, its removal ought to be assured; and in this respect, just as my honourable friend has put forward a plea for the consumer, I submit a plea on behalf of the producer, who must be handled tenderly if maximum production is to be secured and the best interests of the consumer served. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.35 p.m.",61
