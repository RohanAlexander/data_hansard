2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the delays between the announcements of each quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and their applicauon as a percentage increase in age and invalid pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory and a cause of economic distress. That proposals to amend the Consumer Price Index by eliminating particular items from the Index could adversely affect the value of future increases in aged and invalid pensions and thus be a cause of additional economic hardship to pensioners. The foregoing facts impel tralian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Require each quarterly percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index to be applied to age and invalid and similar pensions as from the pension pay day nearest following the date of announcement of the CPI movement. 2. Give an open assurance to all aged and invalid pensioners that any revision of the items comprising the Consumer Price Index will in no way result in reducuons in the value of any future entitlements to pensioners. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Jenkins and Dr Klugman. Petitions received. Petition to the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth humbly showeth that the undersigned are deeply concerned: That abortion is the destruction of innocent human life. That on 10 May 1973, the House ofRepresentatives overwhelmingly rejected the Medical Practices Clarification Bill, which sought to legalise abortion on demand in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. That the Legislative Assembly in Canberra should consult Parliament again before discussing and debating the opening and operations of Population Services International and Preterm Foundation in Canberra. That the situation regarding abortions in the Austrahan Capital Territory is the same as that in New South Wales where the statute prohibits abortion but allows a defence. That the situation in the great impact on situations in the states. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Federal Government will act immediately to prevent the establishment and/or operation of Population Services International and Preterm Foundation, and other private clinics, in the Australian Capital Territory. That taxpayers' money may not be used, through Medibank, tofinanceabortions. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Braithwaite. NA Petition received. East Timor To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Pensions humble petition of the undersigned concerned citizens respectfully showeth: Whereas there is mounting evidence that some 60 000, perhaps as many as 100 000 East Timorese may have been killed since the invasion of East Timor by Indonesian forces; and Whereas a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 12 December 1975, stated that it 'strongly deplores the military intervention of the armed forces of Indonesia in Portugese Timor' and 'calls upon the Government of Indonesia to desist from funher violation of the territorial integrity of Portuguese Timor and to withdraw without delay its armed forces from the Territoiy in order to enable the people of the Territory freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independence'; and your petitioners to ask the AusWhereas Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock, in a statement to the House ofRepresentatives on 4 March 1976, described Australia's poUcy on East Timor as 'clear' and calling for 'the withdrawal of Indonesian troops', 'a cessation of hostilities', 'the implementation of an act of self-determination and a resumption of humanitarian aid through the International Committee of the Red Cross'; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should ensure: 1. That the Australian Government re-state this policy on East Timor publicly and unequivocally and 2. That the implementation of the said policy be pursued as strongly as possible.

Ltd, and certain members of the motoring public of N.S.W. respectfully showeth: That the Federal Government give every consideration to implementing the findings of the Royal Commission on Petroleum.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Australian Capital Territory has a by Dr Klugman. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. Your peutioners humbly pray that your Honourable House will take every step necessary to ensure that: (1) The mining, export and sale of all fissionable be postponed until our technology and society are sufficiently advanced to ensure that radioactive materials are not released into the environment. (2) All relevant material be made available to the public to ensure widespread, well informed public discussion and debate on the whole nuclear issue. (3) A major proportion of money spent on nuclear research be diverted to researching alternate power sources i.e. solar power. by Mr Lucock. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation sonal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with complicated variations in his personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same vary from State to advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly double income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Morris. Petition received. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister able willing to comment on the assertion in a devasto tating article yesterday in the Wall Street Jourcould nal, the most influential financial newspaper the world, that the decision to devalue, which described as disastrous, was advice and solely on his whim?",13
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"The best description of the devaluation was one used by a journalist for the Melbourne Age, but he was fact referring to the devaluation of my prededrawn cessor. If he had judged the devaluation that undertook in the same terms, he would have Uranium used the same terms and praised it very highly as an advanced and foresighted move. The decision that we took, as has been stated on many occasions in this House, was taken having received advice from our official advisers. As all material honourable gentlemen know, 2 options were given to us. We chose the option of devaluation because the currency, as a result of excessive wage claims, of excessive government spending of previous times and of the inflation thus caused, had become over-valued and very plainly adjustments were necessary. I would beheve that events that have occurred since then have indicated very plainly the wisdom and farsightedness of the Government's move. More and more people in Australia are coming to accept it in that hght. The main comTaxation plaint, that I think I got at the time, was that a House number of people said: 'Well, look, we knew you humble were going to have to devalue, but we thought you would devalue in April or something like of perthat and we were making our dispositions accordingly'. If we had waited until April, imagine personal how many people would have been saying: in 'Couldn't you have seen the signs? Why didn't you do it last November?' We in fact did do it or her then. Since then there has been wide recognition in manufacturing industry that the devaluation job would has given it a greater chance to compete again. State even when gross wages were At the sametimethere has been a complete setmaintain records of income earned tling down in the capital markets and the speculations that were going on have utterly pray that a system of disappeared. Investment decisions are coming forward. I refer to the $600m proposal announced by Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia a day or two ago, which the Chairman of Directors said quite plainly was in part attributable to the decision to devalue; the Norwich Park decision; the Alwest proposal; and the Alcan proposal for a $70m expansion of its refineries. All of those matters indicate greater optimism in the future and full justification of the wisdom of the Government's move. If I might predict it, I also believe that or other information that might be made available this Parliament and to Australia at a later time well point in the same direction-complet e in justification of the Government's decision in it repairing the damage done by the honourable taken against official gentleman. NA",14
4,Mr GOODLUCK,VANDALISM OF TELEPHONE BOXES,"Has the attention of the in Minister for Post and Telecommunications been to a sadistic, brutal attack upon a young we married woman in Hotham Street, Elsternwick that might have been avoided if 2 telephone boxes where she endeavoured to ring a taxi had not been rendered inoperative by obviously sick, senseless vandals? Will the Minister inform the House how often telephone boxes are inspected for damage? Is vandalism of telephone boxes reaching an unbelievable level? Are any positive steps being taken, including the imposition of heavier penalties, to overcome this serious problem? Will the Minister please report to the House in due course when the boxes in the area mentioned were last inspected?",14
5,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,VANDALISM OF TELEPHONE BOXES,"My attention drawn to the regrettable episode that occurred in Melbourne. I am concerned, as the community question. would be concerned, when this sort of attack occurs. The House ought to know that vandalism of public telephones in Australia presently costs about $3m. I think thefigurefor Melbourne is of the order of about two-thirds of a mUlion dollars. The honourable member asked me when these telephones are checked. They are, of course, checked automatically by the people wishing use them. Secondly, they are checked by cleaners, coin collectors and technical staff attached to the local exchanges. Regrettably the public does not inform us quickly enough when some of these boxes are out of order. What are we doing about the matter? The Australian Telecommunications Commission has a new program that will be to a great extent vandal proof. The instrument itself will not be easily subjected to vandalism and when vandalstaff ism occurs an automatic signaloccur in the local exchange, which means that the repairs will be hastened. The exchange will be informed automaticaUy that that telephone out of order. It is regrettable that the incidence vandalism has grown. WhUst we are getting this program off the ground- I regard it as a matter of some importance-the public could help us 2 tremendously by advising us as soon as possible that telephones are out of order. PRICES AND WAGES FREEZE: NA",15
6,Mr UREN,PRIMARY PRODUCE,"Is the Prime Minister aware that the Queensland Premier has said that the recent Premiers Conference agreed that primary proan duce would be exempted from the price-wage jointly freeze? Was the Queensland Premier correct? If so, does the Prime Minister agree that contrary statements made by him and the Treasurer both inside and outside the Parliament are able misleading?",15
7,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,I speak for this ment's Government on these matters and we indicated that there would be no exceptions in these matters.,15
8,Mr UREN,PRIMARY PRODUCE,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is not a matter of what statements were made. The question that I asked the Prime Minister was",15
9,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,Order! There is no point of order.,15
10,Mr UREN,PRIMARY PRODUCE,I asked him,15
11,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,There is no point of order. was The honourable gentleman well knows,15
12,Mr UREN,PRIMARY PRODUCE,The reply must be relevant to the,15
13,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,The Prime Minister is entitled to answer the question as he chooses. The House will make its judgment as to the answer. NA,15
14,Mr BUNGEY,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY,Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security aware that the to handhng of inquiries received from members of the Federal and State parliaments by the Department of Social Security in Western Australia has been banned as a result of industrial action by staff associations? Does the Minister realise that many pensioners and social service recipients rely on members of Parliament for assistance in their dealings with that Department? Can the Minister indicate what action will be taken by the Government to overcome the calso lous disregard of the needs of pensioners by the of the Department of Social Security in a beep-wil l Western Australia?,15
15,Mr HUNT,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY,"The honourable member raised is this point with me yesterday. I have made of inquiries of the Minister for Social Security to ascertain the position and to clarify some of the questions that have arisen. The answer to the first questions is yes. The Minister for Social Security indicated in another place on Tuesday that discussions on these matters raised in the honourable gentleman's question were to be held between the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and the Public Service Board and senior officers from the Department of Social Security. As a result of those discussions offer was made to Mr Campbell. It was made by the Board and the Department, and it was 3-pronged. If honourable gentlemen will just bear with me for a minute I would like to read those 3 prongs because they are of considerinterest to the pubUc generally. The first is the immediate approval by the Board of an additional 218 positions in response to the Departcase put to the Board on 7 February 1977. These positions include 97 to restore the pools for training purposes to their 1975 level, plus 50 to undertake quarterly review of unemployment benefits, 36 to strengthen internal audit and field officer staff, 25 to strengthen the staff working in recovery of overpayments and 10 for automatic data processing planning. In addition the Board is recommending that the Department retain permanently 90 staff from the 150 it gained temporarily to undertake the additional work associated with moving from the means test to the income test for pensioners. This 90 staff will be applied to what are called form R reviews. The second offer was evidence that the Department is moving actively with its staff improvement program directed to restoring its training program, reviewing outdated systems and methods, updating its computer programs, equipment and so on. It was also indicated that an immediate examination would be made as to whether additional relief positions are required. The Board has agreed to participate in this exercise with the Department.",15
16,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY,Order! I interrupt the Minister to draw his attention to the fact that a detailed answer of this kind is a waste of the time of the House.,16
17,Mr HUNT,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY,I am almost finished in respect of Western Australia. Mr Campbell claims that the Department needs an additional 60 relief positions in Western Australia immediately. He has made it clear that the situation will be examined again about the end of June. I seek leave to incorporate this information in Hansard as a true record.,16
18,Mr SPEAKER,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY,"Perhaps the request ought to have been made before the answer was given. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsThe Minister for Social Security indicated in another place on Tuesday that discussions on the matters raised in the honourable gentleman's question, were to be held yesterday between the ACOA and the Public Service Board and senior officers from the Department of Social Security. As a result of those discussions an offer was made to Mr Campbell. 3. The offer to Mr Campbell made jointly by the Board and the Depanment was three-pronged: (a) immediate approval by the Board of an additional 218 positions in response to this Departments case put to the Board on 7 February 1977. These positions include 97 to restore their 1975 level, plus 50 to undertake quarterly review of unemployment benefits, 36 to strengthen our internal audit and field officer staff, 25 to strengthen our staff working on recovery of overpayments and 10 for ADP planning. In addition the Board is recommending that we retain permanently 90 staff from the 150 we gained temporarily to undertake the additional work associated with moving from the means to the income test for pensioners. This 90 staff will be applied to Form R Reviews. The final approval of them, however, depends on the IDC on Staff Ceilings; (b) evidence that the Department is moving actively with its staff improvement program directed to restoring our training program, reviewing out-dated systems and methods, up-dating our computer programs and equipment etc. This will be long term before any effect emerges; (c) an immediate examination as to whether additional relief positions are required. The Board has agreed to participate in this exercise with the Department. Mr Campbell claims that the Depanment needs an additional 60 relief positions in Western Australia immediately. However, as it is likely that portion of the total staff in each State (e.g. 785 in Western Australia) includes an allocation for relief positions thefirstthing the examination will need to do is to determine in what way any relief positions that exist at present are being utilised. Mr Campbell made it clear the situation would be examined again about the end of June. PRICES AND WAGES FREEZE: NA",16
19,Mr UREN,PRIMARY PRODUCE,I ask the Prime Minister again whether he is aware that the Queensland Premier has said that the recent Premiers Conference agreed that primary produce would be exempted from the price and wage freeze. Is the Queensland Premier correct?,16
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,"The Premiers Conference did not discuss exemptions. It made no agreement about any exemptions. The attitude of the Commonwealth Government and the attitude as understood by Premiers, I am sure, was that the freeze would cover all wages, prices, incomes, rents, dividends and the rest. We have made that plain. I think the honourable gendeman should know because it is on the record. The great disappointment in this question is that the honourable gentleman I think was about the first spokesman for the Austrahan Labor Party to try to destroy the basis of the wage and price freeze. He was about the first spokesman to try to spread abroad the view that a wage freeze was a quite unfair return for a price freeze. That does no credit to him or to other members of his Party who have adopted that view as opposed to the view adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, who would have given it a go.",16
21,Mr SCHOLES,PRIMARY PRODUCE,I rise to a point of order. the pools for training purposes to,16
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,Opposition members come in here and they just cannot take it for half a moment.,16
23,Mr SCHOLES,PRIMARY PRODUCE,"My point of order, Mr Speaker, is that the Prime Minister keeps referring to a price freeze when in this House the staff canteen is putting up prices this week. He ought to look at his own backyard.",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,PRIMARY PRODUCE,There is no point of order. NEW SOUTH WALES DAIRY FARMERS changes,17
25,Mr BAUME,PRIMARY PRODUCE,"Has the attention of the Minisfeel ter for Primary Industry been drawn to a report that the Mayor of Kiama, a dairy farmer in my electorate, has had to resign from that office cause of the savage impact the New South Wales Government's cutting of milk quotas has had on his income? Is any method available to the Fedall eral Government to provide some relief New South Wales dairy farmers, who are now having an asset for which many of them paid dearly-thei r milk quota-take n away without any compensation whatsoever? Can any Federal pressure be brought to bear on the New South Wales Government to end this injustice to this hard working section of the Australian people?",17
26,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIMARY PRODUCE,"I know the honourable very gentleman to be most solicitous of the welfare his constituents. Indeed, the question indicates yet again the problems that lie in the overlap of responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States in the field of agriculture. when the manufacturing sector of the Australian dairy industry has been in such difficulties, changes introduced by the New South Wales Government have led to a position where the regular supply of milk to the New South Wales ants, market, particularly the whole milk market, is being changed dramatically without any comHaving pensation being paid to those who have been suppUers under what is known as the BMQ ply system. The changes mean that at some time of future drought or seasonal adversity in New South Wales there may be very significant supply problems for the city milk area. quences in individual milk quotas to dairy farmers are as the honourable gentleman has suggested. Unfortunately, the New South Wales Governaware ment has not been at all forthcoming in other areas of assistance to the dairy is it changing the basis of market milk supply without providing any compensation, which is in marked contrast to the system introduced in Victhat, toria where compensation is to be provided, it has also refused to contribute in the underwrithonourable ing that is avaUable for skim milk powder and casein on a basis that is supported in every other State. The New South Wales Government's lack vices of concern for agriculture is to be expected, course, when its colleagues in the Federal House completed. did so much to destroy the rural sector during the time they were in office here. At the moment we are in the process of drafting legislation which will lead to the introduction of stage 1 of the Industries Assistance Commission Crawford report on recommended for the marketing of dairy products. We that at the Federal level that wtil be yet another demonstration of the efforts we are making to overcome the traumas in the market place befor the Australian dairy farmer. I can assure the honourable gentleman that in spite of the shortfalls of individual State governments, we will do we can at this level to correct the disabilities of to those Australia's dairy farmers. NA NA",17
27,Mr CHARLES JONES,RAILWAYS,"I preface my question to the Minister for Transport by drawing attention to the fact that in early 1975 the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor, drew my attention to the fact that Australia was rapidly running out of oil reserves, that the of import cost of replacements was very great, and that there was a need to electrify Australian railways. Arising out of that meeting, a decision was At a time taken by the Government",17
28,Mr SPEAKER,RAILWAYS,The honourable gentleman the will come to his question.,17
29,Mr CHARLES JONES,RAILWAYS,"The then Government engaged the French national rati consultSofrerail, to carry out a study into the electrification of Australian rail. I ask the Minister: in mind the importance of the contents of President Carter's recent announcement on ensupergy, has that study been completed by Sofrerail? If so, when can we expect the report to be tabled in the Parliament so that all honourable members wtil be aware of the need to elecThe consetrify rail in Australia?",17
30,Mr NIXON,RAILWAYS,"The matter which the honourable member raises is, of course, important. I am of the initiative he took as Minister for Transport to have the study made of the cost of industry. Not only electrification",17
31,Mr JAMES,RAILWAYS,"He was a good Minister, too.",17
32,Mr NIXON,RAILWAYS,There can be argument about so in the presence of Mr Speaker. I wtil not but enter into a debate. The facts are that the member for Newcastle as Minister took an initiative to refer this matter to study to see whether the cost of electrification of rail serwas a viable alternative to the present railof way system. I am not sure whether the study is Mr Charles Jones-It is.,17
33,Mr NIXON,RAILWAYS,I thank the honourable member for the information. I will make sure that my Department gets a report to me on it as quickly as possible so I can give the honourable member the information he seeks. NA NA,18
34,Mr MACKENZIE,CONTROLLERS,"I direct a question to the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that air traffic controllers have been directed to stop work for 12 hours tomorrow to consider a proposal that the national stoppage be extended for 7 days if their claims are not met? Do their claims include a 36 per cent increase in their wages award? Is it true that air traffic controllers command salaries of up to $ 18,500 per annum, including shift penalties and allowances, for a 3 5-hour working week? Will the stoppage cause serious losses for airlines and inconvenience to the air travelling public particularly in Victoria and Queensland on the eve of the school holidays? What measures are being taken to avert this stoppage? If the Minister has the power to stand down air traffic controllers who stop work, will he do so, if necessary, to ensure that the Austrahan travelling public is not held to ransom by minority militant action such as this?",18
35,Mr NIXON,CONTROLLERS,"It is a fact that the air traffic trollers have a claim before the Public Service Board for a 36 per cent increase in their award salaries. It is also a fact that the average earned by air traffic controllers at the moment is at about the $18,000 mark for a 35-hour week and with many other reasonable conditions. I that in the mildest manner. On 19 April, the Pubthe lic Service Board advised the Civil Air Operteen. ations Officers Association of Australia that the earliest it could consider the pay claim would the week beginning 2 May 1977. The curious thing is that on 20 April, the very next day, Civil Air Operations Officers Association decided that unless a satisfactory response to its pay claim was received from the Public Service tions Board a national stoppage of air traffic controlment lers would be held for 12 hours from 12 noon tomorrow. So this decision was taken the day after the Association was advised that it was impossible for the Board to listen to its until about 3 May. The action of the air traffic controllers is regrettable. It will cause a great deal of inconvenience to the travelling public. It will be costly for individuals and the airlines. The matter is presendy before a Pubhc Service Board arbifrom trator who has called a compulsory meeting this morning at 11 o 'clock to try to find a way to avert task? this proposed stoppage. I hope that reason will prevail, that the men will continue to work and let the proper arbitral processes proceed. The air traffic controllers should let the Public Service Board make a proper judgment in a cool atmosphere and not have the matter heated up by industrial trouble. I beheve that the decision taken by the air traffic controllers is not in the best interests of either themselves or this nation as a whole. I would urge them not to undertake their strike and to let the PubUc Service Board make its proper judgment in the way it ought to do. PRICES FREEZE: PARLIAMENTARY NA",18
36,Mr ARMITAGE,REFRESHMENT ROOMS,"My question is directed to you, Mr Speaker. I refer, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred, to the Prime Minister's direction that all prices be frozen and to the fact that the Prime Minister on Tuesday of last week and the Treasurer the day before yesterday said that there would be no exceptions, not even in regard to primary produce. I therefore ask you: Are you aware that the price of bananas in the non-members' canteen has varied in recent days as follows: On Monday they were 10c each; on Tuesday they were 15c each; and yesterday they conwere 15c each. Is this not a very slippery decision? What steps will you take to ensure that the freeze is observed in its place of conception, wage namely here in Parliament House?",18
37,Mr SPEAKER,REFRESHMENT ROOMS,"This significant matter was brought to my attention yesterday. I have caused say the most extensive inquiries to be made about variations in the price of bananas in the canI have learnt that in fact the price did vary. I have given instructions that it is not to vary in the be future. Although the price will not vary, I can give no undertakings about the bananas. Withthe out the help of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, who is interjecting, I shall conclude my answer. I have given instructions that investigabe made to see whether all prices in ParUaHouse can be held at the present level. I shall consult with the President of the Senate with whom I share the chairmanship of the Joint House Committee. After those discussions take claim place I shall report to the House. EAST TIMOR: VISIT OF FOREIGN NA",18
38,Mr NEIL,AFFAIRS OFFICIALS,"I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Are any Australian officials the Department of Foreign Affairs in East Timor? If so, why are they there and what is their  Australian Embassy in Jakarta presently visiting East Timor. Their visit will extend from 26 April to 30 April. It is hoped that the visit might provide us with some first hand information about the use of the Australian contribution to the Indonesian Red Cross for humanitarian assistance in East Timor. The visit is also partly to start preUminary local preparations for a visit to East Timor by a team of Australian officials from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. That visit was announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on 30 March, and it has been approved. In arranging the visit it was made clear to Indonesia that the discussions and the visit did not amount to recognition of the integration of East Timor into Indonesia. I have seen articles in newspapers which imply, if not state, that any dealings with Indonesia on a matter such as this amount to de facto recognition. To put it mUdly, that is a viewpoint which flows from Uliteracy or ignorance. There can in fact be 3 stages in the recognition process. There can in fact be intercourse between states without recognition. A will for recognition is required on the part of the government examining the question of whether there should be recognition. I have said in the past regarding de facto recognition that any ambiguity which exists is implicit in the term and, so far as this matter is concerned, not in the Government's policy. As I have said, nonrecognition does not necessarily signify nonintercourse. There has to be a will on the part of the recognising body. There are numerous examples in pubUc international law for this statement. As is well known, and as I have said today, there can be 3 stages in the recognition process. The first stage is informal relations on a recognition basis as distinct from de facto recogmonwealth nition. The second is de facto recognition. The third is de jure recognition. Any of those steps can be chosen at any time. Furthermore, the 2 officers are expected to travel quite extensively East Timor and to provide us with an opporaware tunity to make an independent assessment of situation. NA NA",18
39,Mr JACOBI,AND SECURITIES LEGISLATION,"My question, which I address to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, relates to the proposed national companies and securities legislation. Is it a fact that the agreeties ment reached with State Ministers responsible for corporate affairs to establish regulate this entire industry will do nothing more than institutionalise existing fraudulent and deceitful abuse and malpractice? WUl the Minister caU a conference of State and Territorial officials concerned with the administration, enforcement and prosecution of the laws dealing with the securities industry to flush out the weaknesses and deficiencies which are rife so that at least his attempt at national legislation may stand some chance of being efficient and effective?",19
40,Mr HOWARD,AND SECURITIES LEGISLATION,"The answer to the first question asked by the honourable gentleman is no. The honourable gentleman knows, as do other members of this House who have studied this matter closely, that one of the principal deficiencies in the present situation is the absence of a national enforcement body and the incapacity of individual State organisations to act effectively. Mr Jacobi-But the Minister",19
41,Mr HOWARD,AND SECURITIES LEGISLATION,"The honourable gentleman has asked a serious question. If he wants a serious answer he will keep quiet. The real weakness, as the honourable gentleman knows, is the absence of a national regulatory authority. The scheme agreed to in principle by the Commonwealth and the States does propose the establishment of a national regulatory authority and the honourable gentleman well knows that. The second question raised by the honourable gentleman really is whether the existing legislation and what might be proposed by the future legislation are adequate to cope with the matters that cause the honourable gentleman concern. I understand him to be suggesting that, in the context of establishing this legislation, there should be a study made of the problems. I will consider whether it is necessary in the course of establishing this legislation for any further studies to be nonmade on a co-operative basis between the Comand the States regarding that issue. NA",19
42,Dr KLUGMAN,CANNABIS,"I direct my question to the in Minister for the Capital Territory. Is the Minister that a select committee of the New South the Wales Parliament has recommended that gaol sentences be abolished for the use of or possession of cannabis, more commonly known as marihuana? Is it a fact that in the Australian Capital Territory the maximum penalty for the use of or the possession of less than 25 grams of cannabis is a fine of $100? Is he aware of any problems arising from the absence of gaol penalfor this offence in the Australian Capital Territory? Finally, has he received any complaints a scheme to from the Festival of Light?",19
43,Mr STALEY,CANNABIS,It is a fact that the penalty for the use of marihuana in small quantities in the Australian Capital Territory is a maximum fine of $ 100. There is no gaol penalty. I have not advised of any specific problems that have occurred in the Territory as a result of the fact that there is no gaol sentence for users tities of marihuana. I am not aware either of any representations from the Festival of Light or from anyone else on this matter. AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE: NA,20
44,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,QUEENSLAND PORTS,My question is diAM rected to the Minister for Transport. The MinisJournal ter would have heard that the Queensland Government Government decided this week to allow the Aushas trahan National Line unrestricted access to intrastate trade in competition with the railways. Can the Minister advise what effect this will have on the Australian National Line's decision withdraw from the Port Alma and Mackay port trade after a trial period? What legislation will necessary to give effect to this decision?,20
45,Mr NIXON,QUEENSLAND PORTS,"The information that the give Queensland Government had agreed to the Austhe trahan Nauonal Line calling at intrastate ports was conveyed to me yesterday by the forced Queensland Minister for Railways, the Honouroverseas able Keith Hooper. I informed him that the news was very welcome. I am sure that the honourable member for Dawson and the honourable memwho ber for Capricornia- I must mention the lot, havprobing ing mentioned one",20
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND PORTS,The honourable gentleman seek must be relevant to the question.,20
47,Mr NIXON,QUEENSLAND PORTS,"Mr Speaker, let me say that I know that all honourable members from terday's Queensland will welcome the news. It will make a very big difference to ANL capacity on route. It will be able to provide a much better and, I hope, a much more regular service than has been able to give in the past. I congratulate the Queensland Government for the far sighted attitude it has taken on this matter. I assume that the Premier of Queensland will be writing to the Prime Minister in the next few days to confirm the information that was given to me. I am sure what legislative requirements wtil be necessHouse ary. There may simply be administrative tiveness requirements, but I will keep the honourable member informed on that aspect In respect to ANL capacity to continue to call at ports such as Mackay, I will take up the question with ANL to see what difference it wtil make to the projected loadings it thinks it will be able obtain in and out of that particular port. I know that the honourable gentleman has been very thorough in his representations to me to ensure that ANL maintains its service into Mackay, as been has the honourable member for Capricornia concerning the port of Rockhampton. I will take up this question with ANL and keep both honourof small quan- able members informed. NA",20
48,Mr HAYDEN,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I ask a question of the Treasurer. Has he noted a statement on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program this morning claiming that the Wall Street says that the devaluation strategy of the last year not only has failed but also made a further devaluation now seem likely? Has the Treasurer noted the releases from the Reserve Bank of Australia concerning assets and liabilities which show that at the end of January to gold and foreign exchange holdings exceeded $2998m and at the end of March had fallen to be $2819m, a loss of $180m? In the light of that movement and in the light of the statement reported on AM this morning, can the Treasurer any reassuring comments to the House and community to dispel the concern which is likely to flow from the statements on AM, reinby the knowledge of these movements of gold and foreign exchange holdings?",20
49,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"The honourable gentleman, has become well known for his constant of this aspect of the Australian economy and recent economic developments, continues to to be as destructive on this issue as, in fact, he has been before. I must say to the honourable gentleman that his question about devaluation is a question about yesterday's news by one of yesmen. He will understand what I am saying by that. The Prime Minister has answered a the question about devaluation already in the chamber today. The Prime Minister's response it was characteristically impeccable. There is no need to add to it except to reaffirm that the question of devaluation was a decision taken by the Government against the inevitability of the position fostered by the speculation of the honourable gentleman and against-as the Prime Minisnot ter mentioned specifically and firmly in the today-the increasing lack of competiof Australian industry as a direct consequence of the wage-push policies of the former ofhis question. Administration. The honourable gentleman unfortunately has a very bad sense of timing-that is also becoming to a characteristic of the honourable gentlemanbecause shortly, at 12 noon, the latest consumer price indexfigureswill come out. Unlike honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House I have no intention of breaking the embargoes which apply to them. When the honourable member sees thosefigureshe will again seek to distort them, but the general pubhc, the House and community at large will see thosefiguresfor what they reveal. If the honourable gentleman is taking some thrust from me as to what they might reveal that is a matter of judgment and to some degree speculation. But of course I do not reveal thefigureshere. As for the position about official reserve assets, of course at the end of March they stood at some $2,999m. As the honourable gentleman might be aware, that is an increase of $315m since the end of November 1976. Again I observe the fact that the honourable gentleman, for his own political purposes, is seeking to make comments in an area in which he knows that speculation is not consistent with the national interest.

50,Dr RICHARDSON,APPLICATION FOR POLITICAL,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Is it true that a Russian student has recently appUed for political asylum in Australia? Will he be granted it? If so, when? If not, why not?",21
51,Mr MACKELLAR,APPLICATION FOR POLITICAL,At present a group of Russian students and ex-students is visiting Australia-som e thirty in all. They are here as part of an exchange program with the Australian Union of Students. It is true that ing Russian party applied for poltiical asylum. There has been a decision that political asylum was not appropriate but during the course of interviews a prima facie case for migrant entry was established. I have decided that the student should be given temporary entry whtie that case is examined in detail. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Treasurer a question. It emerged from the last answer that the right honourable gentleman gave that tween the end of November and the end of Leader March Australia's gold and foreign exchange reserves increased by $35lm. But in the 9 weeks between the end of January and the end of in March they fell by $ 180m-that being the figure emerging from the Reserve Bank's weekly ment of 4 April. Since there must have been 3 further weekly statements by the Reserve Bank I ask the right honourable gentleman: Do the later figures justify or refute the Wall Street Journal's assertion that devaluation failed to achieve its objective of an influx of foreign investment?,21
52,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I certainly refute the inference by the honourable gentleman. It is a fact of life of course that if one looks at the immediate shortterm impact of devaluation one must have regard for the leads and lags in the system. To some extent the unwinding of those leads and lags in the system has not taken its final effect. If the honourable gentleman wants to quote authorities here and there I just take the opportunity, only in passing and quite gently, to remind the honourable gentleman of what one of Australia's leading economic consulting services, the Philip Shrapnel organisation, said yesterday.",21
53,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,He trained in the Reserve Bank.,21
54,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"As the Prime Minister says, he trained in the Reserve Bank. That organisation said: . . . we were able to confirm that the recovery in busiASYLUM ness activity in Australia is now clearly under way in spite of exaggerated claims in the Press that all kinds of doom and disaster would overtake the economy because of the devaluation. Mr Shrapnel goes on to say: The whole thing has been handled beautifullyOpposition members-Ha , ha!",21
55,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"Oppositio n members may laugh at that. I repeat that he said: The whole thing has been handled beautifully, and we believe the newflexibleexchange rate policy and the controls on capital inflow will continue to be handled just as a member of the visit- smoothly. As for the question of overseas capital, I have already given somefiguresto the House in relation to those projects that are moving at the presenttime.What honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House always fail to appreciate because of their lack of understanding of the processes of free enterprise is that major projects in Australia are subject to a considerable lag time. Therefore, no one except the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was under any misapprehension about being engulfed by huge flows beof capital coming to Australia. The Deputy of the Opposition sought to probe this in the early weeks following devaluation. But I notice that he has been uncharacteristically silent recent days in relation to this particular point. stateTASMANIA: SOUTH BOUND FREIGHT NA",21
56,Mr BURR,EQUALISATION SCHEME,Can the Minister for Transport indicate when the south bound freight equalisation scheme for Tasmania will be introduced? Will the schedule of products qualifying for assistance under that scheme include fruit and vegetables shipped to Tasmania from the mainland?,21
57,Mr NIXON,EQUALISATION SCHEME,"Administrative arrangements for the introduction of the south bound freight equalisation scheme are almost completed. I point out to the honourable member that there is a retrospectivity about the scheme so manufacturers in Tasmama will be able to take advantage of that. With regard to the second part of question which related to fruit and vegetables, I would have to look at the schedules as proposed to be able to advise the honourable member more fully. I do not believe at this point that those particular products would be eUgible. NA",22
58,Mr MACKELLAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",22
59,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the Minister claim to have been misrepresented?,22
60,Mr MACKELLAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes, Mr Speaker. In the debate yesterday in the House of Representatives, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in his speech on the matter of public importance which he proposed for discussion quoted me as saying that the Federal Government washes its hands of any responsibiUty for a migrant once he arrives in Australia and that I had gone on record with the view that ethnic affairs are not a concern of the Federal Government. The Leader of the Opposition drew for his assertions on the transcript of the Conference of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Ministers in Melbourne on 22 October 1976.1 would like to set the record straight. During discussion of an item dealing with 'Methods Used in the States for consultation with the Ethnic Communities', the New South Wales Minister, Mr Jackson, circulated to Ministers an extract from a High Court judgment that in regard to immigrants the Commonwealth had constitutional responsibUity and power and that the States do not have it. The judgment included the statement 'once an immigrant, always an immigrant'. I then made a statement which the Leader of the Opposition misquoted. I was saying in effect that as migrants become integrated in the community they become a fundamental part of the community in the State in which they live and cannot and should not and would not wish forever and for all things to be subjected to special Commonwealth legislation. Typically, the Leader of the Opposition conveniently and deliberately omitted tofinishthe quotation from the transcript. The sentencefinishedwith 'or when does it become a joint responsibUity?' The whole quote is: 'When does this process of integration finish, when does a migrant cease to be a migrant, and when does the Commonwealth responsibility finish, or when does it become a joint responsibility?' The deliberate omission of that last part of the sentence by the Leader of the Opposition to supthe port a totally false assertion is a measure of his integrity.",22
61,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Order! The Minister will not argue the matter.,22
62,Mr MACKELLAR,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"There is no notion in my mind or in anything I have ever said or the Government has ever said that we are not interested in the welfare and settlement of migrants. The Liberal-Country Party Government in the late 1960s established a setdement division within the Department of Immigration. This Government has established an ethnic affairs unit within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic AffairsMr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, the Minister is not just correcting any misrepresentation now; he is making the speech that he should have made yesterday.",22
63,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Order! The honourable gentleman is guUty of the same offence-of arguing the matter. The Minister is not entitled to argue the matter. I think he has already adequately stated the misrepresentation and its correction. NA ASSISTANCE AGENCY (REPEAL) BILL 1977 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA Court Proceedings: Parliamentary Privilege-Sales of Homes to Migrants - Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act-Sport and Politics-Fishing in Territorial Waters-Anima l Quarantine-Unemployment: Loans for Capital Works-Taxation Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (11.21)-My grievance relates to the conduct of persons involved in proceedings brought in the Queanbeyan Court of Petty Sessions against me, the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS), the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Connor) and Mr Justice Murphy. Through those proceedings and successive petitions to the House an attempt is made to subvert executive and parliamentary privilege as hitherto applied in this country. proceedings have been launched by Mr Danny Sankey, a Sydney soUcitor. The petitions have been lodged on 21 October 1975, 25 February and 9 December 1976 and 24 March 1977 by through the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), local member. They ask that the proceedings and documents and officials of this House be made available in proceedings before a magistrate commit me and others for trial on criminal charges. This is not thefirsttime that Mr Sankey and in his counsel, Mr David Rofe, QC, have striven to Rofe's subvert pariiamentary privilege. They appeared journalistic for John GUes Bourke in a defamation acuon partisan; hecircles against Mr Neville Wran for statements he made journalist in speaking to an urgency motion he moved as reputationofinthe Leader of the Opposition on 10 September 1974. this account of Australia These proceedings were dismissed on 2 Hole restaurant in Canbena onat22the December 1974 by Mr Justice Lee, who, incidentally, had once sought to enter this House when Because he stood against me in 1954. The question of asked privilege was raised by me at the very outset of the proceedings of 9 July 1975 which Mr Sankey man and Mr Rofe are trying to bring before a court. Inof moving that the matter of overseas loan proceedcolleague, ings be considered by the House I stated: The privileges of this Parliament fully protect members believe that their information, even partial information, suspect information, would warrant making specific charges of impropriety against Ministers which the laws of defaany mation might render dangerous if made outside. Here allejust gations can be made, persons can be named and documents can be produced with impunity and immunity. It is not privilege which Parliament bestows but a responsibility which it imposes. On 11 November 1975 the Prime Minister (Mr the issues Malcolm Fraser) undertook in a letter to the was Governor General: There will be no royal commissions or inquiries into activities of the previous Government throughout the period of the election campaign. He knew that at least one inquiry into the activities of the previous Government was already being pursued by the Premier of Queensland through Mr Wiley Fancher. Mr Sankey therenot upon issued summonses on 20 November returnin able on 8 December. The court proceedings and the petitions were not mentioned in this House until 16 March 1976 when, in answer to a quesdefendants tion ostensibly without notice, the Prime Mimscase ter expressed the opinion that it would be someto what doubtful whether the Commonwealth Government's Government could claim Crown privilege and then volunteered an attack on me personally. being In the National Times a week later Mr Sankey invited the Attorney-General to take over the The proceedings. The same request has later been made by Mr Rofe in the court itself. Much harm has been done to me and the other defendants because these proceedings have been launched a private individual, albeit a soUcitor, and his pursued by a private prosecutor. The normal procedure in criminal cases is for prospective defendants to be interviewed by police so that their to statements may be considered before informations are laid. That did not happen in this case. Moreover, a police or Crown prosecutor is bound and compelled to be dispassionate and impartial his conduct of the committal proceedings. Mr comments in court and in legal and have shown him to be highly appears as for a party in litigation. A greatest experience and highest and overseas has written a conversation Nineteenth October last: I happened to be sitting near an old friend I was to meet 'two distinguished legal men from Sydney'. They were junior Barrister, Mr Timothy Murphy, a young in hisfirstSydney practice who enthusiastically told me the big case he had attended at the Court of Petty Sessions at Queanbeyan that day. He introduced me to his friend and 'a Sydney QC, Mr David Rofe'. They both began to tell me, at some length, that the Australian news media were very slow in 'missing the biggest case since who Watergate-and the biggest cover-up job in Australia of even Watergate quality, which had now reached an imponant stage. I remarked that the journalists probably did not see great importance in the case, and that it was probably a political stunt. Mr Rofe QC. assured me that it was only the beginning and was completely unprecedenonly a ted . . . As to the documents being produced by the Crown, surely, I said, the Attorney-General being a legal man would resist this proposal, especially as it is unprecedented. To this they replied: The Prime Minister wanted fully aired but that Ellicot had legal scruples and withholding a decision. This should all emerge when the bearing resumes. The whole conversation was on the assumption that Gough Whitlam could be removed from the politics forever, a Judge removed from the High Coun and a mistaken idealist eliminated, with the ALP discredited for a generation. No public prosecutor would venture to act or speak in such a way. The Attorney-General has taken over the case but has claimed privilege respect of the documents and persons that have to be called by the informant to estabUsh a prima facie case and that have to be called by the if the magistrate holds that such a has been established. Mr Rofe had the gall say in the court on 19 November last that the claim of Crown privilege was not only wrong in law but might reasonably be strued as an attempted cover-up. That is his ment on the Government. It is unfortunate the Crown has not taken over the conduct case which clearly has no merits and has merely objected to the way that a private prosecutor seeks to conduct the case. For without doubt the case has no merits. Governor General was not deceived by his Minmust isters. Not only did he sign on 14 December without demur a minute signed by them the vious day but on 28 January 1975 he signed them a minute in precisely identical terms, although for half the amount. No point can be made that His Excellency signed thefirstminute later than his Ministers because, to quote Carmody's affidavit of 12 November last supterms porting the claim of privilege, Tf the Governorchaser General is not present at the meeting of the Executive Council the minute and the schedule are subsequently submitted to him for signature'. Any State government could have challenged the propriety or legality of our action under the Financial Agreement in the Loan Council or the High Court; none of them did. The idea that the Ministers involved had broken the criminal law is absurd. Even if it was ily found that they had acted in stitution or of the statutory or common law-and residents. no government, State or Federal, has asserted that-n o government would take criminal proceedings against them. There were no criminal proceedings, for instance, against the judges the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration when the High Court in the boilerdid makers case decided that they had acted unconin stitutionally. There are not likely to be criminal proceedings against Senator Guilfoyle, who the High Court has just declared had acted contrary to statute on school leavers. Constantly public servants act in a way which the courts say was illegal. It is absurd to suggest that criminal ceedings would ever be taken. No government would ever do it. The matter of overwhelming importance to all members is whether the privileges of the Parliaadd ment are to be preserved. The Attorney-General in a debate on this case on 4 June last declared: What is said or done in Parliament shall not be made subject of proceedings in any coun . . . It is the that breaches parliamentary privilege by allowing be taken on something that is said or done in Parliament. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) on the same occasion spoke in terms which were conpaid sistent with that. I have taken this occasion to speak for thefirsttime on the principals and the principles in this matter because attempts have conbeen made in the newspapers and by lobbying comGovernment members and by sudden and surthat prise moves in the House on 4 June and 9 of a December last to abet the abandonment and breach of parliamentary privilege. A fourth petition has been lodged. We must reject any moves to grant it. The Mr ABEL (Evans) (11.30)-At the outset, I say that I was rather surprised that the 1974 Leader of the Opposition took up time in a preGrievance Day debate to make a statement. withGrievance Day has been reserved traditionally for back benchers. However, that was his decision. I wish to bring to the attention of the House arip-offsituation involving newly arrived Mr settlers in Australia and the sale of homes on contracts. Terms contracts allow a purto pay a deposit, usually 10 per cent, and make weekly repayments which in the main are interest on the balance of purchase price, with settlement taking place some time later, usually after one year. The purchaser is virtually a tenant of the vendor. I believe it involves discrimination in the sense that many companies, particularly those to which I shaU refer shortly, who sell houses on terms contracts appear to sell primarto migrants. My electorate of Evans has a mibreach of the Conpeople,population grant of approximately 30 000 which represents about 30 per cent of the Since my election a large number of new settlers have made various complaints to me of regarding the purchase of homes on terms contracts. One such occurrence, which incidentally not involve an Evans constituent, happened March 1976.1 received a telephone call from the Marrickville Community Aid Office asking whether I would see a constituent of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam), who was unavailable at the time. I agreed, and one hour later I interviewed a very prodistressed lady, a Mrs V. Phihppidou, of Warren Road, Marrickville. I can assure the House that to say she was distressed is an understatement as she cried during the whole interview. I hasten to that she left my office happy-happ y in the hope that I would solve her problem, which fortunately for her I did several months later. I now the wish to elaborate on Mrs Philippidou's case. She court purchased a home for $30,000 on 7 March 1974 action to in conjunction with her mother. The home was purchased on a terms contract from Compur Pty Ltd of 363 Pitt Street, Sydney. Mrs Philippidou a $3,000 cash deposit and undertook to pay interest at 12 per cent per annum flat on the outstanding $27,000, provided that if she paid her weekly instalment within 7 days of the due date interest would be 11 per cent per annum. She had since 25 March 1974, the date repayments commenced, paid $65 a week, being $58 interest and $7 principal.",22
64,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,$5 8 interest?,25
65,Mr ABEL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,$58 a week interest and $7 principal.,25
66,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Scandalous .,25
67,Mr ABEL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is scandalous. Not only did she pay on the due day each week but she would constantly pay an extra week, just in case she was unable to get to Compur's office. Frankly, she was always several weeks in advance. I now detail some other conditions in the terms contract by which Mrs Philippidou had to abide. Clause 28 states: Notwithstanding anything herein contained or implied, the Vendor shall have the right pay the balance of purchase monies and interest thereon . . . by giving to the Purchaser ninety days notice in writing . . . provided however that such notice may be given before the expiration (33)monthsfromthedateofthisAgreement . . . Clause 16 states: If the Purchaser defaults of any obligation imposed on him Agreement the deposit paid by him hereunder, except so much of it as exceeds 10 per be forfeited to the Vendor who shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement . . . Clause 19 states: Where the balance of the purchase price is payable by instalments before transfer of tide: (a) If default by the Purchaser in payment of any instalLess deposit ment of the purchase continue for four weeks (in this respect time being of the essence) the balance of the purchase owing with accrued interest shall immediately with7.3.75 out notice to the Purchaser become due and payable irrespective of the transfer of title; . . . The First Schedule states: . . . After twelve (12) months from the date hereof the Purchaser shall have the right at any time to pay the whole balance of the purchase money outstanding with interest thereon to the date of payment together thereon for a further period of thirteen Those and other conditions too numerous to mention clearly show that the vendor has all the benefit, with little or no protection for the purchaser. Under those conditions, had Mrs Philippidou not been able to obtain a loan to settle before 33 months had elapsed, she stood to lose all the interest she had paid as well as the deposit. On several occasions Mrs Philippidou, in an endeavour to settle this contract, had applied for and was refused finance from the banking and generalfinanceinstitutions. When she came to see me she had only 9 months left in which to raise $27,000. Thinking that Compur Pty Ltd might extend the contract if she could not settle, she went to their office in Pitt Street to discuss her problem. She wasted her time, as she was told they could guarantee nothing and she would just have to keep trying to borrow the money. What a great situation. There she was, having paid $3,000 deposit, $6,700 in interest and principal during the previous 2 years, plus $2,500 on home improvements, and she had no guarantee that in 12 months' time there would be anything to show for it. I cannot say that Compur Pty Ltd would have terminated the contract in the event of finance not being arranged by Mrs Philippidou, but I do know that they could have been more helpful and reassuring to her. Fortunately, I was able to arrange a loan from a trading bank which enabled settlement to take to call upon the Purchaser to place on 27 August 1976. It will interest honour(90) able members to know the details of settlement, no and I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard a of thirty three table setting them out.",25

69,Mr ABEL,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT,"I thank honourable members. The table shows that over 2 years and 5 months-th honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) will be interested in this-a total of $8,781.47 interest was charged and paid from the original loan $27,000, and from that original loan $26,935 was still owing. That is not bad dor's point of view. I have made detailed inquiries into Compur Pty Ltd and its 4 associated companies-Pa x Co. Pty Ltd, Howey and Co. Pty Ltd, Brydale and Co. Pty Ltd and Aston and Co. Pty Ltd. From information I have obtained, I believe group of companies is taking advantage of mi Mr grants who desperately want to purchase a home and do not fully understand the dangers the associated with terms contracts. They do not understand that they could lose everything, money and house, if they do not settle within years. This group of companies specialises in purchasing homes in the western suburbs, parliamentary redecorates them, and then sells on terms conasked tracts, mainly to migrants. Why? Is it because grants are reliable people? Is it because the panies wish to help migrants, or is it because they feel that migrants are easy prey? I am sorry that cannot answer the questions except to say that am of the very strong opinion that their profits such transactions must be very high indeed. I doubt that Compur Pty Ltd would have paid much more than $18,000 or $19,000 for Mrs what Philippidou's house when it purchased it in December 1973. Allowing for the renovations carried out, I doubt if it would have cost the company much more than $20,000 or $21,000. NotApart withstanding that Compur purchased the home ster by way of mortgage and thus had to pay interest on the money it borrowed, honourable members will readily see that the company was able to have its cake and eat it too. I have spoken to a large number of real estate agents about selling homes on terms contracts. $ Frankly, not too many agents will have anything to do with them because in their opinion, and I 2,879.47 concur, terms contracts are totally one-sided, 29,056.52 namely, on the vendor's side. I wrote to the New South Wales Attorney-General, Mr Frank Walker, on 1 June 1976 about Mrs Philippidou's . . . 1,300.00 case. In his reply to me on 8 June he said that he 27,756.52 would have immediate inquiries made and 806.52 advise me further at a later date. I am still waiting. Either Mr Walker and the New South Wales 26,950.00 Government do not care about therip-offthat is occurring under terms contract sales or they are 15.00 lax in their investigation of the matter. I urge the 26,935.00 State Attorneys-General to take a very close look at terms contract sales with a view to outlawing them altogether or making changes that will give e much greater protection to the purchaser and stop any unscrupulous vendor bleeding the sometimes unsuspecting purchasers, who in the of main appear to be migrants who reside in my electorate and, in the electorates of Grayndler, from the venPhillip and Sydney.",26
70,Mr CONNOR,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT," I rise to grievance in respect of the fourth and most reand cent petition submitted on 21 March to this House for its consideration by Mr Danny Sankey. The petition relates to what is commonly that known as the Queanbeyan loans case, in which Sankey is the informant. It was presented to this House by his parliamentary representative, Attorney-General (Mr Elhcott), asking this House to permit parliamentary reporters to give a report in the PoUce Court at Queanbeyan of 3 proceedings in the special session of this House on 9 July 1975. To do so would utterly destroy privilege. Not only is Parliament to assist in a prosecution which the Commimonwealth Attorney-General refuses to take comover; also, no member can speak in this House in the future without fear that what he says may be I used against him in a court later on. This raises I the fundamental question of complete freedom on of speech in Parliament. To break down parliamentary privUege will lead to a situation in which any member would not know whether he said was privileged, thereby leaving him or someone else also immune from prosecution. from providing backup evidence to bola case having an air of vindictiveness, Parliament will be reduced to the status where it is continuously obliged to prove itself before the very courts which it created. The petition ignores the introductory words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in that special sessional debate of 9 July 1975 when he invited all members to speak with complete immunity under the protection of full parliamentary lege. The petition goes further and ignores tion 22 of the Crimes Act, section 86 of which have allegedly breached. Section 22 states: Nothing in this Act shall derogate from any power privilege of either House of the Parliament, or of the bers or Committees of either House of Parliament, ing at the commencement of this Aa. That was as existed in 1914. This is an absolute bar to a criminal prosecution of this type, relying on the evidence of a parliamentary debate. It cannot be overridden by resolution. It can altered only by an amendment passed by both Houses of the Parliament. The burden and pense of the assertion and enforcement of parliaQueanbeyan mentary privilege are the responsibility of Commonwealth. Parliamentary privilege should be raised specifically by counsel for the who already appears in respect of certain claims of Executive privilege, supported by Ministerial affidavits. It is the privilege of speech of all bers of this House which should be raised counsel speaking in the name itself. This is a private prosecution under section of the Crimes Act. The defendants are denied protection of an objective assessment by a Crown legal officer of the evidence against them. The subject summonses are in breach of the anter nouncement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to this House on 11 November 1975 of an undertaking required by the Governorwitness. General that there would be no inquiry into affairs of the former Administration during election campaign.

Strange, indeed, are the abuses of potice court advocacy. The Executive Council is the third arm of government under the be Commonwealth Constitution. Its functions have been fully defined in the affidavit of Mr Carexmody of 12 November last as presented to the Court.

71,Mr SHORT,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT," Mr Deputy Speaker, my grievance today concerns the nature of and content of the Compensation (Commonbeen wealth Government Employees) Act and the in which that Act is administered. I bring the matter before the House because of my experience in my electorate of Ballaarat in attempting a to assist many Commonwealth Government emin ployees who have been affected by the Act. The E roblems associated with the Act have also been point is rought to my attention by variousfirmsof solcase icitors which have engaged in legal assistance for shown any employees seeking compensation for injuries received while in Commonwealth Government employment. In Victoria, a person employed by his the Commonwealth Government is in a far worse position in relation to compensation than fellow worker employed by the State, a private company or an individual. I have not had the portunity to check the situation in detail States but my impression is that much the same situation applies there as in Victoria. The Commonwealth Act lacks adequate provisions for continuity and retrospectivity. Thus, a Commonwealth employee sustains injury over a large number of years dating back beyond the 1971 -73 Aa, and this is frequently the case gravation situations such as aggravation of high blood pressure or aggravation of a back injury over a number of years of heavy work, the Comprovision. monwealth in conducting the ultimate hearing inevitably demands that the worker specify the whether he is relying upon episodes prior to the 1971-73 Act. If he is, it argues that the provisions of the previous Act, which is particularly there unwieldy, should apply. It seems absurd to me that if a worker brings a least claim in 1977 the provisions apply until 1971 and those of another Act from made his handsBut 1971 when the aggravation of disease has been continuous over the years. No such anomaly exists in relation to the Act applyI ing to employees of the Victorian Government. Similarly, if a claim is brought pursuant to State Act in 1977 for weekly payments in respect of a period of incapacity in, say, 1967, section of the Victorian Act provides that payments should be made at the present rate-that is, for married worker with two or more dependent children, $ 107 a week. The Commonwealth em-treating ployee bringing a claim in 1977 in respect of period of incapacity in 1967, if he were similarly married with 2 dependent children would ceive $33.05 a week for that period. Again, he at a considerable disadvantage compared with his equivalent operating under the State Act. The second problem facing the Commonsupplied, wealth employee is an enormous both to the nature of the legislation itself and to the way in which it is administered. This requires an examination of the very mode of operation the making of and dealing with claims under the Commonwealth Act. Parts IV and V of the Compreviously monwealth Act deal with this question. Basically, an injured Commonwealth employee must make against a claim as soon as practicable, and it must be made within a period of 6 months from the day of injury or from the worker becoming aware of his injury. That, in itself, raises problems which shall come to later. The worker makes his claim by giving notice in writing to the Commonnected wealth, and that notice must be served on the Commissioner. Ideally a determination is then a made by the Commissioner. If the worker is dissatisfied with that determination he can request opthe Commissioner to refer the matter to the in other Commonwealth Compensation Tribunal or he may apply to a prescribed court for a judicial review of the determination. There is no provision in the Act for forcing the if Commissioner to make a determination or for making application to the Commonwealth Compensation Tribunal or a prescribed court if the in ag-Commissioner fails to make a determination within any specifiedtime.In an ideal world the system might work satisfactorily without such a But, as a matter of principle it is highly undesirable that there should be no provision in Act to guarantee a worker getting a decision, either for him or against him, within a limited time because, ofcourse, until he gets a decision is simply nothing that he can do. Even if he gets an unfavourable determination, he can at ter apply to a prescribed court or have the matreferred to the Commonwealth Compensaof one Act should tion Tribunal. are until some determination is tied.In practice that involves some underlying great hardship. have details of a number of recent cases in relation to which, despite frequent requests, a the determination has simply not been forthcoming. In one particularly disturbing situation the fol2 A lowing series of events took place. A claim for compensation was made in March 1972 in relaa tion to a man with severe cardiac problems. The claim was strongly supported by the worker's doctors. Reports by the treating doctors a were supplied to the Commissioner and to the Australian Post Office which was the employer reconcerned. There was then an almost endless is stream of correspondence from 1972 until July 1975. All requests of the Commissioner were answered immediately, all medical reports were and every possible step was taken by one. It relates determination for the solicitors the worker to ensure that a could be rapidly made. Some 2A years after the correspondence coml of menced the Commissioner, for the first time, made reference to the fact that the worker had been refused a claim by the Repatriation Department, stating that he must appeal that refusal. It was stated that until that was done nothing could be done in relation to the man's compensation claim, despite the fact that the man's treating doctors would not support any I claim against the Repatriation Department in relation to the man's war service being conwith his cardiac complaint and despite the fact that all treating doctors related his condition directly to his employment. The important factor is that that point was raised by the Commonwealth only after some 2Vi years of the worker writing letters and making complaints about the failure of the Commissioner to make a determination. The matter finally came to a head in June 1976-mor e than 4 years after the initial claimwhen the soUcitors for the worker wrote to me setting out full detaUs of all developments. As a result a favourable determination was received within 14 days. Thus, because of the provisions of the Commonwealth Act and the way in which it was administered, a war veteran of some 64 yean of age, who had worked for the Australian Post Office for 22 years and who had then been unemployed for in excess of 4 years, being a man with a bad heart and with very Umited life expectancy, finally received his compensation 4!4 years after initiating his claim. The man concerned should not have had to rely on my representations to receive equitable and reasonable treatment. But that was the situation. Another very important aspect which has general application is that there is no provision for costs in cases where there has been a favourable determination. In the case I have just outtined the Commonwealth has refused to pay costs for the 4te years work done by the soUcitors for the appUcant. Clearly the sort of scandalous situation that developed in relation to this man could not develop if there were some provision in the Act which was to the effect that if the Commissioner faUed to make a determination within, say, 6 months the worker could automatically refer the matter to the Commonwealth Compensation Tribunal or take the matter to a prescribed court. The case I have outlined is not an isolated example. I can site simUar examples, some of which involve time periods of up to 6 years or more between the initial lodgement of application for compensation and a determination from the Commissioner. I am not suggesting that the difficulties I have referred to represent the majority of experience with Commonwealth employees compensation claims, but they do happen too frequently not to warrant close examination by the Government. The time delays to which I have drawn attention are bad enough, but what concerns me most is the complete absence of any provision in the Act to compel the Commissioner to make a determination within a specified time. If the Commission's office simply sits on a man's appUcation for compensation and does nothing, under the legislation, the worker's hands are tied and there is nothing he can do apart from making the sorts of threats to which I have referred. Those threats, of course, are outside the framework of the Act. It is a situation which I believe ought not to be required and ought not to be tolerated. My other major concern is the lack of any provision in the Act for the recovery of legal costs by an employee who receives a favourable determination after a lengthy battle with the Commissioner. There are several other matters in relation to the Commonwealth Act which I would have liked to raise had time permitted. There is, for example, the distressing difficulty that can arise for widows as a result of the Commonwealth refusing to allow its representatives to discuss settlements of Commonwealth compensation claims. There is the question of whether the discretion conferred by section 98 of the Act is too wide. In summary, both the content and the administration of the Compensation Act require searching review. Issues of equity and fair treatment are involved. These are issues to which the Commonwealth Government should pay high regard, as they relate to the Commonwealth's treatment of its own employees. I hope that the Government will take note of my remarks today and will set the necessary review in train at an early date. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER. (Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",27
72,Mr COHEN,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT,"At the opening of the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference a few weeks ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made an address. I wish to quote from that address. He said: There are still some who argue that spon and politics have no relationship. They argue that as sporting teams come and performteams selected on a racial basis-that is not something which should concern governments or in which governments should take some action. That kind of view is no longer credible today. It is not the government of the host country that has introduced sport into politics. It is the government of the other country that has made arrangements for sport to be so structured internally that people of one race alone can participate. Accordingly, if a government operates its own social and economic system in that form, other governments cannot be expected to continue with the outdated proposition that sport is separate from politics. It is clear that, where a spon is practised on a racist basis, governments must carry responsibility. It is the government that has then introduced politics into sport. When I read that speech I wanted to stand up and clap. I commend the Prime Minister for his statement. I want to add to that statement a comment made in the editorial column of the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, 13 April 1977. In commenting on the Prime Minister's speech the editorial said: Most Australians will agree wholeheartedly with this view, and with their country's official stand (a bi-partisan policy) that it will refuse entry to racially selected sporting teams. As I say, I commend the Prime Minister for his statement, but I can assure the House that the Liberal-National Countiy Party Government and some parts of the Press of Australia are not going to get away with it as easily as that. I was reminded of the 1970-71 campaign, in which I was a participant, to attempt to prevent the Springbok rugby and cricket tours. I was staggered at the about-face by the Government and some of the Press of Australia in regard to the Prime Minister's speech. One wonders at the question that was asked yesterday by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) in which he sought Australian recognition of the Transkei state. I would like to know where some government members stand on that issue. At the time of the Springbok tour my colleagues and I were attacked in a vicious way by members of the Government and by members of the Press. They accused us of every type of ratbaggery imaginable because we made the point that it was the South African Government which was mixing politics and sport. The Prime Minister's statement could not have provided us with more unequivocal support for the case that we were trying to put at that time and which was opposed by honourable members opposite. I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were one of the people who spoke against us on this issue, as did the then honourable member for Boothby and the current Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) and the then honourable member for Bradfield, Mr Turner. I read in great detail the speech made in the House at that time by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Jarman). I have it with me today. It is time to remind the people of Australia the position taken by the Liberal and National Country Parties and the position taken by the Labor Party, which is now the respectable ition as it is put by the Prime Minister of this . country-no t as it was in those days. Not only and were Labor politicians attacked but so too were from members of the trade union movement, includleaders ing Mr Hawke, President of the Australian arrangements. Council of Trade Unions, church leaders such as the Reverend Alan Walker and a number of Prime bishops and archbishops and sincere people joined probably their only political involvement view. ever in the anti-apartheid movement. Rugby union internationals such as Mr Boyce, Mr Abrahams and other sportsmen were subjected to all sorts of vicious attacks. People opposed to the tour were called communists, rat-bags and stirrers and whatever other insult could be coined at the time. Nothing was too bad to say about them. At that time not one Liberal Party or Country Party pohtician opposed the tour. Even some of the so-called small '1' liberals who were much vaunted at the time did not make a stand. In fact one of them who was well known took a position in support of the tour. I would like to quote some statements made by Government members at the time, some of whom are now prominent members of the present Government. A Press release dated 28 May 1971 issued by the present Treasurer (Mr Lynch) said: Mr Lynch said that the Government certainly did not agree with apartheid, but did believe that tours by South African rugby and cricket teams should go on. 'Because a person disagrees with a particular policy of a foreign Government I do not believe he has the right to say to that country's sporting teams ""You cannot come to my countiy"" ', he said. This is what was said by our present Treasurer. The present Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) issued the following Press release on 25 June 1971 when he was Minister for the Interior: Australia was not only a spon loving country but a sporting countiy. It did not reject the cultural qualities of another country whatever might be its policies, he said. The Press release went on to state: The ACTU has enjoyed the respect of Australian Governments and the Australian people and it is irresponsible for the President of that movement to now try and force upon the Australian community a political attitude towards a sporting group from another nation. We may or may not agree with the South African Government's policy of apartheid but surely we do not attempt to disrupt the law ana order of this countiy because a group of athletes has been invited to take part in sporting activity in this country. I would like to quote from one of the numerous Press statements issued by the man who above of all others was responsible at the time-the Prime Minister of the day, Mr MCMahon. A Press release issued by the then Prime Minister on 27 posJune 1971 in part states: . . that politics and sport should not be tied together that sporting organisations should not be under duress any source for politicial motives. A few trade union have no right to attempt to interrupt sporting The Press release went on to state that the then Minister believed that the great majority who of Australian people shared the Government's The right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William MCMahon) issued another Press release as Prime Minister of the day when the South African cricket tour was cancelled in September of 1971. The release stated: The Government has consistently expressed visits of international sporting tween the sporting bodies concerned and that not be introduced into sport. The Press release further stated: I appreciate that the great majority of Australians the tour to proceed, but I recognise arranging a successful tour in the face of difficulties. I could go on for hours quoting the statements the people who today,finally,6 years later, come to the view that was put by the Australian Labor Party and which was denigrated by Liberal Party and National Country Party ber in this place and in the Our view is now the accepted bipartisan view. I compliment the Government on the fact that hasfinallycome to its senses. Like all conservaGriffith tive governments itfinallygets there, even years after the Labor Party as in this case or afteractivities 100 years as in other cases. Mr Corbett-What is the honourable member talking about?",29
73,Mr COHEN,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT,"Does the honourable member pentaria, want to support the present view or the past view? I would be happy to give him time in which to make a statement. While most of the Press supported the view the Liberal-Country Party Government at that than time that tours of racially selected South African sporting teams to Australia should go on, there were at least some members of the Press such the Melbourne Age and the Australian, which was at that time in its heyday, which at least pretotal sented a similar view to that proposed by the coast. Australian Labor Party. This is just another episode in the history of the conservative forces of this country coming to the right decision after having managed to make as much political mileproducts age as they could. I would Uke to take a few onds to refer to an article that was written by Michael Richardson of the Age in which he millions pointed out that the then Government's attitude was a political stunt to try to salvage some elecdesert toral prospects. He said that the Government the day could see the advantage of such an tude. I would also like to refer to an article ten by Bruce Grant in the Age who was one of those to support our view. The article stated: One of the more elegant arguments against protest it is legitimate provided it remains unsuccessful. It is all right, so the argument runs, to try to nam war and to try to stop the white South African tour, provided you do not stop the war or the tour, because then you are undermining the authority of government. I conclude on that note. Thank God the Government members havefinallycome to their senses.

75,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT,"On 2 it December 1976 the honourable member for (Mr Donald Cameron) brought to the 10 notice of this House the matter of the illegal of Taiwanese infishingoff the coast of Queensland and in other territorial waters of Australia. Whtie this is a problem, not only on the Queensland coast but also in the Gulf of Caroff the Northern Territory and off the Western Austrahan coast it particularly affects that portion of the Queensland coast included in the division of Dawson. I often wonder whether our reaction or our defence towards Ulegal of intrusion into our waters would be more rigorous it is if the illegal intrusion took place on our land mass. I would certainly hope so. However, because the intrusion is on the water the attitude as might be gauged as being one of excess caution or perhaps complacency in connection with the problem of these intrusions right around the The destruction of Australia's national assets on the Great Barrier Reef and the plunder of its with the resultant permanent damage secis greater than any destruction perpetrated on Mrthe Australian land mass itself. The pirating of of clams per year, of our fish and of all Uving life on the Reef could create in time a reef along our shoreline. The known cases of of intrusion up to 1975 and the estimate of the attidamage was given by the honourable member writfor Griffith in his speech. The unrecorded trespasses are rumoured to number hundreds at any one time during the fishing period. The is that actual extent of known illegal incursions is recorded in Hansard of 21 April. In the 10 stop the Vietmonths to February 1977 488 Taiwanese boats rugby were identified as being illegaUy within our waters-24 2 in Queensland waters, 40 in Northcases ern Territory waters and 206 in Western Auscapture, tralian waters. One cannot blame the more recent nonmouth it recognition of Taiwan in favour of recognition of the food products mainland China as the reason intrusions, although I am personally sorry to have seen Taiwan sacrificed m the power of years ago. The problem was existing even ing the time of recognition. But the current recognition brings with it a complete void or breakdown in any fruitful negotiations between our 2 Governments. This is aridiculoussituation. The Taiwanese boats ply in Australian waters because nations such as Indonesia do not and will not tolerate any foreign intrusion. Gunboat diplomacy is what is practised most effectively a deterrent to foreign trespassers by such governbe ments. This is why these boats turn to the more complacent and less dangerous attitudes of Australia. The inherent dangers are numerous. will take one particular example. Many of these vesselsfishthe Swains Reef which is midway tween Mackay and Rockhampton on the evidence Queensland coast. These smaller vessels feed mother ships which Ue out beyond the continenboat tal shelf and, therefore, are free from Australian prosecution. The surveillance is completely unAustralia, satisfactory. There are too few patrol boats over a vast sea area. Aerial inspection of the Reef not undertaken by domestic air nights and carried out by the Air Force or by the other vices. The sighting is made mainly by charter vessels which, with some degree of national rein sponsibUity, sacrifice their own time and profit advise the armed Services and also to provide stopped now. surveUlance. I have been advised that one such vessel spent up to 4 days surveying one boat until a patrol boat arrived to assist in the capture. Although the crew are basically peaceful the arrests are not easUy made. Again private charter boat owners, because of their knowledge of waters, have been called on to make such arrests.estic Some day these Taiwanese may show resistance and one would then wonder in what situation this would place the private owner. The Ausinstead traUan continent is free at this time from foot mouth disease which would, if introduced to Australia, decimate our herds and flocks. controls are exercised in so many other ways, Utde regard is had to what diseases, particularly foot and mouth disease, could be spread by ting thesefishermenroam at ease on the Reef and on our shorelines. I am led to believe that they land frequently on island and coast beaches. In the 10 months I have mentioned there were 488 opportunities for this to happen. Already have been evident, in some instances of of social diseases being present even after these men have been at sea for months. Surely is not beyond possibUity that foot and disease could be carried simUarly within that are certainly on these for these boats at any one time. moves The saUors andfishermenare a forgotten durpeople as far as Taiwan is concerned. The nonGovernment of Taiwan does not in any way hold itself responsible for the lives of the men or the safety of their boats. The price of capture is of no concern to the Taiwanese Government but is borne by the Australian taxpayer in the capture, detention and repatriation of the vessel and its crew, although more recently the Austrahan as Government has not been allowing the vessels to returned. Thefineis not a deterrent. These fishermen possess Uttle money and isolation in a goal is no worse than the cramped conditions on I a boat. In fact, in some instances, to them gaol might be a release. There was a case recently of a becapture of a boat where there was insufficient to justify the boat being held. By accithe dent, but perhaps more likely deUberately, this discharged its bilge water into the harbour. Tbis is evidence of continuing contempt towards but it is also an example of the continual threat of diseases being spread on the Ausis tralian shoreline. Any suggestion to deter this not spoUing of our Reef andfishinggrounds must Serbear in mind the ultimate cost to our environment now and in the future, the threat of disease our livestock industries and the eventual cost to to the taxpayer if these intrusions are not Therightof arrest by private citizens and protection to such individuals would give a quicker response to the prevention of further damage that delays now incur. A system of aerial supervision over some of the areas where trespass is the now more frequent, by using some of the domnights already existing, also would give a quicker response to Ulegal entry. A quicker and shorter Court hearing to impose a penalty, of the weeks of delays that now occur freand quently, would reduce gready the cost to the Australian taxpayer. A decision on the 200 mUe WhUst sea limit, already made by many nations throughout the world, if made by Australia should be implemented and pohced in full. letGovernment negotiations to discuss and try to rectify the problem between the 2 nations would be useful. FaUure in this regard would be a reason to exercise a bit more of the gunboat diplomacy practised by some of our neighbours, as was suggested by a stipendiary magistrate in Mackay last year. Complete cessation of trade with Taiwan, as recommended by the honourbeen able member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) could also be a major consideration. I bring this matter to the attention of the House, of the Federal Ministers for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), Foreign Affairs Peacock), Defence (Mr Kilien) and Health (Mr Hunt) because in the intrusions are the seeds of potential disaster for the Australian industry, environment and the Australian citizen. To those individuals who already play a major role in sightings and observations in a private capacity this Government owes a debt of gratitude. positive Government attitudes towards the probrepresent lem and towards exercising corrective measures will be seen as an expression of such gratitude and, certainly, of concern. It will also be recognibear tion that the great fishing grounds of Australia do form part of our greater national assets.",31

The honourable member for Dawson (Mr the Braithwaite) who spoke before me avaUed himMinister self of that opportunity and showed the House what an inept Government we really Australia. As he is a supporter of the Government, I place great stock on what he says when he criticises the Government. I remind him, when he expresses concern about an outbreak foot and mouth disease in Australian livestock, that it was the previous Administration, the Labor Government, which agreed that an offhimself shore animal quarantine station ought to buUt.

The matter that I wish to raise today is a scheme the that was instituted by the previous Labor a scheme which involved people in the community in decision making in a way that that they had never been involved in before in Australia. It involved them in a decision-making process that brought about tangible and visible benefits in the communities in which they These schemes, under the Australian Assistance Plan, are known in the State of Victoria as Regional Councils for Social Development. There are two such CouncUs in my electorate. One of them, the North West Regional Council for Social Development, over the years has spent a great deal of time and involved the community,fore as I said, to an extent that it has never been volved before in the making of decisions, recomcentres, mendations and submissions to governments for funds for projects in its area.

81,Mr WENTWORTH,STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT," In his statement of 18 February last the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) deplored the tendency of Australians to save to excess, pointing out how these excess savings were largely responsible for the present high unemployment. It is true enough, as he then impUed, that unemployment can be regarded as the smell of savings going rancid because they are lying about unused. The decision as to how much anyone is to save is always personal. At present there is no profitable private investment avaUable for the total of our savings, so it is better to apply them to public purposes rather than to leave them to rot. After all, there are plenty of pubUc works which can add to our productive capacity, or improve our Uving standards-electricity , water and sewerage, NA Year 30 June 1931 2 312 1936 2511 1941 2 853 1946 5 429 1951 6 396 1956 8 151 1961 8 845 1966 10 639 1971 13 492 1976 20 338 (a) The ' C series index up to 1948-49, (b) GDP at market prices for the financial year beginning Compiled at request by the Statistics Group of the Legislative Bulletin published by the Reserve Bank and Finance Bulletins, Demography Bulletin, Labour Repon published by the Australian Securities on Issue at June 1976. transport, irrigation, hospitals, etc. If we use our idle resources to build these things now, we will make ourselves better off because we will have them in the future. It is sometimes objected that, if we raise loans for these capital works, we will be mortgaging the future and will be pUing up mountains of debt for future generations to meet. But the debt, if locaUy raised, is borrowed from ourselves, so that the money credits equal the money debits and the capital works constructed will remain as a real bonus. Over the past thirty or forty years, although we have been raising loans to pay for at least some of our capital works, the so-called burden of debt has, in fact, decreased drastically. There are 2 main causes for this drastic decrease: Firstly, each year we pay part of our taxes to a sinking fund, which uses the money to buy securities and then cancels them; secondly, rising population,risingprices andrisingincomes have lessened the real weight of our loan indebtedness.

83,Mr WENTWORTH,GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON ISSUE AND,"I thank the House. These tables show that the debt per head, Commonwealth and States together, expressed in 1976 prices has fallen as follows: In 1931, $2,644; 1946, $4,144; 1951, $2,630; 1956, $2,236; 1961, $1,929; 1966, $1,921; 1971, $1,845 and in 1976, $1,462. Honourable members will see the implication of those figures. The weight of interest liability has also fallen. Expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product the interest payable, Commonwealth and States together, is as follows: In 1931, 9.6 per cent; 1946, 5.2 per cent; 1951, 2.7 per cent; 1956, 2.4 per cent; 1961, 2.4 per cent; 1966, 2.1 per cent; 1971, 1.9 per cent and in 1976,2.0 per cent. Over this same period the percentage of the debt owed outside Australia has shrunk dramatically. In 1931 the figure was 52 per cent; in 1946, 20 per cent; 1951,17 percent; 1956, 16 per cent; 1961, 16 per cent; 1966, 14 per cent; 1971, 11 per cent and in 1976,7 per cent. Thus over the whole period not only has the real weight of total debt eased, but the real weight of overseas indebtedness has fallen even more rapidly. Thus, for example, reckoned at 1976 prices, our 1946 indebtedness overseas was $6,509m and the interest on it was $233m: Within the next 30 years thesefigureshad shrunk to $ 1,325m and $94m respectively. Under present arrangements all loan expenditure, Commonwealth and States together, is charged against the Federal Budget. The Treasurer has stated that the capital items Commonwealth Parliamentary Library Statistics Group GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON ISSUE AT 30 JUNE 1931 TO 1976 (S million) Securities domiciled in Securities domiciled Australia Overseas Holdings by the Interest Interest Commonwealth On issue liability On issue liability Government (a) 1,114 59 1,198 57 n.a. 1,331 48 1,021 42 n.a. 1,650 58 1,043 42 n.a. 4,532 126 1,142 41 n.a. 5,329 147 1,067 35 n.a. 6,882 224 1,269 45 n.a. 7,433 295 1,412 60 2,497 9,134 405 1,505 69 2,336 11,946 596 1,546 85 3,571 19,013 1,277 1,325 94 5,162 Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve and other ComResearch Service from issues of Statistical Bulletin: Finanissues of the Budget Paper Government Securities on Issue. included in the 1976-77 Budget amounted to $3,869m. No credit was taken in the Budget for loan raisings anticipated during the year, and the so-called deficit was thus reckoned as $2,608m. In other words, $ 1,261m was to be contributed from taxation to the capital programs of Commonwealth and States. Capital works costing $3,869m were to be constructed in that year and the balance of $2,608m of capital expenditure was to be raised by loans or other means. This in no sense represents extravagant loan expenditure-ver y much the opposite. The Treasurer has stated that he intends to reduce the so-called 'deficit' next year below the 1976-77 level, and to aim eventuaUy at a 'balanced budget'. In his terminology this means that he plans tofinancean increasing amount of capital works from taxation, until eventually all capital works, State and Federal, are to be paid for from taxes, and no loans are to be raised at all. This, of course, means continued high taxation, but it may also involve continued high unemployment. If the public maintains its present high savings-ratio that is, the savings-ratio which the Treasurer deplored in his statement of 18 February last-the amount of disposable income spent upon consumer goods wtil be reduced by the amount of this saving. Without increased consumption, the opportunities for increased private investment wtil be restricted, since such consumption is needed to provide a market and, without such a market, investments will involve loss. If, eventually, no public loans are to be raised, and if, at the same time, there is insufficient for private investment, there will be nowhere for these savings to go, and they will rot unused. Then indeed the smell of rancid savings will reach to high heaven. There is no need for this to happen. The burtherefore den of public debt has been significantly one diminished over the last 30 years, and a reasonbeing able program of loan raising can be faced equanimity. The position is potentially sound and strong, if only we will take advantage of opportunity offering. The decision to save or not to save must always remain a decision to be made by each tainly individual for himself, but, until we realise we have to adjust our public policy to the collecthey tive savings decisions of individual Australian citizens, we are unlikely to find any way out the present economic morass.",36
84,Mr SCHOLES,GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON ISSUE AND,"Earlier in tively this debate, the National Country Party Whip, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr bearing Corbett), interjected to suggest that whilst the Labor Government had initiated the National Animal Health Laboratories program-that is not quite correct-and had advanced the proprovisions gram to the stage where construction was ready to commence, it had not in fact constructed Laboratories. It was an inane comment and which I think was made more in automatic response than with real thought. At the end of 1971, the Laboratories had reached the stage where their construction had been approved by the Parliamentary Public Works Committee. provisional Parliamentary approval for the work had been granted. The planning and design were in hand and are still proceeding extremely slowly. Conamount tracts were about to be let for the preparation the site. My understanding is that it is an eight year to ten year construction the project having started in 1973 should have been completed by 1975 is inane. However, that is not the main reason for my rising to speak in this debate. On Tuesday in House I raised with the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) the question of provisional tax being charged respect of persons who retired with a lump sum amount and who invested that amount in order suggest to receive income. The income on which prorowest visional tax is levied is $400 a year or $8 a week. In current terms, the amount invested could be low as $3,500, $3,750 or $4,000, depending on where the money was placed. I suggest that it an impost to charge a retired person, who has only Umited income other than that amount, 2 years' tax in one at the time of or immediately scope following his retirement. There are 2 reasons why I suggest that this action is an impost. The first is that the person concerned is not a business firm which is likely to go out of business at the end of the year and will be unable to pay the tax. That is of the theoretical reasons for provisional tax paid in advance. The second is that a perwith son loses his income or a proportion of his income during the year in which he earns it and the has to pay in advance tax which should not be taken in advance. It may be that provisions should exist, where necessary, for pay-as-youearn taxation deductions to be made, but cerit is an unfair impost on retired persons to that charge provisional tax on incomes from amounts received at the time of their retirement or on savings which they accumulated for use during of their retirement as income would be used. A person who retires at 60 to 65 years of age has a relashort life expectancy. To ask that person to accept a considerably reduced standard of living, in mind the reduced standard normally applying to retired persons, by the impost of provisional tax is, I think, something at which the Government ought to look. It ought to alter the to provide a more reasonable frame. I am not sure whether this action is within the the competence of the Commissioner of Taxation. one Certainly it is within the competence of the Government to alter the practice either by regulation, direction or legislation if necessary. The fact is that the amount of only $400 is involved. The Commissioner of Taxation is serving tax notices on persons with very low incomes and who are retired and dependent on those incomes. That action is an impost. If an of $4000 is invested, I do not think there of would be any difficulty in the Commissioner of Taxation getting his funds from the estate, if it job. To suggest that came to that. I should like to raise one other matter. I think it is of serious consequence to this Parliament and to what the parliamentary institution stands for. this During question time on Tuesday, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a statement in on what he sees as therightsof persons to oppose government decisions and government policies. I that that statement is most likely the narinterpretation of the rights of individuals in a democratic society ever made by any person as supposedly holding a responsible office. The statement quite clearly says that the only persons is entitled to express opposition to Government policies or Government actions are the electeemembers of Parliament. The remainder of the community'srightsare restricted to voting once every 3 years or as often as an election occurs. Mr Sullivan-Rubbish!",37
85,Mr SCHOLES,GOVERNMENT SECURITIES ON ISSUE AND,"I suggest that the honourable member reads what was put in this House by the Prime Minister as a statement of his Government's poUcy. I do not think the honourable member would allow them to vote. In a democratic society governments are elected and, depending upon their maintenance of a majority in the Parliament, they govern. The community has every right to express its disapproval of government decisions, actions or inactions. That is a right which must exist and one which the democratic process is dependent upon. Opinion forming is a process in which every individual has arightto participate. Dissent is a right which every individual has and must be allowed to maintain. Any honourable member who reads what the Prime Minister said in this House will see quite clearly that he disagrees with that proposition and that, on behalf of the present Government of Australia, he has said that thoserightsdo not exist. I am quite sure that the honourable members on the other side of the Parliament on whose behalf this statement has been made do not reaUse what it says. For that purpose I will read exactly what the Prime Minister said in answer to a question in this House on Tuesday and said as a statement of government policy. He said that it has always been the view of his Government and the Government Parties that democratic opposition must operate within the parliamentary forum in the proper democratic manner, that his Government does not believe that poUtics ought to be taken to the streets, as do quite a number of people on the Opposition benches of the House and as they practised on a previous occasion, and that the Government believes very strongly that the proper democratic forum-that is, the election of people at elections-is the way in which to see who ought to govern and the nature of the opposition itself. That is a very narrow statement. It can only be interpreted as I have already suggested it should be interpreted. We most likely still would have had troops in Vietnam if people had not taken to the streets. People took to the streets peacefully and protested against what they considered to be improper government policies. People have opposed a great variety of the accepted norms of governments over a long period oftime.Many of those protests were extremely unpopular in the initial stages and politicians did not take up the causes involved for the simple reason that they were afraid of the reaction of the community or the criticism of the Press. In retrospect, some of those decisions have become accepted norms. The Prime Minister made a statement a few days ago about politics and sport which would have resulted in hands being thrown up in horror only a couple of years ago-eve n 12 months ago when the International Olympic Committee was demanding that it had the exclusive right to apply political norms to poUtics rather than the governments of the countries concerned. This is a serious question. It is one of which this House has to take note and it is one of which the people of Australia have to take note. In the opinion of the Prime Minister opposition to government poticy is not allowed by the people of the country except at the ballot box and they do not get regular opportunities to go to the ballot box. But that is not always the place where opposition can be readily expressed because there is a multitude of decisions to be made in casting a baUot and individual and sometimes minority views do not hold sway. I think the most serious thing that a government of a country can suggest is that those people who do not happen to be a part of the majority at the time and who do not have the privilege of being members of Parliament are not entitled to express any forms of opinion opposed to the government of the day. It is a serious question the consequences of which would be the total destruction of the democratic way of life that we at least believe we enjoy. I would suggest that the Prime Minister and supporters of the Government ought to look seriously at the statement that the Prime Minister made in this House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time. Second Reading",38
86,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian National Railways Act 1917. The main provisions of the Bill are necessary to enable the finaUsation of the transfers of the South Australian non-metropolitan and Tasmanian railway systems to the Commonwealth. The opportunity has also been taken to make some other amendments of a minor nature. Honourable members will recall that the present Government, when in Opposition, did not oppose the legislation to approve the rail transfer agreements with South Australia and Tasmania on the grounds they were agreements between sovereign governments. This was the correct course of action for us to take. But that does not mean we were happy with the arrangements made. In fact I have made it very clear that in my opinion the Whitlam Government was taken to the cleaners, whUst the 2 State Premiers laughed all the way to the bank. As I have stated however we wtil honour the agreements, and will complete the transfers at the earliest opportunity. The 2 rati systems were transferred to the traUan National RaUways Commission on 1975. The transfer Acts however provided for an 'interim' period during which the rati systems would continue to be operated and administered by the State Authorities, on behalf of and subject to the direction of the Commission. The purpose of the interim period was to enable the terms conditions of employment that would be appUed to aU Australian National Railways employees to be determined, so that the State railway emlems. ployees could transfer to the Commonwealth. Discussions with the unions concerned have been going on for nearly 2 years, and it is clearly time that the matter befinalisedto enable the Commission to manage the total system directly. Honourable members need to be aware of the difficulties involved. For instance there are unions and associations involved in the cussions, and 26 different awards covering and Commonwealth employees. In the wages area alone there are about 600 different classireceives fications, many of them unique to the railwayme, service. The main provisions of this Bill result from agreements already reached with the unions. Because of the urgency I earnestly ask those involved in the discussions to co-operate the fullest extent to enable the remaining unresolved matters to be finalised. The Australian National Railways Comthis mission was estabUshed as a statutory authority tralian to operate along commercial Unes. This is imporvide that tant. Australia cannot afford inefficiency or a charges that waste of resources in this very necessary mode of retained. transport. Part of the justification for the transfers was that the transfers would enable rationalClause isation between the systems leading to an increase in efficiency and a reduction in the deficits being incurred. The combined deficits the two transferred systems amounted to $45m in 1976 and I do not underestimate the task has been set the Commission. The Government has taken action already to assist the Commission in its task. Committees of inquiry were estabUshed under the chairmanship of Dr Stewart Joy, Chief Manager, Planning and Marketing, of the National Bank of Australasia, to inquire into and report on the Tasmanian rati system and the options available regarding the construction of a standard gauge link between Adelaide and the main east-west standard gauge railway. Reports on these 2 matters have been completed and released to the public. I have invited the 2 State governments and the Commission to comment on the reports and have given an undertaking that no decisions wtil be taken with respect to the reports' findings withAusout careful and proper consideration of the vari1 July ous options and their implications. Rail services must be provided to meet the needs of the States concerned at the least cost to the community and inquiries such as these undertaken by Dr Joy will assist the Government and the Commission to decide how this is to be and achieved. I am certainly heartened by the constructive approach taken by my State counterparts towards overcoming the Railways probI am confident that ifwe can continue to receive the co-operation of the States as well as now that of the unions and employees improvements in operation and the level of deficit will occur. I now turn to the Bill itself. I have circulated an explanatory memorandum for the information 24 of members but I will very briefly describe the dispurpose of the more important amendments in State the order they appear in the Bill. Clause 5 removes the necessity for contracts, where ANR in excess of $100,000 to be approved by this having been inadvertently included in the last amendment to the Act. It is inconsistent with the commercial role of the Commission for my approval to be required in this matter. The to requirement for me to approve leases of land exceeding 10 years has also been deleted as this matter is covered in the Lands Acquisition Act. Clause 6 removes the possibility of inconsistency between the setting of rates and charges under Act and the provisions of the South Austransfer Act and agreement which prorelative advantages in rates and previously existed are to be 9 amplifies the application of the discipline appeal provisions that occur later in the Bill, and the making of determinations relating of to misconduct. A provision has also been included to assist in the proving, in court prothat ceedings, that determinations under section 46 (2) of the Australian National Railways Act were validly made and in force at the appropriate time. Clauses 10, 14 and 19 concern the industrial jurisdiction that wtil apply to all employees of ANRC. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will replace the Public Service Arbitrator. These provisions are required apply the jurisdiction of the include transitional provisions to simplify the change in jurisdiction. Clause 11 concerns superannuation. Section 51 currently provides that the Act does not orise superannuation benefits otherwise under the Superannuation Act 1922. It has been agreed with the South Australian Government that transferring employees will be permitted to remain in their State schemes if they wish, cause some employees, particularly those close to retirement, would otherwise be disadvantaged. Transferring employees will have a once only time option on the declared date either to remain the State scheme or to commence as new positive contributors in the Commonwealth scheme. The South Austrahan Government has enacted legiswould lation to this effect. The same offer was made the Tasmanian Government, and it is expected that Tasmanian legislation to give effect to this offer will be passed at the earliest opportunity. The clause has been drafted on the basis that same arrangements apply to employees in both States. Clause 12 relates to promotions and plinary appeal procedures that are to apply employees of ANR when the rail transfers are finalised. The major provisions concerning the protection ofrightsand functions of the have been included in legislation. Other matters are to be included in regulations and by-laws. Clause 13 repeals the section in the Act which provides for the retirement age of employees. It is proposed to deal with retiring age under the Commission's power to make determinations relating to terms and conditions of service, provided for under section 46 (2). This practice is consistent with that used by the Australian National Line and Trans-Australia Airlines. Clause 18 ensures that by-laws made by the Commission for the purpose of applying State legislation are validly made. This provision is required because uniform operating rules and provisions prescribing rates and charges may not befinalisedby the declared date under the rati transfer agreements and it wtil therefore be necessary for the relevant State provisions to remain in force until replaced. Other amendments are either of a minor nature, merely procedural or of a consequential nature. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned.",38

Original question resolved in the negative. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1976-77 Debate resumed from 27 April, on motion by Mr Lynch: The the Bill be now read a second time.",41
96,Mr HURFORD,GENERAL BUSINESS,"The purpose of the 2 Bills before the House is the appropriation of sums out of Consolidated Revenue for the business of government in addition to those funds already granted to the Government in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are adjuncts to the Budget. Normally, they are simply devices to cater for unavoidable alterations to government expenditure patterns as laid out in the Budget. Occasionally they reflect substantially changes in the direction of government economic policy. That was the case in 1974-75, when the Labor Government increased public sector outlays as a be not counterbalance to rising unemployment. The international recession had evoked a similar response from the governments of most Western democracies, and I was glad that it evoked that response here in Australia. Normally, unless a major change in the level of government expenditure has occurred, extra appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) are largely off-set by shortfalls in expenditure estimates in the Budget. These expenditure shortfalls are the amounts the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) likes to refer to as savings. They are, of course, not savings in any conventional sense of the word. Any large enterprise which plans expenditure over a 12-month period will find that circumstances will prevent its plans from being realised in every detail. So too with governments. The shortfalls of expenditure in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) do not emerge for the most part as a result of improved management or greater work effort; they occur as a result of things not going as the Budget predicted. They also sometimes occur as a result of governments not honouring Budget commitments about expenditure to various groups. Also, they sometimes emerge, as all honourable members who have served on the Public Accounts Committee know, because of inefficient estimating. In the statement of savings issued by the Treasurer with the Bills we are debating, there are examples of shortfalls occurring for the first 2 reasons I mentioned. We will have to await the report of the Public Accounts Committee to ascertain whether or not the third reason is applicable here. Returning to the first 2 reasons, we see that it is expected that almost $216m less will be paid out of Consolidated Revenue to the Second Reading Health Insurance Fund established under the Health Insurance Act than was expected when the Budget was framed. I suspect that this so called saving has occurred because the Government did a better job of dismantling Medibank than it expected and that there are fewer people calling on the resources of the Health Insurance Fund. In this instance, the expenditure did not take the path expected by Appropriation Bill (No. 1). On page 32 of the statement of savings, we find in Division 308 of the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs an example of a saving made where a goverament has not honoured previous commitments. The so-called saving of $ 17.7m in the expenditure of the Australian Development Assistance Agency is effectively a cut of $ 17m in Australia's foreign aid. This cut sits rather strangely with the assurances of the  Australia's foreign aid would not be cut in a de facto fashion via government induced administrative constrictions. It is obvious from looking at the details that this cut in aid has occurred because the Australian Development Assistance Agency has been unable because of staff cutbacks to spend the money committed to it. Genuine savings in government expenditure which lead to greater efficiency are of course sought and welcomed by all parties, certainly by the Opposition Labor Party. A genuine saving occurs when the same service is provided to the same people for less cost or where it is discovered that benefits can be withdrawn from people who have no need of them. For example, if the reduction in the appropriation to the Health Insurance Fund had occurred because of less than anticipated usage of health services and if this did not result in a decline in health care standards, then a much needed saving would have emerged. I am somewhat sickened by Government members who claim great credit for saving taxpayers' money but do it simply by transferring the cost to the taxpayer in a disguised fashion. I doubt whether taxpayers who were saved the cost of the burden of Medibank regarded themselves as better off after they had paid private health insurance subscriptions. I have mentioned a number of sacrifices associated with the BUls before the House but in general I have left aspects of detaUs of spending to be taken up by my colleagues speaking in this debate. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), as extensions of the Budget as I said earlier, should be examined in the light of overall Budget strategy. The Budget is now 9 months old and it is possible to make a judgment as to its success or failure. This I will do later. Budget of 1976-77 was framed around large cuts in government expenditure and investment incentives to the business sector. The ultimate parameter used by the Government in its Budget construction was the deficit. This had to be cut at all costs. The reason for this was quite obvious. The Government when in Opposition had run a concentrated campaign of conjecture, half truth and downright Ues about the effects of the deficit being run by the Labor Government. This campaign, led by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), was the ultimate exercise in talking down the economy. It was an orchestrated appeal to fear, playing on the ignorance most people have of the technicalities of the way an economy functions. The Treasurer exaggerated for his own ends figures for the final deficit. The Prime Minister quaintly told everybody the country was broke and that everyone owed the Government $500. It is no wonder that when the Treasurer accuses others of talking down the economy it is impossible to take him seriously. It is little wonder that accusations of economic ignorance thrown by the Prime Minister at members of the Opposition conjure up pictures of the chap who lived in a glass house and threw stones. As part of its attack on the Labor Government the conservatives latched onto levels of government expenditure as a prime cause of domestic economic recession. It is pointless drawing to their attention that most of the realrisesin government expenditure were a reaction to rather than a cause of economic recession. In none of the of conservatives' discussion of Australia's economic performance in the years between 1972 and 1975 did the international recession play a major role. What nonsense this was. The Treasurer attempted to mislead us again yesterday during question time by suggesting that it was the Labor Government's policies which had caused the recession. I repeat: What nonsense this is. There was a world economic crisis during 1974 and 1975. This discussion of the past is, ofcourse, very relevant to the present because accurate gauging of causes of a problem are needed before any worthwhUe remedies may be prescribed. The economics editor of the Age newspaper, Mr Ken Davidson, provided us with a graphic illustration of the effects the world recession had on Western economies in a recent series of articles. During 1975 non-farm gross domestic product in 7 major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries fell by an average 1.3 per cent. In plain terms this means that all leading Western economies suffered a The severe recession in 1975. Australia also caught up in this recession but our performance under a Labor government, aided by positive use of government expenditure, was discernably better than most others. During 1975 Australia's nonfarm gross domestic product actually rose, granted by only .4 per cent. But it was a nse compared to the substantial average faU in the major OECD countries. At this stage I might point to other statistics put together by Mr Davidson which compare Australia's economic performance with the 7 major OECD countries, this time for periods following the Liberal and National Country Parties return to office. In 1976 non-farm gross domestic product in Australia rose by 4 per cent, in contrast the average for the 7 major OECD countries of 5.5 per cent. In the calendar year 1977 optimistic estimates place the real growth in Australia's non-farm GDP at about 3.2 per cent whereas the OECD estimates that the average figure for the 7 major countries will In short, Australia's growth performance compared more favourably with overseas experiences under Labor than it has under this Government. A simUar view emerges from a table of averence age annual percentage increases in industrial production put together from OECD data in the December bulletin of the Flinders Institute of Labour Studies. In the period 1972-75 Australia ranked fourth on a table of industrial production for 14 countries. We were ninth in the period 1964-68 and have faUen from fourth to eighth when the 6 months of this Government's policies are taken into account. I mention these facts cause too much of the economic debate in that Australia is clouded by ill-informed criticism Labor's economic performance. True, there were problems. But they were not predominantly of domestic origin. The international recession must be recognised for what influence it played. That was the major influence. Looked at in its true perspective, government expenditure under Labor was a workers fall major element in preventing a slide into much campaign to and deeper recession. Any dangers that rapidly increasing rates of government expenditure could be counter-productive by crowding out the private sector were removed through the trimthe ming which occurred in the 1975 Hayden Budon get. I mentioned earlier that this was an priate time to examine the Government's Budget strategy in the light of performance. In Budget Statement No. 2 a number of predictions are made for the year 1976-77 about movements national product, monitory conditions, the labour market and wages and prices. I would to examine these predictions at this stage. I will dealfirstlywith national product. farm GDP was expected to grow in real terms by about 4 per cent in 1976-77. In thefirsthalf thefinancialyear significantly less than half this growth had been achieved and statistics for 1977 give no indication of any improvement. In regard to the labour market, it was expected that ployment growth would be consistent with a gradual reduction in the rate of unemployment. No such thing has occurred. Unemployment January reached a post-war record of 354 589 people-5. 8 per cent of the work force. At the of March, 5.4 per cent of the work force was unemployed compared with 4.5 per cent a year earlier when Labor's policies were applied. No gradual reductions in unemployment had occurred; rather a substantial increase in unemploybe 4 per cent.ment had taken place. I turn to deal with prices and incomes. Both the consumer price index and average weekly earning were expected to increase by about 12 per cent in 1976-77 so the Budget told us. Experihas shown that the expectation for the CPI was little more than wishful thinking. During the first half of thefinancialyear the CPI rose by 8.2 per cent. Devaluation has insured that it wtil rise by around 7 per cent in thefirsthalf of 1977. This will give ariseapproaching 15 per cent for the year compared with a Budget prediction of 12 per cent. I say this in spite of the 2.3 per cent increase announced today as the increase in the beconsumer price index for the March quarter. All that 2.3 per cent depicts is that the effects of of devaluation are seeping into our economy because of very sluggish retail sales rather more slowly than was expected. Another reason for the 2.3 per cent increase, which I agree is less than was expected by the pundits, is food prices which increased by only 1.9 per cent compared with 5 per cent in the similar quarter last year. The the level of increase closer to in average weekly earnings may be 12 per cent as the Uving standards of the Government intensifies its for its own mistakes.wage and salary earners pay make Dramatic evidence of the adverse effect that policies of the Fraser Government are having the living standards of ordinary Australians approappeared in the December quarter national accounts released yesterday. These figures revealed that living standards in Australia fell by more than 4 per cent during 1976 due to actions in of the Fraser Government. The December quarter national income estimates show that, like seasonally adjusted, household disposable income rose by 12 per cent between December 1975 and December 1976. During the same Nonperiod, consumer prices increased by 14.4 per cent indicating a fall in real household disposof able income of 2.4 per cent. When a population growth of 1.5 per cent and the reductions in the social wage through reduced government spending are taken into account, real income per peremson fell by over 4 per cent during 1976. I move on to deal with monetary conditions. in The Budget assumptions were suggested to be consistent with a growth in the volume of money end broadly defined at between 10 per cent to 12 per cent. Devaluation has rendered this statement somewhat inoperative as the Treasurer has told us that devaluation would necessitate a revision in the estimate for money supply growth. Sigspite nificantly, no announcement as to what the revised target would be has been made. The take latest figures suggest that the money supply growing at a rate of about 12 per cent per annum. This implies a decline of approximately 4 per cent in the real level of money in circugiving lation. Such a decline has obvious ramifications for the economy, and especially for small businesses. That sector has been extremely hit by this Government's monetary policies. see large company profits rising swiftly while small business is starved of finance even for everyday needs. The overdraft is the source working capital for small business, and over the drafts are restricted. It is obvious from the broad resume I given that the 1976-77 Budget strategy is in tatsuggest ters and that the Budget is nowhere near on line. It would have been reasonable to expect the Government to realise the error of its ways and to take remedial action by means of these adproud ditional Appropriation Bills which we are debata ing today. The central problem with the ment's strategy has been its failure to use the public sector in its proper role. Leaving aside the folly of Medibank and devaluation, I say that Government's major move which has influence over the level of economic activity has been reduction in the real level of goverament outlays. The last quarterly national accounts indicated a newspaper: fall of some 8 per cent in goverament capital expenditure during the last 12 months. The effect recovery of that has been the slow down in activity, and it is obvious that that has happened. The major part of the rest of the world is enjoying some economic recovery. In keeping with that, ments have been cutting back the rate of increase in real government expenditure. Australia, the other hand, is still wallowing in recession. Government's answer is to cut back the real level of government outlays. We are completely out of step with the rest of the world. Significantly the Treasurer no longer bleats about international endorsement for the economic policies of his Government. News yesterday of the enormous increase in government outlays in France-th home of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-make s nonsense of the line that the Treasurer has been taking. In garbage fact, it would seem from first reports that much of the strategy advocated by Labor over the year has been adopted in the French GovernFears ment's latest moves. The Government is still preoccupied with its misconceptions about the deficit. It still rigidly adheres to a brand of stone age economics. In of cries from all sections of the community for the Liberal and National Country Parties to alternative action, they cling to theories and is philosophies which visited the Great Depression upon the world. The Government's approach to the economy is totally wrong. It has set about business incentives to expand and to invest but it has forgotten that there is not much good in asking business to produce goods if no hard one will buy them. The Government relied on We consumer spending for a short while and then it set about reducing that spending power by its actions in national wage cases. The Prime Minisof ter obviously does not understand the problems economy faces and has no ideas for remedies. The grasping of the wages and prices freeze was an act of sheer desperation. No one who underhave stands how an economy works could possibly such a plan without first working out the details-getting the necessary support from employers and employees. Let us hope that something can be salvaged from the chaos. But if a man, our Prime Minister, will not arrange national conference to prepare the necessary Governground work, nothing will happen. Since coming to power this Government has the tottered from one economic policy to another. The editorial of the 14 April edition of the the Australian Financial Review put those policies all together in one bundle. I quote from that Fraser's investment led recovery, the consumer led of last August's Budget, the devaluation strategy of last November, the wages and incomes freeze of April. They are put together in a bundle. Each of those strategies was virtually torpedoed by other governgovernment action. The Government seems intent on drawing up strategies and then taking on action to make sure that they do not work. In Its contrast, the Labor Opposition has been consistent in what it has proposed, and I shall come to that in a moment. At the present time the country is left without a plausible economic strategy. The Prime Minister still exhorts people to support his freeze, but that does not hide the lack of a real economic policy. The Australian Financial e Review of 15 April put it this way: Talk of a 'national effort' is all very fine but it is political when it is used to cover up for the lack of any coherent policy. past Conjecture is rife about the 1977-78 Budget. of credit squeezes plague small business. Nobody knows where the Government is going. The Opposition has consistently put forward a viable alternative approach to that being followed by the Government. That approach involves an initial widening of the deficit and a modest increase in the rate of growth of the money supply. Support for a strategy which involves the use of the deficit to bring about a higher level of economic activity and thus attack inflation from a stronger economic base comes from many areas. All Labor State Premiers, as well as the Victorian Liberal State Premier, have put forward proposals involving initial widening of the deficit. The Bank of New South Wales, which previously was one of the Government's strongest supporters, has noted that 'the Government seems to have achieved little perceptible headway in controlling inflation and reviving business confidence'. The Bank of New South Wales said also that policy changes should be made 'even though in the short term the deficit would be thereby increased'. Only on Tuesday Mr Rod Black, President of the Austrahan Wool and Meat Producers Federation, called for tax cuts and a selective increase in government expenditure. Editorial comment in the Canberra Times has expressed concern at the Government's obsession with deficit reduction. The comment is the same from all these sources within Australia. The story is the same abroad, if we look at what is happening in France, Japan and the United States, to mention just 3 countries. The story is the same abroad if we take note of the article in today's Wall Street Journal of New York in which the bankruptcy of the Australian Government's economic pohcy is pointed out. The deficit can responsibly be increased at this stage of our economic history. The rate of growth of the money supply can be increased. Once it is accepted that the deficit may be increased, half the battle is over. It then remains to obtain a maximum activity increase from a limited deficit increase. The clawback of the extra taxes from the extra income which comes from that extra activity immediately reduces the deficit. The Opposition believes that indirect tax and selective increases in government expendiovercome ture are preferable to cuts in direct taxes. tax cuts directly affect the cost structure and hence are compatible with the continuation orderly wagefixationwhich indexation affords. counter They also tend to produce a greater increase activity than does an equivalent cut in direct taxes. Government expenditure in areas such the building and construction industry would have a direct and immediate effect on employEducation ment. The way back is long and hard, but these measures would, in the short term, get us back on therightpath. Regrettably many of the Governseasonal, ment's concessions to business are not producing the desired effect. Consequently these should be scrapped to allow expenditure in more productive areas. For example, very few people ever conceived that the investment allowance should be available in conjunction with the stock valuation proposals. These funds are at the moment simply enlarging short term corporate profits. While not detracting from the importance of company profitability for new investment in new jobs, I suggest that the companies would be better off in the long term if government stimulated an increase in the aggregate level of demand. The same comment applies to what the Prime Minister had to say today in relation to the new mining ventures that have got off the ground. Any senior mining man in this country will say that it is not the investment allowances-thos e hand outs-whic h have closed other options and which have meant that these new ventures, which we all applaud, get going. That has not been the cause of the new investment. What has been the cause of new investment is the new markets which are created as a return from world economic activity. I believe that is why the Opposition regards many of these concessions, these allowances, as being too extravagant. It is not that we do not applaud some people getting some new concessions which might lead to new employment; it is a question of what the options are and what are better ways of doing things. The best way in which to get the economy moving in this country and to get people back to work is to stimulate consumer spending. As part of its alternative strategy the Opposition calls for a major expansion of manpower and retraining schemes. While those sorts of activities do have some short term benefits they are primarily designed to counter long term structural problems. There is a major difference here between attitudes of the Government and of the Opposition. Very little the Government has said or done suggests that it sees the basic struccuts tural problems in the economy which cannot be by macro policy initiatives. Indeed in Indirect one document tabled in the House by the Treasurer it was suggested that all recessions of were cyclical and could be overcome by normal cyclical policy. I point out that this is not in the view taken by experts in thefieldof employment and manpower studies. During discussion as at an experts meeting organised by the OECD Directorate for Social Affairs, Manpower and in Paris, unemployment due to several factors was distinguished. These factors were cyclical, physical, social and mental disabilities, frictional and structural. It is obvious that a government that is incorrectly distinguishing causes of problems will be inept at providing solutions. The Opposition, unlike the Government, has discerned many of the real problems facing the economy and has viable plans to combat them. Accordingly, I intend to move an amendment on behalf of the Opposition. Before doing so I want to summarise the points that I have been making. The Government came to power with its ideology of mutilating and reducing the public sector. That was a totally wrong ideology which would lead to totally wrong economic policies at any time, particularly at this stage of Australia's economic history. The lack of government spending meant a lack of jobs in the pubhc and private sectors because of contracts the public sector has with the private sector. But more than anything it meant a lack of confidence and a lack of consumer spending which are so vitally required. From that bad start the Government has ricochetted from one bad decision to another, so much so, of course, that not only is there a lack of confidence at home but there is also a lack of confidence abroad which leads to an outflow of funds and the disastrous devaluation decision which, as I mentioned earlier, was commented upon in the Wall Street Journal. All of this has led to another grasping for straws in the so-called wages and prices freeze. This is not a substitute for hard economic policies. What the Opposition is putting forward is a viable alternative strategy. We believe that there ought to be cuts in indirect taxes to stimulate conences sumer spending. We believe there ought to be more government spending, particularly in the construction area and in local initiative programs. We believe also there ought to be government spending in manpower programs because we are short of skilled workers. We beheve that this spending and cuts in indirect taxes can be done without exacerbating inflation. We point in particular to the fact that our extra expenditure and our loss in revenue would befinancedby phasing out some of the more extravagant handouts to the business sector which have not produced results, however pleasant they may be for those receiving them. We cannot get an investment led recovery because the business sector has not produced results. Therefore assistance to this sector ought to be substituted grams which will produce results. The other way offindingfunds is by a modest increase in the money supply which will not be inflationary as long as that increase is not greater than the rate of inflation plus the rate of growth. We also believe that at least $500m would be available by a more vigorous selling of government bonds, a more vigorous funding of the deficit. The time available to me has almost concluded. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not denying the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that (a) the slashing of government spending is part of an inept economic strategy which has led to a decline in the standard of living of all Australians and (b) there is an urgent need for alternative policies of promoting a consumer led recovery by cuts in indirect taxes and appropriate stimulatory expenditure on job Creadon and manpower training programs, all done in a context of not increasing inflation by (i) phasing out the more extravagant business tax concessions, (ii) increasing the money supply but not beyond the rate of inflation plus growth and (iii) instituting a more vigorous bond-selling program'.",41
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GENERAL BUSINESS, Is the amendment seconded? Mr Keith Johnson- I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,46
98,Mr MOORE,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I listened with interest to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) put forward the Opposition's views on the economy. As I listened it became very apparent that the Opposition has learned nothing from its 3 years in Government. It would continue to expand the Government deficit. It would continue to spend largely in the government sector. It would continue to push along into the area of a wages spiral. I would have hoped it might have learned something after its experiduring its 3 years in office in which the consumer price index rose from 4 per cent to 15 per cent or 16 per cent, in which unemployment rose from 100 000 people in roundfiguresto 300 000 and in which there was a lack of business confidence. But I note from the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review-this is the publication quoted by the honourable member-the following comment was made: The Labor Party is lacking in its duty to shape up as an Opposition because it is not really interested in the country's economic problems. The ALP is presently consumed by a leadership struggle between Mr Whidam and Mr Hayden. As I listened to the honourable member for Adelaide, the Opposition spokesman on economic affairs, I assumed that he had counted himself out of that struggle, but was thinking of writby pro- ing himself back into it. The problems facing Australia are great. I wtil not shirk conceding that point. Infiation creates a very great problem. Unless it is brought under control the whole structure and fibre of the nation will collapse. I am very heartened by the quarterly CPIfigureswhich were released today. The 2.3 per cent increase is a remarkable achievement particularly in view of the pressures brought about by increased import costs and the other pressures that are around at the present time. I would like to congratulate the Government on its performance in this area. This achievement points to the fact that there is some basic underlying confidence that we sometimes fail to see in some areas. I am concerned about the level of unemployment, which is too high. I am particularly concerned about the very high percentage of unemployed youth. I believe this is an area at which the Government will have to look in the future because we cannot afford to have the youth of the nation unemployed. The social problems that flow from unemployment are quite enormous. I am sure something wtil be done in the future to alleviate this problem. I would like to pay particular attention to some of the problems which face the Government in framing the 1977-78 Budget. I believe there are a number of areas in which there is certainly confusion and uncertainty. I think the Government should have in mind that the Budget should be a light on the hill for people to see. People should be able to see which way taxation reforms will flow. They should be able to see which way they can expect interest rates to develop. By framing the Budget in this way the people wtil be able to take a positive step in the areas of personal exertion, personal investment and personal initiative. There is no doubt that some of the sacred cows of Australia will have to be pruned. We cannot afford to continue a number of programs without a significant lift in taxation, which no one wants, or a very extensive lift in the deficit. It might all very well for the Opposition spokesman on the economy to say that all we have to do is aggressively to sell bonds. Our record in this area to date has not been too good. I shall refer to this matter later in my speech. But while we are pruning expenditures, which were allowed to blossom at an enormous rate during 1972-75 we will need to look at the question of flexibility in certain areas. As programs are cut and as expenditure and outlays are cut the impact does not fall evenly across the nation. It will be necessary to look in terms of special relief in special areas. I hope that some notice can be taken of these problems when the Budget is framed. In every Budget. I think that too little attention is given the question of income. We always speak in terms of expenditure and later say: 'Where do we find the income.' The Government has already given concessions in the area of tax indexation, investment allowances and stock adjustment. These are very significant giveaways in terms of Government income. The amount of money in one particular full year could well be approaching $2,000m. This giveaway or concession will, in my view, naturally inhibit the ability of the Government to give personal income tax concessions on a large scale. I very much doubt that taxation concessions would win wage concessions in the current climate and under the current leadership of the trade unions. I hope that people wtil recognise the contribution made by the Government in the area of taxation. It is worth drawing one small parallel that if these concessions had not been given- I think that in no small way they have had an impact on economic activity in Australia-the amount of personal income tax could be withdrawn significantly. I refer to the question of the deficit because it is this area around which so many of the arguments revolve. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide, was very emphatic that this area should be expanded to allow the Government to encroach further into the area of the private sector, to bid away resources and to give out largesse on a large scale. How do we fund the deficit and what is the impact of it? In funding the deficit on an internal basis in Australia the greatest impact falls in the area of interest rates. It is the area of interest rates which I believe has the greatest impact on economic activity, an impact far greater than personal taxation. Quite clearly, we are caught in a bind. To support high levels of deficit, one must go out of the market place and bid for money. When one bids for money, one is forcing up interest rates. I think the honourable member for Melbourne be Ports (Mr Crean) would know that only too well. The Government will have to pay marked attention to the area of interest rates if it is to promote consumer spending. There is no doubt that if high levels of interest rates are pursued, this will encourage people to save and not spend. High levels of deficit create uncertainty and do the same in terms of consumer spending. I urge the Government, when it approaches the question of funding the deficit, to be particularly cautious not to push the rates higher than it absolutely has to. Indeed, I hope that they would not go above current levels. What can the Government do in order to sell to bonds in Australia? What is the history of it? The Government has only 2 options. It can set out to make bonds more attractive for people to buythat is a fact of prices and interest rates-or it can force subscriptions. It is as simple as that. I am philosophically attracted to market forces. Therefore, I would like to look at some of the ways in which the deficit can be funded in Australia. In the 1950s most investment portfolios held by individuals had a 20 per cent to 25 per cent component of Government bonds. Today there would be very few private investors who hold any significant amounts of money in Government securities. Why is this? It is because over the last 20 years almost invariably everyone who has invested in Government securities has lost money through the rate of inflation. As tion went up, interest rates went up. As interest rates went up, the value of the assets held went down. Until this trend is reversed and interest rates are reduced theflowof money to assets will stay in liquid form. In this time, Government securiand ties nave been very unpopular. At the same time Australia has estabUshed a money market in such which there are 9 operators who hold approthat ximately $ 1,000m to $ 1,200m in Government curities. But this is a very haphazard operation. The secondary market in Government securities is remarkably poor; indeed, it is a disgrace. hope that one way in which the Government curity market could be made more attractive and would be to have a look at this market. It might be that there ought to be a committee of inquiry to investigate ways in which the money market Australia can be made a more effective working organisation. I think many of the operators that area would welcome it. In Canada, the get United States and Great Britain a very conscious effort is made to make the market an attractive place. Governments, banks, reserve banks and central banks in those countries do this for particular reason that they know that if they a viable market they can go to it at any stage raise significant amounts of money to fund their deficits or to fund particular programs that come along from time to time. In Australia there are 3 basic forms of securisecurities, ties-Treasur y notes, savings bonds and Comcoupon, monwealth bonds. These have limited appeal. I think that if more are to be sold the Government must look at some new alternatives in this area to enable it to attract the money that it will need fund the deficit. The honourable member for investment. Adelaide wiU need a very big load of alternatives to do this. Firstiy, the Government might well give consideration to lifting the limit on the amount of money that can be subscribed to saving. ings bonds. Currently, it is $100,000. Secondly, would like to pursue the argument of indexed bonds. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) put forward a case not long that the Government should accept indexation bonds as one of the ways in which significant amounts of money can be obtained from the non-bank sector. I wtil try, as hard as I can, to put that argument to one side. Firstly, the acceptance of an indexed bond is an admission of defeat by inflation. Secondly, it would create in itself a rush of all other securities to an indexed position. I have seen indexation of wages; I have seen indexation of taxes and I have seen indexation of various social security payments. I am bound to inflasay that I have grave reservations about their workings, on all fronts. In the area of taxation, it has always been my view that the Government should set a rate and Uve by it, that the indexation of taxation is, in itself, a way in which one can put it to one side say that it just comes automatically. In the long run, a series of indexations wtil result in distortions in whatever is being dealt with it will become an unmanageable propseosition. From a selling point of view, indexed bonds will create an enormous distortion. It is my experience that the person who wants to place I money on fixed deposit wants to know 2 things. seHe wants to know whether the money is secure what return he will get. In this circumstance, he wtil get the same security but the interest rate he wiU receive will be a matter of how the econin omy performs. Those who buy fixed deposits at a falling rate-if one accepts that one day there wtil in be a negative consumer price index-migh t well a nasty shock. The history of indexed securities-and they are not new throughout the world-ha s never been a happy one. I hope that we will never come to that situation in Australia. the The third form, which I think has considerable have merit, is the reintroduction of a tax free or and rebatable bond. This would have an enormous appeal to those who have not found a successful investment opportunity in the last three or five years. It would be an opportunity in which significant reductions could be made in the cost of by way of a 5 per cent or 6 per cent which would allow the Government not to put the pressures on to the interest rates about which I spoke before, but to mop up as much excess cash as possible of that held in some of the to corporations and some of the areas of individual Care would have to be taken in the framing of this area to avoid the old technique of tax washI think this can be done. It was demonstrated I before that it could be done and there is no reason to believe that it cannot be carried out again. Any introduction of an instrument which ago would have the power of sale that this would of have, would need to be introduced with care. If there is a rapid subscription to it from areas which normally put their money in housing societies or savings banks one would have to watch the consequences of that as they occurred. The fourth form would be to introduce a form of bond option. It is an area which I have not seen used but it has been used successfully by stock exchanges in some areas to promote sales and interest in various securities. I believe the only way in which the Government will be able to sell Government securities is to get out, brush up the image of the stock and make it more attractive, saleable and realistic in terms of its approach to the market. I said at the beginning that the alternative is to force subscription to government securities. I have no great liking for that style of approach. But we already have a 30-20 rule and it would not be particularly difficult to make that a 40-20 ratio and to embrace the fringe banks and other institutions. As I said before, it is a policy in which I do not believe because I think the market forces would be a far better method of handling the problem of funding the deficit. It is vital that we understand and look at ways that we go about meeting the problem. The consequences to interest rates are enormous. Unless we get interest rates and taxation down we will never inspire consumer confidence to get consumer spending going at the level which we will require ultimately to break the wages and prices spiral. I believe that this can be done only through a vast lift in productivity and that can be achieved really only by a significant improvement in consumer spending. Overseas borrowings on a large scale which may be necessary can be achieved. I hope that people will not shrink from big numbers when they talk of borrowing from overseas. Let us look to the future. I believe that there is a basic belief in the Australian community that the economy will come right. Australia has too many great resources for the economy to do anything else. These resources have enabled this country to come through many crises in the past. We have resources-energ y and power resources-whic h will stand Australia in good stead in the future. But unless we have a strong short-term resolve to reduce the deficit we will never get properly on this course. The Government must clearly state its policy and stand by it. It is no time for vacillation or for double approaches to various items or policies of economic strategy. If these goals are achieved 1978 should see a significant upturn in the Australian economy.",46
99,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,GENERAL BUSINESS,"It was my privilege to second the amendment that was moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). I now have the honour to speak to that amendment which proposes to omit from the original motion before the House all words after 'that' and in their place substitute a recipe for a solution to the economic ills of Australia-if not a recipe in full, certainly something more substantial than the Government has been able to provide for this House since it came to office in 1975. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) identified 2 problems early in his speech-inflatio n and unemployment. In the whole 20 minutes during which he addressed the House regrettably he gave no hope of there being any solution to either of these problems coming from the Government benches. He plagiarised a phrase. He mentioned the 'light on the hill'. I remember that a person who hadgreat skills indeed in the management of the economy of Australia used exactly the same phrase except that he meant it and he worked toward it and he achieved his objective. In talking of light, whether it be on the hill or anywhere else, I remind the House that in the glare of the spotlight in December 1975 the Australian people were asked to turn on the lights. That meant they should elect the Liberal Party, the conservatives, to government in this House. The people did. But from that time on it seems that the conservative Government of Australia has blown a fuse and Australia has been plunged into darkness. In fact all that was ever offered to the people was a lighted candle. The honourable member for Moore spoke about this Government's generosity in terms of the $2,000m that the Government forgoes or ploughs back into the community. He broke that up into 3 areas: Tax indexation, the investment allowance and stock adjustment. He made a veUed reference to wages which rather alluded me. Two of the areas he mentioned, and one to some extent, give benefit exclusively to industry, not to people who earn salaries and wages at all. People who earn salaries and wages do not get an investment allowance; nor do they get a stock adjustment. They may get some benefit from tax indexation, but that is rather doubtful. So this $2,000m that is ploughed back into the community cannot have an effect on wages; what it could have an effect on is prices. If so, how does the honourable member explain that the consumer price index is continuing to rise degrees quarter by quarter? As I said, there is some doubt as to whether tax indexation would affect the average person in the community. I found that there is another member of this House who agrees with that view, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), who, writing in April issue of Quadrant, the latest issue, stated: The average middle-income earner is probably taking home a slightly smaller proportion of his pay than Whitlam. Later in the article he wrote: And on top of it all, when tax has never been higher, berra keeps insisting that it has handed out a $ 1,000m through tax indexation to the inflation-hit taxpayer. to convince anyone that they have had a tax cut pay packets tell them clearly collected this year are rising at a faster rate than wages. That was written by a Government supporter, the honourable member for Macarthur. These towards are his words. He went on in his article to state: Treasurer'these But notwithstanding its unswerving adherence book orthodoxy, the harsh fact runs on the board. In 1976 the actual rate of inflation per cent has turned out to be marginally greater 1975. I remind the nation that Labor was in governister ment in 1975. The article continues: The Government is reluctant to face up to this unpleasant reaUty; it keeps harping on the underlying rate of comparing it favourably with the rate under the Government. Even from the standpoint of political scoring, this is to make a foolish mistake. The Australian people are not concerned with they are interested only in results. All they are about is the horrifying figure of 6 per cent for the ter- a higher figure than in any quaner since the inflation of the early 1950s. The Government should about politics. It should be on the future, instead of harking back to the past. The honourable gentleman also has other wise sidering, words to say on the subject. In the same article he Appropriation stated: The 6 per cent is frightening not only in itself it ponends. Some estimates suggest that for the three quarters to June this year prices could rise by cent in the absence of any wage increases at all. This could spell desperate trouble for the during the end of 1977. It would certainly spell desperate trouble for the economy: among other things, the near tainty of another devaluation, and thus a further push inflation. . . . If the Government has, on the whole, acted wisely and courageously, why has it failed policy objective, a slowing down of inflation? Its plans have clearly been upset by the reconstruction of Medibank and will soon be further frustrated by the November devaluation. The honourable member goes on: . . . in retrospect the changes to Medibank must be adjudged a serious blunder. The restructuring of Health Insurance should clearly have waited until inflation was on the way to being defeated and until the economy was back on the highway of growth. The Government was overambitious; it should have devoted all of its energies to the immediate and vital tasks. Medibank could have waited; it was not an urgent priority. It seems to me that, in that article, the honourable member for Macarthur put very succinctly the the philosophy of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of this country. The Prime Minister has led along those who support him in this under place because of the overwhelming majority that he received in this place, not on votes, in the last general election. A number of his supporters are Cannow in such a deUcate position that one of these tax cut days they will have to make a decision as to It is hard whether they can win an election with him or when their without him. The Prime Minister wtil have to that income taxes and levies face up to that problem. The Prime Minister's whole philosophy matters is reflected in the s legislation which we are debating to textthis afternoon. The Government generally remains that it has not put the at 14.5 adopts a confrontation approach towards probthan in lems. Those people who sit opposite never wish to conciliate. Since taking office, the Prime Minhas pursued the trade unions of this country and blamed them for the country's ills. For the first 12 months he blamed the 3 years of Labor inflation, Government. When that argument started to Labor wear thin with the electors he thought he would pointpick on the trade union movement. In his endeavours in this field, he did what he has done in fine statistical technicaUties; worrying so many other fields; he does not remember last quarthose undertakings that he made to the people of Korean Australia prior to December 1975. At that time forget he quite clearly told the people that there would concentrating its entire energies be no attack on Medibank. Yet one document that accompanies the Estimates we are now conStatement of Savings Expected in which refers to Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1976-77 and Appropriation Act (No. 2) but for what 1976-77 and which I believe to be one of the some 14 per most scurrilous documents I have ever read states, for example, that the estimated savings in Government the national health area amount to $232,362,000. The Government is trying to concervince this House and the nation that it is saving to that money. It is trying to convince us that it is in our best interests that it does so. to achieveresultsin its major I return briefly to the item I mentioned before - tax . I pointed out that the honourable member for Ryan showed us quite clearly that all of the $2,000m that he claimed the Government was ploughing back into the community was in fact going to one section, namely, business and industry. It did not go into the pockets of the Australian people. I have just read to the House extracts from an article by the honourable member for Macarthur which points out quite clearly that the average taxpayer in Australia is now paying more tax, despite tax indexation and other proposals, than he was paying 2 years ago when there was a Labor Government. Surely it has now been established in the minds of all Ausand trahan people that there has been no tax relief the average Austrahan taxpayer. We find that, with no tax nificant reduction in services. In the case of tion pensioners, migrants, health, as I have already mentioned, that reducmembers tion in services amounts to over $232m. What is really going on? Something that I find great was difficulty in understanding is how the average saving of person is still paying as much tax now as he ever the Australian paid but is receiving less service for it from Government. What is happening to the difference? I have a rough idea: It is going into the pockets of the friends of the Governmentthat is, the wealthy friends of the Government, tralian whofinancedthis Government's return to office. They are now looking for their quidpro quo. That was is where the difference is going. Every departister ment has suffered a reduction in the amount lowed for salaries and wages. There has been no of reduction in the payment of salaries to officers; traUan people are just being pushed out of the Public the trade union Service by the man leading this Government who suffers from some sort of paranoia in this respect; he thinks he is running his farm instead unionists of the nation. The Department of Health is one of those areas for which the Government claims the larand gest reduction in expenditure. The next largest the Department of Defence. Almost $68m been lopped off that Department's approprioffered ation. Apparently we will not be buying a couple of battleships this year. Almost $ 12m-in $ll,924,000-has been pruned from the allomodated cation for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Amost all of that amount consists of the saving of $10,870,000 out of the $40m appropriated for the National Employto the community. ment and Training Scheme. In other words, 25 per cent of the appropriation is expected to be saved on the National Employment and TrainAustralia ing scheme. This action probably has something to do with the fact that the Labor Government introduced that scheme and therefore it is now socially acceptable. The purpose of the scheme is: For expenditure on allowances and other expenses for purpose of employment training and re-training (including the training and re-training of widow and repatriation sioners, migrants, Aborigines, and ex-members of Defence Force) to meet the needs of the labour market. If it is fair enough to say that the labour market has been destroyed and no longer exists, why should we re-train people? If we study a list those people whom these funds were to assist, find that the Government is living up to its repuwas tation of bashing those who cannot fight back who do not have the resources to fight back. to I shall enumerate them again: Widows-and the Government is very good at bashing widows and relief, there is a sigonlywidows the mite; it has a reputation for that not in Australia but around the world-repatria Aborigines and exofthe Defence force. Nearly $ 11 m that set aside to be spent on re-training these people is now being pruned. This represents a $1 lm worth of service to a section of community which is not going to the be delivered. I cannot see how the Government can have any pride in this document. Another area which wiU be pruned is the AusTrade Union Training Authority which set up by the Labor Government under MinClyde Cameron when Minister for Labour aland Immigration. It was thefirstsuch Authority its kind in Australia. For thefirsttime the AusParliament and through it, the Australian community, recognised the need to extend into area the specialist training that occurs in the community. For thefirsttime trade were to be recognised as a responsible and an integral part of the Australian community and all the things it stands for and the Australian economy. Like doctors, lawyers and architects any other professional person in Australia, is they were to be trained at community expense. has The then Opposition, the now Government, no opposition to the passage of that legislation. It expressed the wish to have 2 amendfact ments included in the Bill and it was accomby the then Labor government. The legislation was lauded at the time. It was held by the then Opposition, the present Government, to be something which would certainly be of value The people involved in trade union training in are among the most respectable and the most responsible people in our whole community. But what happened quite recently? The not members of the Australian Council for Trade Union Training received a telex from the responsible Minister telling them that there was to be an the inquiry into the activities and affairs of the Trade Union Training Authority. There was no consulpentation with them. Even the President of the Austhe tralian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, was not consulted. He was told that there would be an inquiry. He was then consulted about the terms of reference. Some notice was taken of his of comments on the terms of reference. But the we Council itself was not consulted at any time. It told that there would be an inquiry into its activities as if it was a Mafia-like group in the community that had to be inquired into by the police. I am not suggesting that it is wrong to hold amendment inquiries into the activities and affairs of statuwill tory bodies. I am suggesting ment has again demonstrated its intention, bethis time to to the cause of the Council's trade union base, to smash it and to do it in such a subtle way. The GovernAustraUa ment has not seenfitto have such an inquiry Trans-Australia Airlines or any other statutory authority. It seems to me to be an act of gross courtesy for the directors of the Council not to at least consulted on the matter before they received a telex that was issued at the same time as advertisements appeared in the newspapers that there would be an inquiry. The whole attitude of this Government is one of seeking confrontation with the trade union movement. Honourable members opposite stand up in this House and speak about the irresponsibility of the people who are elected by the members of their union to manage the affairs of their union and to formulate the policy of their union. It is absolutely downright misleading to regard those people as being irresponsible. It is easy stand up in this chamber when there is a petrol strike in Victoria and call such unionists mainof land gangsters. It is easy when the air traffic trollers are on strike to say that those people holding the nation to ransom. It is a darned sight harder to convince honourable members opjaundiced posite that there are 100 reasons a week, 1000 reasons in a short space of time and perhaps million reasons a year why men should legitfollowers imately withdraw their labour but they do not so. Therefore responsibility does exist in this and there is not the irresponsibility talked of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm ing Fraser), who has a paranoic hatred of unions. And why should he not have a paranoic hatred? He is a farmer, he is an employer, and he has always regarded the people who work for him as being paid much more than they are worth. It is years ago. the nature of the person. He is trying to run this country as he runs his farm. Not since Adam necessary Smith has anybody tried to apply that sort philosophy to any civilised country. Mr Martyr-You have never read Adam each Smith.",49
100,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I have no reason to read Adam Smith. My time has almost expired. The reason I have no reason for reading Adam Smith is because Adam Smith can give no dom to the world today. There are much more enlightened philosophies around. Honourable members opposite are welcome to read Adam do Smith, but I would invite them to read something more enlightening and something more in tune with contemporary Australia. I commend the to the motion. I trust that the House that the Governseems to me wisdom see the of it and agree with it. It offer the only practical solution at 2 problems that confront and that are a serious threat to us. into Mr MCVEIGH (Darling Downs) (3.29)-The National Country Party of Australia wholedisheartedly and completely supports Appropribe ation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and rejects the amendment moved by the Opposition. These Appropriation BUls are blueprints of the plans of the Government to restore and to maintain economic sanity in this country. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) grasped the nettle in his second reading speech and called all Australians to arms to do battle against inflation and unemployment. The additional appropriations reS iested total $326.073m, which is well down on e sum of $ 1,240.941m sought in 1974-75. Quite obviously the Treasurer is a good housekeeper. That was confirmed by the announceto ment earlier today of a 2.3 per cent increase in the consumer price index for the March quarter this year, which represents the lowest increase conin a March quarter since 1973.1 would suggest to are the shadow Treasurer-h e could be more aptly called the phantom Treasurer-that he open his eyes, co-operate and become part of the success towards which this country is now one headed and that he not isolate himself and his and be called a saboteur of confidence do in this country. Anyone who disagrees with the area intent and message of the BUls is not only misby leading the mood of the pubUc but also exhibita rather naive enthusiasm for destroying a quality of life of Australians that is based on the legend of heroism and loyalty created by our pioneers and brought to the notice of the world one cold, dun grey morning at Gallipoli some 62 The Treasurer is dispensing the medicine to revitalise Australia. That medicine is of the pruning of government spending and, in answer to the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson), the obtaining of better value for dollar spent as well as the urging of all Australians that the best cure for our ills is productive work. At the risk of repeating famous words of one of the present Ministers of the Crown, there is nothing wrong with Australia wisthat work will not cure. Too much of our resources are being spent on propping up inefficient industries and encouraging people to their thing, like trade unions colleges teaching young insurgents how to strike while the taxpayer picks up the bill. We need a return to the work syndrome and the retention of jobs in Australia for Austrahan people and not the exporting of them from this country to Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong or the Philippines, otherwise the alternative is sheer social corrosion, which history shows is the classical perilous effect of the lack of the will to work. One regrets the happenings of recent days in one respect but is proud in another. We as Australians- I realise that that isolates the Opposition-breathe d easUy at the display of nauonal confidence and national self respect which prompted the release of the text for a wage-price freeze by the 7 heads of government on 13 April. That was a reasoned approach for co-operation and consensus in the battle against inflation. It relied for its success on a groundswell of public support and confidence. I believe that this initiative of the 7 heads of government is deeply respected by the electorate. The trade umon movement has tried to wreck the plan and has placed this spark of hope in grave jeopardy. Bob Hawke, as is his usual custom, has engaged in an exercise of industrial bullying. The union intransigence to accept the spirit of the plan is based not upon fact or concern but upon an insatiable ambition to clobber our economy to death. Anyone who ever held the leader of the trade union movement in esteem must now have a downward revision of his priorities. No wonder- I direct these remarks to the honourable member for Burke-h e is not consulted about anything; he is told. That is what one has to do with him. One must also severely castigate those Premiers who gave a gUmmer of statesmanship when removed from pressure and public scrutiny but who, when confronted by the noisy, irresponsible element in society, had an attack of cold feet and became dithering doves. It is noticeable that they were Labor Premiers. Their action has been a salutary lesson that in critical situations the union movement is the Opposition in Australia. I am reminded by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) stated this in Gladstone recently. For once the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is right. But what a scathing indictment of the people who sit behind him and who elected him to the position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He does not believe they are the real Opposition. He beUeves that the trade union movement is. Many of them wtil no doubt believe he is simply just not plausible. The heads of state threw out a challenge in a direct test of the people's wtil. Inflation in the final analysis wtil only be beaten not by governments alone but by the combined efforts of governments-Federal , State and local-and a reawakening of the Australian conscience. These Appropriation Bills contain allowances for wage and salary increases following decisions of the court. It is worth recording that the Commonwealth Government will have cut down numbers in the Public Service by 14 000 by June this year, whtie State governments and local government have increased their numbers by 3.3 per cent. One can offer the comment that it is a pity that othertiersof government have not exercised expenditure restraint as the national government has. Let us recount and record the philosophy of the Australian Labor Party in expenditure. In 1974-75 outlays rose by a mammoth 46 per cent in a single year and the deficit rose from $293m in 1973-74 to $2,600m, almost a ninefold increase. Unemployment trebled. Again taking up the point made by the honourable member for Burke, I say to him: Members of your Government, now the Opposition, were the employer assassins in Australia. Average earnings rose by 22 per cent, whtie gross domestic product did not. The consumer price index rose by 17 per cent. In the last quarter for which Labor was responsible it rose by 5.6 per cent. As I stated, the March quarterfigurereleased this morning was 2.3 per cent. Remember Mr Whitlam's overseas tour at the time of the Darwin disaster. It was for 35 days at a cost of $497,559 for his personal party, excluding public servants. It is appropriate to recall this in the debate on a Bill which includes a provision for the Northern Territory Home Finance Trustee for on-lending under the post-cyclone concessional home loan scheme. The Treasurer has been able both to restrain expenditure and to give taxation relief. The average Australian income earner will benefit from an income tax cut of approximately $4.50 per trade week from 1 July this year. The honourable member for Burke said taxation would increase. I suggest that he do his homework and talk to the people he represents. The reduction will come through automatic indexation of taxation, which in essence will return to the worker or salary earner the amount of extra tax he has had to pay over the past year because of inflation. Quite obviously the benefits of tax indexation, together with increased family allowances, mean that it is quite reasonable to ask for some wage restraint. In July next a person with a wife and 2 chUdren and on the average national wage would be paying $9 a week or $468 a year less in tax than 12 months ago. The honourable member for Burke does not beheve that is a reduction in income tax. Mr Keith Johnson- I do not. I do not beheve it will happen.",52
101,Mr MCVEIGH,GENERAL BUSINESS,"It already has happened. Without tax indexation, an initiative of the Fraser-Anthony coalition, the people of Australia would have paid one-third more in personal tax.",54
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GENERAL BUSINESS, Order! The level of conversation is a trifle too high. Mr Keith Johnson-He is being provocative.,54
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I know he is being provocative. That is why I did not call the honourable member for Burke to order a little while ago. It would help if the honourable member for Darling Downs addressed himself through the Chair. Even if he is referring to the honourable member for Burke, he can do it indirectly.",54
104,Mr MCVEIGH,GENERAL BUSINESS,"The revenue forgone by the Government through personal tax indexation is estimated to be $990m thisfinancialyear and $ 1,050m in a full year. This is a meaningful ation relief, and I know that the wives of workers will be grateful for the extra take home money the pay packet. It will at least help ease the trol difficult and annoying experience of going to the shopping place and food markets and facing a ceaseless battery of increasing prices and nonbility availability of goods because some bloke or other is on strike over something about which he does not know anything. Her budget is always stretched to the Umit. How much better be if prices in shops remained stable, but the demands for more and more wages and better ditions for doing less and less have blown this concept through the ceiling and made it an impossible dream. Our taxation pohcy is therelandholders fore decisive and direct. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) deals with the partment of Transport and the aUocation of $7,514,000 for a variety of most essential serfree vices, including local government services. government for too long has been the meat in sandwich of government in this country. State governments, which have the responsibUity for local government, have adopted the poUcy of percolating among the people that the blame rests with the Commonwealth Government as it period is the body responsible for using the financial pruning shears on local government. This attiprovided tude must be corrected. Under federation the States are entitled to 33.6 per cent of the Commonwealth's personal income tax collections, excluding any special surcharges or rebates. However the States, if they want to fund every suggested program, may raise their own taxes; but they do not appear to be very susceptible to federalism because it will bring accountability to them. They will have no one to blame except themselves. They are not game to stand up and be counted under this proposition. Local government now has an entitlement to an annual share of personal taxation. This year local government has been granted $140m, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year under the disastrous Hayden Budget. State overnment Loan Council programs wtil total 1,356m, an increase of 5 per cent on 1975-76.1 want to record thesefiguresand facts because of certain statements made by the Minister for Local Government and Main Roads in Queensland, the Honourable R. Hinze, whose recent utterances have confused the issue. They need to be corrected. The above facts indicate that there is no substance in his remarks. For the first time local government authorities, through the States grants commissions, wtil have taxfunds allocated to them on a per capita and needs basis. There are no special guidelines for in the allocation of funds, no Commonwealth conor direction. It is up to the States to work out their own priorities. That is their privilege and responsibUity. Local government has the responsifor more than 83 per cent of the nation's road system. Despite its restricted revenue raising capacities, it has continued to provide almost one-third of all funds spent on constructing and it would maintaining Australia's roads. conSomething has to be done to ease the burden of ratepayers. For too long they have shouldered the burden of shirefinances.Those who are not but who use the council faciUties and amenities and who earn income and pay taxes should play their part in local government Definances. Some of the taxation should be earmarked for direct payment to local government of bureaucratic intervention from the States. Local Local government must have direct access to the national funding as aright,not a privilege. Our road system needs developing and upgrading. It has been estimated that there will have to be an outlay of $5,900m over a 5-year to avert a real crisis in the national roads system. The Commonwealth Government has this year $38.3m for roads over and above the level provided last year. I hope the States will not use this as an excuse for withdrawing funds from thefield.We have appropriated $475m for 1977-78, with startling increases in certain areas such as 81 per cent for urban local roads and 39 per cent for rural local roads. Perhaps if the honourable R. Hinze stripped his outburst of condemnation of all its huff and puff and he stopped to think and analyse, he could channel his enthusiasm for his portfolio into suading the Treasurer of Queensland to spend the extra $ 19m windfall that he recently received without any fanfare from the Federal Treasury on roads and bridges. That is a real test of his abUity and factual presentation. It gives me no great pleasure to have inscribed in Hansard the facts of the situation to rebut the ill-founded and mischievous statements of the Queensland Mmister. What he said at Murgon recently, as reported in the newspapers, is just not the truth. There has been an increase in funds from the Commonwealth, and if local government in Queensland is being suffocated it is the fault of the Queensland Minister. If he corrects his mistakes he will at least be bringing good tidings. The real facts, not the Hinze dreams, need be recorded. The Commonwealth grant for and increasing. Queensland rural local roads for 1977-78 is $ 18.8m, an increase of 33 per cent over the amount provided in 1976-77. The Honourable R. Hinze, the Queensland Minister, assumes the increased grant for rural local roads includes aUowance for works on roads which were preresources. viously beef roads. That is simply not so. The total allowance for works on beef roads was included in the 1976-77 grant for rural arterial roads. A total of $20.9m was provided for rural arterial roads in 1976-77, $9m of which was beef roads. The grant for rural arterial roads 1977-78 is $23m, an increase of almost cent over the $11.9m provided in 1976-77. Grants for rural local and rural arterial and a provision for beef roads within those 2 expired. categories have been increased by more than 20 per cent in 1977-78 over those for last year. Therefore, irrespective of which category beef roads money comes from, rural Queensland be 20 per cent better off next year so far as money for roads is concerned than they were this year. The bulk of money for rural local and rural arterial roads goes to local government for expenditure on their programs. Therefore, rural local government in Queensland will benefit about the same percentage. So far as urban counformer cUs are concerned, urban local road moneys have been increased by 72.2 per cent for Queensland in 1977-78 over 1976-77. The Appropriation BUls also deal with funds for natural disasters. Measures to deal with disasters are essentiaUy a State responsibUity ir l l first instance. If a disaster is of such magnitude that Commonwealth assistance is needed, then the State asks for and receives help. I do not wish to canvass the issue of the organisation of task forces to act when a disaster, be it flood, fire, per- earthquake, tempest or drought, occurs. What I do want to discuss are thefinancialarrangements and planning that can be made by the various governments, individual companies and insurance houses to minimise the personal hardships which inevitably follow in the wake of any disaster. It is too late to make plans after the damage has been done. Drought and cyclone losses are largerrisksthan floods, bushfires and storm damage. Between 1975 and 1976 the total payments to the States for natural disasters were $224m, of which $110m or 45 per cent, were drought related. In reviewing the historical record, it is apparent that the major risks exist in the northern areas of Australia which are prone to cyclone, drought andflood.It is probable that losses due to natural disasters will increase through time. Payments by the Australian to Government to the States are both substantial All persons in Australia should be insured with natural disaster cover at reasonable rates, with the Government acting as a refinance institution an and making the best use of insurance industry The Commonwealth will act with support faciUties. It will not be involved in direct underwriting but would offer re-insurance facUities up to a specified maximum Umit. The cover has to be automatic, otherwise confusion prefor vaUs.

Having succumbed to the temptation in that way, I should now like to ceed to discuss the Appropriation Bills, which routine measures that allow members of the that. House quite wide ranging discussions on the Government's economic policy. I support amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), which is a legitimate method of reaffirming the Opposition's attitude to some of the incredible economic poUcies this Government. I say freely to the House that, like most other members, I am not an economist. However, I do try to read so that I can stand what those policies mean. Mr Martyr-You are a good doctor.",55

108,Dr JENKINS,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I am goingjto refer later to the stated: modest member of Parliament. One of the things The that concerns me in this area is that if the econhumming omy is to revive it is necessary that be confidence in all sectors in investment, ness and amongst the consumers. It is necessary that there be increased consumer should be remembered that, like me, most people in that field are not economists and that economies unless they have an understanding of what going on, these factors are not going to occur. There will still be lack of confidence; stUl be lack of consumer spending. One of the problems with this Government's economic polleft a disturbing icy is that, for the ordinary person in the street many whom it affects, it is so hard to understand. Therethe seems to be a basic assumption by the Governexpansions, ment that if it says it has made savings in public threatening expenditure everyone sees that as necessarily being a good thing. But many people in business do not necessarily accept that it is a good thing. Those in industry who were providing employon ment through the satisfying tracts for essential works do not see insensate slashing of programs as a good thing, and that growth produces an attitude of great doubt in the continue.in community. I know that there is a certain euphoria on Government benches because of the consumer price indexriseannounced today. I hope that phoria will not stop the Government from thinkfrom ing seriously about how real that figure is and how real is the benefit which it might be felt to indicate. After all, in that respect one only has refer back to last month's Rydge's magazine, scarcely a Labor paper. Its comment was that inflation rate for the last calendar year was per cent. When the devaluation decision bites, prowhich will be in the June quarter of this year, are Australia's inflation rate will rise to much above That is going to be the real test. I know that we can quote from all sorts of sources, but I am the quoting from a conservative source. One of the other things that concerns me is that it is politically expedient for the Government to blame all the economic troubles on the of Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. It did that in opposition. It still does it. Even in opposition it would not accept that there were external undereconomic factors applying which gravely affected Australia. Its problem in sticking to that line of argument is that it now has its back to the wall on any let-out. It is still faced with the probof claiming consistently that all the problems honourare domestic and have been produced domestically. I refer to an article which appeared earlier in the year in the magazine Newsweek. It unemployment rolls were pared a bit, idle plants were once again and government policymakers sudthere should denly breathed easier. in busiThat sounds Uke Government Ministers after midday today. One wonders how long it will last. spending. It The article continues: On the heels of the worse recession in 2 generations, the of both rich and poor nauons alike were expandis ing in 1976-the year of the recovery. Was this reflected in Australia? I submit not there will much. It further states: But the recession and the events that accompanied it had legacy. Inflationary levels were still high in industrial countries, causing a new wave of turmoil in intemauonal monetary system. And to finance their the developing nauons borrowed and borrowed and borrowed, throwing themselves deeper into debt and an already fragile global financial structure. What we do not see in the Government's discussion of the economy is the effect that this has the Australian economy. One American econof government conomist commented: Without substantial stimulus, the economic recoveries in both Germany and Japan may be finished, and with slow the US, there is no way for the world recovery to That is the sort of area in which I think Australia the has to show some responsibiUty and some concern. There should be some explanation of how euthese factors affect Australia and what flows them. What we have had in Australia, because of this concentration on the domestic situation, is a loss of real wages to the worker which to leads to further cuts in that consumption and confidence that I mentioned before. This the Government has exacerbated this matter by its 13.7 actions. I think that probably this Government subscribes to the argument adopted by some of the old fashioned theorists, namely, that a pool of unemployed would help slow wage demands and reduce the level of industrial unrest that said to be instigated by the more militant tions of the trade union movement. I think what happened in Australia effectively disproves this. Really, if the Government were to rely this weapon, the numbers of people in Australia would have to be so large that the bulk of small businesses in the country would forced into insolvency. There would be no conthings sumer led recovery which is one of the things that is needed whUe unemployment remains so high. I comment on that because it is pretty obvious that what this Government is aiming for is trial confrontation. It is taking a hard line. It said: 'We have this domestic economic strategy and we want to confront the union movement in order to show who is boss and enforce our to views'. It is doing this even though the outcome of the strategy is not certain. It has been tried elsewhere and has faUed. We see this present statement of the prices-wages freeze given with no guidelines. We saw the response of the Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to Mr Bob Hawke, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, when he offered to consider wage freeze in return for cuts in taxation. only have to go back to the end of November year when the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) was makhave ing certain comments on the economy and when Mr Hawke offered that same sort of deal to the Government. It was not a matter brought up bepolitics. cause of this so-called prices-wages freeze. I am afraid that I do not know what this Government means by the term 'prices-wages freeze'. I do not have. understand that there are any guidelines for it. It appears to me that we can draw the following analogy from the present situation: The Governber' said: ment has asked the trade union movement to give it a blank signed cheque but it will be alhow lowed to determine the colour of the cheque. The just that. trade union movement has given that proposition the rejection it sorightlydeserves. If Government wanted the freeze to work, if it beunderstanding Ueved it should work, it should be delineating guidelines to allow a national conference of those persons interested to discuss how the freeze can be used to bring about economic recovery and how it can be used to inspire confidence the investment and business sector in Australia cause that necessary increase in consumer spending. I submit that the Government has been dereUct in its actions and quite irresponsible this field. It brought up the idea of a prices-wages freeze as a public relations stunt. It has been shown to have no substance. It is an idea that so many countries have talked about either on a is voluntary or compulsory basis. There are varisecations in such a freeze if one thinks of the that guidelines. Without knowing those guideUnes, how can one assess the genuineness of this on attempt? One can only reject it as a complete out of work public relations exercise. be I want to refer to a couple of the more specific that are contained in these Appropriation BUls. At this stage I refer to that 'Modest Member' of Parliament. Some time ago in one of his regular articles he was pointing out that no really worthwhUe tax cuts could be made without a corindusresponding cutback in welfare services. He has pointed out that most of the peripheral cuts in expenditure in the Public Service had already been made and only the big ticket items were left cut in return for tax savings. I believe that the 'Modest Member' indicated that these areas were education receiving 9.1 per cent of government outlays; health, 2 per cent of government outlays; social security and welfare, 25.4 per Primecent; and payments to the States and local government authorities, 21.1 per cent. the Mr Martyr-Thos e figures would beright,too, We if they are from the 'Modest Member'. last Dr JENKINS-I accept that they areright.I a great deal of respect in many ways for the 'Modest Member' for Wakefield (Mr KeUy). I only feel that he needs some remedial teaching in Mr Martyr-He has lasted longer than you",56
109,Dr JENKINS,GENERAL BUSINESS,"Yes, not much longer though. The point I am making is that the 'Modest MemSome would cut the defence vote but not I. I remember we bared our breasts to the aggressor in 1939 by doing the One can understand that sort of reaction in Australian history. But there must be a growing body of opinion on both sides of all the House which starts to question defence expenditure. Defence expenditure appears to be able to go on without proper assessment of how in efficient is that expenditure. Obviously, I am to citing what was stated in an magazine article that the 'Modest Member' probably has read. But it makes some pretty legitimate comments that I think the Government should answer. It points out that when asked by both the Whitlam and in Fraser Governments, the Defence Department's own assessment was that there was no discernible military threat to Australia in the foreseeable future. At that time, it was going into an assessment of the aircraft Australia should have to replace the Miragefighters.Why they had to be replaced has never been explained politically. It was a desire of the Department. There was a suggestion that it was feasible to undertake a rebuilding program on the aircraft and that we should keep them in active service for the next decade at a fraction of the cost of purchasing new aircraft. It was suggested also that, if we carried out that plan, the Mirage would continue far to outstrip any opposition it would be likely to encounter in this region. In fact, it was offered as an aside that the only opposition would be likely to come, after all, from the 1950s vintage Sabres of the Indonesian Air Force which were given to Jakarta by Australia. That is not an unreasonable comment. In addition to that sort of activity the Air Force is interested in buying some 40 specialised ground attack jets. There are problems involved in buying those aircraft. One could ask also whether the F-15fighter,which is the one mentioned, is necessarily the best. There are other aircraft, that have multi-role capabilities, which could be just as effective as the F-15, and which could be purchased at a much lower cost. I turn to the Navy. I remind the House that, in February 1976, the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) announced the decision to buy two of the American FFG-7 patrol frigates. Those small 2,500 tonners, he estimated, would cost $330m. He was careful to add that that figure was calculated at January 1976 prices. That would be the cost for the 2 ships, helicopters, missiles and other gear. I understand that nobody in the Department of Defence believes that that will be the cost when they come into service in 1982, but that it will be at least $500m. The Navy now wants to order one more. One questions whether those are necessarily the best type of work boats for the Navy. When doing an investigation with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation just recently, one was led to reflect on the extent of the coastline of Australia and the type of naval craft that were best suited to our purposes, being a large continent with a large coastline and a small population. We would probably be better off with many more small patrol boats. I do not particularly want to get into an inincrease volved discussion on that matter. What I am ing is that that sort of expenditure might looked at in view of the fact that there is no discernible threat in the near future. Apparently not a great deal of testing is done of aircraft and sels which we are buying. We might well carry out an assessment of the role in Australian defence and the increasing cost of the types of naval vessels being purchased, despite the 'Modest Member's' reservations in treating the matter as a holy cow. I hope that the Government does apply the same criterion when it is thinking of cutting expenditure on education, health and social welfare and when it is increasing the problems we face by ensuring that the numbers of students at our schools and tertiary institutions are maintained at much higher numbers than is necessary because of the lack of opportunities it creates for them. The Government has to offer special stimulus for the creation of enough apprenticeship places, and I beheve that not enough apprenticeship places are being created. In Victoria there are many more applicants for apprenticeship places than there are vacancies available.  Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1976-77 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1976-77. However, I wish to speak against the amendment which has been moved. I think it is amusing that the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) should say that there is no discernible threat to Australia in the near future and go on to question the Defence vote. I think I ought to remind the honourable member for Scullin that someone who should be rather closer to him than to me, John Curtin, in 1938 said: Defence expenditure must depend entirely on the conditions which prevail in the world from time to time. Obviously that must be the position. I say that any increase of defence expenditure after the Munich pact as far as Australia is concerned appears to me to be entirely unjustifiable and an hysterical piece of propaganda. Mr Kelly-Who said that?  the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), in criticising the Government's economic policy, came out with the usual sorts of words that we are used to hearing from him. He said that the Government was mutilating the pubUc sector, that there ought to be cuts in indirect taxes and that there ought to be more government spending. Really one wonders whether they ever learn, especially in view of today's announcement that the consumer price index for the March quarter this year increased by 2.3 per cent compared with a 3 per cent in the CPI for the March quarter of last sayyear. I think that is ample evidence that the be Government's economic policy is working. The matter that I wish to raise in this debate is vesone which is probably known to many honourable members in this House. It concerns the question whether the Commonwealth is getting value for the taxpayers money which it spends. There are probably 2 areas which one can look at, first, the collection of the funds and, secondly the spending of the taxes collected. I was concerned to read, in relation to the collection of gift duty, for example, that in the 1976financialyear about $ 10.4m was collected and that the net cost of collection was approximately $850,000 or 8.1 per cent of collections. However, I consider that the problem is greater on the expenditure side. What I am really talking about, of course, is efficiency within the Public Service. I do not want to concentrate on personal efficiencies but rather the overall efficiency of the departments and the systems under which they operate. This really concerns how much of the funds allocated to a project actually gets to the people for whom the project is meant to cater. For example, when I learned that less than 50c in the dollar found its way to the end user under many of the Labor Government's Aboriginal programs, I thought that there was a great need for concern. Similarly, when I was in the Citizen Military Forces I was astounded at the enormous paper war that went on. Probably a greater amount of money is spent in some cases in keeping track of personal items-for example clothing-tha n the item is worth. I pick that example only as one that I know, but I am sure the same situation applies in many other departments. I believe the need for proper efficiency audits is overwhelming. I now look briefly at who is responsible for efficiency in the Pubhc Service. Apart, of course, from the departments themselves, the 2 bodies one immediately looks at are the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General. The Auditor General who is not responsible to a Minister but who reports directly to the Parliament, carries out normal regulatory or compliance audits. There are, however, 2 other sorts of audits with which I am concerned. They are efficiency audits and program audits. I shall dealfirstwith program audits. Basically they are aimed at seeing whether the programs are actually doing what was intended. I understand that that sort of review is now being undertaken by the Prime Minister's Department and the new Department of Finance. That, of course, is in line with the suggestions contained in the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, known as the Coombs report. I understand that those departments will be looking at such matters as whether the programs are still relevant, whether they are doing what was guidance intended, and so on. I shall leave for a moment the question of efficiency audits and whether the Auditor General may be the appropriate person to undertake such audits. Apart from the Auditor General, the Pubhc Service Board also has responsibility for efficiency within the Public Service. Section 17 of the Public Service Act states that: 'In addition to such duties as are elsewhere in this Act, imposed on it, the Board shall have the following duties': To devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of departments by improved organisational procedures. A number of headings are given, some of which are: 'The avoidance of unnecessary expenditure' and 'the establishment of systems of check in order to ascertain whether the return for expenditure is adequate'. The Board has the duty 'to examine the business of each department and ascertain whether any inefficiency or lack of economy exists' and 'to maintain a comprehensive and continuous system of measuring and checking the economical and efficient working of each department, and to institute standard practice and uniform instructions for carrying out recurring work'. It would appear therefore that the Board has all the power to do just what I am concerned about. The question then is: Is it doing it? It seems to me that the PubUc Service Board is confronted with some rather basic conflicts. Initially, of course, the Board has to sit as employer, wage determiner and arbitrator over those employed in the Public Service. Tbis itself could well be an area for government consideration. However, deaUng with the area of efficiency audits, there seem to be even greater conflicts. If under section 17 the Board is to conduct the type of efficiency audits that I would hope it would be undertaking, is it in fact capable of doing so? Remembering that the Board is in part responsible for the establishment of the organisation structure under which the departments are operating, section 17 then says to it 'You also have a role to go back to the departments and see it they are operating efficiently'. Can it really be expected to come up with a totally objective and unbiased view when it is really sitting in judgment on itself? I do not believe under the present arrangements it can really do so. Let me quote from the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, known as the Coombs report. That report at page 47 talking of the Public Service Board, says: The Board sees itself as a primary source of expertise and for departments and agencies in organisation and personal practice, and believes that its capacity to formulate and assist departments to achieve greater efficiency depends upon the maintenance of harmonious working relations between the Board and departments. Harmony would be difficult to maintain if the Board were responsible for reports embodying serious criticism of departmental performanceparticularly if these reports were to reach a wider audience. Furthermore, it is evident that the Board cannot be wholly objective in its approach to section 17 studies. Much of what is done in departments is the result of the Board's own advice. The report goes on to say, referring to efficiency efficiency audits: The Board in conducting such an audit would to some extent be judging its own work. Apart which awareness of this conflict reports themselves, it could have deleterious effects attitude of the Board to innovation. I also want to refer to the types of examinations which were made by the PubUc Service Board under section 17 inquiries. I would read 2 paragraphs from the Coombs report which indicate the deficiencies in the types of examinations made and further problems the Commission considered appUed to the Public Service Board undertaking efficiency audits. It says: The Public Service Board has shown great reluctance to assess performance of departments and agencies. Indeed for some years no section 17 examinations were made. Now that they have been resumed they are seen as exercises in assisting and improving management rather than in auditing or assessing performance. They are carried out by a team headed by an external consultant and including the senior officer from the department or agency concerned. The form of the Board's participation emphasises its role of servicing the team although there is no reason to doubt its real tribution to the study itself. Furthermore, the report of team is treated as strictly confidential to the department cerned and great care is exercised to preserve this confidenthe tiality. It was only with much reluctance that the Board gave the Commission access to its reports enabling scope and methods of the inquiries. That scope was found be extremely narrow. The Coombs report goes on: The reviews are predominantly concerned with rearrangements of the management structures and modifications of the procedures and practices within them. This is the important partThey are only marginally concerned with the basic systems and procedures governing the establishment of those structures or the recruitment to and the advancement of people within them. No major aspect of the Treasury's or, particularly, the Public Service Board's role appears to have been followed through in any of the reviews. Nor do they comment, even on a strictly confidential basis, on the work of senior officers with major managerial functions, or encompass the efficient administration of programs as opposed to that of selected administrative units. Since the Commission believes that it is primarily in better organisation that the economies leading to greater efficiency will be found, the narrowness of the studies is disappointing. It seems clear from what I have said and the views of the Commissioners in the Coombs report that the Public Service Board as it currently operates should not be the body responsible for efficiency audits. In fact the PubUc Service Board in its annual report for 1976 says so itself. At page 17 it says: The Board sees its own role in relation to the overall efficiency of the service as essentially that of management improvement at the central level, in the form expressed in section 17 of the Public Service Act. The Board has also indicated to the Royal Commission its view that the public audit function would be appropriately placed with the Auditor-General; if that function were so placed, the Board would accordingly see its own role and responsibilities as part of the joint management team with Permanent Heads from the influence as subject to appraisal. of interest may have on the on the It would seem that the Coombs report substantially accepted the views of the Public Service Board and I now look to what is being done to implement these urgently needed proposals. Honourable members will remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a statement to this House on 9 December last year. He said that the Government had taken initial decisions on a number of the Royal Commission's recommendations. He said that the Government accepted in principle the need for efficiency audits and that officials had been asked to report to the Government on detaUs of how such a system might be implemented. The Prime Minister said on that occasion: I believe that we have made substantial progress in our initial examination of the report and have set in train work to prepare such detailed plans. I have no doubt that, when conimplemented, these reforms will lead to a more efficient the administration- a matter which should be of concern to all conAustralians. I add that as the Government examination of Royal Commission's recommendations progresses, obviously there will be other reports to the Parliament concernit to study the ing the decisions taken. to I want to support the Governments moves for the implementation of efficiency audits to examine whether sections of departments or indeed whole departments are operating under the most efficient systems and procedures. This is going to require some people with very specialised knowledge. There will be some differences between private enterprise efficiency audits and Public Service efficiency audits, particularly as there is no simUar price mechanism or competition at work. I understand the Auditor-General was in fact overseas in December last year to look at other countries and how they operate such efficiency audits. Honourable members will know that the Americans have recently undertaken just this sort of work. I therefore hope that this means that the Auditor-General will be given the job. I strongly support the Government's moves and I urge the Government to implement the proposals as soon as possible. This is one example of the Government having to spend money to save money, but I am conbeen fident the returns involved in increased efficiencytrol and greater value for money will be substantial.",57
110,Mr SCHOLES,GENERAL BUSINESS," I want to deal substantially with the approach to economic problems and the damage which is done by treating these problems as pohtical propaganda weapons rather than as serious national probwhich lems. In the last fortnight, for instance, we been almost snowed under by a public relations barrage about a price-wage freeze. On Tuesday last week the Opposition moved in this House suspend the Standing Orders to enable the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to make a firm statement on the guidelines and procedures under which that price-wage freeze was to operexpenditure ate. The Government refused to do so. It promised on that occasion to make a statement but it subsequently did not make the statement. The Prime Minister then came into the house and made a statement which in no way indicated the guidelines, what was expected of people how the government saw the price-wage freeze operating. Clearly, it was a set of words which had no basis in fact. It is still a set of words with no basis in fact. The Government does not have a clue how it would manage or operate such a price-wage freeze. I suggest that the way to achieve that of approach, which is expected to be cotant operative and which needs not only the vocal also the active support of the majority of people in Australia and all sections of the Australian community, is to be honest with people, to tell them what is wanted, to tell them what the probing lem is and to ask them to assist. In that instanceand this week we have seen further evidencedecision was made almost over a cup of tea. The Government went into the Premier's Conference with a number of items listed. One of them was the federaUsm proposition on State taxes. This one of the panaceas of all time for this Governfor ment. In opposition, federaUsm was said to mean State co-operation and State independence. The States arefindingout that independence has only one meaning, that they pick up the tabs for those things for which the Commonwealth decides it does not want to pay or for which it does not port continuation. That is a pretty broad field. Some of those areas were fairly clearly underPrime taken to be continued by the present GovernprevaUed ment during the period leading up to the 1975 election and during the election campaign. I instance one, the Australian Assistance which is about to die a natural death. This will recentrahse activities in social welfare which decentraUsed very effectively into the conand operation of the local community in a number of areas, especiaUy in my electorate. That is now to be put back into the extremely centralist control of the Victorian State Government. In the main, State governments are more centrahst than the Federal Government, despite the propaganda to the contrary. Education, had been substantially depoliticised by the have estabUshment of the Schools Commission, and criteria whereby recommendations were made and the government of the day then had to make to decisions as to what extent it would fund those recommendations, are now about to disappear insofar as they are public information or subject to pubUc examination and suggestions as to what should take place. It is pretty clear that under this Government secrecy will again prevaU in reports to the Government and in School Commission reports. The reasoning behind them will no longer be avaUable to the Australian community and Government decisions or will again take on the cloak of all wisdom because any criticism of an authoritative nature will not be avaUable for the public to examine. This technique was carried on successfully for many years. In the 3 years of the Labor Governtype ment and for a period thereafter reports imporfor the pubUc to understand, such as Tariff but Board reports and a number of other reports, including the Schools Commission reports, were made public so that people understood the advice given to the Government and the reason for that advice. When the Government's decision was different to that advice, the Governa ment was then placed in a position where it had to indicate quite clearly the reasons for its political judgment. If the advice of the experts is withheld the Government does not have to explain its is decision. It has only to announce it. That makes very easy government. It makes for a greater lack of responsibUity on the part of the Government. In the situation which has occurred in the last 2 weeks it has now been unravelled that the whole truth was not told to the community or the Parliament with respect to the price-wage freeze. supFirstly, the Premier of Victoria very definitely included tax cuts in his initial propositions. The Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) upon him not to proceed with that particular proposition as it would cause embarrassment to the Commonwealth. The price-wage freeze was announced-and I say announced-as Plan, voluntary following which the Prime Minister moved immediately to have a compulsory freeze had on wages accompanied by a partial freeze on prices. Partial is the operative word. The ter for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) made quite clear the day after that he did not think price freeze applied to primary products and perishable goods because that would be imposshad ible. I tend to agree with him on that statement. cannot see how at an auction of catde for freeze. instance, a seller could suddenly jump up, the price looked like being good that day would make up for his losses the day before, say: 'Sorry, that is the Umit. The price freeze there. I will not sell my cattle any dearer.' I think that he would be locked up if he did. Similarly, cannot seeMr Kelly-It is similar to some that I have seen.",61
111,Mr SCHOLES,GENERAL BUSINESS,"That might be true, but I could not see even the honourable member for Wakefield, if he looked Uke getting a decent price for his cattle for once in a year, standing and saying: 'That is too much.' He may even pay off some ofhis debts that way. Mr Kelly- I think you arerightabout that.",62
112,Mr SCHOLES,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I could not see one of the South Australian tomato growers, who grow for the early or late market in Victoria under ditions which must certainly attract costs which are greater than those for the grower who grows for the normal seasonal market saying: 'Well, am prepared to accept the seasonal glut price, opposed to the price which I would have expected.' These are real factors and they are factors which ought at least to have been explained to people. The Minister made a ment but the Prime Minister came into the house last week and said: 'No. Everybody is in.' Quite clearly that was not a truthful statement and was not a statement which had any practical base whatsoever. I make one other point. The whole exercise needed the co-operation not only of the emcomes. ployers, who had certain motivation because they were going to get out of it stable wages, which they claim is very important to them also stable costs which the government promised, but also of the trade unions who had to have some guarantees that their position would be protected. The people who work for Uving in this community are just as entitled have their position protected as those people whom they work. The trade unions were not con-economic sulted and were not brought into the discussion. There was no attempt made to have discussion with them in the week following the announceship ment. The wage-price freeze was said to be existence on the day after it was announced but Ministhe trade unions were listed to talk to the it Government about this matter a week later. A the week after the freeze came into existence the Government asks for co-operation. Applications already been made to the Conciliation and I Arbitration Commission for a compulsory wage That is not the way to get co-operation. when The call by the ConcUiation and Arbitration and Commission for a national conference, which and was part of the submission to the Australian is Council of Trade Unions, and the proposition of tax cuts in return for wage restraint were at least I negotiable positions which should have been discussed. I doubt whether the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could have made a lesser decision than to ask for a national conference and stUl retain any credibUity whatsoever as an independent wage fixing and condition determining body. But the Prime Minister immediately set out on a course of abusing the trade up union movement and its leadership because they sought to discuss the matter in a manner which would have enabled them to give serious consideration to whether they could participate. One does not blindfold oneself and then walk through a maze of poison ivy. That is the sort of conmaze anyone who walks into anything suggested by the Prime Minister is likely to be in. The Prime Minister continually suggested that the I Government wanted an agreement in principle. as He has a habit of accepting such statements and then expanding them and placing a different interpretation on them. He has access to the pubUc media which enables him to place on the destatefensive any person who would give such an undertaking and thenfindthat he was not able to keep it. The Prime Minister, if he wanted a volit untary wages-prices freeze, had a serious responsibUity to the Australian community to talk to all the parties concerned before he started hitting with brickbats. That is where the crunch The Prime Minister saw this not as an opportunity to advance the economic position of the country or the national interest but rather to and advance his political needs and those of his had Government. That is why co-operation is difficult, if not impossible, to gain. One cannot continue to seek to divide the nation, to blame a a section of the community, which at the moment to even the statistics prove is carrying the major for portion of the sacrifices of the Government's poUcy, and expect that section to cooperate when it is not consulted, no discussions are sought or held and it is asked by the leaderof the Government on public forums under in threat to give agreement to a plan which the Prime Minister was not able to outline in this Parliament; nor has he yet been able to outline any significant details. The wages-prices freeze was a farce drawn and seized upon for one or two reasons. I the major reason was to avoid the indexation case which would arise out of the March quaner cost of living figures, which were not as bad the Government anticipated. Mr MCLean-They were very good.",62
113,Mr SCHOLES,GENERAL BUSINESS,"Well, they were not as bad the Government anticipated and possibly the Victoria fears of the Government were not as warranted as they might have been. But the facts of the ter are that by avoiding that March indexation increase the Government would have effectively frozen wages for 2 months and funher reduced the standard of living of those people who pend upon Commonwealth Conciliation and cannot Arbitration Commission decisions. The economic Commonwealth Treasury-n o one seems to have mentioned this, not even the Prime Minister who talks about the losses if he were to give tax cessions-woul d have a substantial saving if that indexation increase were not granted because increase would go on to the bills for the Comhe monwealth Public Service. The figure of 2.3 per cent attached to the Commonwealth Public Sermost vice bill would be a substantial amount of which would be saved by the Commonwealth double and which therefore could at least be used by the Government, without increasing its deficit, as bargaining position on tax concessions or some other forms of concession to meet some of the objections which exist and which were asked be discussed at a national conference. If Prime Minister has seriously considered a volunhas tary wages-prices freeze a reality he has already dropped the ball because he chose of national interest and he is still choosing politics ahead of national interest. The Victorian oil dispute, which the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was able to negotiate to a settlement and which likely should have been settled a lot earlier the same process, resulted not in any congratuYou lations for the President for participating in achieving a settlement of this dispute but straight out abuse from the Prime Minister and the Minyou. ister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). The reason for that abuse was that they felt they had been cheated of their victory. They wanted an industrial confrontation situbudgetary ation which would justify the establishment the Industrial Relations Bureau which they are about to set up as a policeman, along with the trade union section of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation which this Government has reactivated, to spy on and to act as agent provocateurs within the trade union moveup ment. They needed that situation for poltiical think purposes, to continue their campaign of divisiveness within the Australian community. They have not had that, therefore we get the reas action of abuse of the President of the ACTU. It is strange that in this community whenever an employer organisation makes demands on the as Government-whe n for instance the Premier of suggests tax cuts-whils t they are not acceptable to the Government they are at least conmatsidered to be responsible suggestions. But when they are made by the people who pay the majority of taxes-the people who are making the sacrifices-the y are irresponsible, mean or destraight out unco-operative. The Government expect co-operation and national effort in proposals it puts forward unless it is prepared to put those policies forward honestly and without deception. That is something that no conone in this Parliament at this moment could say that the Prime Minister does. He is a double stanthe dard man from way back. He says one thing but practises another. I think that if any national effort is ever to be gained, unity of purpose is the important single factor. But whilst people money know they are being deceived and that the standard is being practised there will not be that unity. It is interesting that the Prime Mina ister does not acknowledge any responsibUity at all for the problems that the Government is having with the deficit. I think most of us who are to interested know why the budgetary problems the exist at the moment and why the Government to carry out a policy of absolute wage freeze. It is not interested in price freeze; wage freeze is politics ahead what it is all about. ",63
114,Mr SCHOLES,GENERAL BUSINESS,"A price freeze you have not got. Your are fooling yourself if you think prices most have not been going up in the community this by week and last week. You are fooling yourself. ought to do you own shopping at the superand markets. Then you would know. You obviously do not know. The housewives do, I can assure I am concerned, and I think all of us are concerned, about this double standard. If cooperation is to be obtained it has to be obtained on the basis of honesty. The reason for the problem which the Prime Minister of now finds confronting him is his own lack of judgment and refusal to accept advice. At the time of the drafting of the 1976 Budget it was clearly spelt out to the Prime Minister that he could not responsibly make the sort of conindirect cessions which he did to mining and other panies and hope to contain the deficit. He did accept that advice and more than $ 1,000m worth of concessions were granted in the Budget tions of the Australian community which were, and are still, prosperous and which did not have the need for this assistance that other sections the community have. These concessions have been paid for by reductions in the welfare area and community expenditures. They are now to be paid for finally by freezes on wages of persons least able to afford to meet the cost. Nearly $2,000m in costs because of forgone revenue and other effects such as devaluation were created by direct Government decision. If there are problems in the budgetary situation the moment they are a result of misplanning by this Government directed by the present Prime Minister. He seeks to blame others for his mistakes. Trust cannot be built on that sort deception.",63
115,Mr MCLEAN,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I am pleased to express my support for the Appropriation Bills presendy before the House. It is interesting place these additional Estimates for 1976-77 in 3-year perspective. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) did this in his second reading speech to Approchanged priation Bill (No. 3) in which he stated: I particularly draw the House's the amount of $326.073m in additional appropriations sought in the Bills compares with $506.201 m provided for last year and $ 1,240.941 m in 1974-75. Therefore, despite the inflation rates of recent years, these 2 Appropriation Bills indicate that the Government has been successful in exercising its policy of restraint in government expenditure. Further, the Treasurer stated that notwithstanding the additional appropriations sought in these BUls, it was expected that the total outlay in 1976-77 over the whole range of expenditures would not vary significantly from the figure of $24,32lm that was contained in the Budget of last year. This of course raises the issue whether the Budget remains a reasonable arm of economic management, whether the deficit is important, whether there should be government expenditure restraint, whether there should be tax cuts and whether monetary policy might play a more important role in economic poUcy in the future. We are, in effect, with these BUls invited to question the rationale of the Government's economic poUcy to date. In previous debates on financial matters, I have outhned my view of the economic problems facing this country. I have outlined the direct and causes of inflation, the relationship becomtween inflation and unemployment and the not Government's strategy within that context. In speaking to these Appropriation BUls, I should to seclike to make some comments regarding this Government's attitude to government expenditure and in particular, to restraint in government of expenditure. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and other Opposition spokesmen including the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes).have often criticised this aspect of the those Government's economic strategy. In fact, it forms part of their proposed amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). They stated that stagnation would result from the Government's cutting of public sector expenditure. Those who adat vocate more government spending are simply out of tune with current economic relationships. They may have been correct in the early 1960s own because then high unemployment was generally of accompanied by low rates of inflation and could be remedied without putting pressure on prices. I have said in this place before that the 1960s was a period when prices reflected such fundamental things as demand and resource utilisation. But to that element of price and wageflexibUitywhich a permitted this to occur no longer exists. The Opposition does not seem to realise that times have when it advocates increased government expenditure to increase employment. attention to the fact that As I have said before, under the previous Labor Government the highest ever rates of increase in government spending occurred at the same time as record unemployment. We have unemployment not because of inadequate spending, but because of inadequate investment. Because of excessive government expenditure, the previous Government ran large deficits, financed those deficits largely by printing new money and entered the marketplace competing excessively against the private sector for goods and services. This occurred at a time of declining productivity and it therefore produced great pressure on prices and led to record high interest rates. These factors in turn thwarted investment in key sectors of the Australian economy. It was inadequate investment brought about by these circumstances which therefore produced unemployment. Excess government expenditure, not the lack of it, led to this situation. This is the opinion of a very respectable and widespread body of economic opinion throughout the world. I certainly support the Government's policy of restraint in government expenditure. In my opinion there is Umited scope for further action in this area. Budgets have become rather intractable and certainly inflexible and in my opinion they are now more useful as a vehicle for governments to impose their ideology on a nation than as a weapon for economic management on a continuing basis. I emphasise the words 'on a continuing basis'. Thus approximately 60 per cent of total outlays are involved in carrying out programs in the Departments of Defence, Health, Education and Social Security. Many of these programs are either of a long-term continuing nature or are caught on the indexation bandwaggon with an automatically inbuilt capacity to involve successively higher outlays each year. I do not suggest that indexation, whether it be of taxes, wages or pensions, is a bad thing; quite the contrary. But I do maintain that it is helping to make the outlays side of gets more intractable and less amenable to adjustment I doubt whether there is much more the Government can do in a substantial way in this area. On the revenue side, we have the continuing call for tax cuts. I should like to make 2 comments in this regard: Firstly, given the nature of the expenditure side of the Budget to which I have already referred, any tax reductions above those already made would inevitably lead to an increased deficit and the kind of inflation and increased pressure on interest rates that Australia has experienced over the past few years. Further tax reductions should await a decline in the inflation rate which has already been substantially reduced by this Government. Secondly, people seem to forget that this Government has already made substantial tax reforms. They constitute a very impressive list. Firstly, there was the introduction of fuU personal tax indexation in the last Budget. This will represent a cost to revenue of $ 1,050m in 1977-78. This is the single most important tax reform in the history of the Australian tax system. For the first time it gives guaranteed protection to the community from unlegislated tax increases caused by inflation. Then there is the investment aUowance which also was introduced last year and which will represent a cost to revenue of $550m in 1977-78. This has been instrumental in bringing about a revival in investment spending. Company tax indexation is being introduced with the trading stock valuation adjustment- a charge of $400m against revenue in 1977-78. Taxation from mining and petroleum has been reduced to encourage exploration and development. This involves a loss of revenue of $40m nextfinancialyear. Distribution requirements for private companies have been eased and will represent a loss to revenue of $25m in the nextfinancialyear. Income equalisation deposits have been introduced to protect farmers from the effects of fluctuating incomes. This represents a cost to revenue of $4m in the nextfinancialyear. Estate duty exemptions have been substantially widened at a cost to revenue of SlOm in 1977-78. These are all significant tax reforms and will be equivalent to tax reductions in excess of $3,000m in the Government's first 2 years in office. Tax indexation has already saved a famUy of four on average weekly earnings about $4 a week in 1976-77 and will save them a further $5 a week next year, making a total saving of $9 a week. But these are not savings in the normal sense of the word. They represent money in the hands of the people which they would not have if Labor bud- were still in office and was stUl continuing to refuse to introduce tax indexation for individuals. The point I am developing is that much has already been done in the areas of government expenditure restraint and taxation reforms. In my opinion, as a result of these initiatives, there is very little scope for further budgetary action on either side of the ledger, at least until inflation has been further reduced and solid economic growth is under way. There may be some scope for further expenditure cuts, but I submit that these will be minor in relation to overall expenditure growth which wtilrisesubstantially due to inflation, continuing programs in the major portfolios and wage and social security indexation. Such automatic increases in revenue wtil not occur in future because of tax indexation. This may make governments honest, but it also will make life difficult for future governments in a political sense by locking them into budgetary situations which are not easily altered. In the immediate future, and given the budgetary constraints now confronting governments, there will be an almost inevitable tendency for deficits to increase while rates of economic growth are less than the inflation rate. This in turn is inflationary and will be the inevitable result unless additional revenue is raised or expenditure is reduced. There is limited scope for either infiscaland political terms. It will therefore be very difficult for the Government to maintain its present budgetary strategy over the longer term. When the time comes to pursue a mildly expansionary policy, and I suggest that the time is near, monetary policy will be far more important thanfiscalpolicy. Tax cuts, for instance, are certainly desirable. Governments like providing them and people like getting them. But in the budgetary circumstances I have outlined they would have to follow rather than precede or accompany economic revival. At the moment tax cuts would increase the deficit and might do little to stimulate expenditure. Recent evidence suggests that they would probably go into extracumstances savings as people continue to hedge against unthat employment rather than be spent as a hedge against an infiation rate, which the cuts would help to perpetrate. On the other hand, extended credit facilities obviously would be utilised by those who had di-last rect expenditure plans. Monetary expansion is more likely to go into investment than consump-quarter tion, in line with the Government's investment led recovery policy. I also make the point that monetary expansion could more easily be reverlevels sed should economic circumstances require this to be done. For instance, if tax cuts led to demand expenditure than expected it would be more difiicult, and there would reverse such decisions than it would be to reverse monetary pohcy decisions. There is also the added advantage that the Government can, through the Reserve Bank of Australia, broadly direct the areas of increased bank lending, whereas it has less control over the direction expenditure emanating from tax cuts. But, as said before, there is a question oftiminginvolved here which may not be as far in the future as some people seem to suggest. Australia's restrictive policies have been line with the poUcies of most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development counper tries. Although the United States, Japan and Germany have pursued mildly expansionary poUcies, they are in the minority and have much different recent economic history from of Australia. Those 3 countries implemented contractionary poUcies earUer than Australia and improving. they took stimulatory action only after reducing inflation. That was due to the tinting and inten-farm sity of Australia's economic problems. The shift of income away from profits to wages and the large rise in the proportion of income saved much sharper than in earUer Australian remonths cessions. The resultant increases in our ployment and inflation rates produced Another differences between these rates and their long term average that were greater than those in almost all OECD countries. The OECD currently advocates different economic policies with the stronger countries of the Umted States, Japan and Germany taking action to stimulate demandequal but at the same time taking care to avoid measures that would renew inflationary ures and it recommends that the weaker countries employ severe demand restraint, supplemented where possible by arrangements which limit the growth of incomes. very It may well be that Australia is now rapidly moving to the position where her economic cirjustify taking action appropriate to now being taken in the 3 stronger countries. Although their inflation rates have been reduced, Australia's underlying rate dropped from 16.7 per cent in 1975 to 10.8 per cent in 1976 and the consumer price index figure released today confirms that, notwithstanding the devaluation year, inflation in Australia is coming under control. The figure of 2.3 per cent for the March indicates that Australia should have single digit inflation for the next 12 months. I think it also should be noted that unemployment remain at historically high levels in those stronger countries and that in both the United greaterStates and Japan unemployment is higher than in Australia, where there is also considerable be greater lags, toexcess capacity. There are other indicators that also suggest to me that this Government's strategy is working and bringing about an economic recovery. I have already touched on the Government's success in of bringing down the inflation rate and mention has I been made of the present unemployment levels in Australia. I would like to put the unemployment problem in perspective. During the period of office of the Labor Government the number of in people out of work, expressed as a percentage of the work force, rose from 2.39 per cent to 5.41 cent-a n increase of 126 per cent. Since this Government took office in December 1975 not only has unemployment, expressed as a percena tage of the work force, stopped increasing but thatalso there has been a sUght improvement. Although the position is still not good it is Let us look at some other indicators. The nonsector of the economy grew in real terms by over 5 per cent in the year to the December quarter 1976, more than recovering the 4 per werecent decUne that took place under the last 21 of the Labor Administration. This is a unemmajor indicator of growth in the economy. significant economic indicator is the recovery in investment expenditure-normall y a necessary pre-requisite for increasing employment. Investment in plant and equipment by pri3 vate enterprises increased by 32.1 per cent in the year to the December quarter of 1976, which is to a growth of 18.4 per cent in real terms. I think that reflects the success of the Governpressment's investment incentives. A recent survey by the Commonwealth Statistician indicates that private capital investment expenditure will continue to increase. The Treasurer indicated this when answering a quesA tion in the House yesterday. He stated: Businessmen's expectations during the current 6 months period. The mining industry, which capital spending has been in decline, shows a comof plete turnabout with an expected rise in capital spending 41 per cent. A solidriseof 18 per cent is expected in the manufacturing industry. Company profits, which are tomorrow's investI ments and tomorrow's jobs, constitute a further positive indication that the Government's egy is working. Company profits recovered strongly last year and, in the December quarter of 1976, were some 33 per cent higher than they were a year earUer. Although there are still weak points in the economy, I feel that there is a sufficient number of promising indicators to sugFebruary gest that the Treasurer is quite entitled to think that the economy is emerging from its recession and that the basis for future growth and stabUity in Australia is being steadUy secured. For that reason I would suggest that Australia could be considered as one of the stronger OECD member countries. Since this Government took office Australia's economic performance has generally been better than that of most OECD countries. It is therefore necessary for us to ensure that, with the leads and lags in the economic system, we do not lose this momentum due to excessively restrictive poUcies. I think we are getting to the position achieved by the economies of the United States, Japan and Germany immediately introduction of mild expansionary policies. I would therefore suggest that, in view of the tricted budgetary options I referred to earlier, Government could consider some change of phasis in its monetary policy to provide greater fiscal leverage and to ensure that the gains already achieved are strengthened for the future. I support both Bills before the House. They dicate to me the kind of restraining policies that have been successful in turning the direction the economy to one of growth. I urge the country. Government now to investigate the possibility of introducing a change of emphasis in its policy further to enhance the prospects of the economy, which quite obviously is mend with at last both inflation and unemployment showing distinct signs of improvement. must not lose these gains. In supporting I also reject the amendment moved by the Oppoconcerned sition. Part of that amendment reads: . . . whilst not denying the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that (a) the slashing of government spending is part ofan inept economic strategy . . . visiting United States professor of economics who addressed the Life Underwriters Association in Sydney recently said: are for a growth of 8 per cent in How could anyone in hisrightmind, given the experience the last 3 years in Australia, with massive growths in total of spending which are without parallel in any peacetime period in Australian history and which correspond torisinglevels of unemployment, argue that if we simply add a little more spending we could produce some more jobs? think that sums up the strategy of the Opposition. I support these BUls and reject the stratOpposition's amendment.",64
116,Mr ARMITAGE,GENERAL BUSINESS,"Once again just over a year the question of possible Cenin tral Intelligence Agency activity in Australia has raised its head. I ask the House to recall that in of last year I brought to its attention, as recorded in Hansard, a transcript of an AM program of 19 February in which a Ray Martin from New York outlined certain allegations. I am not necessarily making a point for or against now those allegations. He alleged that the CIA was connected with the dismissal of the Whitlam Government. Once again this issue is very much to the fore in Australia, with allegations being made. I do not think we are in a position to advocate the truth or otherwise of those aUegations at thistime.I show the House today's Sydney Sun. Its publishers are hardly a young radical organisation. The newspaper is owned by the Fairfax family. The headlines read: CIA 'interfered in Australian unions' prior to their They also state: Defence man briefed Kerr. resIt is said that the briefing occurred on 8 the November 1975. AUegations are again floating emaround Australia. They are of a very serious nature. So far as I am concerned it is a matter of not only whether the CIA is involved in espionage activities in Australia but also whether anyone is involved in the espionage activities of any incountry. It is time the Government took this issue seriously. It is well and truly time there was a full of scale inquiry into espionage activities in this monetary Mr SHIPTON - What about bananas?",67
117,Mr ARMITAGE,GENERAL BUSINESS,"I said into the espionage now on the activities in this country. We Mr SHIPTON - Not bananas? the BiUs Mr ARMITAGE-Listen , mate, if you are only about bananas when I am speaking to an important issue it is time that you set to and worked out precisely what is of importance to this nation. I have an A Current Affair transcript of an interview on 10 June 1976 between Mike Minehan, Gail Jarvis and Eric Butler fame-the Eric Butler-in which Eric Butler says: The United Nations is, to informed people, an national front orgamsauon. I in fact have just come from most distinguished gathering in South Korea of the Anti-Communist League-6 1 nations represented-rea l experts on Communism. They all agreed of course the United Nations is nothing more than a haven for Communists. Has been from the beginning. This is a time when it is being alleged that the Liberal and National Country Parties are being infiltrated by extreme right wing elements.",67
118,Mr SHIPTON,GENERAL BUSINESS,Who are they?,68
119,Mr ARMITAGE,GENERAL BUSINESS,The Eric Butlers and company.,68
120,Mr SHIPTON,GENERAL BUSINESS,Is he a member of the Liberal Party?,68
121,Mr ARMITAGE,GENERAL BUSINESS,"He has a big influence in certain elements of the Liberal Party, and the honourable member knows it. For the reasons I have stated, we should be concerned at the activities of any extreme organisation in this country, be it an extremity of the Right or an extremity of the Left. In view of the latest accusations concerning activities of the CIA in Australia. I call upon the Government to institute a full-scale inquiry into espionage activities in this country. It is time the Government moved in on this area. In February last year accusations were made about the involvement of the CIA in the dimissal of the Whidam Government, and today similar accusations are made about the involvement of the CIA in the dismissal of the Labor Government. If the allegations are correct, the Government is falsely in control of this country. This evening I also wish to deal with the need for a manpower pohcy and the various policies being followed by this Government which must lead to more unemployment, particularly as the Government obviously does not understand or appreciate what is happening with employment with the impact of automation and new techniques. Unless the Government is prepared to have a full-scale inquiry to determine a manpower policy in this country, then although inflation may reduce, a large proportion of Austrahans will be left unemployed. For this reason I strongly support the amendment moved by the Opposition in this debate, which states in item (b): there is an urgent need for alternative consumer led recovery by cuts in indirect taxes and appropriate stimulatory expenditure on job creation and manpower training programs, all done in a context of not increasing inflation by (i) phasing out the more extravagant business tax concessionsof Of course we have a number of those. One is to come before the House next week which will cost interthe country another $340m. I am going a little a carefully in my reference to it. I will not deal with World the actual legislation. The amendment continues: (ii) increasing the money supply but not beyond the rate of inflation plus growth and (ih) instituting a more vigorous bond-selling program. Let me give the unemploymentfiguresfor 2 offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service in my electorate. In Blacktown at the end of March the grand total stood at 3241, of which 1671 or 51.56 per cent are people under the age of 18 years. This was a reduction of only 138 on the previous month. The decrease in the figures for this office and the other office I shall mention, Mount Druitt, was due to the recommencement of universities and colleges of advanced education and young people taking up scholarships. In other words, the decrease came about because people were going back to study, not because they had found jobs. In the Mount Druitt office, of a total of 3548 unemployed 1619 were under the age of 18 years. In other words, in that area over 45 per cent of the unemployed were young people. This was a decrease of only 143, which is a far smaller decrease than occurred in March of previous years. The reduction was due mainly to people taking up scholarships in colleges of advanced education and universities. This is a very serious position, but the important issue which should be looked at is what the future will be with the continued use of automation. Assume that an industrial organisation decides to go to the western suburbs of Sydney today. Of course that area is more alfected by unemployment than most other areas in Australia. Whereas previously it would have had a fairly highly labour intensive industry, today it would go in for massive capital investment assisted by the investment allowances of this Government. Such organisations employ equipment and machinery which wtil maintam their labour force at a minimum. For example, I know of a food processing company which moved from the mner suburbs near the centre of Sydney to the outer western suburbs. When it moved that companyfloggedits land in the inner city and utilised thatfinanceto put in equipment. The result is that in its new factory in the outer western suburbs it employs one-third of the people it employed when it was in the inner city. That is the pattern for the future. policies of promoting a Let us assume that we come to the end of the inflation cycle. Let us assume that business profits increase even more dramatically than some have increased recently, as in the case of Australian Iron and Steel. We will still be left with the position where a very large section of our population will be unemployed. Very thoughtful analysis is needed to ascertain the reasons for this. What is causing it? How is it to be overcome? What new areas of employment should there be? In my belief, encouragement is needed for industry to go out into the areas of high unemployment such as the outer western suburbs of Sydney. In my view, that encouragement should take the form of tax incentives and low cost capital, and I beheve the co-operation of both Federal and State Governments is needed to achieve it. If it is not achieved, the high rate of unemployment in these areas, particularly for young people, will continue. Instead of doing these things, this Government is carrying out a policy of deliberately increasing unemployment. It is deUberately cutting expenment diture in employment-giving areas, and the best example of what has happened is the city of berra, where unemployment has increased from approximately 1 per cent of the work force when this Government took office to 5 per cent. That has occurred because the Government has cut expenditure in employment-giving areas, and that situation is occurring all over Australia. employment in my area alone has increased nearly 30 per cent since this Government took office. I make the point that there is a very great need for the Government to conduct the necesswhich ary inquiry to establish a sound manpower icy, a manpower policy which will provide ployment for the future. In particular, the need for an unemployment relief scheme. On 2 days in succession this week, yesterday and today, I received correspondence from the ister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) refusing a proposition for the introduction of an unemployment relief scheme.",68
122,Mr WILLIS,GENERAL BUSINESS,It promised to bring in one.,69
123,Mr ARMITAGE,GENERAL BUSINESS,"It did originally. Once again, it has forgone another promise. The first instance relates to what is called the CYSS, the Community Youth Support Scheme. When the cusations, Minister requested me to do so, I called together the various interested parties at a meeting in Blacktown. Those people sat down and said: 'This scheme lacks teeth, but as much as possible and make the best use ofit.' The net result was that they made certain recommendations to the Minister. Included in those recommendations was the need for ployment relief scheme in areas of high unemployment. Yesterday the Minister replied declining the proposition. In the second instance, the time. correspondence received today relates to a proposition by the Penrith City Council that the Minister should receive a deputation which would support the introduction of an unemployment relief scheme. Without even receiving the deputation, without even listening to the arguments of the Penrith City Council, a councU which largely covers the area of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr GUlard), a Liberal member of this Parliament, the Minister declined to receive the deputation and declined to support the introduction ofan unemployment relief scheme. Today we are throwing down millions of dollars in unemployment benefits and are receiving nothing in return for the community as a whole. With the introduction of such a scheme, at least we would get benefits in the form of projects of lasting value to the community, yet the Governrefuses to do this. It ignores completely the impact upon the personality of the individual Canwho is unemployed and instead brings up ersatz propositions such as the Community Youth Support Scheme. For that reason I say that it is well and truly time the Government realised that an unemployment reUef scheme is essential not only to give people an opportunity to maintain their Undignity because they have employment but also by to ensure that the wastage of resources which goes on today does not continue. It is equally essential to introduce a viable manpower policy will take into account the impact which polnew techniques are having today upon industry emand upon employment, impacts which will be I refer to felt even more in the future. It is time, with the accusations of CIA inMinvolvement in Australia, that this Government realised that a full scale inquiry into espionage activity in this country is necessary. Twice now the accusation has been made that the CIA was involved in the dismissal of the Whitlam Government. In all conscience, and perhaps in an attempt to protect itself from such accusations, it is well and truly time that the Government conducted a full scale inquiry into these acand for that matter into any espionage activity in this country, and I make that call. I believe that this country deserves protection, and it is the job of the Government to give the country we will co-operate that protection. Debate (on motion by Mr Dobie) adjourned. an unemADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Ellicott, and read a first",69
124,Mr ELLICOTT,GENERAL BUSINESS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act of 1975 gave effect to the recommendations of the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee, the Kerr Committee, which reported in 1971. It was supported on both sides of the House. The Bill now introduced is intended to make some changes in the structure of the Tribunal to enable it to operate more flexibly in dealing with a much wider range of matters than at present. The Tribunal came into operation on 1 July 1976. It has jurisdiction to review decisions under a number of Acts, some ordinances of the ACT, and by-laws made by the Postal Commission and the Telecommunications Commission. Nevertheless, only 24 appUcations had been made to the Tribunal to 26 April last. Most of the legislation conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal is not of a kind that requires decisions to be made in a substantial number of cases. So far the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in the welfare field. Plans are now well advanced, however, to enable appeals to be taken to the Tribunal under the Social Services Act. Appeals will also be provided under a large number of ACT ordinances. It has become apparent that the Tribunal should have a different structure if it is to be equipped hear appeals on a wide range of matters without making excessive demands on the services of presidential members at a judicial level. The central feature of the amendments is to be found in clause 12 of the Bill. At present, subject to any provision to the contrary contained in an enactment conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal, the Tribunal must be constituted by a presidential member and 2 non-presidential members. What is now proposed is that the Tribunal may be constituted in any of 4 ways-by a presidential and 2 non-presidential members; by a presidential member alone; by a senior nonpresidential member- a new class of memberand 2 other non-presidential members; or by a senior non-presidential member sitting alone. Subject to any provision to the contrary in another enactment the President is to be empowered to decide how the Tribunal is to be constituted for a particular matter. The President when constituting a tribunal is to have regard to the degree of public importance or complexity of the matters to which the proceeding relates and to the status of the decision-maker whose decision is to be reviewed. Second Reading What is intended is that decisions made at ministerial or very senior departmental level would ordinarily be reviewed by the Tribunal constituted by or including a presidential member. So too would a decision in the nature of a test case made at a lower level of government. Of course, an appeal that begins as a straightforward matter may turn out to be a complex one or one of much public interest, or to involve difiicult questions of statutory interpretation. The Bill therefore makes provisions whereby such a case, it it has been set down before a non-presidential bench of the Tribunal, may be transferred to a presidential bench. These provisions are to be found in clauses 11 and 13 of the Bill. The amendments to be made to section 20 of the Act would empower the President to change the composition of a tribunal where it has not commenced to hear a matter. Again this discretion will be exercisable by reference only to criteria of complexity and public importance of the matter and the status of the decision-maker. Where the Tribunal has commenced a hearing the matter can be brought before a 'higher level' of the Tribunal under the proposed new section 21A which is inserted by clause 13. In such a case the change can be made only where a party makes an appUcation for this purpose and the President concludes that the public importance of the matter warrants the application being to granted. Now section 21A also provides for the case where only part of a matter requires to be dealt with at a 'higher level' of the Tnbunal. For example, where it is necessary to resolve a question of law, proceedings commenced before a non-presidential bench can be brought before a presidential bench for the purpose, and then remitted back to the non-presidential bench. Consequential upon the amendments referred to, section 45 of the Act is amended by clause 30 so that the Tribunal, when it does not include a 1residential member, may not refer a question of aw to the Federal Court of Australia without the concurrence of the President. This clause reflects the view that matters should not go to the court until the resources of the Tribunal have been exhausted. The creation of the new grade of senior nonpresidential member has required changes to a number of other sections of the Act. Clause 4 amends section 6 of the Act to provide for the appointment of such a member. Section 10 is to be remade by clause 6, to incorporate provision for appointment of acting senior nonpresidential members. Section 22 is to be remade by clause 13, to provide for a senior nonpresidential member to preside at a hearing of the Tribunal constituted as a non-presidential bench. Although the Bill does not require senior non-presidential member to have legal qualifications, it is intended that in practice training will be required for such an made appointment. Next, the Bill proposes some changes to section 26 of the principal Act. That section enables additional jurisdiction to be given to the Adminsimilar istrative Appeals Tribunal by regulations made under the principal Act. At present, however, isdiction can be given only in respect of decisions made after regulations providing for appeals against decisions under a particular statute come into force. This means that, where there is an existing review machinery under a statute, regulations cannot provide for the transfer to the done. Administrative Appeals Tribunal of matters pending before that existing review machinery the date on which the relevant regulations made. The purpose of clause 16 of the Bill is amend section 26 of the Act to facilitate the transfer, by regulations made in accordance with that section, of the jurisdiction of existing appeal bodies to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The other provisions of the Bill that require special mention are those relating to the protecbers uon of information that ought not, in the public interest, be publicly disclosed in proceedings fore the Tribunal or as a result of having been produced, in confidence, to the Tribunal. Section 36 of the principal Act empowers the Attorneyfore General to give a certificate that the disclosure information concerning a specified matter or disclosure of the contents of a document would be contrary to the public interest. The giving such a certificate does not prevent the informathere tion or documents being made available to the Tribunal, but it may prevent them being vides disclosed publicly or to parties to proceedings before the Tribunal. Except where the certificate is given on the ground that the disclosure would prejudice security, defence or international tions or would disclose proceedings in Cabinet, an Attorney-General's certificate may be lodged challenged before the Tribunal and may, if the ged them. Tribunal so rules, be set aside. Section 36 is to be amended in 3 respects. First, the question whether a certificate should set aside is to be determined by the President the Tribunal. This is consequential upon the ation of the new class of senior non-presidential members to preside at sittings of the Tribunal. Under the Act as it stands, where a presidential member presides at a sitting of the Tribunal, he would decide the question whether a certificate under section 36 should be set aside. Secondly, is to be made clear that where a certificate is set a aside this may be done on terms that only some of the parties may have access to the document legal or information concerned. Thirdly, it is to be clear that members of the staff of the Tribunal may have such access to a document or information the subject of a section 36 certificate as is necessary for them to perform their duties. A amendment is to be made to section 46 in relation to the staff of the Federal Court of jurAustralia. The Act does not provide for the Attorney-General to claim a like immunity from disclosure in respect of an answer to a question asked of a witness in proceedings before the Tribunal. New section 36A, to be inserted by clause 23 of the Bill, makes provision for this to be at Section 66 of the principal Act makes it an are onence for a member of the Tribunal, a former to member of the Tribunal, or a member or former member of the staff of the Tribunal to disclose any information acquired by him by reason of his office or employment for the purposes of the Act. This provision goes much too far. It applies whether or not the information concerned is otherwise publicly available. It subjects memof the Tribunal of judicial status to restrictions that do not apply to them in their office as bejudges. Accordingly, section 66 is to be replaced by a new section, to ensure that documents or information furnished to or given in evidence be the Tribunal cannot be required to be of produced or given in evidence in other proceedthe ings if there is a relevant certificate of the Attorney-General in force under section 36 of of the Act or the Tribunal itself has ordered that should be no public disclosure of the material. The proposed new section also prothat a person who is or has been a member of the Tribunal may not be required to give evidence in a court in relation to any proceedings before the Tribunal. Clause 28 of the Bill prorelaposes the insertion of a new section 43A empowering the Tribunal to return documents with the Tribunal to the person who lodIt is considered that proposed new sections be 43A and 66, together with the general provisions of of the law prohibiting unauthorised disclosure of creinformation, will give adequate protection to confidential information and the privacy of persons appearing before the Tribunal. Regard must also be had to the powers the Tribunal has under section 35 of the Act to prohibit the publication of evidence. Contravention of an order of it the Tribunal prohibiting the publication of material is punishable under section 63 of the principal Act. A new provision is to be made, by clause 36 of the Bill, for regulations to fix fees payable in respect of applications to the Tribunal. The regulations may provide for the refund, in whole or in part, of any fees paid when the proceedings terminate in a manner favourable to the applicant. The provision is included in the Bill so that, if it appears necessary to do so in any particular class of appeals, fees can be prescribed to deter frivolous applications to the Tribunal. The remaining provisions of the Bill relate to procedures in proceedings before the Tribunal. They are designed to simplify procedures and to facilitate the hearing of appeals by the Tribunal. Finally I should mention that the Bill has been very carefully considered by the Administrative Review Council which was appointed late last year. The Council endorses the changes proposed to be made to the structure of the Tribunal and to the procedures before the Tribunal. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA (JUDICIAL REVIEW) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Ellicott, and read a first time.",70
125,Mr ELLICOTT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS," I move: That the Bill be nowreada second time. This is a very significant measure. The purpose of this Bill is to reform the law relating to the by the courts of administrative actions of Commonwealth ministers and officials. The Bill is a further step in the on-going review of Commonwealth administrative law that began with the establishment of the Administrative Review Committee-the Kerr Committee-in 1968 by the then Attorney-General. The proposals by that Committee have so far resulted in the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Review Council and the enactment of the Ombudsman Act. Both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Review Council are in operation; the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been appointed and it is expected that he will take up his office about the end of June. The present law relating to the review by the courts of administrative decisions is in a most unsatisfactory state. A great deal has been written about the shortcomings of the present procedures and it is not, I think, necessary for me to elaborate on these deficiencies in the present context. The law in this area is clearly in need of reform-indeed , it could be said to be medievaland simplification and to be put into statutory form. What the present Bill seeks to do is to establish a single simple form of proceeding in the Federal Court of Australia for judicial review of Commonwealth administrative actions as an alternative to the present cumbersome and technical procedures for review by way of prerogative writ, or the present actions for a declaration or injunction. Before I proceed to say something about the details of the Bill, it may be useful to set these proposals in the context of the machinery for review already embodied in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Ombudsman Acts. It is very important that we get this in focus. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal is empowered to review on the merits any decision of a Minister or official acting under a statutory power if, but only if, the relevant legislation provides for an appeal to the Tribunal. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act does not confer a general right of appeal against decisions by ministers, officials and statutory bodies. Where, however, an appeal Ues to the Tribunal, the Tribunal may review on the merits the decision appealed from and substitute its own decision. Second Reading The Commonwealth Ombudsman is not restricted to the review of decisions taken in the exercise of statutory powers. He is empowered to investigate complaints against decisions of Commonwealth officials and statutory bodies, whether taken under statutory power or in the review ordinary course of administration. He is excluded from reviewing actions by Ministers, but he may investigate a recommendation made by a department to a Minister. He will not be concerned directly with reviewing the merits of the decisions or action of officials where no element of maladministration is present and, in particular, he will not be empowered to substitute his own decision for that under review. He may only recommend corrective action where he thinks there has been maladministration. No doubt in many cases his decision will lead to review. Judicial review by the Federal Court of Australia will not be concerned at all with the merits of the decision or action under review. The only question for the Court will be whether the action is lawful, in the sense that it is within the power conferred on the relevant Minister or official or body that prescribed procedures have been followed and that general rules oflaw, such as conformity to the principles of natural justice, have been observed. The court will not be able to substitute its own decision for that of the person or body whose action is challenged in the court. It will be empowered to enjoin action or to quash a decision itfindsunlawful and to direct action to be taken in accordance with the law. It will also be able to compel action by a person or body who has not acted, but who ought to have done so. It will thus be seen that the 3 avenues review, appeal on the merits to the Administratstatutory ive Appeals Tribunal, investigation by the Combe monwealth Ombudsman, and judicial review the Federal Court of Australia, provide different approaches to the remedying of grievances about Commonwealth administrative action. Each has its own place in a comprehensive scheme for the redress of grievances. Apart from the technical Umitations of present law for judicial review under the preapplies. rogative writs, a person who is aggrieved by a decision usually has no means of compelling the decision-maker to give his reasons for the cision or to set out the facts on which the decision is based. Lack of knowledge on these matters will often make it difficult to mount an effective chaUenge to an administrative decision even though there may be grounds on which that degation. cision can be challenged in law. Accordingly, one of the principal elements of the present Bill is provision that will require a decision-maker to give to a person who is adversely affected by decision the reasons for that decision and a ment of findings on material questions including the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. There is already a like provision in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act in respect of decisions from which an appeal Ues to the Tribunal. A draft of the present Bill was considered detaU by the Administrative Review Council, and the comments and recommendations of the Council have been embodied in the Bill that now before the House. I turn now to a description of the contents the Bill. It provides for review by the Federal Court of Australia of decisions of an administratreviewed ive character under an Act of the Parliament, Territory ordinance or regulations or rules under such an Act or ordinance. It also provides for the review of conduct engaged in or proposed to be engaged in for the purpose of making cision to which the Bill will apply. Decisions made by the Governor General under statutory authority are to be excluded, and there is provision for regulations to be made excluding classes of decisions from the scope of the Bill. The present law provides only a Umited scope for review of the exercise of statutory powers by the Governor General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council. Where the exercise of such a power is prima facie ultra vires, the courts can grant appropriate relief. But it appears doubtful whether the courts will inquire into the grounds on which advice is tendered to the Governor General. It will still be open, in any of case where such a decision is made in excess of authority, for the existing remedies to applied, but it has not been considered approby priate that the court should be empowered to inquire into the proceedings of the Federal Executive Council in the manner provided for in the present Bill. Specific provision is made in the Bill for the court to make an order requiring a decision to be made where there has been a breach the of duty to make a decision to which the Bill The grounds of review are set out in clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill. Clause 5 applies to a decision dethat has been made and clause 6 applies to conduct engaged in or proposed to be engaged in for the purpose of making a decision to which the Bill applies. Conduct includes the taking of evidence or the holding of an inquiry or investiThe grounds of review specified are those that have been developed by the courts. To avoid a stultifying further development of the law by the Federal Court of Australia, each of clauses 5 and his 6 contains the comprehensive ground that the statedecision made or proposed to be made would be of fact, otherwise contrary to law. Clause 11 of the Bill provides for an appUcation for review to be made in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court and for the time within which it may be made. An application for review under the Bill may be made by any perin son who is aggrieved by a decision. This term is defined in sub-clause 3 (4) to include a person whose interests are adversely affected by the deis cision or would be adversely affected by a proposed decision. These provisions relating to of the standing of a person to challenge Commonwealth administrative action may need to be when the Australian Law Reform a Commission presents its report on the law of made standing. The Commission currently has a reference from me on the subject. Clause 13 provides that a person who is entitled to apply for a a dereview of a decision may obtain from the decision-maker written reasons for the decision, includingfindingson material questions of fact. I have already referred to the importance of this provision. No longer will it be possible for the decision maker to hide behind silence. Clause 14 empowers the Attorney-General to give a certificate that the disclosure of information would be contrary to the public interest on a ground specified in that clause. These grounds cover those under which a claim of Crown privilege may be made before the court in judicial proceedings. The effect of such a certificate is that the information to which it relates need not be included in a statement under clause 13. Subclause (4) of clause 14 specifically provides, however, that the clause is not to affect the power of the court to make an order for the disclosure of documents or to require the giving of evidence or the production of documents to the court. The powers that the court may exercise on an application for an order of review are set out in clause 16. The court may quash or set aside the decision or part of the decision, refer the matter back to the decision maker for funher consideration subject to such directions as the coun thinksfit,make an order declaring the rights of the parties in respect of which the order relates, or direct any of the parties to do or refrain from doing any act or thing where the coun considers this necessary to do justice between the parties. Where there has been a failure to make a decision, the coun may make an order directing the making of a decision but not, of course, the making of a decision of a particular kind. The Bill is intended to provide a comprehensive procedure for judicial review of Commonwealth administrative action taken under statutory powers. Clause 9 of the Bill is intended to ensure that this jurisdiction is exclusive of the isdiction of State courts. The Judiciary Act has long embodied the policy that actions of Commonwealth officers should not be subject to review by way of mandamus or writ of prohibition in State courts-sectio n 38 of the Judiciary Act. The clause further makes it clear that actions of the Federal judiciary are not to be subject to review in State courts. The jurisdiction of State courts to grant habeas corpus is not to be affected. Parliament cannot legislate, ofcourse, to remove the powers of judicial review given to the High Court by the Constitution-sectio n 75 (iii). It is expected, however, that the procedures provided for by this Bill make resort to the existing procedures for judicial review unnecessary except where a review is sought of decisions excluded from review under the present Bill or otherwise in special circumstances. Most of the prerogative writs are granted on the discretion of the court and one would imagine that the High Court, faced with an application for a prerogative writ under section 75 (iii), would give careful consideration to the situation in which an application could have been made to the Federal Court under these provisions. Clause 10 of the Bill preserves any other right of review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. In particular, paragraph 10 (1) (b) provides that the Bill is not to affect the powers of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Government also has 2 further measures in hand as part of the program of reform of administrative law. These are a Bill to set down standard procedures for Commonwealth adjudicative tribunals, in line with the recommendations of the Kerr Committee, and a Freedom of Information Bill, which will entitle persons to have access to documents in the possession of Commonwealth agencies, subject, of course, to certain exceptions designed to protect the pubhc interest in the confidentiality of certain documents and proceedings. Both Bills are in the course of drafting and I would hope to be able to introduce the Freedom of Information Bill before the end of the present sittings of the Parliament. The other Bill, which sets down standard procedures, will certainly be introduced before the end of this year. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1976-77 Second Reading Debate resumed.",72
126,Mr DOBIE,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"We are at present jurdebating Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Before I get to the substance of my speech there are one or two items that I would like to bring before the House. First I would like to say it is some source of satisfaction to see that the accounting procedures of departments are such that the demands for funds under these Bills are 35 per cent less than they were at this time last year. In other words, the Government is seeking only a further $326m as opposed to a necessary $506m last year. Having just heard the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) speak in the House I looked at his Department's requirements. I am intrigued tofindthat there is an estimated saving in his Department this year of $4.19m under an item headed 'Maintenance, enforcement and property matters, reimbursements to States'. I would be interested to have more details of the estimate at a later time. I am also intrigued tofindthat there is to be a saving in our appropriations this year of $1,065,000 in respect of our defence cooperation with Indonesia. I sincerely hope that this does not indicate a lessening of our association with that country. When I heard the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) claim earlier in this debate that too much of present day economic debate was centred on the untrue fact that the Labor Government was responsible for economic chaos in Australia. I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. I do not know whether I have used his exact words, but every thinking Australian is only too aware not only of the chaos that resulted from 3 years of what is now outdated socialist rule but also of the unbelievable speed with which the Whitlam Government achieved this chaos. I do not doubt the sincerity and goodwill of the honourable member for Adelaide. But I beheve that if he were ever Treasurer of this country and the Party opposite were to govern again the constant adherence to the economic philosophy that was followed by Labor Treasurers would once more undo the work that the present Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has been undertaking for the past 18 months. The honourable member for Adelaide should bear in mind the comments of the then United States Secretary of the Treasury, the Honourable William Simon, when he addressed a meeting of the World Bank at Manila on 5 October last year. He said: Unfortunately, good economics is not always perceived to be good politics. My experience has been art with a high rate of discount. And while the pay-off to good economics is real, it takes time. This lag, as ists call it, is a politician's nightmare. Fortunately, I think that more and more people now understand that this is the case-and I sense growing suspicion of the proposed instant solution, the quick world of unlimited demands and limited resources, ministers are not only inevitably unpopular, but indeed not afford to be popular. We bad tidings-to reiterate the unpleasant but inescapable that resources are scarce while wants are limitless. It is our lot, whatever our country's economic system whatever its circumstances, to speak out for financial sibility-to call for prudence in an age of fiscal adventure. Mr Speaker, as you well know, this is the fact and the burden of a Treasurer of this House. honourable member for Adelaide, whose amendment is made up of easy glib words, achieved should bear this in mind. We should not forget that the last major economic statement made the honourable member for Adelaide was selfGovernment admittedly inflationary. We must get back to the consume. fact that the duty of any government is not to shield its citizens from the facts. The job of our Treasurer is to reveal the facts as they are. It should not be forgotten that we are still reeling under the effects and forward commitments of the socialist Whitlam-Hayden policies of 1974 and 1975.1 hope that the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) of the Fraser Government will, in his public statements, give more emphasis to the reasons why we have found ourselves in the economic position we now face. I am reminded of Macawber's simple statement. Macawber, as honourable members will recall, is a character from David Copperfield who in turn migrated to Australia. He said: Annual income £20 Os.Od.; annual expenditure £19 19s.6d.; result happiness. Annual income £20 Os.Od.; annual expenditure £20 0s.6d.; result misery. I will bring that slightly up to date and say annual income $22 billion; annual expenditure $2lVi billion; result happiness. Annual income $22 billion; annual expenditure $24Vi billion; result misery. There is no joy in being a supporter of a government that has to introduce economic policies to correct the extravagances of a previous government. This is the position in which this Government has found itself and in which it still finds itself. It is not too late to keep blaming the former Government. After all, the first 2 years of office of the former Government were successful because it was enjoying the fruits of policies brought down, if I may say, Mr Speaker, by you when you occupied the position of Treasurer in the former coalition Government.",74
127,Mr SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"I wtil allow the honourable that politics is an gentleman that indulgence. the econom Mr DOBIE- I thank you for your indulgence. We must bear these things in mind when talking of economic poUcies. We are not talking about how to manage some small business in the back fix. In a blocks or some small business in the suburbs. We finance are talking about managing the economy of a cancomplex, sophisticated society. It is not easy, as I are required to be the bearers of fact have said before, to correct the morass in which we found ourselves. It is not easy to reverse the and trend. It is no easy thing to generate confidence responand no member of this House will not have recognised the reduced rate of new investment in plant and machinery, despite the Government's The new investment allowance. No honourable member could say that the Government has all that it should have achieved. It has been a difiicult scene. Generating confidence in by the private sector will only come about if the provides incentives to produce and Although the amendment moved by the Opposition tries to beguile this House into believing that that is what it is trying to achieve, in fact the amendment, which I reject totally, is nothing more than a continuation of the economic clap trap that we learnt to expect between 1972 and 1975. However, I believe, as my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean) pointed out, that with the very happy announcement today of a small increase of 2.3 per cent in the consumer price index, we have reached a stage where we should be considering some stimulus for the private sector. If we are to continue to overcome the twin evils of inflation and under-employment, no amount of planning by itself will provide the answer. The economy must be encouraged to expand and this means providing incentives within the private sector to produce and consume. The principle of allowing market forces alone to dictate the level of production, whether it be primary produce or manufactured goods, is, I regret to say, not the whole solution. I hope that in the deliberations that are taking place now within the Cabinet some thought will be given to this and that some action will result which will stimulate the private sector and help it to expand.",75
128,Unknown,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,76
129,Mr DOBIE,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was expressing my pleasure with today's announcement of the small increase of 2.3 per cent in the consumer price index for the present quarter. I repeat my support of the remarks of the honourable member for Perth. He was a well known economist in Western Australia before he entered this House in 1975. He said that the economic climate is such at the moment that consideration should be given to providing incentives to private industry. I repeat my own earlier remarks: I believe that the economy has to be encouraged to expand and this means providing incentives within the private sector to produce and consume. I hope that we will see some evidence of this in this year's Budget for I can the House that there is great need for stimulation in the depressed metropolitan area of Sydney. Sydney has been very heavily anected by a series of major economic disasters. The closing and near nationalisation of British Leyland and the collapse of several of our major finance corporations in that city have presented a climate which needs localised transfusions and incentives. I sincerely hope that when the Budget is brought down this year we will see some evidence of that. I beheve, as I have already said since the resumption of the sitting, that I agree with the honourable member for Perth that we should, at this stage, be in a position to offer some form of stimulation and encouragement to the private sector. In my remaining few minutes I turn to what is one of the most pleasing announcements in the Bills being debated at the moment. That is the decision to provide $850,000 for the Community Youth Support Scheme under which financial aid is given to community groups which provide supportive services and programs for young unemployed people. In the Cook electorate we have proceeded with a scheme. We have called it the Cook Pre-Employment Committee-CPEC . We have already appointed our project officer, Mr Colin Pritchard, who has had considerable industrial experience. He has a great deal of community expertise, particularly in Sydney. We have also appointed a deputy project officer, Miss Susan Daevitt. She has had wide working experience in a variety of occupations as well as some very practical social community involvement. From that amount of $850,0001 am pleased to say that $22,500 has been provided in the Cook electorate for the year commencing 7 March. It covers salaries, materials, insurance, rent and telephone costs. We have already established a drop-in centre at Cronulla. We are investigating and negotiating another centre at Kurnell and we are looking for a third drop-in centre in the Miranda area. I am pleased to see the interest of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) because at present he, too, is in the course of creating 2 committees within his very large electorate. I am certain that he will have the same success as we are already achieving in Cook. I should like to mention for the record who are the people on the committee in my electorate. I have maintained the chairmanship of the committee. Also on the committee are: Mrs Helen Harding from one of the schools in the area, Mr Ray Cook, and Mr Tony White, who is officer-incharge of the Caringbah Community Health assure Centre, the Secretary of the Committee is Mr Rick Parry of the Commonwealth Employment Service office in Caringbah, and the Treasurer is Mr Graham Salter. I wish the honourable member for Hughes, who is trying to interject, the same co-operation from his committee as we are getting in Cook. With this committee we have already established close contact with all community groups and service organisations and we feel that we have had certain successes already. One of the constant problems of these community centres-this would apply in Hughes as in other areas-is to find ways and means of getting young people to come along to the drop-in centres. This is a serious problem and not to be taken lightly by anyone on either side of the House. Despite the nonsense that is being spoken by certain people, even on my own side of the House, there are unemployed young persons in this community who cannotfindjobs. The imputation put by so many people, that the unemployed do not want work, in my experience in the electorate of Cook is just not true. Mr Innes-Hear , hear!",76
130,Mr DOBIE,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"I am pleased to hear the honourable member for Melbourne say: 'Hear, hear!' This matter goes beyond party poUtics. I also wish the honourable member success with such a committee in the electorate of Melbourne. I sincerely hope that he has put forward a submission to establish such a committee. I would be interested to hear later whether in fact he has. Our early experience- I give this information to all honourable members-show s the desirabitity and practical effects of encouraging the young people who are out of work to become involved with the administration of the scheme. So far we have had great success. We have managed to place a large number of young people in work, beyond our wUdest anticipations. We have been impressed with the attitude of the young people coming to us seeking assistance infindingwork. I turn now to discuss our future. It will be to see what activities can be planned and to find out what jobs are avaUable. It is an area which at the moment is very exciting. This activity should be occupying every member of this House from either side. I think it will be a great disappointment if wefindin several months' time that there have been honourable members who for political reasons have decided not to proceed to take advantage of this community youth employment scheme. It is one of the great steps that the Government has introduced to meet what is a sorry situation of unemployment. Anyone who has anything to do with unemployed youth can feel nothing but deep compassion for this hard core of youth which cannotfindwork. This problem is serious. It is virtually beyond politics. matter that should occupy the thoughts of all of us irrespective of party and should go well beyond that consideration. The temptation is to go on to describe the scheme further but time will not allow me to do so. I hope that within this debate on the Appropriation Bills other honourable members following me will seefitto talk of their experiences as well. We cannot find a solution to our economic situation unless we find a solution for the unemployed who are desperately seeking work. This problem knows no electoral boundary; it knows no poltiical difference. It is something that is very serious and it affects many occupations. It is complex it is difficult: But I believe that the introduction of the youth employment scheme is one of the really positive moves that this Government has taken. I strongly support thefinancialpoUcies of this Government. As I said earUer in the debate, I reject out of hand the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Adelaide as yet another example of an inflationary solution to a serious problem which we inherited in December 1975.",77
131,Mr LES MCMAHON,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"In speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 3), let me first restate the amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). It states: That all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not denying the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that (a) the slashing of government spending is part of an inept economic strategy which has led to a decline in the standard of living of all Australians and (b) there is an urgent need for alternative policies of promoting a consumer led recovery by cuts in indirect taxes and appropriate stimulatory expenditure on job Creadon and manpower training programs, all done in a context of not increasing inflation by (i) phasing out the more extravagant business tax concessions, (ii) increasing the money supply but not beyond the rate of inflation plus growth and (iii) instituting a more vigorous bond-selling program'. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) permits the appropriation of $247m from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the purposes specified in the Schedule to the Bill. This amount is made up of $44m for wage and salary increases under the relevant departments and divisions. An allowance of $90m for such increases was made in the original Budget estimates but was not appropriated in individual salary votes. The sum of $9m is sought for the May referenda; $9m for Aboriginal programs; $38m for defence equipment cost increases, $32.5m for student allowances and $6.6m for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Bill was introduced by the It is a Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in this House on 21 April and the sum sought to be appropriated is only a pittance when compared with what should be given for capital works and services, payments to the States and other services. It is a disgrace that the country is coming to a halt. What can we expect in the August Budget this year- a freeze or a tease of the Australian people? The previous speaker from the Government side, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) congratulated the Government for saving money by tightening the belt. His electorate will not appreciate his remarks. The unemployed, the pensioners, small businesses, house owners and many others in this country will be worried by what the honourable member said topaying night. 'Life was not meant to be easy', said the and Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Government life is not going tralians.

How much will this worthwhile training scheme now under investigation by a select committee, which will recommend alterations to the legislation and trade-union pruning of administration costs, receive for its survival in the next Budget?

Labor Council is Government appointment of a committee to overhaul the trade union training scheme. Labor Council education officer, Bob Carr, said: 'Curtailment will lead to more strikes because many young men and women union officials have learnt and others are learning negotiation procedures, in avoiding strikes.' Another article in the Australian, entitled 'Union trainee programs face overhaul' states: The Federal Government is expected to overhaul national trade union training scheme it subsidises. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Mr Street, will announce within a few days the names three-man group to inquire into the operations scheme, for which the Government provided $3m last The authority was formed in 1975 under the former Government and provided for the setting up of a national training college in the Albury-Wodonga growth centre, Clyde Cameron Training College.

Union officials said last night there was no need inquiry and opposed the suggestion that the training should embrace management. I have had discussions with the Labour Council of New South Wales and the unions. They have stated that they are very perturbed over the issue and they are just waiting to see the outcome the full inquiry. The Canberra Times on 30 March this year reported: A combination of Liberal Pany backbench outrage over government money to the trades-union movement of resentment by established union leadership, is believed to have stimulated a Government decision to appoint Under his a three-man inquiry . . . to be easy for AusIt also states: sources were reported yesterday to confirm the budget for trades-union training would be severely back, as reported in the Canberra Times several weeks The Government's industrial-relations platform endorsed training, in terms coinciding with the courses which TUTA conducts.

The Government is believed to be looking to cut the budget for trade-union training and take away from union representatives control of the curricula in trade-union which are of great value colleges. Now I would like to speak about the Government's poorly conceived and short sighted plans to overhaul the trade union training scheme. the From the outset I think it is important to make it clear to the members of this House that this latest Relations, move by the Government is not an isolated of a affront to the unions, but one of a series of recent of the manoeuvres to shackle and provoke the unions. year. Apparently the Fraser Government is determined to cause industrial unrest, obviously as a Labor cover-up for its own ineptitude in handling the economy; but I would like to emphasise that it the would be a great tragedy if this unquestionably also successful scheme for union training is allowed to a full-time staff of about 75. be sacrificed for this devious purpose. Since its beginning in June 1975 this important alloinitiative of the former Labor Government has proven itself to be an effective means of assisting for an the unions and unionists to make the maximum scheme use of their resources and to participate more effectively in the industrial relauonsfield.Maybe this is what the Fraser Government and its big business friendsfindso objectionable about the trade union training scheme. Maybe the scheme of has proven itself to be a formidable match to management education, so that the employers no longer enjoy the unfair advantage in industrial relations which they were permitted to enjoy for so long. For a considerable time government has substantially funded various forms of management education. For instance, a federal government established-and this Government continues to fund it-the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales, and this is only one of the numerous forms of assistance currently given to the training of management. In contrast, prior to 1975 the total resources available for union training were negligible compared with those available for management training, and this was despite the fact that 53 per cent of wage and salary earners in public and private employment belonged to unions and that unions played such a key role in Australian society. For these reasons the trade union training scheme can only be seen as a move to balance government assistance to management training and not as a union advantage over management or a needless expense, as the Fraser Government would have us believe. No one questions government assistance to meet the needs of the private sector for skilled managers and no reasonable person should question government assistance to union training. After all, both these forms of assistance contribute directly to efficient business operation and industrial peace and thereby the well-being of the whole community. Prior to the establishment of the trade union training scheme the full-time union official was placed in the unique position of having to learn his or her skills on the job. There was nowhere that a plumber, an insurance clerk or a waterside worker could systematically or readily acquire new skills as a research officer or as a negotiator. With the introduction of the trade union training scheme union officials and potential union officials were given a much needed opportunity to obtain instruction in how to analyse the significance of the rapid changes currently taking place in industry and industrial relations. They were shown how to accept new ideas and methods and to perform more effectively their organising and administrative duties within the union movement. Having now been in operation for nearly 2 years, the trade union training scheme has proven itself to be effective in achieving its worthy goal of promoting trade union competence. In that short time it has achieved considerable success in the closure of the gap that previously existed between unionists and management and in the level of industrial relations, knowledge and technique. An important consequence of this achievement has been the diminishment of tension and frustration between the 2 parties and a more efficient avoidance and resolution of industrial conflict. In those circumstances it seems difficult to understand why the present Government has seen fit to conduct an inquiry into the trade union training scheme. One cannot help but be suspicious about the Government's intentions in this matter, especially when the Government sees no need to examine management training. It would not be surprising or uncharacteristic of this Government if it were to use the inquiry as a smokescreen to justify its intention to reduce the funding of the training scheme in the forthcoming Budget. In a Press statement dated 30 March last the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, claimed that there was an urgent need to inquire into trade union training. Mr Street made particular reference to 3 areas of trade union training which he considered the inquiry should examine. They were the desirability of integrating trade union training into industrial relations training generally and the closer integration of trade union training with the general education system; the role, membership and staffing of the statutory authority concerned with trade union training; and the cost and methods offinancingtrade union training. It seems very strange indeed that this Government should suddenly deem it necessary to conduct such an inquiry into these areas of trade union training when less than 2 years ago it saw fit to pass the Trade Union Training Authority Bill without opposition. The two amendments that were put forward by the then Liberal-National Country Party Opposition were accepted by the Whitlam Government. In seeking seriously to modify the Trade Union Training Authority the Government faces the same credibility problem it faces in seeking the passage of the constitutional amendments it opposed 3 years ago. Apparently this Government is not concerned about its inconsistency. In fact, inconsistency is becoming this Government's most consistent trait. In March 1975 when my colleague the then Minister for Labor and Immigration, Mr Clyde Cameron, presented the Trade Union Training Authority Bill he emphasised in his second reading speech the importance of trade union training remaining the sole responsibility of unions. On that occasion he stated: The traimng of unionists in union functions is a specialised task. Instructors and lecturers need to understand thoroughly their subject and the objectives and nature of the trade union movement. It must be the special responsibility of the union movement to formulate its own training schemes to accord with its own ideas and not to leave them to outside institutions. Thus, the conduct of courses cannot be a joint bility of unions and employers. lar problems facing employer and union bodies there is much they do not have in common. While apparently agreeing with in 1975, we now find the Fraser Government making a complete about turn on the matter and bowing to employer pressure to reduce union influence over the curriculum of each course and to appoint employer representatives to the counobjective cils administering the system. If that happens Trade Union Training Authority will surely much of its proven effectiveness and cease form its important function as a counterbalance to government assisted management training. the large range of government sponsored or sisted management schools currently operating in Australia, no emphasis is ever placed on ticipation by the trade union movement. If the Trade Union Training Authority is to remain a viable counterbalance to management training it is essential that this autonomy of the Authority not lost by its being diffused with management education bodies. The Government's industrial relations form endorses trade union traimng in terms inciding with the course that the Authority ducts. On the occasion of the Trade Union TrainGovernment ing Authority Bill being returned from the ate with amendments, the present Minister Employment and Industrial Relations is recorded in Hansard as saying: Now the Bill is perfectly acceptable to the Opposition. Why is it then that the Government suddenly tion finds it so necessary to conduct an inquiry into Arbitration union training when, less than 2 years ago, it ment's intentions. wholeheartedly supported the passing of the union power even It Trade Union Training Authority Bill? This Government's blatant victimisation the trade union training scheme is a deliberate provocation to the trade union movement. For instance, how much say do unions have in the role of membership, staffing and curriculum at the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales? The truth is that unions are not considered. How can eral and National Country Party back benchers and employer groups justly agree that they members. should be given representation in union training? At this stage I think it is important that I clear up any misunderstanding that may exist in the minds of honourable members. I am not advocating that all training activities for unionbut ists should be carried out in isolation rest of the community. Let me make this clear: I believe there is much scope for joint of both unionists and management representaresponsi- tives at courses and seminars held in industrial Whilst there are many simirelations and other associated areas. Such joint training is beneficial to both sections and should those sentiments be encouraged. However, these activities are not designed specifically to develop the expertise of unionists as officials and members in the union movement itself. Therefore, it is imperative that the primary of the Trade Union Training Authority the remain the adequate provision of trade union lose training for the trade union movement and by to perthe trade union movement. Honourable members must know by now that the policies of the Of Fraser Government are rapidly bringing this ascountry to the point where it wtil be wracked with widespread industrial disruption. The parGovernment's wages policy is undermining the wage indexation system and thereby raising the problem of considerable industrial disputation as unions try to restore real wage levels by pursuing is wage claims on individual employers. In addition, the Government is now launching a quite unprecedented attack on the trade union movement, involving widespread legislative and other plataction. In recent weeks, unionists have been cofaced with quite momentous amendments to the conTrade Practices Act, legislation to enable the to sack permanent public servants Senfor any reason, the proposed introduction of for tough new stand-down provisions for Federal Government employees and an inquiry into trade union training with terms of reference that portend substantial changes and cutbacks in funding. Coming on top of all this, the introducof amendments to the Conciliation and Act is proof positive of the Governis clearly seeking to smash though it is likely to provoke widespread industrial disruption by so doing. of The proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are clearly designed to debilitate and shackle the unions. The unions are doing a remarkable job in trying to keep peace in this country. Unions will be considerably weakened in respect of maintaining and retaining membership by legislative encouragement of Libnon-membership of unions and the prohibition of any action by them to recruit unwilling",77

When I say speak in sorrow, I do, and when I say that I speak in anger, I do.

Sadly for me, my State and good people, both Liberal and Labor, in Tasmania once again Tasmania is to be isolated and held to ransom because these people said this afternoon it was not possible to exempt Tasmania from the strike.

On Tuesday afternoon, following lengthy majority. discussions with senior officers of the Department of Transport and with the full co-operation and assistance of the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), who has been absolutely magnificent in this matter- I will pay many tributes to him for truth as to how a small gang the way he has handled the matter- I determined to make a personal plea as an ordinary back bencher of this Parliament, not as anybody special but as somebody who was concerned the about the fact that Tasmania had been held to would ransom with monotonous regularity. I rang the president of the organisation concerned, the Civil Air Operation Officers Association of Australia. I spoke to the Federal President, Charles Stuart. Let me say from the outset that I was pleasantly surprised at the way that he received my submission and at his undertaking that would put to the Federal executive of the air traffic controllers my submission, as the subister mission of an ordinary member of this Parliaadministration, ment, that Tasmania should be exempt from forthcoming strike. I merely asked that the gentlemen's agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions that Tasmania should be exempt from transport strikes should apply to this organisation, which as a matter of interest is not affiliated with the ACTU.

As I said, I was pleasantly surprised at the sympathetic hearing I received from Federal President. Mr Stuart told me that he put my submission to his executive. I hope that his executive, as a group of fair and reasonable men, appreciate that we in Tasmania have had enough of transport strikes. We have had Mr enough of being isolated and strangled. At the sametimeI pay a tribute to senior officers in the Department of Transport, particularly Mr Col Freeland and Mr David Graham, who were of utmost assistance to me. I repeat my tribute to he the Minister for Transport. Whatever unpopularity he may have incurred in years past as Minfor Shipping and Transport in a previous he has really stood up and fought the for Tasmania under the Fraser Government. Yesterday he was asked a question which I want to read into Hansard, not simply incorporate in Hansard, because it is significant that we note the question asked, the answer given and the response of the irresponsible industrial gangsters. This is what I asked Mr Nixon yesterday: I direct tny question to the Minister for Transport.

In the event eral executive deciding in principle to exempt from the strike, can the Minister assure the House and his Depaitment will do everything that the exemption for Tasmania eventuates? The Minister answered in the following terms: I should point out that the claims of the air traffic lers are presently before the Public Service Board. hopeful that the proposed and intended strike as by the air traffic controllers profess to be terribly optimistic about that at this view of the public statement made by the air traffic lers themselves.

The last time we had an air traffic controllers strike the Department of Transport, by adminis10 trative action, released air space between mania and the mainland.

The president of the air traffic controllers informed me that he felt that this had been dangerous on the previous end occasion. We were endeavouring to see whether a situation could be reached whereby if the air liar. traffic controllers said that they were prepared to exempt Tasmania from the strike the Department would have co-operated by making priate arrangements to ensure that with safety and under departmental control planes could fly in and out of Tasmania. What then happened? Following the Minister's answer in the House yesterday I was delighted to see the intervention in this matter of The the Deputy Premier of Tasmania, the Hon.

156,Mr HODGMAN,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The statement by the federal union secretary that it is not possible to honour an agreement which the Australian Council of Trade Unions said was possible is not good enough for this member of Parliament, not good enough for Liberal and Labor State members of Parliament and not good enough for the people of Tasmania. I was present this afternoon when the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), at his Press conference, informed members of the Press and through them the people of Australia that if this strike was not concluded by Tuesday next he would, on behalf of the Government of this country, introduce appropriate legislation into the Parliament. Let me say: 'Hear, hear! The sooner the better'. The sooner we get on to the statute books of this country legislation which will curb industrial anarchy and will call to order those who persist in picking on one State-the smallest-despit e the wishes of their rank and members the better. Witness the strike involving the Transport Workers Union last week that continued in Victoria until yesterday. Note the fact the members of that Union in Tasmania put Tasmania first and voted unanimously to return to work as from midnight last Monday week. We have reached a situation in which I believe this country can no longer permit present conditions to pertain. For my part, I make no apology at all for having asked the Government to give the most serious consideration to bringing forward the Industrial Relations Bureau legislation. The Minister, for reasons which he considers sound and which I accept, said that an undertaking was given. I believe we are getting very close to a stage at which we might consider taking one clause out of that Bill, bringing it on straight away and putting it straight through. I do not see why we should wait while others hold us to ransom. I refer to clause 26 of the Bill which will amend section 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and will have the effect of rendering liable- I merely say rendering liable because it wtil be for the Commission to decide whether to take the appropriate action-for deregistration organisations which, by strike action, prevent, hinder, or interfere with trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. How farcical it is that section 92 of the Constitution has guaranteed us that freedom for 77 years and we have not until now- I think the Minister will correct me if I am wrong-had to put something on the statute books to give section 92 teeth. As far as the people of Tasmania are concerned, the sooner that legislation is on the statute books better. I repeat, we have had a gutful of this. What I am saying is not just the view of my Party; it is the view of the other Party. It is the view of the Government of Tasmania. Whether the Government decides that that is the appropriate course to take or whether it should be some other form of legislation, let me say in advance that I wtil back it to the full. I wtil back publicly the Minister who has fought in this Parliament, not just this week but in previous months, for the State which I have the honour to represent. I wtil back the Minister for Transport to the hilt. I believe he will have the support of 99 per cent of the people of Tasmania. I hope that we find very shortly a situation in which those who determine that a few should override the wishes of the majority, those who promote industrial autocracy of the most irresponsible kind, will come to the end of their run. I say to the file honourable member for Sydney, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that far from the Government confronting the people of Australia and the people of Tasmania in particular, it is about time the Parliament took appropriate action to ensure that those who bash Tasmania will not get away with it forever but will be brought to a very speedy halt.",84

People such as Chief Commissioner Chambers and others have worked very assiduously. Those who knew something about industrial relations, such as Judge Foster and other gentlemen who were revered in the industrial area, brought together people-bot h employers and employees-wh o were in dispute. I am afraid that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) who has just resumed his seat has never had any experience in industrial relations, and thank God he has not. His outbursts in this place are enough to start a fight in an empty house.

161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Order! The honourable member should address the Chair.,85
162,Mr INNES,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. The amendment which the Opposition has moved spells out clearly and unequivocally the procedures and the processes that ought to be undertaken. The Government has failed miserably to carry out the promises it has made to the Australian people. It has failed miserably to come to grips with the overriding problems of inflation. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), who sits next to the honourable member for Denison, has clearly criticised the Government on its handling of the economy. The issues and the matters that are spelled out and the suggestions that are made in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) are the only things that are really constructive in relation to overcoming inflation. What have been the results of all of the concepts, processes and procedures adopted by the Government, including devaluation, in taking a heavyhanded attitude towards reducing the real level of the wages of trade unionists in this try? If the position is laid out clearly and concisely as it was laid out in submissions made to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission- I will refer to those submissions in a few moments - it must be accepted without argument that the real level of workers' wages in this country has fallen and that the recovery that was expected to result from the procedures and processes adopted by the Government has failed to materalise. The amendment points to the direction in which we ought to go from here. We say that the standard of living of all Australians has declined. We say there is an urgent need for alternative policies to promote a consumer-led recovery. At the present moment there is only one person in isolation who does not believe that a national conference of all the parties involved ought to be held. I refer to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He held a conference with the Premiers. The only item on the agenda was the second phase of federalism, and that really had nothing to do with coming to grips with the problems that irk the economy at the moment. When that conference could not agree on that agenda item the Government attempted to introduce a prices and wages freeze. But it was simply an exercise in ad hockery. Everything that we have come to expect from the Government has been in that vein. In his submission to the Arbitration Commission the advocate for the Australian Council of Trade Unions-hi s words are very clear-said : These facts are simply untrue and downright nonsense to present, if contrived as a diversionary tactic, as an act of considered statesmanship in introducing this proposition of a prices and wages freeze. The economic welfare of the Australian people deserves better than this sort of charade. The submission then went on to say: Illegitimacy of itself, however, should not damn the offspring. So let us examine the factual position now confronting the Commission. The submission then went on to spell out that the best way to understand what it ah meant was to understand that it was simply not a proposition for a prices and incomes freeze. It went on to say: While some subsequent noises have been emitted in these directions, there is absolutely no apparatus to deal in any way with professional or quasi-professional incomes and with those who derive incomes from dividends, capital gains or from various sources in the interest rate structure. Most importantly it is not a freeze upon prices. Already various spokesmen for those who derive their income from prices have made it quite clear that they will not hold prices constant. This situation has been emphasised by imports and many food items. People involved in these fields pay lip service to the freeze. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) countalks about employers taking a responsible position in relation to prices. But every housewife in this country will tell honourable members that in the food marts, in areas where specials are offered, the special price is taken off and the article is offered at the old price. So, for God's sake, I ask the Minister to remember that when we are talking in terms of increasing prices, we are not carrying out some academic exercise over in the Cabinet room. We are talking about what comes out of and what goes into people's pockets. If we look at the matter clearly and unequivocally we will see that as well as those other items to which I have referred the components of the consumer price index which cover private rents, house prices, repairs and maintenance, between 30 per cent and 40 per cent would not be subject to the prices freeze. So the whole thing becomes an absolute facade. The real issue is contained in the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Adelaide. Twist and turn as the Prime Minister might, the situation is that the Victorian Premier posed the proposition of cuts in indirect taxes.",85
163,Mr HOWARD,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Do you want me to respond to that?,86
164,Mr INNES,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"I do not want the Minister to simply respond. I do not suppose he can at this point. Instead of going on with all this bellyaching which we have heard from individual backbenchers, I would like whoever is going to respond to respond on the basis of the alternaters tives to the amendment. The Government's posals have failed. That has been spelt out by ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission and the majority of State governments. They have suggested that a national conference should conin sider on a national level all the concepts which are spelt out in the amendment. If the Prime Minister cannot be the captain, he wants to his bat home. He will not call a national conferThere ence even in the face of such a suggestion from the majority of Premiers, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and responsible emmeans ployee organisations. They have called for a national conference. If the Government introduces industrial legislation of that nature there will be a confrontation with the trade union movement. There was such a confrontation during the 1960s. I happened to of$32,400. be an industrial court advocate at that time. Such a confrontation faUed then and it will faU again. Any government which declares a situation which will wreck the ConcUiation and Arbigins tration Act is doomed to faUure. Such action brought down 2 governments, one in this country and one in the United Kingdom. If such action attempted again it will bring down this Governdeprived ment. But I do not believe that that is the spirit which this situation ought to be approached. The honourable member for Denison faUed to realise that 2 people are involved in an argument. It very easy for employers to play a straight bat until such time as all the words run out and then to use whatever legislation is available, but not a conciliatory fashion. They move to the penal provisions which are contained in the legislation in order to impose their will upon others. That is society. exactly the proposition with which we are confronted. If such a situation occurs we convince anybody by trying to batter submission. The processes of conciliation ought to apply in this area. Proper tribunals ought to established for that purpose. Pressure was plied by the Prime Minister and the responsible Minister in the oU industry dispute, as no will be appUed in the current dispute, to ensure that the dispute was not resolved. I believe that the oU companies must be up to their eyebrows trouble because they have agreed to grant some concessions so that the dispute could The Government is interested only in applying pressure, as the Prime Minister applied pressure on the oU companies not to grant concessions, to aggravate major disputes. The oil companies were told that they would be in serious trouble if they relented to pressure by the unions. I would now like to refer to a number of matcontained in the Appropriation BUls. Cuts prowere made in proposed expenditure last year the and further cuts are to be made this year. These by cuts affect those people in the community who can least protect themselves. They affect people receipt of social welfare benefits, pre-school education and migrants. They affect the services provided by welfare programs which depend on take supplementary advances from the Government. is to be a saving of $7,000 in division 175 1.02 which refers to overtime payments of the Australian Legal Aid Office. This estimate really that the Office cannot cope with the overload that it has at the present ume. Further cuts only aggravate the position. Expenditure on legal aid services has been reduced by $2,496,400. At a time of increasing demand for legal aid services it is surprising that a saving of $7,000 can be achieved from a meagre allocation The subject of education was debated in this House today. The honourable member for Hig(Mr Shipton) was a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties and he knows very well that is there are children in this country who are of the opportunity of achieving their in maximum level of educational development. This is particularly so in the migrant area where, as I have pointed out a number of times, the miis grant child is trying to put his backside on 2 stools-h e is losing his mother tongue and trying to learn English. In many cases migrant children in cannot achieve this objective and because of the inadequacy of our education services they are destined to fill the more meagre positions in our do not Mr SHIPTON - You know that we are as symthem into pathetic as you say you are.",86
165,Mr INNES,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Why does the honourable membe ber not go into his Caucus room and stand up to apthe Prime Minister and some of his colleagues and ensure that cuts are not made in that area. doubt it The adult migrant education program in Australia, including part-time instruction, is to be cut by $74,000. Expenditure on the child migrant in education program is to be cut by $983,400. Also, $419,000 is to be cut from the adult mibe resolved. grant education program. Spending on migrant education programs was reduced by 2 per cent in real terms in this year's Budget. A saving of $4,000 will be made under division 274.3.01 under the item of 'Special investigations' for the Schools Commission. An amount of $167,000 has been cut from this item which is vital in the development of multilingual education programs. Honourable members might be interested to note that $404,000 was allocated for this item in Labor's 1975-76 Budget. Only $120,000 was allocated in the Budget for this financial year for those special investigations into the educational needs of disadvantaged groups in this community. Even this meagre amount has been squeezed by another $4,000. The Government claims that it is interested in reducing the educational disadvantage that migrant groups suffer because English is not their first language, but where is there some allocation to implement the recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties. I ask my colleague, the honourable member for Higgins: What has happened to the report? The Government has done absolutely nothing about those recommendations and yet he and I stood up here in this House pressing for their implementation.",86
166,Mr SHIPTON,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,AU will be well.,87
167,Mr INNES,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Yes , in the sweet bye and bye, when they have beards down to their ankles and the kids are on the end of a pick. That is when it will be OK. Like all the programs which the Government implements, the Government acts only after the ball game is over.",87
168,Mr SHIPTON,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,We know what it is all about.,87
169,Mr INNES,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Yes , I am sure. The tears are streaming down the honourable member's face. Technical education is one of the most serious areas of need in this countiy. Expenditure on research investigation is down again by $3,000. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1976-77 reduces expenditure on this item by 50 per cent, from a total of $219,000. The 1976-77 Budget allocated only $ 125,000 for this item, a reduction of 50 per cent in real terms on the 1975-76 allocation. Yet we hear all this drivel about what we are doing in regard to technical and further education. There was a meeting of educationists in Victoria recently and I noticed that some of our friends were there. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) was there going for the lick ofhis Ufe trying to talk himself out of trouble. I wonder how he faced up to that situation. I hope he did as well there as he does with his bees; I believe he is an expert in that field. These cuts seriously jeopardise research aimed at meeting the needs of ethnic groups, and the honourable member for Holt ought to be mindful of that. How does he explain that to the people of the Dandenong area who require this research? In regard to the expenditure of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, there is a saving of $ 10.87m on the National Employment and Training scheme for which there was a total appropriation of only $40m. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1976-77 reduced expenditure on the NEAT scheme by $5.1m by reducing the allowances payable to trainees. The Government claimed that it could assist more people with retraining assistance as a result of its decision. This further reduction in expenditure, or 'saving' as the Government euphemistically describes it, demonstrates that the Uving allowance paid to NEAT trainees is not adequate. Clearly many people have had to abandon the programs. Anybody sitting in this Parliament knows that people who have had pressures placed on them and have not been able to bear those pressures have had to abandon programs. They simply cannot afford to continue them. Discrimination reigns supreme in every area to which one can point. So I believe that if there were an ounce of principle in the decision making process on the Government benches, honourable members opposite would not only support the amendment but also would apply sufficient pressure on the Prime Minister to ensure that without any prevarication he accedes to the wishes of the vast majority of people in this country by calling a national conference to deal with all the issues that are contained in the amendment. It is only by doing that that we will get an overall view of the situation, do what is required and at least head us in the direction of overcoming the economic Uls of this countiy.",87
170,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Having Ustened to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) and his reference to specinc learning difficulties I am more than ever convinced that it is not only chUdren who suffer from specific learning difficulties. The Australian Labor Party will never learn; it has not learnt yet. When one listens to the speeches of honourable members opposite one realises that even those 3 years when they were in government-disastrou s though they were-hav e taught them nothing about the operation of a sound economy and the benefits of such an economy to the whole of the Australian people.,87
171,Mr HODGMAN,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"And they still do not care for Tasmama, either.",87
172,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"That could well be true. I support the Appropriation Bills now before the House and the statement of savings in the information paper put out by the Department of Finance and dated 21 April 1977. The Government is now demonstrating its ability to cope with the gigantic task of stemming the tide of galloping inflation and the flow-on from the disastrous economic poUcies of the previous Labor Government. There is no doubt that the present Government was overwhelmingly returned to office in the nick of time-the right time-to halt the headlong gallop into hopeless debt initiated and further promoted by the Whitlam Government. The Fraser Government has stopped and reduced, and in some areas stopped the enormous spending spree which appeared to be the enjoyable task of those honourable members opposite and which led Australia into one of the biggestfinancialmesses that this country has ever seen. Faced with an enormous and historically high Budget deficit made and left by the Whitlam Government, the Fraser Government has acted responsibly and sensibly in reducing the deficit from some $4800m to about $2600m, and that is no mean achievement. This has been done at some cost to popularity because under these circumstances responsible government has to take action which is not lar and I hope that this Government has the courage and determination to continue to take that action untU such time as the country is back to where it ought to be, that is, in a reasonably prosperous condition for the benefit of all Australians. The reduction of the deficit through determination and responsible action has been criticised by a small percentage of people-perhap s a number of people-certainl including the rather small percentage of honourGovernment able members who occupy the Opposition fact, benches in this Parliament. Mr Lucock-That is why they will continue occupy those benches.",88
173,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"As my friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) says that is where they will be for a long time to come. The Governreductions ment's action in reducing the Budget deficit taken time. We recognise that. No doubt it taken longer than the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) or any Government supporter would like to have seen. However, the GovernGovernment ment's determination has saved Australians Australian business thousands of dollars-eve could be said, millions of dollars-in interest rates. If the Government had sought funds overseas to get this country out of the Whitlam economic debt, then we would have been forced to pay very dearly to borrow that money. We have not had to borrow the money because of the economic restraint that has been placed on the economy by this Government and which has been criticised so roundly and solidly by the Opposition. It would have had a disastrous effect on ordinary Australians if we had had to borrow that money overseas and businesses would have been forced into borrowing money on the world market at high interest rates. It would have forced interest rates up to astronomical levels if that action had been taken. The Opposition does not seem to realise that interest rates could possibly have reached 20 per cent. What sort of disaster would that have been? That is where Australia was heading before this Government took office. The Government has not had to burden Australians with that type of interest rate and with the dark prospects that that envisages. I would Uke to see interest rates much lower than they are at the present time. This Government has kept interest rates down to their present levels from the very high rates they would have been if the Government had not come into office. If this popuGovernment was not in charge of the Treasury now I would hate to think what would have happened to the ordinary Australian and to business economy of this in this country. Apart from these very important measures the Liberal-National Country Party Government has been able to save the Australian taxpayer mUlions of dollars. The reductions in expenditure y over the past 16 months have enabled the to keep tax collections down. In it has been able to reduce the tax burden through tax indexation. This is not generaUy accepted but it should be. The Treasurer (Mr to Lynch) has indicated that the Treasury wiU save more than $98m in 1976-77 and that is shown in Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 which we are debating tonight. Significant savings will be made in the PubUc Service area because of in staff numbers. Administrative costs has will be lower. For instance, the administration has costs for the Department of Primary Industiy will be reduced by some $396,000. This is an area in which I am very interested and in which I have been engaged for most of my life. So, the is prepared to undertake restraint and right across the board. In the Department of n it Overseas Trade there wtil be a saving of some $5.9m. In the Treasury the saving wtil be $11.4m and in the Department of Transport the saving will be $ lm, to name but a few. We are dependent on private enterprise for a large proportion of our employment. There has been a nervousness among investors which has to be overcome. The progress is slow, which is understandable when one thinks of the way in which the Labor Government wrecked the economy during its 3 years in office. People have to be assured that the present Government can restore the economy. We have certainly faced a colossal task in bringing the Budget closer to a balance. That is our objective. We have found opportunities to further our economic philosophy, which hinges on private enterprise. Anyone who realises the importance of private enterprise will understand that this is where a high percentage of employment opportunities lie. In promoting private enterprise we are endeavouring to create employment opportunities for the Australian people. The Government has restored no less than $ 1,000m to corporate and wages sectors through taxation reform. This has been done to allow the private sector to grow. That is our objective. The groundswell for recovery is now apparent. In the half year to December 1976 company profits grew by more than one-third. That is a fair reply to those who say that we have not made any progress in that area. As a share of non-farm national product, profits recovered to nearly 15 per cent from their low point of about 11 Vi per cent reached during 1974-75. Mr Antony Whitlam-How are farm profits going?",88
174,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Farm profits have increased to some extent but they have not increased much as we would Uke. Certainly if the honourGovernment able member's Party had been in office they would be much worse than they are today, becial cause the Labor Party has not the sUghtest symthe pathy for the farm sector. It has always same. There is not a semblance of sympathy for Whitlam) primary industry on the other side of the House. There never has been and there is not likely to unless honourable members opposite change has their attitudes. In the December quarter of 1976, compared with the same quarter of 1975, expenditure real terms on dwellings was up 20 per cent. This is another area of national importance in which we are interested. Expenditure in real terms plant and equipment was up 18 per cent and pering. sonal consumption in real terms was up 4 per cent. All this growth occurred despite a reduction in real government spending. Honourable members opposite said that that growth would not occur and that it could not occur, yet it is occurring. That growth was achieved in the private sector. In the farm sector, which has been mentioned, we have introduced a system of income equalisation deposits to smooth out some of the income peaks and troughs which are inherent in the agricultural sector and which adversely affect had individual farmers' investment plans. We are continuing to support the apple and pear industries through stabilisation. A new rural adjustment scheme has been introduced. Carry-on loans, debt reconstruction and farm build-up have been continued. Rehabilitation assistance has been increased and household support introduced. It had to be introduced to counteract the drastic effects of the poUcies of the previous Government. The fruit growing reconstruction scheme has been extended and the conditions relaxed. In the beef industry, which has suffered very severely, substantial assistance has been made available to assist beef producers, including $ 15m for carry-on loans and the suspension of the Labor imposed meat export inspection charge. That is the sort of thing Labor introduced. Mr O'Keefe-They priced us out of the overseas market.",89
175,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"As my friend from Paterson says, they priced us out of the overseas market. This action is estimated to save producers some $35m thisfinancialyear. An amount of $ 18.5m has been allocated to tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaigns, not only to the benefit of producers but also to the benefit of Australia as a whole. Slaughter compensation was introduced as for the first time. With respect to wheat the has increased the first advance to $66 per tonne or $1.80 per bushel for this finanyear, which is an increase of 20 per cent on previous year. I wonder whether the honourbeen the able member for Grayndler (Mr Antony wants to hear more of this or whether he has had enough. He is very quiet now. These be are some of the initiatives that this Government taken in the short time in which it has been in office. The Appropriation BUls now before the House wtil allow the Government to continue the successful progress upon which it has embarked, in ultimately to get the economy of the country back on a sound basis, to the benefit of every Australian- a benefit which a country having the on natural resources that we have should be enjoyIt is high time that we did enjoy them, too. There has been an agreement on meat classification by the Agricultural CouncilMr Armitage-You are giving them another $350m through a reduction in taxes.",89
176,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,I hear some silly noises on Grayndler the side. There has been an agreement,90
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Mr Martin)Order! Firstly, the honourable member for February Chifley is out ofhis seat and, secondly, all jections are out of order. I know the honourable member for Maranoa is being a trifle provocaAustralia. tive but I suggest that the honourable member for Chifley should try to restrain himself. Mr Armitage- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I am not in my place, does that mean that I may interject?",90
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,No. All interjecvided tions are out of order.,90
179,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"A classification scheme will give producers of beef true returns for their cattle. So honourable members will see that it important that beef producers get behind their organisations to implement a classification scheme as soon as possible. It was announced this week by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) that the Government has endorsed proposals submitted by him for an Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to replace the present Australian Meat Board. No doubt there will be some criticism that the Corporation will not be completely producer controlled, but I hope that we will look at the total construction the proposed Corporation before these criticisms are fully developed. Mr O'Keefe-Before it is finalised.",90
180,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"That is correct. Although bulk of the present functions and powers of the Meat Board will be retained by the Corporation, there will be some significant changes. In other areas of primary industry the Government has introduced a special deduction of $50,000 apply where an interest in an estate passes surviving spouse. That is a very effective measure to try to protect those people who have made some savings during their lifetime. That should be encouraged. In the case of the estate of mary producer passing whoUy to a surviving spouse, the estate will be completely free of if valued at $98,000 or less. In famUy allowances the Government has introduced allowances payto able for each chUd under 16 years of age, or under 25 years of age if receiving full time cation. This is a great help as most country familtasks ies are bigger than those in city areas and have difficulties of distance that do not apply in the ies. We have extended the eligibility for unemall ployment benefit to farmers suffering financial hardship who have registered for the benefit. I wonder whether the honourable member for is still interested in what we are doing for the farmers. An additional $ 100m has been provided since this year to bring expenditure on roads interin rural areas during 1975-76 to some $260m. Roads are a vital necessity in all areas of Despite the Government's prime objective of restraining expenditure and thereby lowering inflation, it is still increasing its aUocation for road building. That is something for which we should be grateful. For example, it is intended to increase the allocation for roads by $38.3m in 1977-78 over the level of funds profor this financial year. There is a very great need for local government to be assisted even more than at present, preferably in my opinion by way of an increase in the percentage of income tax being allocated to local government. is This is demonstrated by the fact that in many rural areas at least rate charges have reached saturation point and have become an increasingly heavy burden, particularly on those rural industries still struggling to survive. We have extended free telephone installation in country areas to a distance of 12 kUometres instead of 8 kilometres. Might I remind the Opposition that when we were in government previously we were prepared to extend that limit to of 24 kUometres to enable people who could not afford to pay something like $5,000 for a phone to be provided with such a service. But when the Labor Government came to office the limit was brought straight back to 8 kUometres. We have the now extended it to 12 kUometres. Mr Bourchier-Sham e on them.",90
181,Mr CORBETT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"As the honourable member says, shame on them. We have provided $50m to to helpfinancerelief measures for primary proto a ducers. Apart from these very important measures the Liberal-National Country Party Government has been able to save millions of dollars for the Australian taxpayers. The a primeasures that have been introduced certainly have been across the board. I have mentioned duty primary industry specifically because in the course of this debate many people have referred other aspects. We have faced colossal tasks in deaUng with the whole problem that was before eduus. No doubt we will have to face those sorts of in the future. I am surprised that the Opposition has not recognised the necessity for the citimprovement of our economy for the benefit of people. The people who are most adversely affected-I heard this phrase used earlier-by a disrupted economy are the people in the lower income bracket. Those are the people we are trying to help, as well as the rest of the Australian community, by our economic poUcy. I know something about that area. I was not born with a stiver spoon in my mouth. I know some of the problems which are confronting those people who Uve on low incomes. It is because of that that we have continued to try to provide an economy which will enable the Uving standards of this country first of all to be stabilised and then improved. Until such time as the Opposition recognises that there cannot be an increased standard of living without increased productivity, it will never learn. That is the real basis upon which an increased standard of Uving can be provided. AU Opposition members worry about is pleasing their bosses, the people to whom they have to kow-tow all thetime.They are a small section of union leaders who are more concerned with promoting their own positions in the unions than they are with the benefit of the people whom they are supposed to represent. I compUment the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), who is sitting at the table at the moment, for saying that the trade unions are the real Opposition today. That is an indictment. I give him great credit for having the courage to be able to present that unpleasant truth to his colleagues who sit behind him in the Parliament. That is a fact. As was pointed out in some of the leading articles in the Press today, it is not due to the fact that there are smaller numbers in the Opposition. It is due to the very poor performance of those people who sit on the other side of the House. This has been clearly demonstrated. The Opposition has a full shadow Ministry which should be able to cope. It has the forms of the House to use if it has criticisms of this Government. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is prepared to say that the trade union movement is the real opposition in this country today, that is an admission which, I think, should be highhghted. One of the actions the Labor Party took was to get rid of some of the better Ministers it had. I believe that my friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) did quite a good job in his portfolio. What reward did he get for it? Where is the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) sitting today? He is on the very back bench after doing a very good job in the education ministry by comparison with other Labor Ministers. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will remember that. If he is doing a good job within the Labor Party, he is likely to be moved out of the front bench and on to the back bench. It is studded with such people. The reward for doing a good job for the Labor Party apparently is to be relegated to the back benches. My friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh is smiting very broadly. He reatises the great work he did for his Party not only in the Parliament but outside it. He solved many problems for the Party. His reward was to be sent to the back bench while people of lesser quaUty took his place on the front bench. I support the Appropriation Bills now before the House I hope that, through them, the Australian people will realise what a good job this Government is doing and that they will have the sound common sense to keep this Government in office for years to come so that the economy may be returned to the condition in which it ought to be to enable Australians to enjoy the standard of prosperity that our resources should enable us to enjoy.",90
182,Mr UREN,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Normally I do not enter this sort of bun fight when the mentality seems to be 'We did this and they did that'. But the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) said that I made a statement that the trade union movement is the main opposition to the Government in this country. He did not mention the treachery of the parties opposite, and the treachery of the forces involved in the coup of 11 November-treacher y which has never been known before in the history of this Parliament. Mr Donald Cameron- I take a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",91
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,It had better be a point of order. Mr Donald Cameron-There is a standing order which says that no member may reflect on Her Majesty or her representative. To suggest that the Governor General was part of treachery is a reflection. I ask that the reflection be withdrawn.,91
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,I cannot uphold the point of order. The honourable member for Griffith is not stating what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said and he knows it. Mr Donald Cameron-You are supposed to listen.,91
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,If you keep saying that you will not be in the House to listen yourself. I suggest you watch what you say. What you are saying is a reflection on the Chair.,91
186,Mr UREN,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"As I was saying, the treachery of the then Opposition, now the Government, was the basis of the conspiracy that existed in this country. Having said that I turn to the matters that are to be brought forward to try to destroy the trade union movement in Australia. Within the next few weeks we will have legislation before this House on amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and amendments to the whole basis of the Trade Practices Act. There has been a threat of even using the corporations power. There will be an onslaught on the trade union movement in this Parliament of a kind not seen since Federation. The Government is trying to crush the real freedom of the trade union movement. It is trying to use these measures as a smokescreen. The honourable member for Maranoa, a member of the National Country Party, talked about rural roads. He proudly raised of the increase in expenditure. Yes, there is to be an increase in expenditure of 8V4 per money terms in the coming year. In real terms that means 3 per cent to 6 per cent less than last financial year. That is the real Government's action. There is a real cutback in capital works and I want to deal with that in some depth in my contribution tonight. Mr Bourchier-Tell us about education.",91
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Order! The honourable member for Bendigo has interjected- I have been counting-o n 15 separate of order. occasions. Mr Bourchier-That is not true.,92

189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Order! That is sevplaced enteen. I remind the honourable member for Bendigo- I do not see his name on the speakers list-that he has the opportunity to speak if wishes and that opportunity will be given to him. I suggest that Mr Bourchier-Well,92
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Order! I suggest about that the honourable member for Bendigo cease interjecting. I intend to see that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets the same opporper tunity to speak as I gave to an honourable ber from the National Country Party, the ment honourable member for Maranoa. Mr Bourchier-On a point of order, Mr building Deputy Speaker, I challenge your claim that interjected 15, 16 or 17 times. that many times at all. If I had done so you would have been remiss in not calling me to order sooner. I interjected 3 times. Other people interjected; not me.",92
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,I am a very tolerant person when in the chair. I try to maintain a certain amount of discipline in the House but I also recognise that there has to be a certain amount of give and take. Mr Bourchier-But you stated the number of times.,92
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,Order! The honourable member has been here long enough to know that he cannot interject when I am on my feet. I suggest we allow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak. I intend to see that he is allowed to speak.,92
193,Mr UREN,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,I hope that at the end of my time. I the question am given an extension of time. Mr Bourchier- I do not wish to interrupt the cent in Deputy Leader of the Opposition,92
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"Are you raising a measure of this point of order? Mr Bourchier-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, you stated the number of times that I interjected. I am sorry but I do not agree with you and I think I have a right to do that when you state the number of times.",92
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,That is not a point,92
196,Mr UREN,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"I want to look at the present plight of the building and construction industry in the economic context of the amendment by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). There is no doubt that the economic policies of the Fraser Government have the building and construction industry in jeopardy. The residential sector has grown quite strongly in recent months but this has been offset he by a decUne in the non-residential sector. It is most unlikely that the levels of real fixed capital spending in buUding and construction will reach the 1975-76 level in this financial year. On present trends real spending in 1976-77 will be 4 per cent below the level of 1973-74. This spells out a very drastic message for the industry which expanded at an average annual rate of 6 cent through the 1960s. Thefiscaland monmemetary policies followed by the Fraser Governhave tightened the screws on the construction industry. It is very likely that the position will get worse. Capital works programs and the and construction industry in particular I are bearing the brunt of the Government's econI did not interject omic strategy. Quite clearly, the Government is pinning its hopes for a revival on 2 factors: It is relying on the continued recovery of the residential sector and it is looking for a rapid expansion of the mining sector to boost the new capital works programs. In my view, both these hopes are groundless, for reasons I shall develop. In thefirstplace, the growth in the residential sector, while strong, has shown signs of tapering off. In 1975-76, it grew very strongly-abou t 20 per cent in real terms over the year. The rate of growth was strong in the first half of the present financial year, but it is now showing signs of levelling off. The growth for the whole year is expected to be just under 10 per cent which is a sharp drop over that of the previous year. With monetary policy very tight at the moment there is no reason to expect a drastic spurt in growth in 1977-78. In the non-residential sector the position is much more grim. Total spending is expected to decline by about 4 per cent to 5 per cent in real terms. This follows on the fall of one per cent in 1975-76. Short term prospects are bleak and we can expect real output to remain depressed in 1977-78. It seems that this will happen although private non-residential construction will pick up by around 10 to 15 per cent in real terms in 1977-78. The private sector accounts for only one-third of non-residential spending. If the pubUc sector declines by 5 per cent or even more as now seems Ukely, the best that can be expected for the industry is no growth-and I stress that. It may even decUne further-by as much as 4 per cent or 5 per cent. The output of the entire industry, both residential and non-residential is expected to decline by one per cent in 1976-77-abou t 4 per cent in real terms below the output of 1973-74.1 stress that the output for 1976-77 is expected to be about 4 per cent below the output of 1973-74. That is how depressed the industry is. At this stage the prospects for any sustainable recovery are not good. We know that Budget strategy is dictating that there will be no increase in capital outlays. The impact of this strategy on public capital expenditure will probably mean a decline in real terms in activity in the industry. WhUe a hard Budget holds down spending in the non-residential sector, tight monetary policy will curb activity in the residential sector. Because the level of output of the industry has declined over the past 3 years, the capacity of the industry is being eroded. This is having a severe effect on an industry which grew at an average annual rate of some 6 per cent through the 1960s. In 1976 unemployment in the industry averaged about 5Vi per cent compared with 4Vi per cent for the total work force. The relative rates were 1 % per cent in 1974 and 2 per cent; now they are 5% per cent and 4te per cent respectively. In November 1976, the industry accounted for about 11 per cent of the total unemployed in the economy, well above its share of the labour force which is about %Vi per cent in direct employment terms. Between November 1975 and November 1976, the total labour force increased by only about 6000 persons. Over the same period, the labour force in the construction industry fell by approximately 6000 persons, or about one per cent of the total construction work force. This shows how the capacity of the industry is being eroded and how deep-seated is the malaise in the industry. I have referred briefly to the impact of the present Budget and I want to develop this point a little further. When the present Budget was formulated the Government set out to hold outlays at the existing level in real terms. Revised inflation estimates now suggest that in fact real outlays will decline by at least 3 per cent to 4 per cent. Capital outlays took the brunt of the cuts. They fell from 21 per cent of total outlays in 1975-76 to 16 per cent in 1976-77. This reduction would have been increased by the revised estimate for inflation. Both major items of capital outlays fell in real terms. Loan Council contributions fell by some 6 per cent to 8 per cent and specific purpose capital payments fell by some 18 [ >er cent to 20 per cent. The budgeted capital outays of both the Commonwealth Budget and the non-Budget sectors increased by about 4 per cent in money terms in 1976-77 over the previous year. This is a real decUne of 6 per cent to 8 per cent in capital outlay. These actions of the Government are mainly responsible for an expected 4 per cent to 5 per cent drop in total non-residential buUding and construction spending in 1976-77. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has told us that outlays will be held at a zero rate of real growth in 1977-78. This will mean some juggUng because the Government is committed to increases in certain areas. For example, real defence spending is to increase by about 5'/2 per cent and education by some 2 per cent a year. This means that about 20 per cent of the outlays will increase by about 4 per cent in real terms. In turn, this can be done only if there is a cut of around one per cent in the other 80 per cent of outlays. Again this must lead to further cuts in capital works spending and, I might say, further unemployment will be created. We can get a clue to the extent of these cuts from the recent statement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) on road funds-whic h I stressed earlier-that there will be an S¥i per cent increase in money terms in the coming year. Yet this will mean in real terms a cut of 3 per cent to 6 per cent. This strongly implies that the capital outlays are being trimmed back hard to achieve the target of zero real increases in total Budget outlays. The Budget measures for 1976-77 were largely responsible for the depressed state of the building and construction industry and the economy as a whole. We are now looking to a coming Budget which will be even more severe. The exTreasury man who is to follow me in this debate should echo those words. The 1977-78 Budget will certainly bring a further decline in the levels of activity and employment in the building industry. This will be due solely to Government policy. It will be impossible for the apparent revival in the residential sector to redress the balance. Turning to the other aspects of the economic policy, it is possible that the Government is ing to the effects of devaluation to stimulate a recovery. To my mind this is based on false reasoning. Agriculture, mining and the import competing sectors of manufacturing gain from a devaluation. The size of the national cake stays much the same after a devaluation. This means that the gains made by some sectors can be achieved only from the losses of other sectors. For manufacturing, mining and agriculture to gain other sectors such as transport, construction and services must lose. I hope the House understands that aspect. It can be argued that the construction industry will benefit because those sectors which have benefited from devaluation will undertake new capital investment. But this depends on a number of factors. It depends on whether gains made by agriculture, mining and manufacturing can be maintained. This in turn rests very much on the wages policies and whether pressure for higher wages builds up in areas where profits increase because of devaluation. It depends also on the pattern of investment in these 3 sectors. Construction investment is not significant in agriculture, which has a high plant and equipment content. In the past 4 years only about 22 per cent of the investment spending in manufacturing was on construction. There is little chance of any great boost to construction from this source. In mining the proportion of construction was about 46 per cent. That means that the best prospects for a boost lie in mining. That partly explains the great stress that the Government is putting on the mining industry. Some very optitor mistic statements about mining investment have been made in the Parliament and some by outhad side consultants. I would warn against any undue optimism about a recovery in the building and construction industry or the economy as a whole that is based on the mining industry. Mining is a tremendously capital intensive industry; it does little to create new jobs. In terms of providing new infra-structure we must have doubts about what it will do in terms of job creation and in terms of reviving the construction industry. The technology of the mining sector is changing very rapidly. We are not likely to see again the traditional sort of infrastructure that was built in the last mining booms. If the north-west shelf is developed it could have the effect of reducing the existing proportion of construction in mining investment. Furthermore, new mining ventures are likely to have a much higher component of imported infrastructure. The chances for local construction and engineering works will not be as great as they have been in the past. look- New mining techniques mean fewer workers. That in turn means fewer homes and fewer community facilities in mining towns. The whole trend is towards a much more modest provision of infrastructure. Townships such as Mount Newman, Mount Tom Price, Dampier and Mary Kathleen will be things of the past. Furthermore, mining and manufacturing together account for only 30 per cent to 35 per cent of the private non-residential construction expenditure. If we add in the public sector, they account for slightly more than 10 per cent of the total non-residential construction expenditure. To increase the total non-residential construction spending by 1 per cent would mean that construction spending in the mining and manufacturing area would have to rise by about 10 per cent. That gives some idea of the level of investment in the mining industry that would be needed to have any significant impact on the building and construction industry. For that reason we must be very sceptical about a mining boom reversing the fortunes of the construction industry and, I stress, the economy as a whole. To touch briefly on one other point, housing has always borne the brunt of monetary policy in Australia because it is a highly credit intensive industry. That applies in the present monetary context and we are looking to further tightening of the monetary policy. Interest rates are tending upwards. We must expect the May loan raising to be a failure, as was the February loan unless the interest rate offered is increased. Private secinterest rates have been tending upwards. Apart from interest rates, monetary policy has an adverse effect on the supply of funds for housing. Strong directives from the Reserve Bank of Australia to lending institutions have bitten hard intofinancefor housing. That must restrain the rate of growth of the residential sector in the months ahead. For all those reasons, we must be pessimistic about a recovery in the building and construction industry that is based on a firm recovery in the home building sector. (Extension of time granted). The stimulus must come from the Austrahan Government. It can best be appUed by increasing funds for capital works spending through the Budget. Unfortunately- I stress this-the Government has backed itself into a corner. The Government has cut off its options. Not only has it made commitments to higher spending in some areas, it has also made some extravagant business tax concessions which wtil cut the growth of revenue very sharply in 1977-78. The stock valuation adjustment wtil take at least $400m, and the investment allowances wtil take at least $500m. In addition, the Government's decision to index personal taxes means it will forgo at least another $ 1,000m in revenue. I want to stress that we now have a Government which is committed to losses in revenue of about $2,000m with a deficit running at $2,600m at the time of the last Budget. The story is that the Government wants to cut that by at least $ 1,000m. Therefore, I tion its options. I believe that the Government will cut public works expenditure which wtil mean more unemployment in this country. It wtil mean that we will not have any real growth in the pubUc sector, the sector where we really need it. We need more houses, more roads and better sewerage services. These are the things we need but this Government is not meeting these needs and it has closed off its options. I want to raise the question of personal income tax indexation but not in a critical sense. I port the concept of indexation, but I oppose very strongly business tax concessions to the private sector of around $ 1,000m. Certain segments the private sector are already receiving too much. There has been a diversion from the wage in earners and the pubUc sector to the private tor. This Government has diverted huge resourAustralian ces-eve n more resources wtil be diverted this year-to the private sector. The movement resources has been faster in this last financial year than ever in the history of this Parliament. Never before has there been such a movement resources from the wage earners and the pubUc sector to the private sector. The public sector the wage earners are subsidising the private tor. When I refer to the private sector I mean very wealthy private sector-bi g business. I refer to the 400 companies out of the 200 000 comand panies that submit a tax return-that one-fifth one per cent of companies that shares nearly per cent of the profit of all companies. This Government represents big business and that where it is diverting our resources. This philosophy has reduced the Government's options at a time when it is dedicated to reducing the Budget deficit and restoring the economy. As I have said, I believe that the Government is trying to cut the Budget by at least another $ 1,000m, and that wtil pose an enormous problem. The Government has got itself into a bad fiscal jam. Until it revises its poUcies, one of the main victims wtil be the building and construction industry. The present pUght of this industry is a very important reason for supporting the motion moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). In particular, phasing out of business tax concessions would free funds which could be directed to increased capital spending and pubUc works, thus creating employment. Easing monetary policy, while keeping it within the rate of inflation plus growth, would provide more resources for the residential home building sector. I urge these measures on the Government in the strongest possible terms. I hope that this Government quesmoves away from the sectional policy that it supports of diverting funds from the many to the very wealthy few. If we are going to develop this country in the best way, then I suggest that the proposition put forward by the Opposition should be accepted.",92
197,Mr SHORT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS," I am sorry that in this debate the Opposition has once again spent its time attacking the Government's economic policy in a destructive rather than a constructive manner. If ever there was a time in supAustralia's economic history when all areas of the economic spectrum needed to pull together, it is now. That applies not only to politicians; it of appUes equaUy to employers, employees and the community at large. We stand at a critical stage our economic development. I believe that the secnext 9 to 12 months wtil determine whether the economy, which is poised on a knife edge, goes forward on the basis of sustainable of economic growth over the years ahead or whether between us all we make such a mess of things that the well-being of the nation and of of each and every Australian citizen receives a major setback from which it will take many years and to recover. I firmly believe that if we adopt a secunited approach to solving our problems then we wtil solve them, but if we are not united then those problems wtil loom ever so much greater will be so much more difficult to overcome. of For this reason I make a plea to the Opposition 50 to work with the Government on economic issues, not to continue its policy of obstructionism and negativism, of painting gloom which is unreal, of sapping the confidence of the Austrahan people for cheap poltiical motives and of dividing the Australian people. Let us look at just what are the facts in relation to the state of the economy at present. Opinions will and do differ on this, but if we look at the picture objectively there is no doubt in my mind that the economy overall is now trending in an upward direction, pursuing a moderate rate of expansion. The latest national accounts figures for the last December quarter put non-farm gross domestic product at 5.2 per cent above the level one year earUer. The increase in the 6 months to December 1976 was 3 per cent above the level in the 6 months to December 1975. Look at some of the other factors. For example, private investment in dweUings was up 20 per cent in the year ending December 1976, business investment in plant and equipment was up 18 per cent and exports were up 10 per cent. All are very important areas of growth. Present signs for our propects are distinctly encouraging in the area of private capital investment spending. For the current half-year businessmen's expectations are for growth of 8 per cent over the second half of 1976. The mining industry, in which capital spending has been in decline, shows a complete turnabout with an expectedriseof 41 per cent. In manufacturing industry a rise of 18 per cent is expected. Looking further ahead, the minerals sector has made firm decisions to proceed with a number of significant projects. One only has to recall, for example-it is only one example-the decision by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd earUer this week to invest $600m in projects in this country in the near future. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) spoke about the problems in the construction industry. I do not deny that in some areas there are problems in the construction industry. Mr Neil-Hi s problems.",95
198,Mr SHORT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"The picture of the situation that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition painted tonight was completely misleading and incorrect. As my friend, the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) reminds me, he conveniently neglected the fact that many of the problems in the construction industry over the past 18 months, and prior to that, have been due to poUcies of the previous Government, to which I wiU come back later. In the December quarter of 1976 both estimated real private investment in dwelUngs and private dwelUng commencements were not less than 41 per cent above their low points about mid-1975. In fact, real private dweUing investment in the latest December quarter was in total only 4 per cent short of its previous very high, abnormally high, unsustainably high peak in the September quarter of 1973. The position has been varied between the different States. New South Wales last year was experiencing perhaps greater difficulty in the construction industry than in some other States. In the December quarter total dwelling approvals in New South Wales were 29 per cent higher than a year earlier and total dwelling commencements were 26 per cent higher. These figures, in my opinion, give substantial Ue to the approach that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was making in his comments preceding mine. The outlook of course varies between different sectors of the economy. This is always the case. This is particularly so in the early stages of economic recovery which is the situation I believe we are in at the moment. We are witnessing at the moment to some extent part of the continuing process of adjustment which is always going on in any economy. We must ensure, first, that adjustment is in the direction that we as a community consider it to be desirable and, secondly, that the rate of adjustment is not so fast as to be excessively disruptive. That is a point which the Opposition, I think conveniently",96
199,Mr YATES,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,DeUberately .,96
200,Mr SHORT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"If deliberately, as my colleague says, neglects. In my opinion, and in the opinion of a great many other commentators on the economic scene in Australia, it was the rate of change that occurred as a result of Labor Government policies in the 1973-75 period that really produced most of the major problems that this Government inherited when it took office. The gross domestic productfiguresI referred to earlier relate to growth of non-farm activity. The picture for the rural sector is less encouraging than for other sectors. Real output in the rural sector fell in the 6 months to December 1976 by 4.9 per cent. The problems of the rural sector, both short term and long term, are in many ways more difficult to grapple with, let alone solve, than the problems of other sectors. I believe we must recognise this and take account of it in pohcy formation. Inflation and unemployment remain major problems. However light is now showing at the end of the tunnel. The March quarter increase of 2.3 per cent in the consumer price index was encouraging even though the figure is still way above what most people regard as satisfactory. There is doubt as to how much of the inflationary impact of last year's devaluation is reflected in the March quarter figure. We may see a more significantly deflationary element in the June quarter figure. Nevertheless the 2.3 per cent figure is a favourable rather than an unfavourable indication of the way inflation is trending. We must also be careful not to take too much account of the consumer price index at the neglect of other price indices. The most accurate indicator of the underlying trend of inflation in the economy is the gross domestic product price deflator. In 1976 this index was well below the consumer price index. There is no reason to suggest that this is not still the case. There is no doubt at all that inflation must be further reduced. It is still astronomical by most of our historical standards. It is significantly higher than the rate in most other Western countries. It is for that reason that I unequivocally support the Government's overriding No. 1 policy objective of bringing inflation down to an acceptable figure. It is also for this reason that I reject the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). I believe that what the Opposition is proposing in its amendment will not assist the fight against inflation and will indeed exacerbate that fundamental problem. There are persons and organisations in the community which claim that the No. 1 immediate priority should be a reduction in the level of unemployment. No one accepts the present level of unemployment, however it is measured, as satisfactory. It is patently unsatisfactory. But what the advocates of tackling unemployment first neglect is that a major and sustainable reduction in the level of unemployment is simply not possible in the absence of a major reduction in the level of inflation. The experience of the Whitlam Government in 1974 and 1975 bears eloquent testimony to this fact and so does the experience of many other western countries. As I have said on previous occasions in the House, I think it is possible that in Australia, the case elsewhere, we are facing a medium to long term situation in which unemployment will continue at a higher level than we have regarded as acceptable and normal in the past. There are many reasons for this. They include the growth in technology and the extraordinary and unsustainably large wage increases in recent years. Those wage increases exceeded the rate of productivity growth in this country by 5 to 10 times. Another reason is the development of industry in low wage countries in the Asian region which is a very important matter that we will ignore at our own cost. However, I am not as pessimistic on this score as many others. But I do think that in this area we have a potentially real problem on our hands which we must put to the closest study. We must better align our education system with vocational possibilities than has been the case in recent years. We must continue the progressive manpower training policies which the present Government has introduced or modernised. On this point, I agree with the relevant part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide. But it does no credit to the Opposition to ignore the major developments in this area which the Fraser Government has already set in train. They are developments which far outstrip in a period of 12 to 15 months anything that the Whitlam Government did during its period in office in this direction. Another essential ingredient in our economic recovery process is confidence. Confidence is returning to the Australian community and so it should, given the improvements in the economy which have taken place over the past 15 months. Again, it reflects no credit on the Opposition to continue with its Jeremiah approach to the present situation. I turn now to the question of how much the Government can do to restore Australia to economic health. Government can do much but it cannot do the whole job. lis prime responsibility must surely be to set therightenvironment under which growth can take place. It must provide stability and prudence in economic management. We must move away from the 'government should do it' attitude which has developed to frightening proportions in the community in recent years and which the Labor Government reinforced in a major way during its period in office. I believe that this is one of the greatest legacies this country has inherited from the Whitlam Government. It appears from the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tonight that the Australian Labor Party has not learnt from that experience. We must learn again as is to ask ourselves first as individuals whether we can do it on our own. Only if we cannot should we then approach government. Government should be the last cab off the rank in many instances, not the first. Otherwise, government expenditure will continue to grow inexorably and unwisely at great cost to each and every taxpayer who already bears far too high a burden. The Opposition claims that the Government's economic strategy is wrong. But what are the options when we take into account the situation facing the Government when it took office in December 1975 and the length of time it takes to turn that disastrous situation around. The Opposition suggests that we should cut indirect taxes. But to have any significant effect either on prices or on the willingness of consumers to spend, the cost to revenue would be enormous. The Opposition says that the Government should increase expenditure on capital works but it does not say where, nor does it quantify the proposal. Experience during 1973-75 should have convinced us beyond all doubt that more and more government expenditure does not stimulate activity and reduce unemployment. In the period between 1974 and 1975, when goverament expenditure increased by 46 per cent, inflation increased fourfold and unemployment went up by 150 per cent. The Government already faces a major budget deficit problem. To act in the manner suggested by the honourable member for Adelaide in his amendment on behalf of the Opposition would greatly increase that deficit and the accompanying problems. It would, without any doubt, force up interest rates. It would, without any doubt, have a significant inflationary impact. Therefore I reject the amendment and urge the Government to holdfirmon the overall pohcy course which it is pursuing. It is a course which has widespread acceptance throughout the community. It is a course which has already paid dividends in a lower rate of inflation and in a restoration of economic growth. If pursued with vigour, the benefits will grow. If abandoned now, the fruits of the past 12 months will be lost, and the prospects for the future will be bleak. The Government's present pohcy stance is very much in line with the attitude and policy stance adopted by most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in a similar situation. It is worth pointing out, cause it does not seem to be recognised generally, that Australia's economic performance since the Fraser Government took office has generally been better than that of most OECD countries. Moreover, our policies are clearly in line with those being adopted by such countries, the main exception being the 3 largest OECD countries where some moderate action has been taken to stimulate economic activity. These latter countries succeeded previously in getting the rate of inflation down to a lower rate than Australia has. Therefore such action is not inappropriate in the circumstances. The fact that the 3 largest OECD countries are now in circumstances in which they feel they are able to take expansionary action highlights the fact that the 1974-75 recession left Australia generally in worse shape than most overseas countries, notably in terms of the key profit and savings ratio. Therefore we had and have further to go than most countries in making up lost ground. That is an indictment, if ever an indictment was needed, of the policies of the Labor Government. Of all the Western countries that should have suffered least from the dramatic inflationary heights due to the oil crisis of late 1973, Australia should have been in the vanguard of escaping that problem. Instead, in 1974 and 1975, we got ourselves into just about the worse economic situation of any of the OECD countries. I conclude where I started, by urging the Opposition to join the Government in tackling the nation's problems rather than in hindering, obstructing and attempting to confuse the community at every turn of the way. As a start, I urge the Opposition to join the Government in attempting to give the wage-price pause a chance to succeed. If the Opposition is really serious about helping the Government and the community at large to solve our economic problems, it has a great responsibility to assist. If it does not assist or attempt to assist, the community will judge it for the Party it is.",96
201,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Short) in this debate. He is one of the more moderately spoken and certainly one of the more economically literate Government members. Therefore I will try to make my contribution as restrained as I possibly can. This debate marks the first occasion on which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has entered into a substantive economic debate since the announcement of the wage-price freeze over a fortnight ago by the Premiers and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It is very instructive to be- look at the Treasurer's mid-term review of his budget strategies against that background. I think it is significant that, in what I thought was a very good handling of a very poor brief by the honourable member for Ballaarat, he referred to this proposed freeze only in the last minute and a half of his address. For the rest of his speech he spoke about the effect-h e conceded that different views could be held about the success or otherwise-of the policies that the Government has been pursuing for the past year or so. It is significant that in his second reading speech on this legislation the Treasurer makes no reference whatsoever to the wage-price freeze, to its effect on the additional estimates for the Government departments which we are now debating, or the effect on the general economy of the so-called savings-this new gimmick that the Treasurer has introduced-mentione d in these sorts of debates. The only element of policy to which he referred was the Government's policy of expenditure restraint. There certainly cannot be any doubt that the Government has pursued consistently a pohcy of cutting some areas of expenditure. It has certainly done that, and shall deal with that matter in a moment and look at the kinds of expenditure it has cut. We have had a most peculiar debate on this this legislation. The debate started only today. I have not had the opportunity of hearing the contribushould tions made by all honourable members opposite, but I have heard at least the last 3 contributions. They could not have been more different. The to honourable member for Denison was tated about the fact that Tasmania is an island and therefore is dependent on air services to a much greater extent than the rest of Australia. He seems to want to reverse that condition. There is nothing we can do about it. I do not Ueve that the kind of contribution we heard from him will do anything to help the atmosphere of industrial relations in Australia. The next speaker from the Government side was the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett). He made an extraordinary speech in which he said that everything wasfinein the garden. To their credit, the Treasurer, the honourable memit ber for Ballaarat and members like him do not pretend in these debates that everything is fine. They draw a picture which is fairly gloomy-oc casionally too gloomy. I think that occasionally they are pessimistic about the kinds of policies that have been consistently suggested from this side of the House by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). Nonetheless, different kind of contribution. The honourable member for Maranoa went on to talk about the expenditure that this Government is undertaking as though it is good thing, because he talked about the kind sectional expenditure in which the Government is engaging. It is important that we understand that at the same time as the Government has been cutting certain types of expenditure which we are debating at the moment it also has forgoing massive amounts of revenue increasing expenditure in certain areas for certain of its favoured clients. Undoubtedly the honourable member for Maranoa thinks that is good thing. He made one outrageous statement, however, with which I wish to deal very briefly. He went on to talk about the slight increase non-farm gross domestic product. Whilst I ceded that point, I made the interjection: 'What about gross farm product?' He said: 'Yes, has been declining'. The last round-up issued by the Treasury shows that the gross farm product decreased during the 6 months to the end of 1976 by 4.9 per cent. That represents the third consecutive decline for the preceding three quarters. He then I went on to say that the Government was not in the business of borrowing money from overseas. If we are to have a serious economic debate in place, let us get our factsright.The Government has borrowed-ther e is no reason why it should not borrow; in fact, I think that possibly it have borrowed more-almos t $ 1,000m from overseas. It took me only a minute to rush my office and bring back a prospectus and an offering circular for $US500m of that amount. So most agilet us deal with the facts. The honourable member for Ballaraat says: 'Look, the Opposition is carping and it is criticising. Why do we not all pull together?' That is all bevery well when the natural party of government is in power. It always says: 'Now let us all pull together. Now is the time.' It was never the time to do that when Labor was in power. Honourable members opposite talk about the constructive role of opposition. The Labor Party has plenty of experience in opposition, and when it was continuously in opposition during the 1960s exercised that role very responsibly, as I believe it is doing now. But when it got into government, what was its experience in relation to the - constructive contribution it received from an Opposition unfamiliar with that role and unwilling to perform it? What contribution did it receive from the supporters of that Opposition outside the Parliament? In fact, no co-operation was it is a very forthcoming. We might as well give the lie in this economic debate straight away to the suggestion that no offer of co-operation has been made from outa side the Parliament. Such an offer has been of made. The trade union movement is wtiling to co-operate. It has called for a conference of all parties on the economic condition of this country for the purpose of canvassing many possibUities and not just a straight wage-price freeze which, been in any event, the Government knows it could as well as never implement. It is quite extraordinary that the notes which a were prepared by departmental officials at the Premiers Conference have not been made available. But excerpts from those notes which were in published in at least one newspaper the weekend conbefore last show that it is impossible to implement that kind of proposition in Australia. that Every Government member knows that is the case. He knows that the power to control wages or prices is a one-sided matter. In 1973 the Austrahan Labor Party Government sought the power for this Parliament to legislate on this matter, so in the national Parliament we did cuss wages and prices poUcies. We did not have to defer to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission or to somebody outside the Parliament. We said that this was a proper matter to be debated in Canberra, in the national Parliament. But the Opposition parties at that time would not support that proposal. Now they have to live with the consequences of that short sighted and unprincipled opposition. The Additional Estimates are a reflection of the faUure of the Government's policies. I believe that if we are to talk about policies we can isolate them thus: There are expenditure cuts which are very largely in areas which were increased markedly in the 3 years of Labor Government. That has been a consistent pohcy of this Government. It has pursued that policy very firmly. I do not approve of it, but the Government has stuck to it. It next pursued an investment led recovery strategy by proposing an investment allowance to business-amon g other allowances-whic h has been a flop. The estimates of the revenue forgone by the Department of Finance have varied from $400m down to $2S0m in a year. Mr MCLean-It will be $5 50m next year.",98
202,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"The amount has ister been coming down. It was not supposed to take so long, as I think the honourable member for Perth will concede. I suppose the next great polfound icy, apart from moving away from support of full indexation which the Government promised at for the last election, was the revamping of Medibank. There was a suggestion that in some way the Government would pass on a direct part of the cost to the taxpayer rather than have refunded from general revenue. Constantly the Government overlooks the fact that at least about $ 1,000m of cost is still funded from general revenue. If we look at Medibank we see the fate of that policy reflected in the documents which we are looking at today. The Department of Health is seeking an additional $250,000 beSecurity. cause it wasted $250,000 in publicity relating the design of the Medibank proposals last year. Every honourable member remembers the farce in May when we had outlined to us the proproblems. posal to amend the Medibank procedures. We came back for the Budget session and we had go through the debates again and have the whole system recast. That alone has cost us $250,000, as we see from the Bill we are debating today. shall proceed to what has been thefinalGovernment pohcy, which is being pursued assiduously by certain sectional interests of the Government dis- since it achieved power and which the Prime Minister implemented at the end of last year, and that is devaluation. It was a very unwise policy. I think Government members and certainly the Treasury conceded that the amount of devaluation was too much. The dollar had to be revalued upwards very smartly thereafter. We are seeing the consequence of that precipitate devaluation in these papers which are before us now. The amounts vary up to as much as the $30m extra which we will have to pay for defence expenditure because of that devaluation. I know that Government members constantly talk about the need to increase defence expenditure. If they want to do that they can do it more cheaply by avoiding unwise policies like devaluation. Devaluation has meant a variation in the figures from that amount of $30m to a piddling $200 which is found in the additional estimates for the Department of Administrative Services for the payment to the Singapore Government for free hospital treatment of Asian residents of Christmas Island. Right through these documents we see the consequence of that devaluation decision where any payment has to be made abroad in foreign currency or something like special drawing rights to the International Monetary Fund. As the Minfor Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) is at the table I refer to a couple of extraordinary additional estimates which are in this Bill. One is, of course, the proposition that we should now vote an extra $20,000 the salaries of officers of the ethnic affairs unit of his Department. Honourable members will remember that when the coalition parties went to the people in December 1975 one of their great it promises to the migrant communities in this country was that they would re-establish a Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as a focus for their concerns. This has been a totally cosmetic exercise to date, and in fact all sections that deliver post-settlement services to migrants in Australia remain in the Department of Social But after nearly 18 months we are votto ing here today for an expenditure to cover the salaries of 19 men for one month. That is a mark, I believe, of the sense of urgency of the Minister and the Government about these kinds of to Within the Minister's specific concern is the telephone interpreter service for which the Department of Social Security is now appropriI ating an extra $140,000 over and above the $260,000 that was appropriated last year. How wrong can this Government be? How out of touch is it with the human side of its policies when it is so badly wrong about the amounts of money that are needed to administer basic community services in Australia. I was very delighted to hear the honourable member for Ballarat refer to the problem of unemployment in Australia and to the burden that is being borne by people who are unemployed. He is the only Government supporter in this debate who has mentioned this matter. I have no doubt that we all should focus attention on this question of inflation. Of course we do that. It is also electorally very smart to do that. As I said in the Budget debate last year, many more people in this country are affected by inflation than are affected by unemployment, and if one talks about inflation one is on an toral winner. But it will be a very sorry day indeed if we are ever so short-sighted or so cynical in our planning of the expenditures of this country to consider only the question of inflation. I want to refer very briefly to the gimmicky part of the Treasurer's papers that he has given us to debate. It deals with so-called savings. statement of savings, according to my colleagues, was never made available for debate until last mation year. Of course, in every parhament appropribunal ations are not always fully expended. A short fall is a saving, to some extent. If we look at what Government regards as a saving, we see its peculiar sense of investment priorities. I do not pins want to deal necessarily with items cal order but this would be the easiest way for me to proceed. We are told that there will be a saving of $10,000 in overtime for staff for the Department of Administrative Services. Members of Parhament who work with me on the Publications Committee of this House know that the Commonwealth has lost the services of an excellent government printer. He has gone to the State of Victoria as Government Printer for an extra $ 10,000 a year. This is not a saving; short-sighted view of public expenditure. There is to be a massive so-called saving of nearly $800,000 on the cost of publishing Acts and statutory rules in the Attorney-General's Departconcerned ment. That is not a saving. Every member of this place knows it is a mere postponement of expencampaign diture. If there is one thing that has characterised this Government during its 18 months in power has been its reluctance to let information out the public arena and to have its Ministers, I especially its Prime Minister go out and confront the public. There has been a reluctance to hold Press conferences to allow the policies of this Government to be examined and its Ministers be questioned about those poUcies. This is a completely phoney saving. It is argued that in some way we are improving the quaUty of government in this country by not making avaUable to the public the statutes that we sit here day and night to pass. We are merely postponing that expenditure. At the same time we are ensuring that the level of public knowledge of things that concern all of us on both sides of this House and in the other place is less perfect because the basic ground material that people need to discuss these matters is not available. I would like to conclude my remarks tonight by referring again to what I said at the beginning of my speech about the Government's so-called price-wage freeze. The savings document that elec- has been presented to us by the Department of Finance was conceived on 25 March. Clearly at that time the Department could not have known of the great wishing exercise that was undertaken by the Premiers a fortnight ago. The document shows that the Prices Justification Tribunal, about which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) has made the most fantastic claims in respect of its authority and The power and the legitimacy of it passing on inforto the Government, has had its appropriation cut. After all last year attacking this triand drawing its teeth with amendments to its enabling Act-the Prices Justification Act-the this Government is now further cutting its Budget at a time when it is sought to be one of the lynchof the prospects of success of the so-called in alphabetiwages-prices freeze.

204,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT," I was today to learn that the Government has decided to spend $ 150,000 on an advertising for the poll on a national song, and that the Government intends to advocate God it Save the Queen as the national song. I am not in into any way implying anything against Her Majesty. think she does a very conscientious job, and is a very courteous and gracious person. I believe that it is appropriate that God Save the Queen should be used on regal and vice-regal occasions, to but I am concerned at the obvious way in which the Government is determined to have it used all occasions and to exclude such songs Advance Australia Fair by ensuring that the people do not vote for them. Already the appear Government is using the donkey vote by decidback oron ing that God Save the Queen, for some reason or other, shall be placed at the paper. Mr Keith Johnson-Is that right?",101

By logic, if the request tunes were placed on the ballot paper m alphation andbecause betical order, in accordance with the electoral tragedy of law of this country, Advance Australia Fair should be on the top of the ballot paper. But this Government has made a firm decision. It instinct shall be God Save the Queen which is placed at But now being the top of the ballot paper followed ous other songs. Worse than that is the information which came to my hands today that the Government proposes to spend $150,000 of taxpayers money in advertising for the poll on a national song that the purpose of this advertising is to advocate that God Save the Queen be chosen instead Advance Australia Fair. I think these issues should be treated fairly. I have no objection the people making a decision. That is their right. But I do not think there should be an attempt, this Government is attempting to do through the type of ballot paper it is producing, with taxinstincts payers funds, to gerrymander the decision. One could not call it anything but that. I ask the ister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) who is at the table to make a full inquiry into this matter. Mr MACKellar-You did not give them a choice when you were in power.",102
206,Mr ARMITAGE,ADJOURNMENT,"We gave them a very good choice. We asked people all over the country to make their submissions. Those submissions were made. At least we were conscious that Australia should have a national anthem which was truly Austrahan. At least we made sure that Australian sportsmen overseas knew that they were not Canadians or Fijians. We made sure that everythat one at the Olympic Games knew, when Advance Australia Fairv/as played, that that was the Aushood, trahan nauonal anthem. I do not think that it the interests of this country for this Government, simply because of its old-fashioned extreme condeepseated, servative attitudes, to attempt by using taxpayers on money to gerrymander the decision by the manas ner in which it prepares the ballot paper.",102

Unforgettable was the the older woman having her baby no, killed as she talked to a reporter. She knew all the plausible cliches about her strong maternal just a matter of pesky hormones. by the varibaby was destroyedinstinct that strong was violated as her and her motives were examined before the watching public. The set-up was tasteless but infinitely worse was the unspeakably sad way that she turned her head away from the camera and shut her eyes in and poignant distress as the moment arrived and the living baby was withdrawn from her body by of what is euphemistically called vacuum aspiration. I hope I do not upset honourable members to too much but these are just nice words which mean 'in pieces'. Unforgettable, too, was the as face of the counsellor with her- a counsellor who had tried to teach her to suppress her maternal under the pragmatic convenience of the abortion. Why, in heaven's name, if anyone has Mintime and skill to counsel women, can they not counsel them to accept their babies instead of the dreadful negation of killing them? After seeing that, who could suggest abortion as a human, compassionate solution to anything. Sad and somehow disgusting was the vasectomy, not because of its determined exposure of male genitalia, but because of the attitude of the patient. As the television audience watched, his male reproductive capabilities were destroyed, incidentally by a woman doctor. The psychologists may find that interesting. He comforted himself with the somehow pathetic assurance a gelded stallion could still get after the mares. There was no word of the dignity of manhis priceless capacity to father children for is in our next generation-jus t a gelded horse. But most heart breaking was the exposure of the thoughtless selfishness of so many of us. We are all selfish. It seems a necessary part, particularly in this place, of self-preservation. But there is a point at which it becomes a fetish. It is a fetish when it results in the killing of unborn babies and it is wholly destructive. I refer particularly to how unfortunate it is in the young people who enjoy a sex life but refuse to have children. In their case it shows that they are at least immature and thoughtless. They forget that one day they will be old and sick or both. They will demand pensions and medical care as their right because of their contributions during their working years, and properly so. But they have made no contribution in people to build the security of a continuing generation to pay and provide for them. Mr Antony Whitlam-What about people in holy orders?",102
208,Mr MARTYR,ADJOURNMENT,"There are only very few of them. I return to what I was saying: Who will pay the taxes to pay for their pensions and to provide the goods and services, the nursing care and doctors they will need? Who will defend them this country ever has to fight for survival? People who consciously refuse to have chilexperience dren will have to depend on the children of others, including the grandchild of the honourable able member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). They will have to depend on the children of those generous hearted enough to take up loving, necessary burdens and joys of children. The point is that we must have both. We must have the contribution in money and we must have the contribution in people. One is useless instruction without the other. Each generation interlocks with the ones before and after. If breaks the continuing cycle of life, reproduction and death, that generation and all that follow are affected. If anything destroys this country it will be too much emphasis on this demand for selfthem. fulfilment, self-revelation, self-awareness and self-satisfaction. It destroys self-sacrifice and self-discipline. In the end it destroys real love else. and replaces it with a sterile gratification. Selfishness Ues even at the root of inflation for it breeds a grab mentality and oppressive materialism.

Mr KEITH JOHNSON What the honourable member for Chifley says is correct. I had to listen to an address to this House tonight which to any thinking person in Australia would be an absolute and utter disgrace. The honourable member was talking about the attitude of people towards having children. He was decrying those who choose not to have children. As my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam) pointed out to him, there are people in Holy Orders around the worldMr Martyr-Ver y few, I said.",103
211,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Very few, was the honourable member's comment. He knows that that is not altogether true. A very large number the of people, with the most honourable intentions, if enter Holy Orders around the world and choose to practice celibacy. It is their choice. If a man and a woman choose to live together and to a normal sexual relationship that does not seem to me, as it seems to the honourmember for Swan, to have the connotation that an endless chain of children should be produced by that relationship. I wish that the the honourable member would come into my electorate where I could introduce him, as I know the honourable member for Grayndler could, to families where the wife refuses, because of or for other reasons, to restrict the size of her family and brings into the world children one generation for whom she cannot care. Mr Martyr-Do they love them?",103

It seems to me that every person who thing has a child loves that child. The honourable member mentioned my grandchild. Of course I love the child. That child will experience all the that I can give to it. The honourable member spoke about abortion as being something abhorrent. I do not think that it is very nice but I do not adopt his attitude. He says that a woman finding herself pregnant, perhaps conafter taking the best precautions in the world, is not prepared to bear the child, should be I had forced to go ahead and bear the child.

It is important that a woman has the right to decide what occurs within her body. HonourMay referenda. able members opposite ought to read the comments of the Supreme Court of the United States of America which said that the gestation period, between conception and birth, can be divided into 3 carefully considered periods. During first 3 months of gestation, the woman is at no risk at all in having an abortion. This is not at her instruction but on the advice of her mediwith cal adviser. During the next 3 months there doubt about the risk. Afterwards of course there is no doubt because there is danger to her, and from that 3 months period on the state accepts full responsibUity",104

218,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT," I listened with very great concern to the speech of the honourattempt able member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) because knowingly or unknowingly he misled the House. What he said was absolute rubbish. I hope that he spoke unknowingly. He did not cite the source of his authority for his claim that the Governprocess ment was going to spend money to promote God Save the Queen. If he spoke knowingly and who sought to give to the House a version that was not true, aU that I can say is that the Appropriation Bill that is being discussed by this chamber should have an additional appropriation in the realm of psychiatrics. Mr Armitage-What about the ballot paper?",104
219,Mr NEIL,ADJOURNMENT,"I have had some service upon comparticipate mittees with the honourable member and it may surprise honourable members on this side of the House to know that in some areas I have developed a degree of respect for some of his views. But as far as this matter is concerned, I only say that he is seeking to make political capital inaccurately. The ballot paper is one matter. The substance of the honourable member's as I heard it, is that the Government is to spend $150,000 to promote one song as against it the others. I remind the House that some months ago I had the privilege to express to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a view that the anthem question in this country should be settled; that it was ridiculous to have 4 songs played as it made the country somewhat of a laughing stock. It is quite proper that there should be a specific national anthem for regal and vice-regal occasions. But to have 4 songs for occasions is ridiculous. The Government decided to accept the principle of having a poll for a national song. After some further representations from me the Government decided to have that poll at the time of the 21 I can inform the honourable member that when I heard his speech I consulted the Prime Minister's Private Secretary to be absolutely certhe tain that the advertising campaign is not intended to promote one song only. I have his asdone surance that the advertising campaign will deal the background of all the songs. It will be is devoted to giving information to the public about all of the songs and to allowing the public to have a say in respect of all of those songs. I remind the honourable member also of the Prime Minister's personal view, stated in public on more than one occasion, that he prefers Matilda. So I think that the only inference that can be drawn is that the honourable member's speech tonight was a mischievous to make political capital out of a most important matter. After the past 3 years of division under a government that sought to act unconstitutionally and illegally, it is tremendously important that this nation should have a healing so that we can again take pride in our nation and that school children and other people stand and sing the national song are able to do so with pride. It is important that we settle this particular issue and that we have a song that is respected throughout the world because it represents the desires of the Australian people. I make one statement about an extension of the poll. It is to my regret that a suggestion that school children in high schools be allowed to in the poll has not been adopted. The Government is sympathetic to that suggestion. I would have liked to see it. A survey taken by the St George and Sutherland Shire Leader, an excellent local newspaper, produced the result can that school children were keen to participate in the poll. But I have been advised that although the Government would like to see this in principle, there is not ume to get the consent governments and non-state schools, and some hundreds of thousands of persons who do not attend schools would not be able to be covered. That is regrettable but it is important that we back to a spirit of Australiafirst.We have lost The trade union leadership in this country has helped by its continual nation bashing and pubUc bashing. The Opposition has helped by running down the Government and trying not to assist in the wages and prices freeze for which all heads of government have opted. We must establish again a genuine national spirit in this country.",104

221,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT," I think that in the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) we find Parliament House's answer Ray. I have a more important matter to raise. In 1973 and 1974 the conservative coaUtion partners denounced the proposal that a Medibank health insurance membership card would be issued to members of the Australian community. seat. This was in spite of the fact that it was also pointed out by the then Labor Government use of the card would be a purely optional matter. If a member of the community drawing on the benefits of Medibank decided that he or did not wish to use the card or, through some inconvenience such as leaving laying it, was not able to present it, benefits would still have been payable. Members of the conservative coalition partners asserted a firm commitment to certain civil liberty principles. They abhorred, they said, the thought that the Australian community was about to be regimented. They denounced the proposal as seeking to apply regimented he numbers to people in Australian society. They went further and suggested that this was the beseat. ginning of the police state. All people in Australia would be recorded, which was the ginning of the accumulation of detailed records of their private lives. Of course, this was a clear case offiction.It was a product of the wild fantasy of an irresponsible opposition. I have discovered today that coalition partners in government intend to enforce the presentation of a membership card or book on all people who are members of Medibank health insurance, private or basic. There will be no choice and no end of the civU liberty principles honourable members opposite enunciated frequently and of State passionately in this House. A member of Medibank in future will be compeUed by the Government to present his membership book or card. If it should happen that in seeking to obtain get a claim against Medibank a person is unable to it. present his membership book or card he will have to fill in an application form.

I am quite happy for the honourable member for Oxley to have his 2 minutes, but when I stood up I was asking whether the But honourable member for Oxley had told the Minmembers ister for Health that he intended to make this attack.",106
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member should know that that a point of order. Mr Bourchier-But it is a normal procedure of the House.,106
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The fact is that granted members cannot raise even something that may be a normal procedure of the House under point of order. Frankly I have been amazed some of the points of order that have been by honourable members.,106

243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Is leave granted? Mr MACKellar-Yes . of order. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Leave is granted.,106
244,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"To continue those remarks, the fact is that the Government intends to conscript all members of Medibank into the presentation of membership books or membership cards to establish their membership of the fund. That is quite contrary to the principles the of present Government so passionately enunciated on so many occasions in 1973 and 1974 when it opposed the principle of Medibank. The point I to make-it is an important one-concern s why Government supporters want to stifle me on this occasion. The Government has not made public announcement on this matter, nor it propose to make any public announcement on it. It intends to impose conscription appreciate without advising the pubhc. Mr Neil- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. A short time ago I heard the honourable member for Oxley say that you, Sir, were his time. I consider that that is a reflection on the Chair and on the House.

246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I will not say disagreements, but many exchanges of comments. In the circumstances a certain amount of what the honourable member for Oxley said was true. I point out to him also that a number of his were helping. I think the honourable member for Oxley has made the point during the time he spoke before the honourable member for St George raised the point of order. is not Mr HAYDEN-Firstly , if I have made any comment which was offensive I regret it. Mr MACKellar- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I seek your ruling? You asked whether leave was for the honourable member for Oxley to complete his remarks. I gave that leave. I believe a the honourable member has completed his by remarks. I believe the Government side should taken have the opportunity to speak now on the adjournment debate.",106

250,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"No , I am on my feet.",107
251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! There are times when I become even more and more amazed. The honourable member for Oxley and the Minister have now been discussing a matter which has no relevance to the point that the honourable member for Oxley had made. I believe that the courtesy that was extended to the honourable member for Oxley enabled him to make his point. The honourable member for Oxley said that he desired 30 seconds. We now have one minute left of the adjournment debate. I think the honourable member for Oxley has completed his remarks, and had completed them before.",107
252,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I beheve it is a very important point of order. It involves more than mere procedure; it is a matter of propriety and conduct in this Parliament. It is a simple matter. I put you for careful consideration and I hope that you may be able to give the members of the House the benefit of your views on this after you have considered it over the weekend. It will be a simple matter completely to disrupt the adjournment debate each evening. It seems that so far this has been done on a very one-sided basis largely by the Government Whip who is",107
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The point raised by the honourable member for Oxley is one to which I suggest all members of this House, not only myself, should give consideration over the weekend. I must point out to the honourable member for Oxley that the taking up of a member's dme with points of order has not always been from one side of the House. I suggest that if we are going to have an adjournment debate, in which honourable members have 5 minutes in which to speak and which allows for more speakers, consideration to honourable members should be shown and courtesy extended so that, except in cases where there is a definite and a particular point of order, no point of order will be taken.",107

Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: (1) On what dates have there been meetings of the Committee of Ministers established on 1 October 1976 to examine cases in which evaluation by government purchasing authorities on the basis of the best value for money principle would lead to goods being bought overseas (Hansard, 9 December 1976, page 3712). (2) Which Ministers attended each meeting. (3) Was a public statement made after any of these meetings. If so, on which occasions and by which Minister. (4) How many cases have been considered by the committee. (5) How many cases have been decided in favour of the Australian supplier. (6) What has been the additional cost to the Australian Government. (7) Does any department or instrumentality have the responsibility of co-ordinating advice to the committee, as was recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into Government Procurement Policy chaired by Sir Walter Scott in his report dated 31 May 1974. (8) Is it proposed that the committee make an annual or other periodic repon to Parliament as the Industries Assistance Commission must do. (9) Did the similar committee which operated from 1961 to 1972 make public statements or reports to Parliament. Mr Street-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Committee of Ministers is a Sub-committee of Cabinet. It is not normal practice to make public information on the operations of the Cabinet. (2) See (1) above. The Prime Minister announced the formation of the committee on 1 October 1976, and its composition. The current composition is the Minister for Administrative Services (Chairman), the Treasurer and the Ministers for Industiy and Commerce, Employment and Industrial Relations, Transport, Business and Consumer Affairs and Productivity. The Minister for Defence and the Minister for other purchasing Departments may be co-opted as appropriate. (3) No. (4) 11 cases have been considered by the committee. A further S are currently awaiting consideration. (5) Of the 11 cases considered by the committee 8 were decided in favour of the Australian supplier. Details of these are as follows: Goods Australian supplier Carpet (Construction) United Carpet Mills NA upon notice were circulated: Goods Australian supplier Value (Question No. 207) $ Lathes and 600 Machinery Pty Attachments Ltd (Defence) 55,404 Cotton/Polyester Bruck (Aust) Ltd Cloth (Defence-Army ) 87,750 Utilities, 762 kg GMH Sales Ltd (Admin Services) X-Ray Film Kodak (A/Asia) 1,614,275 (Veterans' Affairs) 226,745 Firemen's Boots Protector Safety (est.)

When considering'cost'however, it is also necessaiy to consider offsetting benefits such as employment that flow from the Australian supplier being favoured. (7) Yes. The Department of Administrative Services. (8) No. (9) No. Youth Employment Subsidy Scheme (Question No. 217) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: What are the names and addresses of employers who have (a) sought and (b) received subsidies under the Youth Employment Subsidy Scheme and for how many persons have they (a) sought and (b) received subsidies. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The NEAT Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) began operation on 1 October 1976. As at end March of this year-jus t 6 months after its introductionthere were some 7400 trainees in respect of whom employers were receiving the special subsidy which the Government has made available to help in overcoming the employment problems of young people who have experienced a long duration of unemployment. I regret that in the circumstances it is not practicable to provide the information sought on the thousands of employers who are providing training. Considerable staff resources which are needed for other purposes would be required to complete the necessary lisungs. In addition in Value view of the fundamental policy of the Commonwealth Employment Service that information as to names and addresses of its clients are treated as confidential, the permis312,737 sion of employers for the release of their names and Pty Ltd addresses would have to be obtained. However, the following table provides the numbers of trainees under SYETP in each of the States, and the Northern Territory at end of March sistance to the honourable member. State New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory Total International Disaster Relief Operations: Australian Assistance Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Foreign Alfairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: (1) What contribution has the Australian Government made to intemauonal disaster relief operations in each of the last 5 years.

If so, why.  31 March 1977 member's question is as follows: 2 166 (1) to (3) Australia has contributed towards the relief of 1072 disasters overseas, both natural and man-made, by direct bi1 197 lateral grants of cash and commodities and also by regular 523 financial suppon for the activities of the United Nations 964 High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Chil347 dren's Fund and the United Nations Relief and Works 1 Agency. Contributions made by the Australian Government to international disaster relief organisations are listed in 6 270 Table 1 herewith. Contributions for the relief of specific disasters, either direct or through appropriate international organisations are listed in Table 2 which shows the particular emergency and the nature of the assistance given. Total Australian contributions towards disaster relief are shown in (Question No. 266) Table 3. (4) In-depth research would be required before a definitive listing of all disasters occurring throughout the world during the past 5 years could be established. Examination of departmental records, however, indicates that the only major disaster in the period under reference which has not been the subject of Australian assistance was the recent series of eanhquakes in China. In this case the Chinese authorities did not take up the Prime Minister's offer of help.

Taiwanese Fishing Fleets Mr Bungey asked the Minister for the Northern Territory, upon notice, on 10 March 1977: (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports in December 1976 of statements by Mr Ian Tuxworth, member of the Nonhern Territory Legislative Assembly, that Taiwanese fishing fleets operating in Northern Australian waters deliberately allow several boats to be caught by the Navy so other that mother ships and other fishing Australian waters. (2) If so, is there any substance in the statements. (3) Has the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly expressed any view on this subject. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable Government's member's question is as follows: (1) The statements by Mr Tuxworth in October and will December 1976 on the alleged tactics of Taiwanese fisheracceptable men have been brought to my attendon. The matter was cussed at the meeting of the Australian Fisheries Council October 1976. (2) Whilst there may be some factual basis for the matters comments of Mr Tuxworth, this type of information is normally available to officers of my department, who are not involved in patrol duties in the declared fishing zone. The Department of Primary Industry has the major responsibility within this zone. It is assisted patrolling units of the Navy and Air Force. (3) I am aware that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly debated the matter of Taiwanese fishing operPlanning ations in Northern Australia expressing concern at the repeated infringements in Australian waters.

(2) How soon does he expect to have information on the 10 countries which may or may not have closed their vessels can freely fish in embassies.  member' s question is as follows: If so what are the details. (1) I am sure that the honourable member will share the concern both that the Beirut Embassy should be re-opened as soon as possible and that it should be reopened in conditions giving reasonable assurance that staff be able to carry out their duties effectively as well as in conditions of safety. It is also a matter of concern, disin view of the importance of migration from Lebanon to in Australia, to ensure that the many people who may be expected to approach the Embassy in Beirut on migration should be able to do so in safety and with the assurnot ance that their business will be handled promptly and efficiently. In this respect the opening of the Australian Embassy presents different features from those to be taken into account in the case of many others in Beirut. in fisheries surveillance by Recent developments in Lebanon have again demonstrated that this has not been a matter for easy judgment. is however proceeding for re-opening in May, which will providetimefor proper administrative arrangements to be made, including the completion of the migration task-force operation in Cyprus and transfer of staff to Beirut.
