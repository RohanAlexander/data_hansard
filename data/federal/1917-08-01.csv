An allowance, at the rate of £2 2s. a day, was given merly ; but the rate now is £1 a day withi n the Territory, and 30s. a day when away from it .",6
2,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Is the Minister angamite. aware that on Monday evening a.monster meeting was held at Darwin to protest against the re-appointment of Dr Gilruth to the position of Administrator of the Northern Territory, and to demand f r o the Government direct representation? Have the Government any intention of away. granting direct representation to the people of the Northern Territory?",6
3,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"All I know of what took place at Darwin last Monday iB what appeared in the newspapers. stand that a reception was arranged, that there was a counter demonstration. I have had in mind the advisability associating with Dr Gilruth-and I him of this- a council, which would bring knowledge of the administration home the people of Darwin.

7,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Following up the matter referred to by the Honourable member for Corangamite, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he cannot arrange to give the public longer notice of the departure of the mails for the ExpeForces? In Monday's issue of I the Herald there appeared an intimation been that these mails would close at 5 p.m. exyesterday; but yesterday morning's news3d. papers stated that they would close' at in noon - That was obviously an unfair notice to give to the people of the city, formuch less to those of the suburbs. .",6
8,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"- I can only give the honourable member the answer that I furnished to the honourable member for CorI have no knowledge of the particular case to which he refers, but shall have inquiries made, and give him a reply as soon as possible.

PRICEOFCORNSACK S.",6
11,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Is the Prime M in ister aware that the price of cornsacks is daily rising? What steps are being taken to prevent trade juggling in this commodity such as took place last year ?,7
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government have publicly announced that it guarantees that a sufficient supply of cornsacks will be in Australia in time for next season's harvest, andfchafcthese sacks shall be sold at their landed price, less duty. not sure whether anything has been done regarding the price of cornsacks already in Australia.",7
13,Mr RODGEKS,Unknown,There has been a very sharp rise in the price of cornsacks.,7
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We have no control over the market at Calcutta, whence the sacks come. If merchants there choose to put up the price, we cannot interfere with them. But this Government, so far as it can do so, will see that the farmers obtain cornsacks at the lowest price, and will prevent speculators from juggling with the market-to use the honourable member's expression. WOOL TOPS.",7
15,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have been supplied with the following answer to the quesence tion which the honourable member f o Capricornia asked on Friday: The agreement with the two wool-top manufacturers-Whiddo n Brothers Limited, Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited-is dated 1st March, its provisions were settled about two months earlier. This agreement provides that, in consideration for permission to fulfil existing contracts and to carry on their business, making companies shall(a) Pay (not the appraised prices for supplies of wool as provided in the Wool gulations War Precautions Act, as is the case with other woollen manufacturers), but the actual Hat rate, whatever addition to the appraised price that might mean. (This addition now turns out to be 9.5 per cent., or, on the Service of the Commonwealth? quantity of wool that will be consumed to fill the contracts so far entered into, about £70,000 sterling. On purchases made to date, the amount is £17,000 sterling.') (6) Pay to the Commonwealth Government, practically as a licence-fee, 50 per cent, profits. The agreement further provides that, if a war-time profits tax is levied, the trolled companies shall not have more than two-thirds of their profits taken from them under the levy imposed under the agreement inquiries on the subject. and the war-time profits tax. (c) Sell tops only through or with the consent of the Commonwealth Government, so that operations shall be effectively controlled. (d) Pay the. cost of a special continuous audit of their books and accounts by an auditor appointed by the Commonwealth Central Wool Committee, who has full power to disallow any items of expenditure.",7
16,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Is that agreement with Whiddon Brothers Limited, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited specially privileged, or is it possible for any person, firm, or I am company, in the possession of combing, spinning, or weaving machinery to obtain the same concessions in order to make and export the tops?",7
17,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"An agreement cannot be made to cover persons who are not parties to it . By no device of the law can that be done. The honourable member is in error in saying that the agreement gives a privilege to the topmaking firms mentioned. In reality it - takes privileges from them. It takes half their profits, and compels them to pay in the aggregate £70,000 per annum more for raw material than other manufacturers. The latter get their raw material at less than the appraised price, whilst the firms concerned in this agreement are obliged to pay the appraised price, representing an aggregate differof £70,000 per annum. That is a r condition under which those firms are carrying on a controlled business. They are managing their own business, subject and The to the control of the Government. 1917, but FEDERALCAPITAL COMMISSION . POSITION OF OFFICERS.",7
18,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,"I wish to ask the the topMinister for Works and Railways-(1 ) Are the officers responsible for the extratheir ordinary waste of public money, neglect Beof supervision and reasonable administration, as exposed in the report of the Royal full Commission on Wasteful Expenditure at Canberra, still employed in the Public (2) Is Mr W.. B . Griffin now in full control of all works within the Territory, and what is the date of his appointment?",7
19,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The honourable member of the did me the courtesy of intimating that he proposed to ask this question, which reconsembles one that I answered about a week or a fortnight ago, and I have made some W it h the exception of Colonel Miller, who, up to the time of the inquiry, was Administrator of the Federal Capital Territory, all the officers dealt with, in the Royal Commissioner's report are to be found either in the Works Department or in the Department of Home and Territories. Having had an opportunity of examining the Royal Commissioner's report, and of testing it by certain expert advice and analyses, I am bound to say that I do not altogether share his views. I am not one of those who believe that a Minister should hand over to a Royal Commission the responsibility for his Department. I propose, when the Cabinet has had an opportunity to examine the very voluminous data and evidence connected with the inquiry, to submit the matter to my colleagues for consideration, and then to make certain recommendations. As to the second part of the question, Mr Griffin has been for some time-unde r the direction of the ex-Minister for Home Affairs, Mr King O'Malley-in complete supervision of all works in connection with the Federal Capital. His agreement with the Commonwealth Government is dated 18th October, 1913, and it was renewed for three years as from 18th October, 1916. I NVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS BILL. Bill presented by Sir JOHN FORREST, and read a first time. INCOME TAX FORMS.",7
20,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that, notwithstanding the promise he gave last week, that he would take steps to see that income tax forms were obtainable at all post-offices, very many applicants in the northern districts of New South Wales have been unable to obtain them? In view of the fact that returns must be sent in by the end of the month, will the 'right honourable gentleman see that these forms are at once made available'?",8
21,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I shall be glad to make inquiries, and have the matter remedied. Is the honourable member certain that the omission relates to Federal and not to State income tax forms ?",8
22,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Yes . It is the ral income tax forms that' are wanted.,8
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I was informed that the form that was missing related to the State income tax return. I shall at once make inquiries. NA RAILWAY. CASE OF MR . T. P. LYONS.  for Works and Railways received information that one T. P. Lyons, general organizer of the Australian Workers Union, in consequence of information received from a "" junta "" official, had knowledge that suspicion attached to a Government employee in regard to having ""faked"" his time? Further, is it true, that this Mr T. P. Lyons, under A bogus name, sent to the person who is under suspicion, a telegram advising him to be on the alert? If so, what action have the Government taken to deal with this flagrant breach of the regulations of the Post and Telegraph Department?",8
24,Mr WATT,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Some months ago it was reported to me in the Railways Branch of the Department that an organizer in connection with the eastern section of the east-west railway- a man named Lyonshad been in somewhat improper touch - i with one of the station staff of timekeepers, and that this involved the sending of certain telegrams-on e of which, at all events, was under a bogus namewhich were supposed tb warn the official of an approaching visit by the inspectors. I asked for the opinion of the Crown Law authorities as to the law on the question, and, having ascertained it, I sent it on to my colleague the Postmaster-General, with a recommendation that the man be prosecuted. I think that the matter is still in the hands of my honourable colleague. LANDLORDS AND RENTS.",8
25,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In view of the fact that some landlords are raising their rents from 20 per cent, to 30 'per cent., will the Prime Minister induce his Government to bring in a measure that will prevent the raising of rent during war time?",8
26,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This matter has been dealt with on several occasions, and has been considered very carefully by several Fede- Governments of which I have had the honour to be a member. There are many difficulties, as every one knows, in fixing prices; but the difficulties in the way of fixing rents are, I think, if anything, more serious. Short of the creation of a number of rent boards or courts, I do not see how it could be done. W it h the object that the honourable member has in view, I am entirely in sympathy. I have nothing but the most supreme contempt for men who, while not giving a better return for the money, raise rents in time of war. course, a man spends £1,000 on renovating a house, he has a right to a higher rent. If it were laid down as a hardand-fast rule that no landlord shall raise his rent, then a man who improved a house so as to increase its value from £500 to £1,000, would be unable to get any more for it . That is not what is wanted. What is required is that men shall not exploit the public, and particularly the widows and dependants of our soldiers, I confess I do not know how it can be done by law, except, as I have said, by the creation of rent courts, which in themselves would not be an unmixed good. I see no other way of dealing with the evil than that of holding such landlords up to public contempt. They certainly deserve it , and should receive it in ample measure. I wish I knew of some more effective means. If I did , I would immediately adopt them.",8
27,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Government consider the advisability of introhonorable ducing a Bill to create fair-rent the lines of those in Sydney?,9
28,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know what the Courts are in Sydney. My own exto perience of Sydney is that the rents there are certainly not a good example to rest of Australia. If rents in Sydney are question is to be taken as the outward and visible manifestation of what Bent Courts are doing, then God save us from any more such courts!",9
29,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They are reducing claims of landlords and preventing the raising of rents during war time.,9
30,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"V e r y likely the son they are able to do that is that lords in Sydney have raised the rents so articles ? high that they are not able to raise them any higher. ASSENT TO BILLS . Assent to the following Bills reduty, ported :Appropriation Bill 1916-17. Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill 1910-17. Unlawful Associations Bill. Wheat Storage Bill. NORTHE RN TERRITORY. WORKMEN'S DWELLINGS.",9
31,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Can the Minister for Home and Territories give the If , of House any information as to what has become of the suggested ordinance for the control of the' Northern Territory in reference to workmen's dwellings? Is it intended to have a Board, representative of both sides to control the matter?",9
32,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member mentioned to me that he intended to ask this question. . A rough d r a f t of an ordinance was prepared, but as it is in Darwin I have not seen it . Inquiries are being made as to the necessity for passing an ordinance on the lines of the Queensland Act, which makes provision for grants to workmen for the construction of dwellings. The inquiries are as to the extent to which men really desire assistance of the k in d ; and when a report comes to hand I shall be able to tell the House the intentions of the Government. WOO L TOPS: EXPORT .",9
33,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Some days ago themember for Capricornia asked courts on me the following question:How many pounds of wool tops on which bounty was paid were exported from Australia Japan during the period from 1st January, 1908, to 31st December, 1915? the The answer to the honourable member's 16,228,017 lbs. CORNSACKS.",9
34,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Prime the Minister lay on the table the conditions governing the importation. and distribution of cornsacks, and also inform us as reato the way in which the Government prolandpose to remit the duty paid on these",9
35,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have already, in reply to the honourable member for Wannon, explained the manner in which we are going to import cornsacks. As to the manner in which we propose to remit the I personally think the better way would be by a resolution laid on the table of the House. Of course, it is quite immaterial, so far as the farmer is concerned, as to how it is done. the Government is the buyer of the cornsacks, or even if they are bought by private firms, we shall take them over on board, and they will legally become our property. It will then be a matter of a mere bookkeeping entry as between one Department and another, and the bags will be landed free df duty. It will all depend on the arrangement whether we shall retain the property, or hand the sacks over to the private firms which imported them; but in any case the bags will be distributed by those firms at a price fixed by us.",9
36,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does that mean that the sacks already sold will nob have any duty remitted ? Mir. HUGHES - I am talking about the cornsacks to be imported.,10
37,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am referring to those now being distributed. "" Mr HUGHES - We cannot interfere with cornsacks which have paid duty, and are in Australia.",10
38,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am alluding to those - cornsacks now being sold for next year's crop.,10
39,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All those to be imported for next year's crop will , of course, be duty free; the mere matter of how we do this is not very important. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Many farmers have made inquiries from me with a view to ascertaining whether sound second-hand bags will be allowed to be used during the coming season. bags were not allowed last season.",10
40,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No second-hand bags will be allowed to be used. It is considered that the risk is too great; and we shall take every precaution to see that we get new bags as cheaply as is humanly possible. These bags will be duty free, and, in the long run , the farmers will be better off with new ones. NA RAILWAY. ADJACENT LAND .",10
41,Mr RILEY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the Minister for Works and Railways prepared to make a statement as to the condition on which this line is being constructed, so f ar as concerns the land to be the property of the Government on either side? We ought to understand, before the railway is opened, the, conditions on which it has been constructed.",10
42,Mr WATT,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that such a If statement may appropriately be made when the measure concerning bhis line is next before us. RESTRICTION OF SPORT: CONFERENCE.,10
43,Mr BOYD,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"B y what authority, and for what national purpose, was a notice issued to the press to the effect that no reference was to be made to the conference between the Commandant at Sydney and the Sporting Clubs, about the reduction of sports meetings, until the matter had been submitted to and revised by the Censor?",10
44,Mr HUGHES,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am unable to say, bub I do not see anything unusual or improper in the notice. What it ' means is that until the conference makes its report to the Minister the proceedings shall not be made public; and that is quite usual, as in the case of the reports of Select Committees and other reports. There is nothing in this to prevent the discussion of the question of a reduction of sport, and it did not prevent the newspapers anticipating what the conference might say. The newspapers were only prevented from saying what ithe report actually was.",10
45,Mr BOYD,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The press had not to say anything about the matter.,10
46,Mr HUGHES,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think the press thought that the notice meant more than it really did. All it meant was that Such i the press had not to use the Commandant's report before it had reached the Minister, and I think that is quite right. FOOD PRICES COMMISSIONER .",10
47,Mr FENTON,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"As Mr Clarke is about to resign his position as Food Prices Commissioner, have the Government yet decided to appoint a competent man in his place to carry out this very important work?",10
48,Mr HUGHES,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government have decided to appoint a competent man, but the difficulty is to get such a person. Does the honourable member know of a competent man ? It is a standing disgrace to the Public Service of Australia that it is paying a man like Mr Clarke a small salary when a private firm can offer him twice as much, a six years' engagement, and prospects amounting to three times the salary he receives from the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth were to pay Mr Clarke £2,000 per annum, his services would be cheap - at the price. CORNSACKS.",10
49,Mr RODGERS,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A statement was made which gave the farmers the i m pression that they are all to pay a unir form price for their cornsacks. Many forthat ward sales have been made at prices, varyter, ing from 8s. 9d. on the 18th June, to 9s. 3£d. on the 27th July. Do the Gospite vernment propose that any arrangement shall be made with respect to future relutionary quirements, other than sales already Ireland, and named The Nation. made, or are the farmers to make their own private contracts ?",11
50,Mr HUGHES,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They are to make their own private contracts. One reason for the advance in the price of cornsacks is'that the jute market in Calcutta, proprinted bably in anticipation of heavy buying Australia and elsewhere, has' advanced sympathetically, as they say, although i is very unsympathetically from our point of view. The result is that the farmer, by holding back, has now to pay 9s. I see no prospect of the jute market falling between now and the period during which we shall purchase the whole of the sacks required for the next harvest, and I advise farmers to buy. So far I can see, there is no prospect of their getting sacks cheaper than at present. I the local market, however, tries to exploit the farmer, we shall know how to deal with it , but so far as the Calcutta is concerned we can do nothing. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS .",11
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I rise, to make a personal explanation. On Friday I quoted a newspaper which stated that the public? the honourable member for Grey had convened a meeting at Port Augusta some time ago to arrange the rates of pay and working conditions in the Commonwealth Railway Department. The honourable member assures me that he knows nothing about such a meeting beyond what he has read, and I regret my unintentional misbe representation. I understand that the convener - of the meeting was Mr J . J in his own way. Poynton, of the Commonwealth Railway Department.",11
52,Mr BRENNAN,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I wish to make a personal explanation. On the last day sitting I addressed a question to the Prime Minister with regard to that well-known fertilizers? organ of Liberal - public .opinion, 'The Nation, which I distinctly asserted, if that were necessary, was published and printed in Great Britain . I referred also to the Labour Leader. The Prime Minister was good enough to reply, but, owing to the number of interruptions by those honourable members sitting behind him , who apparently knew less about the matter, if were possible, than the Prime MinisI did not quite catch what the honourable gentleman said. I now find that, dethe perfect clearness of my question, he attributes to me a reference to a revoorgan said to be circulated in I doubt if such a paper has circulated in Ireland for 100 years, but I am not sure on that point. My reference was clearly to that organ of public opinion, The Nation, well known in Australia, and and circulated in Great Britain . I in asked the Prime Minister if he approved of such newspapers as The Nation, which t was circulating in Great Britain , being prevented from entering Australia. He will see that the answer he gave to my 3^d. question was irrelevant and useless. PATRIOTIC FUNDS,",11
53,Mr MATHEWS,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In New South Wales patriotic funds are utilized to as supplement the payments to the wives and families of men at the Front. When f public subscriptions were obtained in Victoria and South Australia it was understood that the money would be applied market to the same purpose. In Victoria that has not been done. Will the Prime M in ister say if there is any chance of the Government commandeering the funds in order that they may be applied as was intended when the money was given by,11
54,Mr HUGHES,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Minister in charge of Repatriation, Senator Millen, has this matter in hand, and it has been the subject of deliberation by the Ministry. The Minister has a clear and definite policy which he has recommended to the Government, and which, I think, will satisfactory on the whole.

War Loan Bill. Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill. ARSENAL.",12
56,Mr GREGORY,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Can the Minister for Works say whether any expenditure is being incurred by the Government in connection with that wild and extravagant scheme of the Minister for Defence-'the erection of an arsenal at Canberra? Mr .SPEAKER - Order .,12
57,Mr WATT,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know whether that is a fair way in which to ask a question.,12
58,Mr SPEAKER,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member was certainly not in order in submitting his question in such terms.,12
59,Mr WATT,K ALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have discussed the matwere ter with the Minister for Defence, so far as I know, no expenditure is being incurred in regard to ithe arsenal at the tunity present time.

NA RECRUITING.  prepared to make 'a statement as to the intentions of the Government in regard to those organizations which are passing resolutions prejudicial to recruiting, and which are practically setting themselves up in opposition to the law? "" Mr HUGHES - I have noticed recently only one resolution of the kind to which the honourable member refers, and that was a resolution which was passed by the Trades H all , Melbourne. I have written to that organization asking whether the report which appeared in the press is correct, and I have been informed that in substance it is correct. The Government is now considering what its next steps shall be. When a decision is arrived at, I shall inform the honourable member and the public. POSTA LELECTRICIAN S' AWARD.",12
62,Mr FENTON,RESOLUTIONS PREJUDICIAL TO,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is he aware that Mr Justice Higgins, in the recent Postal Electricians' case heard _ in the Arbitration Court, expressed the opinion that the administrative act of Mr Fisher, postponing the appointments, till six months after the war, of those junior mechanics and mechanics who had passed the examination and awaiting appointments, was illegal and and, contrary to the Begulations? 2. Will he therefore take the earliest opporof rectifying the injustice done by giving these men their rightful appointments? 3. What is the object of the Department in permanently transferring those officers who passed the mechanics' examination and who are now acting satisfactorily as mechanics? 4. Is the Minister aware that these officers whilst acting as mechanics are deprived of their annual increments ?",12
63,Mr WEBSTER,RESOLUTIONS PREJUDICIAL TO,"The Acting Public Service Commissioner has furnished the us that it following replies:1. Yes. It is, however, not considered that administrative act referred to is illegal. 2. The Government has decided to suspend permanent appointments, except'in special cirduring the continuance of the war, and it is considered inadvisable to depart from in the decision in the cases of mechanics. 3. Appointments to the position of mechanio are made as the result of competitive examinaopen to permanent officers of the Service and to persons not permanently in the Service. old, Appointments are made in the order of merit disclosed at the examination, and as permanent appointments from these examinations do have been suspended, permanent officers who have qualified for transfer as mechanics cannot be transferred to that position without prejudicing the claims of other qualified candidates entitled by their order of merit to prior appointment. 4. Officers temporarily transferred as mechanics are paid the minimum salary of that position, and under the recent variation of the award of the Arbitration Court in the case of the Australian Postal Electricians' Union any officer so transferred, and who is a member of the union, will, upon serving the prescribed period, subsequent to l l t h March, 1917, be paid increments as provided for mechanics. . NA",12
64,Mr LAMOND,PEDERAL CAPITAL,"the Minister for Home and T e r r it o r i e s , upon notice I. What is the value of lands owned by the Commonwealth at Canberra f 2. What revenue is derived therefrom T 3. How much of such lands is suitable - for agricultural settlement f 4. How much is suitable for small intensive holdings ? 5. What has been the total Commonwealth expenditure on the Capital site for - (a) lands, (6) works, (c) other purposes? 6. What is the estimated cost of work necessary to be done before the erection of parliamentary and administrative buildings is commenced ?",13
65,Mr GLYNN,PEDERAL CAPITAL,": The answers to t h orable member's questions are as f o l lows : 1. The Commonwealth owns land to the value of approximately £832,000 in the Federal Capital Territory. In this amount is included the Cotter Eiver catchment area, travelling stock reserves, &c., which lands have not been specially valued, but bave been estimated at 7s. per acre, not including the value of any timber. 2. The revenue derived therefrom is approximately £32,000 per annum, inclusive of rates. 3. Under existing conditions the Federal Capital Territory is primarily grazing country, but there are some 3,000 acres of first class, 55,000 acres of second class, and 13,000 acres of third class agricultural land; but up to the present little farming has been carried on owing to the distance from market. In addition, there are some 15,000 acres of land on which apples, plums, and other such f r u it might be produced. 4. Owing to the difficulty and cost of irrigation the area suitable for small holdings under intense culture is very limited. This matter has not been seriously considered, but there are probably about 8,000 acres on the Murrumbidgee suitable for this purpose. The cost, however, of supplying water would be considerable, and to complete the scheme it would be necessary to acquire additional land.

A man who then The war-time profits tax is not to affect incomes from personal exertion. It is a tax upon wealth which is being used for the production of ther wealth, and wages,, rent, light, and all other expenses are to be deducted from profits before they are to be ject to taxation. The measure is a posal to tax the capitalist pure and simple, and is a revelation to the people of the manner in which the Win-the-war party proposes to treat the capitalist war time. This Win-the-war Government, which is so profuse in its lip loyalty to cent, on mortgage. the men at the Front, is going to allow the capitalist 10 per cent, profit, plus £200 exemption, and 25 per cent, of all the excess profit that he can squeeze out of the public in addition. The Treathe surer looks at me with mild surprise. There is no clause in the Bill which that the taxpayer shall have 25 per cent, of the excess profits that he may be able to squeeze out of the public-that will be provided for in another Bill, which conTreasurer is to give us later, fixing the Parrate of the tax. I do not wish to be too severe with the right honourable gentleman; he does not know as much as the Prime Minister knows about the matters to which I am going to refer. His lot has been cast in very pleasant places. I do not suppose that he has ever been in the house of a very poor man. Not so FOBthe Prime Minister. The Treasurer laughs. If the Tight honourable gentleman is Teally acquainted with the life that is lived by the very poor, I shall to include him in the censure that I hope to inflict on the Prime Minister.

80,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"A return of about 6 | per cent, is about the average on present market quotations.",16
81,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The average rate of return at the present time is slightly higher than that which could be obtained prior to the war. I regard this Bill as a mockery. It mocks and jeers at the men in the trenches. Our soldiers are suffering at the present time. Their sufferings are so horrible that the Government will not allow any of the newspapers to describe them, nor will it permit a returned soldier to state what they are from a public platform. This Win-the-war Government is going to allow the capitalist, who is not in the trenches, and who is not! suffering at all",16
82,Mr TUDOR,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,But who is raising prices.,16
83,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Quite so. This Winthe-war Government is going to allow - such capitalists who make these profits to escape this taxation. In his personal letter to wives and mothers of soldiers at the Eront- a letter which he addressed to those whom he knew, as well as to others whom he did not know-the Prime Minister made the statement that the Win-the-war Government would not desert our soldiers or their dependants either now or after the war. I contend that the Government are deserting both, since they are allowing the profit-mongers to make their 10 per cent, profit, and a further 25 per cent, over and above that, by raising the prices of foodstuffs and commodities which the people require. There was a way of protecting the dependants of the soldiers at the Eront, and that was the course we proposed in our manifesto which was described by the Prime Minister as "" a spineless and emasculated thing."" I well remember that the right honourable gentleman spoke in the same way of the Liberal manifesto of the year before.  orable member go on with his Bill?",16
84,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Le t the honourable member take his gruel kindly. Our manifesto set forth that we would allow big companies to make a profit of 1 per cent., and that, as a Government, we would take all profits over and above that amount. That would have been the right way to protect the wives, the children, and the mothers of our men at the Front, since it would have made it unprofitable for these big companies to raise prices. Nearly all the excess profits made during this war are the result of high rents and excessive prices charged for foodstuffs and the other necessities of the general public of Australia. No one knows that better than the Prime Minister. Did he not say to a reporter at Bendigo, "" For forty years I was like the Israelites wandering in the wilderness. I am now in the promised land."" No one knows better than he does what it costs the poor to live. It may be that because he is in the promised land he forgets; it would be more charitable to say that he does not forget, but is powerless, inasmuch as he is now in the hands of the Liberal party, and must do what that party fells him to do.",16
85,Mr ATKINSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,How should we help the poor by taking all these profits?,16
86,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"B y taking all profits over 7 per cent, we would make it useless for exploiters to raise prices. I propose to invite honourable members to consider for a moment what was said by the Prime Minister wben leader of a great party which was very kind to him- a party which overlooked a lot of those personal failings with which we are all more or less afflicted, and which was kinder to him than a mother to her babe. As leader of that party he spoke of "" These unscrupulous persons who are heaping up war fortunes."" It will be interesting to hear what he has to say as leader of the Winthe-war party if he ventures to defend this Bill. In 1915 he issued a pamphlet, at the request of our party, to explain the necessity ior the proposed amendment of the Constitution, and in this he saidWe are fighting a great war; the greatest the world has ever seen. Millions of men have died; many millions have been maimed, wounded, or have suffered from the frightful horrors of modern warfare. . . . No one must be allowed to shirk his duty, and no one must be allowed under cover of this war to exploit his fellow citizens. To-day, as leader of the Win-the-war party, he says, in effect to the profiteers, "" I will allow you to make a profit of 10 per cent. Further, I will allow you a £200 exemption under this Bill , and 25 per cent, of excess profits, or, in other words, all that you can squeeze out of the public in excess of 10 per cent."" In 1915 he saidYet it is certain that this awful war that brought death and suffering to millions already, that has plunged the peaceful world into a very inferno, has ruined industries, made countless thousands homeless and destitute, has brought to some huge profits. He knows what is happening. that this war has brought to some huge fortunes.  Profits Bill which the honourable member brought in , as Treasurer, provide for an exemption of £ 2 0 0?",16
87,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I observe that those who have long entered this House with the support of the commercial classes, are not to be found trying to put me off the track. It has been left to one of the new supporters of the capitalist-on e who also wandered in the wilderness for many years, and is now in the promised landto attempt to do so. He deems it his duty now not to stand by the poor, not to stand by the mothers, the wives, and the children of our soldiers at the Front, but to stand up for the exploiters and other unscrupulous persons who are making fortunes during the war.  fact that the honourable member's Bill provided for a £200 exemption.",17
88,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The exemption of £200 is neither here nor there. What would such an exemption mean to the treasurer of the National Federation who possesses a million of money, and is allowed by the Prime Minister to make 10 per cent, on his million? It would be to him as nothing-as so much dust, such as' that thrown up by the newly found supporter of the capitalist, the honourable member for Grey, who seeks to disturb me. The Prime Minister said in 1915 that this war had brought to some huge fortunes. Those who made huge fortunes then would not allow their capital to remain idle. They have probably invested it once more, and the Prime Minister proposes to allow them to make a 10 per cent, profit, and 25 per cent, over and above that amount if they can get it out of the general public. The right honourable gentleman said in 1915Many have made and are still making great fortunes out of this war. Many more are making higher profits than in peace time, and, despite protestations to the contrary, surprisingly few great companies and capitalists have been seriously affected by the war. It is true that the Prime Minister may has say, "" I wrote that statement as one of the leaders of the Labour party in 1915. I am now in the promised land, and, as the Treasurer said the other day, circumstances alter cases!"" We might well He knows cry, ""Alas for the dominating personality which has ceased to dominate any one!"" Three months ago the Prime M in ister was full of fire. He was eager for War-time battle. Did he not say, when speaking at Bendigo on 28th March lastThere is only one way to deal with a tiger that springs at your throat. It is not to offer him tracts. You want to rip his bowels out. How does this little god of battles propose now to deal with the capitalist, and his fortune, amassed in war time by preying upon the mothers, the wives, and children of soldiers at the Front? In order to show that the Prime M in ister knew what has taken place, let me quote another extract from one of his utterances in 1915. He saidWe all know how the cost of living has increased, so that it is with the utmost difficulty that the bulk of the community are able, even with the greatest economy, to make both ends meet; and, making every allowance for the effects of the drought, there can be no doubt whatever that this is due very largely to the manipulation of the market by unscrupulous persons at the expense of the community. These persons frequently pose as patriots. They subscribe £50 to the patriotic funds and fleece the public by high prices. Under cover of the war they are dipping their hands deeper into the pockets of the people. They are making huge profits at the expense of the community. That was all true in 1915, and it is true today; and the Win-the-war Government have nothing to say about the matter, further than to allow the capitalist, with the limitations proposed, to squeeze all the excess profits they can out of the people. While the wives of our soldiers and others are suffering from high prices, millions of hags of wheat are stacked in our railway yards and other places, thousands of crates of rabbits, thousands of carcasses of lamb and mutton, and thousands of tons of butter are in cold storage. In the face of all this the Win-the-war Government will do nothing to protect the public against exploitation.",17
89,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,There is only three days' supply of meat in cold storage for this city.,18
90,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Then I presume that the stock-owners have done what the Prime Minister told them to do, namely, not slaughter their stock but allow it to remain on the hoof. The honourable member for Hume, who is one of the largest pastoralists in the community, has to laugh at that suggestion of the Prime' Minister, who, while saying that he would protect the wives of our soldiers at the Front, at the same time suggests that the stock should be allowed to remain on the hoof and not killed to supply the public with cheap food. At the present time, some of these unthe fortunate wives of our soldiers, with four, and even up to eight children, are pected, with the high clothe and feed their large families on something like £ 2 10s. per week. ProbMinister ably a woman with four children would, with her separation allowance and all pub together, find herself with not £ 2 8s. per week.",18
91,Mr HEITMANN,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Y o u are entirely wrong. A woman with seven or eight children would get more.,18
92,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,I say that a mother with f o u r children would probably not get more than £2 8s. per week in some of the States.,18

94,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I find that a woman with one child receives up to 38s. and with two children, up to 42s. half-a-crown more for each additional child.",18

96,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The honourable member w may be able to show that in Western tralia a wife with fou r or five children may get a little more than I have stated; but I ask h im to tell us how much a fence, mother with fou r children gets in the way of allowances, and to prove that, try. with all she gets, she can bring up her children, even respectably, in the face of the prevailing extortionate prices which the Prime Minister will do nothing to lower. The right honourable gentleman was asked today whether he would take steps to prevent landlords to r e f r a in from in creasing rents, and his reply was, "" We can do nothing."" The Prime Minister knows, that under the W a r Precautions Act he has power to do anything in war time; and it would be a very easy matter for him to pass a regulation providing that no landlord in the Commonwealth shall increase rents without showing cause. What does the Prime Minister propose to do?. What does this gentleman, who has a certain method of dealing with the "" t i g e r , "" propose? He said today, "" I have the most supreme contempt for such a landlord, and I propose to hold him up in the public pillory."" At this point, however, an honourable member in terjected the question, "" What does the landlord care for that ? "" We may place landlord in the public pillory, but we cannot get a newspaper in town to pubexlish the name of one who has increased prices, to his rent. What do these gentlemen care for the good or bad opinion of the Prime so long as they are permitted by the Government to levy extortionate rents and charge extortionate prices for all more than kinds of foodstuffs? Let us look for a moment at the in creases which have taken place in the prices of some of the main items of household commodities. Bread was 3^rd. a loaf before the war, and is now 4d., although there is no dearth of flour or wheat; butter, which was Is. 3d. before the war, is now Is. 7d.; and meat has from 6 f d . to 10$d.

The reason is clear. The Win-the-war party is now prepared to reward the men who helped it to place and power. Geelong, in January last, the Prime M in ister said he would only ask one question of any one <who wished to be a member of the National Federation, namely, "" Do you put your country and Empire first ¥ If so, in God's name, come in . "" It will be seen that the Prime Minister had the daring to launch his political barque in the name of the Almighty,.and he invited all good capitalists to come in . This the capitalists did, and they put liberally into the political plate. They "" cast their bread on the waters,"" and, after a few months only, it is to return to them. Had the Labour party been returned to power we should, as we said, have taken the whole of the excess profits; and the gentlemen who supported the Win-the-war party knew perfectly well that if we got back again we would do so. therefore, subscribed to the National party's funds in huge donations, which enabled that party to engage publicity secretaries at high salaries, display huge posters, and insert in the daily press large advertisements, costing, in some cases, £50 an issue.",18
98,Mr WEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"'On e advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald cost £110, and another in the Daily Telegraph cost £84.",19
99,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I dare say the honourable member is right. These huge sums, which were used to successfully smash the Labour party, were not found by the general public of Australia, who have not the necessary wealth at their command. The money was subscribed by capitalists, who knew that war-time legislation impending, and they, therefore, assisted to put in power a so-called Win-the-war party, which, when returned, would tect them. MT . HEITMAN - N - Why did the honorsured ahle member, when Treasurer, abandon his wealth levy ?",19
100,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"That is another matter altogether. A levy on wealth might have very disturbing effects, especially i cases where the wealth is not used for the production of other wealth. The Bill of which the capitalists were afraid was the Bill that the Labour party, if returned, would have introduced to take over the whole of the excess profits.. Honourable' members opposite are to get their reward. At I really do not think it worthwhile giving any attention to the machinery clauses of this Bill , because where such a large profit as 10 per cent, is allowed, together with such numerous exemptions and deductions, hardly anybody will be touched.",19
101,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"If a tax on all profits above 10 per cent, will not touch anybody, what becomes of the statement about the huge profits, amounting to 2,000 and 3,000 per cent., which these extortionists are said to be making?",19
102,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Te n per cent, on the £1,000,000 of which the treasurer of the National Federation is said to be possessed would represent to that gentleman a profit of £100,000.

I do not propose to say any more at this stage on the Bill . If the measure passes' the second-reading stage, I may propose two or three amendments in Committee, but, as I have already said, the Bill is a mockery, and is regarded as a joke even by the Melbourne Age, which supported the Win-the-war party during the last election.",19

104,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"This Bill allows more modifications than did the measure I brought forward. The Bill introduced was by the Labour Government applied to insurance companies, and for the life of me I cannot see why proprietary insurproance companies should be exempt. If a life insurance company is distributing its profits amongst the people who have in their lives in the interest of their families, there is some excuse for exempting them, but proprietary companies, which are making war-time profits and dividing them amongst their shareholders n those have no such claim to consideration.",19

The taunts and reproaches which he flung at this side of the House in regard to deserting the men in the trenches were in execrable taste. The only persons who have deserted the men in the trenches are the honourable member and his supporters. We on this side are making appeals for recruits. The honourable member dare not. go on the platform' and aid in getting recruits, because outside organizations with which he is connected have passed resolutions in structing members of the Parliamentary Labour party that they are not to go on the platform to assist the Win-the-war party.",20

The whole burden of the speech to which we have just listened, so far as it referred to the Bill at all, was that a 10 per cent, trade profit is excessive. The honourable member himself supplied the answer to that argument. From ordinary and it investments of a gilt-edged character, in The hon- volving no risk whatever, the investor is able to secure today between 6 and 7 per cent. The slightest inquiry would have enabled the honourable member to discover that today the risks of trade are very serious indeed in consequence of the fluctuations in prices, and particularly because of the difficulty in securing stocks.",20
109,Mr TUDOR,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,The prices are always fluctuating upwards.,20
110,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"At this time, traders must be excessively cautious. They dare not overstock because of the possibility of the war terminating in the not remote future, and a consequent immediate slump in stocks. If it were possible to so frame a measure as to secure the excess profits made by those who have exploited the public, and made money out of the war, our energy should be bent to that policy. Those are the people whom we are all anxious to reach, and honourable members opposite should assist us to do that. But the honourable member for Capricornia has made a fundamental mistake. This is not a Wa r Profits Bill , but a War-time Profits Bill ; and it is the alteration of it from a war profits tax to a war-time profits tax that has brought about the serious anomalies that are incidental to the Bill now before us. I may say that the B i ll is an infinite improvement on the rather crude measure introduced to the previous Parliament by the honourable member. He made his Bill especially anomalous by reason of the fact that he made no attempt to discriminate between the conditions under which the English Act was in troduced and those which exist in our own community. I ask honourable members, in approaching this subject, to bear in mind this fundamental fact, that the War Profits Bill in the Mother Country 'was - introduced because of the war - conditions' obtaining there, for the purpose of discouraging the expansion of trade and in dustry, and concentrating the efforts of manufacturers on the production of armaments and munitions. To-day the Mother Country is practically a huge arsenal. Fulty three-fourths of the business community is directly or indirectly engaged as war contractors or agents, or in some other capacity in dealing with munitions and armaments and other material used in the conduct of the war. Those people are making considerable profits out of the war itself, and whilst there may be some justification for the attempt made to levy a tax on them, we must realise that in. Australia no such conditions exist. A War-time Profits Bill is absolutely applicable to the conditions of the Commonwealth. I would assist honourable members in passing a War Profits Bill for avoided. the purpose of getting at those profiteers who have made money out of the war; but this Bill goes farther and hits in a most cruel and relentless manner those who have been carrying on business in ordinary legitimate channels, and are seeking to develop their operations under conditions altogether unrelated to the war. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - Do you say . that the Bill is cruel and relentless?",20
111,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Yes . Many of the businesses, which this Bill will reach are in no way affected by war conditions. In Australia, we are carrying on business as usual. Only to a very limited extent are we affected by the war. A few people are making money out of the war; but whilst I am anxious to reach those persons by special taxation, I am equally concerned to protect those who are engaged in ordinary legitimate trade. The suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia that the modifications in this Bill indicate that we on this side are standing by the capitalist is too outrageously absurd for serious consideration. As I have already said, we are called upon to assist the Treasurer in his endeavour to secure additional revenue, bu t there will be considerable difference of opinion as to what is the best means of getting it . The Treasurer has evidently been allured by the vast sums of money which have been received under the provisions of the British War-time Profits Act, but even that measure has not been a complete success. On the contrary, it has been a source of disappointment, and has resulted in the cost of the war having been increased by millions of pounds sterling. Raymond Radclyffe, the writer [26] of an article in the English Review, gives valuable information upon this point, and in one passage saysI t was a hideous blunder, and has acted in a manner that none of us foresaw. He adduces facts of a most striking character in order to establish that position.",21
112,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,That is because the tax is being passed on to the public.,21
113,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Of course that in - is the case, and the honourable member will be remarkably clever if he can show how that position of affairs can be",21
114,Mr FENTON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,It cannot be stopped until prices are fixed.,21
115,Mr BRENNAN,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,What is the main point that the writer of that article makes?,21
116,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Hi s object is to show the folly of the taxation. In his opinion the tax should be abolished, and other means of raising revenue resorted to. It is quite true that an Excess Profits Bill was passed in Canada some twelve months ago, and that Dominion has been able to raise revenue to the extent of between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000 from this source, but Canada has no income tax, and this Bil l was brought in to meet that circumstance. If we are anxious to get a parallel to Australian conditions, let us turn to New Zealand, where a similar measure is in operation, though it differs from the Bill before us to the extent that not more than 45 per cent, of the profits are taken. The New Zealand measure has also been a source of the utmost disappointment, and in its operation has created a great number of in justices to a vast section of the community. Furthermore, it has been costly to administer and has not produced the amount of revenue that it was contemplated it would produce. In fact, I am justified in saying that the tax has proved such a failure that it is now about to be repealed, and my prophecy in that respect will probably be verified within the next few days. I asked a friend of mine to secure information as to what the New Zealand tax was likely to produce, and as to what the cost of collection was, and the cablegram received in reply from a reliable source is as follows: No definite information pending Budget which is to be delivered on Thursday. Almost certain to be repealed. Universally condemned. Most inequitable. Probably be replaced by graduated. Endeavouring to ascertain cost of collection. I presume that the ""graduated"" refers to a graduated income tax. This information as to the probable repeal of the New Zealand tax, owing to its having been a failure, ""was confirmed by a statement in the Melbourne Herald last night to the effe&t that it had been decided to repeal the ""War-time Profits Act in New Zealand. I believe that there will be a definite announcement on the subject morrow.",21
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,The New Zealand tax is not on the same basis as that which is proposed in the Bill before us.,22
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"So far as prinTreasurer ciples are concerned, the two measures practically the same, except that in Zealand the Government collect 45 per cent., whereas our Bill proposes to collect 50 per cent, and 75 per cent, of the excess profits. I ask the Treasurer to pause and consider the significance of the pealing of the New Zealand Act. I know, as a matter of fact, that the repeal is to the heavy cost of collection, and unfairness of the incidence of the tax. Those whom the Bill before us will hurt mainly are the proprietors of new busicent, nesses, and those who are engaged in deof veloping struggling industries, whereas they are the very people whom our legisProfits lation should seek to encourage.",22

I commend the honourable member for on the way in which he proposed dealing with this measure. It is not my intention to be ungenerous in my criticism. I.am merely giving honourable members benefit of my investigations. I recognise Uiat there is a genuine effort in the Bill to render some aid to new businesses generally. It was one of the anomalies of the Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia that no such effort was made, and I know that the honourable member for Grey proposed tp amend the measure in that direction. The Bill before us does so, and the amendments effected are of a useful character, but,, for the main part, they depend on the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation.",22

126,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Tba t is exactly what I say. The old-established businesses may maintain their heavy percentage of profits on the pre-war standard. They are certainly not war-time profits, and hence they are not affected by the Bill. In clause 10, an effort is made to assist jnew industries, aud in clauses 14 and 15,' as well as in one or two other provisions, the same attempt is made. I do not propose to refer in detail to tbese clauses, but I desire to make a few comments on clause 10. The Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia contained a very fair provision whioh I am sorry to say is not in the present Bill . Clause 10 of that Bill provided for the setting-off of losses against profits, and read as follows : 10. Where a person proves that in - countingf period, ending after the thirtieth of June One thousand nine hundred and Siis profits have not reached the point which in-volves liability to war-time profits tax, or - that he has sustained a loss in his business, - shall be entitled(a) to repayment of such amount paid by him us war-time profits tax spect of any previous accounting ticular case, period; or (6) to set off against any war-time prohis fits tax payable by him in respect of any succeeding accounting period during thu war, such an amount as will, make the total amount of war-time projits tax paid by him during the whole period accord witli his profits or losses during that iperiod.  sult of adopting such a provision ?",23
127,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"A new or growing business would be able to average , profits.  would never know where he was.",23

130,Sir ROBERT PEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,I am not dealing with income taxation. Had the honourable gentleman given attention to this matter^ he would have discovered that the provision which I have read has stood the test of experience in Great Britain.  what its effects there have been.,23
131,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The provision has not been repealed, and it has been copied in the Canadian legislation. To my mind, it is fair aud reasonable. Pastoralists are seriously interested in this matter, having regard to the fact that a any acpastoralist may make a large profit one day year, and, because of drought, may incur fifteen, losses in the next year or two. With a view to carrying out whab I conhe sider the spirit of clause 10, I suggest certain amendments. That provision readsin reon 1.theWhere it appears to the Commissioner, application of a taxpayer>-in any parthat any provisions of Parts IV., V., and VI . of this Act should be modified in case, owing to(/) the establishment of the business since the war or the fact that the business has only commenced to be remunerative in. the accounting period; or "" (g) any other special circumstances specified in the regulations, the commissioner shall have power to make certain modifications. its I suggest the insertion in paragraph / , after the word ''remunerative,"" of the Treasurer words, "" o r was in process of establishment and growth,"" and I suggest, too, the addition to paragraph g of the words, "" and to secure the percentage standard the on the average during such process of establishment and growth."" I think that those amendments accord with the spirit of the provision, and should be adopted to give needed relief. It Another matter to which I desire to reto fer is the rates of the proposed tax, namely and 50 per cent, and 75 per cent. As the result of inquiry and discussion with his men highly qualified to speak, I am of a the opinion that a tax of 50 per cent, would produce more revenue than the rates proposed. That should be obvious on this reasoning: What we must avoid is the taking away of incentive to enterprise. The result of the announcement of the honourable member for Capricornia that he would allow a standard percentage of only 7 per cent., confiscating practically the balance of the profit, was to stifle enterprise, and to prevent men from launching out in connection with their businesses. This was particularly disastrous because of the unemployment which it caused. No one can go through centres of population in which factories are situated without realizing how manufacturers were frightened by that proposal, which, as I say, caused a vasti amount of unemploymen-ti. If these manufacturers could have had a definite announcement of some generous consideration or relief, they could have arranged their business accordingly. But the announcement that was made had the effect of stifling enterprise, and prevented them from launching out. I have already said , and now repeat, that excessive rates destroy all incentive, and one of two things will happen: there will be no excess profits, made, because manufacturers and traders will not take - the necessary risks, which in war time are considerable, knowing that three-fourths of any profits that may come to them will be taken by the Government. Either that will happen, or the manufacturer orN other taxpayer will pass on the tax to ihe public. Mr Raymond Radclyffe saysTraders do ndd taxes to the cost of the goods. It can lie seen in the annual reports of the thousand and one limited companies which appear e\ery year. Again Every manufacturer has made more money than lie ever made before, and has made it after paying all sorts of preposterous tuxes. He concludesI t was a hideous blunder, and has acted in a manner that none of us foresaw. .  British Government has increased the . rate.",23
132,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Not since then. Another-very important principle which was not in the old measure is introduced by this Bill ; I refer to part IV . , which deals with the computation of profits. In fub-clause 3 of clause 14, provision is made for a process of double taxation, which we in Australia have always protested against and objected to. It is provided thatDeductions shall not be allowed on account of the liability to pay, or the payment of, wartime profits tax, but a deduction shall be allowed for any sum which has been paid in respect of the profits on account of any wartime profits tax or similar tax imposed in any country outside the Commonwealth. It does not say that tliere is to be permitted a deduction of the war-time profits tax paid elsewhere; the only deduction allowed is a deduction from the profits of the amount of tax paid elsewhere. In Canada there is a special exemption regarding war-time profits taxation paid elsewhere, section 3 of the Canadian Act, paragraph c, providingThe amount of any tax paid by a person under the provisions of the Finance Act, No. 2, 1015, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or under any legislation for raising revenue for the present war in force in India, or any colony or dependency of His Majesty, or in France, # Russia, Italy, Belgium, Japan, Servia, Montenegro, Portugal, and any other country that may hereafter become an ally of His Majesty in the present war, or the colonies or dependencies of any of these countries in respect of any business liable to taxation hereunder, shall be deducted from the amount of the tax that would otherwise be payable by such persons under this Act. The Government should consider the wisdom of permitting the deduction of wartime profits taxation paid in the Mother Country or in the other Dominions, even though a certain amount of revenue may thus be losti.",24
133,Mr GROOM,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"That is, tax paid on profits earned in Australia?",24

136,Sir ROBERT BEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The Bill provides only for deductions from the profits of any war profits tax paid out of Australia. It does not provide for the deduction from the tax payable in Australia of the tax already paid elsewhere, a vastly different thing. Double taxation should be avoided.

Let us assume, for instance, that the excess profits of his business in Australia amount to £1,000. In that event, he will be called upon to hand over to the Commonwealth 75 per cent., or £750, and when he forwards the balance of £250 comto London, the British Government will take 80 per cent., thus leaving the merchant with only £ 5 0 .",25

That places British merchants at a disadvantage, and must necessarily discourage them r I am glad to We say that in May last there was an indicathat the British Government proposed to reconsider the whole process of double taxation. I trust that they w i ll do so. Sir Joseph Ward , when in London last year, was able to make a reciprocal arwhich rangement with the British Government excess profits should be taken-as a correspondent of mine points out-as follows : The higher rate declared in either Great Britain or New Zealand should be taken as rate of excess profits, and half should be paid in Great Britain and half in New Zealand. For instance, for this year in England the excess profit is 80 per cent. New Zealand will pay 40 por cent, and England will pay 40 per cent., so you will see that houses like ours trading in New Zealand will contribute SO per cent, of its excess profits to the war. The houses we have trading in Australia will, on the 75 per cent, basis here and the SO per cent, in London, have to pay 95 per cent, of its excess profits. This is a manifest injustice.

Should this be altered to provide that the allowance of £200 runs out at £800, the result would be that a taxpayer making a profit of £800 would, after the first year of taxation, have to pay tax to the amount of £600, retaining £200 for himself, so that be would bo exactly the same position as if he had made excess profit of only £200.

I wish to say at once that there is absolutely no foundation in fact for such a statement. Honourable members on this side do go on the recruiting platable profits. for m , and will continue to do so so long as opinion, is a wrong one. the Government carries on recruiting i voluntary way and does not attempt to exerb economic pressure. That is the nosiwar tion of this party, and I wish to make it quite clear.

This measure, I take ib, is introduced, among several others, for the purpose assisting the Commonwealth in this houn war. of crisis. We all recognise that the is nob over yet, and that today we owe something over £160,000,000, with a cess, growing interest bill every year. war itself is now costing us something like £1,000,000 a week, and, therefore, the financial position is a very serious one. wealth at the present time. This position was placed before, the people by both parties during the recent electime tions, and the people were promised that, whichever party was returned, sufficient revenue would be raised to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. This, break of the war. as I say, is one amongst other measures introduced with a view to assisting us to defray the cost of the war; but, judging from the measure itself, the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong, it would appear that honourable members opposite are mostly concerned about passing a Bill which than is absolutely essential, affect the wealthier people of the cpuntry. the exception of two vital principles, is a machinery Bill , and one really consideration in Committee, and, conseing quently, my remarks at the present will be short. The Bill sets up two positions. I first place it states that any company or business or person-and "" person includes ""company""-wh o two years of the three pre-war years makes no more than 50 per cent, or per cent, on the capital invested, shall not pay a shilling of taxation. Yet we talk about raising money from profits for the purpose of defraying the cost of the and as far as possible removing the load from the shoulders of the great Then, whatever a the pre-war profits may have been for any two years out of three, if these can be shown to have been bad years,the taxpayer is permitted to go back another couple of years in order to decide what are his taxThat provision, in my I agree with n a the honourable member for Kooyong that this is a war-time profits tax, and not a profits tax, and my quarrel with the Bill is that it should be one to provide for war profits tax . ' An y concern that earns anything like 10 per cent, ab a time like this is earning more than it is entitled to. This is a time of distress, when we hear honourable members on both, sides, and also the people outside, urging how necessary it is to do everything possible of towards the successful prosecution of the However, we do not hear much war nowadays of that declaration by Mr . Lloyd George that, in order to attain suci t is as essential to have the "" silver The b u l l e t "" as to have the men. On the contrary, we see every effort made to protect people who are amassing considerable In my view, if we are able to live comfortably at a like this, it is just about as much as we can expect, but we know that there are people who have increased theii banking accounts most rapidly since the outThis fact is proved by statistics and the banking returns, which can lead us to no other conclusion than that there are people who are now making and from more money than ever before.",28
168,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Many industries have had to suspend the use of their capital will nob, more for the time being.",28
169,Mr CHARLTON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I am not saying W it h that there are not exceptions. I am now this speaking in general terms, and the facts for must guide us to a large extent.. Accordto the Bill a new business comstage menced since the outbreak of the war may be permitted to earn 10 per cent, n the with a £200 exemption, and the honourable member for Kooyong apparently con"" tends that, by this provision, such new in any businesses are placed at a disadvantage. I ask, however, how many new businesses 60 established in normal times can show a profit of 10 per cent, in the first two years? If there are such businesses they ought certainly to be asked to contribute something towards paying the cost of the war. After all, when we are borrowing money at 4£ per cent., in order to carry on the war, it seems absurd to allow to - those who speculate in other ways a profit of 10 per cent, before they are required to pay any taxation. To my mind, a profit of 7 per cent, is quite adequate at a time like the present. It must be borne in mind that this Bill will operate only during the period of the war. It relates to profits made during war time, and when peace is declared it will cease to have any application. But we are creating for the purpose of collecting these war-time profits machinery which will cost a considerable sum of money, because it will be necessary to set up a large staff; and if the tax will raise only £450,000 per annum, will it be worthwhile? Shall we get out of it any money to assist in prosecuting the war and pay our interest bill ? In view of the statement made by the Treasurer, that he estimates to get only £450,000 per annum under this Bill, we are not justified in making the people believe that we are passing it as a means to raise money to assist in carrying on the war. Compared with our requirements, the revenue it will raise will be infinitesimal. Throughout the measure an endeavour is made to assist to escape taxation those who should be paying something out of their profits towards financing the war. There is exemption after exemption, which permits persons who are making profits in any industry to escape paying any tax at all. Indeed, if the Bill is agreed to in its present form, very few people will pay the tax. Certain reductions' are to be allowed for all mining companies other than those raising coal, and the Treasurer explained that coal mines are not exempted, because they have a considerable life. I tell the honourable gentleman that there are many silver, lead, copper, and zinc mines that have a longer life than coal mines. There are mines of that description in operation in Australia today which have outlived many coal-mine propositions. After all, the life of a coal mine depends on the area available for working, the thickness of the seam, and the percentage of coal obtained from it. I fail to see why we should give exemption to companies that are doing particularly well. Let me draw the attention of the House to some mining companies which are not raising coal, but which will be entitled to make considerable reductions in connection with this tax. The Mount Lyell Mine, for instance, has paid in dividends £3,940,000; it has 1,289,195 shares at £ 1 each, and its value today is £1,650,000. That mine has won in dividends considerably more than the amount of money invested in it, and it is still a good proposition; yet, under the Bill, it may claim certain exemptions. The Mount Morgan Mine has paid in dividends £9,033,000; it has 1,000,000 shares at £ 1 each, and its present-day value is £1,625,000. The Wallaroo ancl Moonta Mining Company has paid in dividends £2,435,250; it has 160,000 shares at £2 each, and its present value is about £440,000. There, again, the dividends are considerably in excess of the capital invested. Silver, lead, and zinc mines are also entitled to certain consideration under the Bill. I find that the Broken Hill Mine has paid in dividends £2,115,000; it has 130,843 shares at £1 each, and its value today is £1,657,000. Whilst the Broken Hill Proprietary has paid in dividends £10,169,552; it has 1,181,006 shares at 8s. each, and is reckoned to be worth today £2,598,200. No coal mine in Australia can show a return equal to any of those I have just quoted, and many of our coal mines have started later than the silver and lead mines, and will finish sooner. Those copper, silver, lead, and zinc mines ought not to have any more liberal exemption than is permitted the coal mines, because they aie better profitearning propositions. When the honourable member for Capricornia was speaking, another honourable member interjected in reference to the wealth tax. Repeatedly I stated on the public platform, when it was unpopular to hold such views, that I did not approve of a wealth tax, because by taxing the wealth of the country we should be hitting the worker engaged in the different industries. My ideal form of taxation is a tax on income, and let it be sufficiently stiff to raise enough money to pay interest on the war debt, and also something to liquidate the principal. I have never advocated a wealth tax, because I know that such au impost would have a boomerang effect, and that the workers would feel it more than any other section in the community. It appears to me that the tax proposed in this Bill will work out in this way: Pre-war profits can be established afc 20 per cent., 30 per cent., or 40 per cent., and perhaps today 70 per cent, and 80 per cent', is being made. The Government may take a percentage of those earnings, b ut that will not preventl a company or firm still further raising the prices of its commodities. The poor consumer will not be helped, because it is clear that, if the firm increases its prices, although the Government will take 50 per centi. the business will still have 50 per cent, for itself. A certain amount of money will go to the coffers of the Treasury, but the community will be so much the poorer because of inflated prices. In my opinion, that is not sound legislation. This Bill is only a skeleton. It will not assist to any great extent in financing the war. Therefore, I shall reserve for the Committee stage any further remarks I have to make. There are many clauses which ought to be re-modelled, so as to reduce the number of exemptions, and secure a tax which will raise something like £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 per .annum, instead of the £450,000 which the Treasurer estimates.",28
170,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Henty) [6.1] - At the outset of my remarks I should like to congratulate the Treasurer on the vast amount of effort he has applied to the drafting of his Bill . I do not know that a more complicated and intricate measure has ever been introduced to Parliament, for it touches all industries developed and carried on under war conditions. An y person having an inside knowledge of the working conditions of businesses ' and their ramifications must approach a matter of this kind with considerable care. I think the Treasurer has done this admirably. Previous drafts of the B i ll also gave evidence of very careful consideration, and the different Treasurers, having regard to the views of their respective parties, tried to meet a very difficult situation. present Bill , being largely a copy j f the English Apt, necessarily deals with conditions that are not manifest in this country to any great extent. I have three main objections to offer to it in its present for m : firstly, that it circumscribes the area of the tax altogether beyond what, in my judgment, is fair and reasonable; secondly, that its retrospective operation is grossly unfair; and thirdly, that it will allow businesses which were making large profits before the war to escape their fair share of the burden of taxation whilst their competitors are heavily mulcted. That last objection may be 'inseparable from a war-time profits tax, and I agree with the honourable member for Hunter that the weakness of this class of taxation is that in trying to reach the war profiteer we may in j u r e the whole community. If we could reach the men who are making money oub of the war I should not care what percentage of their profits the Government proposed to take, but a war profits tax and a war-time profits tax are two totally different and distinct propositions. Yet the exemptions in the Bill in some cases apply to actual war profits made under war, conditions and subject to taxation profits that are not in any way due to the war. This creates conditions that make the measure extremely complicated and likely to be unfair to a large section of the community.",30
171,Mr FINLAYSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Then the Bill is not what it pretends to be.,30
172,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"It pretends to be a wartime profits tax, but what honourable members desire, I think, is a war profits tax. The only reason for inserting the word "" time""* in the title of this and similar measures is so that everybody may be roped in within its ambit. The Treasury officials have adopted this method of simplifying their work because they realise the difficulty that faces them in deciding what are war profits and what are war-time profits. There would be an excellent reason for circumscribing the area of the tax, if it were a war profits tax ; it could be con1 fined to those people who are making war profits, while those who are carrying on their ordinary businesses could be eliminated from its scope. It is a fundaThe mental axiom which is accepted by the great bulk of honourable members on this side of the House just as strongly as it is by honourable gentlemen opposite that no person is entitled fco make money out of the war. If any person is supplying the troops with clothing, food, or munitions, he is entitled to payment for his services to cover the expenses of his establishment, bnt he is certainly not entitled to pile up huge profits. The worse feature of the Bill is the exemptions that are provided. terest of many honourable members in the Bill ceased when they learned that their constituents were exempted from its operation. Those who represent farming areas pure and simple, knowing that their constituents have been exempted, are displaying no further interest in the measure.",30
173,Mr CORSES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,That should not prevent them from endeavouring to frame a Bill that will provide revenue.,31
174,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"It should not; but those who have been in public l if e for some years know the habits of honourable members. It is very irritatin g to have to listen ' to a dozen speeches on such a subject in one day, aud honourable members are very glad to get rid of a Bill in which they are not interested when they have heard three or four speeches upon it . They are glad to get out of the chamber for a spell; but if there is a Bill of interest, fco their constituents they are always here, especially if it might affect their constituents detrimentally. If the Bill does not affect their constituencies they feel bushel. that there is no call for the in to be in the chamber-that is a principle that any honourable member could stand to on a public platform-buf c even though an honourable member's constituents are not affected by a Bill there are plenty others whose constituents are affected, who are prepared to give consideration it. The great weakness of this measure is the exemptions which prevent honourable members from being interested in it , and from having regard to how their constituents are affected. Exemptions are vided i u regard to agriculture, the mining industry, and professional occupations. In fact, the only people who will affected by the Bill are the commercial community, or tliose who are running businesses. I wish to test the farming community and professional gentlemen the principle that I have laid down, that gone ou active service. no persons who are making profitsout the war should be exempted. The farmer is receiving 4s. 9d. per bushel for wheat.  He does not get that amount at his railway station I",31
175,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Then we will say that he is getting 4s. 6d. per bushel. In preThe in - war years the average price of wheat was about 3s. per bushel, and the difference between that price and the present pool price is purely a war profit.",31

177,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The increased cost of production has to be taken into consideration, as well as other additional charges, but they do not contradict my statement, they merely serve to modify it . . A f t e r we have allowed every deduction in relation to in - .> creased cost of bags, increased cost of labour and extra railage charges, and every additional cost in the carriage of his wheat to the market, the difference between the pre-war cost of wheat and the pool price is a war profit ; and I fail to see any good reason why the farmers should be exempted from a Bill that is put forward for the purpose of raising money in order fco defray war expenses. If there were no wheat pool, what would be the price of wheat for which the farmer is now getting 4s. 6d. per bushel?",31

I do not and expect him to support me in a proposition, to to abolish the exemption as applied tofarmers. Nevertheless, I want my argument answered in such a way as to show that it will be unfair to tax these people who are certainly making war profits. Now let me turn to the professional men prowho are exempted. I saw a statement the other day in a Sydney newspaper that some medical men were earning £15,000 be and £16,000 a year-thos e were the topnotchers-whil e others were earning from £5,000 to £6,000 a year.

I do not think that it can be denied that it is a war profit. A r e not the dentists in exadtly the same position? Many of us have had friends who have walked out of their businesses, and gone to the Front, and been killed.' Their practices have gone to those who remained behind, and the latter have made war profits.",31
182,Mr HEITMANN,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"In justice to the medical profession in Western Australia, it should be said that the doctors there in many cases are preserving the practices of those who have gone away.",32
183,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I hope the honourable * member will not think I am making an attack on the medical profession, or on any profession. I am merely discussing the question in its relation to the Bill . I feel that the Bill will not accomplish whafc the House desires to do, nor in the words of the honourable member for H u n ter, will it be worthwhile to go on with it unless it be amended. There are the members of the profession to which the honourable member for Wilmo t belongs, the lawyers, - with whom no one has any sympathy, and who, fortunately for them, need none -.Their income has been increased by the war for the same reasons. So, too, with the architects, accountants, engineers, and other - professional men. The lessening of competition has given them more work, and the extra income earned is purely and simply war profit, which a War Profits Bill should tax. Every one, I think, is of opinion that gold-mining is an industry the profits of which should be exempted, because the price of gold, which is the standard by which to measure the values of all other commodities, cannot be increased.",32
184,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"If a store of hidden treasure were unearthed, would it not be fair to levy a tax upon it? . Mr BOYD - I shall deal with that point later. The profits from all mining operations, except gold-mining, are taxable. No one knows better than do the honourable members for Hunter and Newcastle, and myself, that a coal mine is a wasting asset, and that the waste of a coal mine proceeds at a more rapid rate than that of a gold, silver, or copper mine. Nearly all the coal mines at Newcastle itself are Is it now worked out. The coal from the district is now being won in mines away from the town. With the facts of that case in mind, how can any one say that a coal-mine is not a wasting asset? The Victorian State Coal Mine is an asset that is wasting very rapidly.

I propose to read two letters I have received from agents who come within that category. They are worthy of the attention of the House, because they put the position of a man who was earning a salary and who subsequently became a commission agent. In the first of these letters the writer points out how he will be affected under the Bill as it standsTlic present basis of the war profits tax does not give any exemption to the business which makes its profits entirely on a commission basis, or, in other words, from ""personal exertion."" 1 was employed some eighteen months ago on a salary, but decided to commence on my own account as manufacturers' agent and broker. The business is conducted purely on a commission basis, which vendors pay on a sale being made. I have not received any profits from a sale of goods other than my commission. As the Bill now stands, if during the present year my business shows a profit of £1,000, £450 will have to be paid to the Government as profits tax. This would be a hard hit, considering that some little time ago I was offered a position of £S0O per annum, which, of course, - v would not be taxable. It would appear to be an oversight in the Bill that a business worked on purely a commission basis is subject to taxation. Any increase in my earnings is really due to my getting the full benefit of my own personal exertions.

I come now to the second part of argument, and that is as to the retrospecmonths tive operation of this Bill . I consider it to be the duty of Parliament to provide for the financial needs of the country during each financial year. If the gation to find money to meet! the needs the country extends beyond the estimated revenue, then it should be the duty Parliament to raise by way of additional taxation sufficient to cover whatever it may be, so that we may close the financial year without any loss.

The rest of his earnings are left in the busiis ness, in order to develop it . Perhaps per cent, of the business community carry on their enterprises upon overdraftsmoney borrowed fro m That goes to show that men, in the conduct of their businesses, are generally a little b it ahead of their capital; the f a c t that overdrafts continue year in and year out shows that the businesses are always a little ahead of the man who earns the capital to work with. In a young country like this, which is developing its natural resources, that must always be so. the banks' capital,. which is the capital invested by the great bulk of the people in banks for safe keeping, is utilized by business men, and, therefore,the' gives employment to a considerable numprober of people: and if that source of capital is cut off, the employment of the commimity is injured very materially. If we take the year 1935-16, which this tax proposes to cover, we realise that a man who has made his profit in that year has per drawn whatever allowance he was accustomed to, and has naturally spent it . ? The balance has gone into machinery, stock, or plant of different-kinds; but once it has gone into machinery, this machinery cannot be sold to meet the tax in j u r in g the business and throwhave ing men out of employment. To demand a tax of 50 per cent, now, two years after only the money was earned, is a ridiculous",34
198,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,The community has,34
199,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Notic e is nothing. The very best answer I can give the honourable promember is that the gentlemen who gave notice that they were going to impose the tax have since been before the electors, the issue and have met their doom. Mr RTT.ET - The Prime Minister was leader of the party at the time, and he",34
200,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The gentleman who in othertroduced that proposition was ""the ex-Treasurer-the honourable member for",34
201,Mr FINXAYSOTT,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,You do not suggest that this was an issue at the election?,34
202,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"No ; but it w as just as > busimuch an issue as any other question. When we ask for a decision from the electors at a. general election we have to take a verdict on a whole policy; there no way of disentangling the issues out, 90 and saying that the contest has been on this principle or that. The fact that at party is elected or thrown out is the only the banks. thing by which we can judge. Let me give you the case of a man who earns £1,000 a year, and has drawn a sum of fSOO for his personal use, putting £200 as capital into his business to extend and develop it. If , before the war, he was earning only £500, he is how in such a position that he has to pay 50 per cent, as.the 1915-16 tax, and 75 per cent, as the 1916-17 tax. That means that he has to find £150 as taxation for the year before last, £225 for the last year; or £375 out of his £1,000 for this year. It is all very well for honourable members to fix their minds on men who are drawing hundreds of thousands of pounds a year, but there are mighty few 'of tliese, if any, in this community. ""When we pass a Bill of this nature we have to remember that it affects everybody wbo comes within the area, and that it reaches, among others, the man who is earning £1,000 a year. Is it equitable to say that a man earning' £1,000 a year should be taxed to the extent of £3jT5, while a man who earned £20,000 a year before the war, and is now earning £18,000, shall not be taxed at all? That is what the proposition really is. In the case of the man who is earning £1,000 a year, and who has spent £800 of it for his personal use, he, instead of allowing the £200 to go into the development of his business, will have to' use it to meet this taxation-h e has find £175 out of the money he put into machinery or stock for the development of his business the year before. This means that we are going to force him to sell his goods or to curtail his business, or, of course, borrow from the bank on an overdraft. Let me give honourable members another case. We are going to impose on agents here, for businesses conducted in other countries, the responsibility of fixing what profits these businesses have made, and what tax shall be levied. An agent here for a firm at Home or in America receives goods on commission. When they arrive he is told that the selling price is £5; and he, perhaps, sells at £5 5s. or £5 ""10s., and thus makes his profit. He does not know what was the cost of manufacture, or what was the price in the country from which the goods were shipped; all he knows is the cost landed here. Yet he is to be held responsible for making a return showing the profit made by the firm in America or ""in the Old Country. The thing is manifestly impossible. In the first place, he has not the information, and if he asked for i the would be promptly told to mind his own business. Of course, it might be said, ""Let these people take their business away""; but if that answer were made, what is the jiosition? Take petrol as an illustration. We are developing, or trying to develop, Our oil-fields, though we have not got very ,far yet. I know that the honourable member for Barker is deeply interested in this matter, and I am sure we wish him all success, not only for himself, but for the benefit of Australia, and we should be glad to classify him as one of the oil kings in the future. At present, however, we produce no oil, but'are dependent for the motive force of all internal-combustion engines on the petrol that comes from abroad. If the Bill were to operate in such a way that the representatives of the shippers of petrol were told that they must give a return of the profit made in Australia by the sale of the goods, they would be told by their principals, ' ' you can tell your Australian Government, with our compliments, that if they do not want our business we shall withdraw our goods."" What would be the result? Do you think they would to suffer? We should be the sufferers, for all the works operated by internal-combustion engines would be closed down, and men thrown out of employment. The ramifications of these businesses are much too intricate for Parliament to deal with, for we do' not, and cannot, know the whole of the circumstances connected with them. Let me give another illustration of an old-established firm, which may have been making huge annual profits before the war. Such a firm is not taxable at all under the Bill.",34
203,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,All the honourable member's arguments would apply to an income tax.,35
204,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"No , they would not.",35
205,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I mean as to ramifications of business, and the difficulty of deciding what tax ought to be paid.",35
206,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Le t us take the case of two men, A and B, both in a big wav of business, and A making £60,000 a year before the war. In the accounting period that income goes down to £40,000, while competitor B , who pushes his business, and owing to some fortunate circumstance, raises his income from £20,000 before the war up to £40,000. At the present time two such competitors would be on the same plane, earning exactly the same income. One of these men has lost £20,000 of his business, and the other has gained a like sum.  every time.",35
207,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I am glad the honourable member admits the facts, for he shows that it is an ordinary illustration, though my figures, of course, are fictitious. What happens? The man who has in creased his business has to pay for 191516 a tax of £10,000 out of his £40,000, the next year he has to pay the 75 per cent, tax of £15,000, and, as iti has all to be paid in one year, he is called to pay £25,000 out of his profit. Each of. these rneu is earning the same amount of money, but one is taxed to the extent of £25,000, while the other goes scot free.",36
208,Mr FINLAYSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Why not, if he lost £20,000?",36
209,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"He has not lost £20,000 - h e has made £20,000 less, and it might be on the turnover, in a case where there is not such a large capital. A Bill that operates in this way operates unfairly. Why should men with big in comes not bear their fair share of the burden of the war, along with men of smaller incomes? Parliaments as a rule copy one another's legislation, and the Bill is almost a of the British measure. 'This latter as the Treasurer told us, was introduced in the British House of Commons because of the huge profits that were being made by munition makers. Tha.t could not be prevented, because the munition makers were employed in the very midst of - the war, manufacturing and supplying goods for the troops, and putting on practically what prices they liked, until they were checked and controlled by the Government. Their position was totally different from the position here. The British Government then came down with their war-time profits tax measure, and, through it , got at the whole of these people. The munition manufacturers of England are the men who pay the great bulk of this taxation. We have been told that f b r the first year this taxation at Home realized £86,000,000, the next year £120,000,000 with a 60 per cent. tax, and that this year an 80 per cent, tax is expected to raise £200,000,000. By means of this Bill the Treasurer says he expects t'o raise £450,000. The war-time profits tax at Home raises revenue representing £ 5 per head of the population each year. That is an enormous sum, and it means that a man with a family of five pays an equivalent of £25 in taxation. Now what is the effect of this wonderful measure of ours in Australia? It means revenue averaging Is. lOd. per head of the population. In other words, the B ritish tax yields fifty-five times more per head of population than will the tax proposed i u this Bill , and I do not wonder that the honourable member for Hunter interjected, when the Treasurer was moving the second reading, "" What is the good of going on with a Bill like this?"" That disappointment is based on the idea that general profiteering is taking place in Australia.",36
210,Mr WATKINS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,There is no doubt that there is some profiteering.,36
211,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I am prepared to admit that there are special cases of profiteering, in which men are making money out of the war, and if it could be done I would tax them for the benefit of the State to the extent of all the money they are making in that way.",36
212,Mr WATKINS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Some of them are old businesses, too.",36
213,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"T r u e ; but many men re-draft who are making money out of the war r are being exempted because of the difficulty of f r a m in g an Act which will in clude all people. That - there is any general profiteering in this country is disproved by the remarkable admission of the honourable member for Capricornia when he said, ' ' If you impose a profits tax with an exemption of 10 per cent, you will get nothing."" If« that statement is true, and I am prepared to admit that it is very close to the mark, it explains why, under this measure, the Treasurer expects to receive only £450,000 per annum. Is it worthwhile Parliament imposing a tax of this kind if we can get the money we require in another and fairer way? Is it worth the trouble of placing upon the community the obligation to prepare returns in relation to their business dealings? It is possible that, in some cases, returns for eight separate years will require to be prepared. will be the returns for the war years, for the three years before the war i order to arrive at a pre-war standard, and, if the taxpayer can show by his balance-sheets that those three pre-war years were abnormally poor, he is titled to give a return for the three ceding years. The Commissioner say, ' You can give me your balanceants. sheets.""",36
214,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,They ought to be in existence.,37
215,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"They ought, bu6 in some cases they may not be in existence, and it is possible that some men may be comwho pelled to prepare and submit to the Taxaand tion Commissioner balance-sheets for eight years. In objecting to a Bill of this kind, it is necessary to show how a sum of money can be obtained equal to that which the Bill is estimated to raise. I say that most equitable for m of taxation I know is the New Zealand system of imposing a super-tax on all profits made above a cerlooks tain standard. B y adopting that system we should ensure that every penny of the tax would go into the coffers of the Treaaverage sury. Under the Bill , however, the vernmeut will require to create a new department, the cost of which will be least £50,000 per annum. members may be surprised at that figure, but investigation will show that a departdepleted. ment to collect £450,000 per anuum f r o this tax will cost about £50,000 a year. In time of war, when we all believe in economy, when it is undesirable to create now billets, and when the present macon.e chinery is capable of collecting the tax, we ought to allow' it to be collected in such a manner that every penny it yields w i l reach the Treasury. In dealing with a return it is just as easy for the assessing officer to say that the taxpayer shall £50 or £75 as to say that he shall pay £10. Only the one calculation is required. Extension of time granted.",37
216,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Will not this tax be adindustry. ministered by the Income Tax Commissioner and his staff?,37
217,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"That is the intention o the Government, but there is an effective, answer to that proposal. If it is tended that the present Commissioner and staff can, in addition to the work Tbere now do, administer the hundreds of and thousands of returns that will come in n from the commercial community all over Australia, the Department must be underworked or over-staffed today. I am quite sure that this tax cannot be collected unenless a new Department is created, and prethe creation of a new Department will may mean the employment of expert accountEvery man's business differs from every other, and lawyers who have to deal with complicated business suits sometimes have to spend days in getting a grip of the intricacies 'of a business before they can argue the case in Court. We shall require to have in the Taxation Office men will deal fairly with the taxpayers, at the same time be able to analyze the statements in such a way as to secure a fair deal to the State. A lot of people, including myself, thought that this tax would yield a huge sum of money, and I was rather startled the when the Treasurer told us what he estimated to get from it . But when one ap-t plies his mind closely to the subject, and about to discover where the revenue is to come from, be realizes that his former expectations were not justified. The man's mind at once fixes on the Gosquatter as a man with big revenues who can afford to pay this tax. But what are at the facts in regard to the squatting indusHonorable try? The year 1914 was a year of drought, and the flocks and herds were I u many cases half, and in m other cases more than half, the stock was lost. The price of wool in the pre-war years was from 10d - to l i d . per l b . ; the price today is 15id. per l b . Before the war a squatter may have derived an in of £40,000 or £50,000 from a certain number of stock. "" In 1914 he lost a big percentage of his stock, with the result l that, althoup-h he gets 4d. per lb. more for his wool, he has only half the quantity to sell. Therefore, he has not anything like pay the income he had before the war, and as a consequence he will pay next to nothing under this Bill .  the squatting industry than in any other",37
218,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"All these arguments show that we shall get Little or nothing from f the squatter as a class by this taxation. In other countries the persons who pay conhuge sums to the national exchequer by way of war profits are the manufacturers they of munitions. In Australia we have no 698 War-time Profits Tax [REPRESENTATIVES.] manufacturers of munitions, consequently we have no body from whoin we can get huge war-profits taxation. It must be remembered that although a man may appear to be earning large sums of money, wages, interest, and raw material have all risen in price; he may be turning over a huge sum in his business compared with his pre-war turnover, but he may not be making a greater profit. The main ground upon which this Bill is based is the general feeling throughout the community-and a very legitimate feeling it is, too-that the cost of living to the working classes has risen so much that - some people must be making a huge profit, and those people ought to pay special taxation. By what is the cost of living represented ? The , staple products of lif e are bread, butter, sugar, milk, potatoes, eggs, and onions - All those commodities have risen in price, but the men who produce them are exempted under this Bill .",37
219,Mr FALKINER,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Because they are paying all the increase for labour.,38
220,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Whateve r the reason may be, these are the items that affect the cost of living, and the men who produce those articles are exempt under this Bill .",38
221,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Coa l is a necessity about which the honourable member knows something. Does he think that £ 3 5s. per ton is a fair retail price?,38
222,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"No one pays price. Recently a big strike in the coal industry was settled by the Judge giving the men what they demanded and allowing the employers 3s. per ton extra to cover the increase in wages. The employers were satisfied, the employees were satisfied, and the poor, suffering public had to pay.",38
223,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,The public are paying 3s. 3d. per cwt.,38
224,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"That is the consequence of the act of the Court. The allegation of profiteering, as some honourable members are in the habit of calling it , is based upon the increase i nfchecost of living, and if the position is analyzed it will be found that men are not making the profits that some honourable members think are made, and the Treasurer will not get the millions that some honourable members thought he would get from this tax. Of course his estimate is only a rough one; his officers cannot calculate the revenue with any accuracy, but I consider that it would be Assessment Bill. far better to utilize the provisions of the Income Tax Act, and impose a super-tax on the excess profits that have been made, rather than create a new Department for the purpose of imposing a war-time profits tax. 1 I am reminded very much of a story with which the Minister for Works and Railways is very fond of entertaining his hearers. A professor once asked a lad if he could get him any frogs. The boy replied, "" Yes ; there are thousands of them in our pond."" The professor told the boy that he did not need thousands of frogs, but he would be pleased if he couiu bring along two or three hundred for his classes. Subsequently the boy arrived at the college with a cart and some kerosene tins, and said to the professor, "" Here are your frogs."" But when the professor examined the tins he saw only four frogs in them. Thereupon he said to the boy, "" I thought you had hundreds of thousands of frogs in your pond?"" "" So did I , "" replied the boy; "" I judged so from the amount of row that they made."" It is the same in regard to this profiteering. There is a lot of noise made, but when we come down to solid facts and to the calculation which the officers have submitted to the Treasurer we find that, instead of the revenue from a war-time profits tax being millions, it will be a paltry £400,000. that In reference to the 75 per cent, aspect of the matter, if I offered an honourable member certain work, and told him that I would give him £ 1 for doing it , I would be in danger of personal violence if , after he had done the work, I said that I was going to take back 15s. But that is exactly how it is proposed to treat the manufacturer, the producer, or the businessman. We expect him to expend his energy in developing his resources, and give up 15s. out of every 20s. he makes.",38
225,Mr WEST,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Why not?,38
226,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"If that is the idea of some honourable members they will be sadly disappointed. No man, so' long as he carries on his business within the law, will be anxious to expend his energies in earning money, knowing that 15s. out of every pound he earns is to go to the Government.",38
227,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Do not threaten to ("" slow down "" !",38
228,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"It is not a question of "" slowing down."" The man will say to himself, "" I am making a very comfortable living; why should I break my neck or take any undue risks if I am to get little or nothing for it V The effect of this legislation will be to induce men who are carrying on businesses and making money to "" slow down "" - if honourable members like to so term it-thei r energies and keep their profits down to what they were prior to the war, and invest them in gilt-edged securities. A man takes a certain amount of risk i u tryin g to earn money. Immediately we propose to tax him to the extent of 15s. out of every 20s. he earns he will cease to take risks. The result of his ceasing to take risks will be that a large number of people will be thrown out of employment, and those who will be thrown out of employment will soon be crying out about depression in the community, and wondering what has h it them. In fact, there are already many out of employment today owing to this proposed taxation. Its effect is now operating. Immediately Parliament threatens to do anything people become scared, and endeavour to get to cover. Immediately business people are threatened with the imposition of taxation that will levy 15s. out of every 20s. they will not continue to develop their businesses.  the honourable member suggests.",38
229,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"It will take 15s. out of every 20s. of the extra profits that are made.  profit to be made, and then takes 15s. out of every 50s.",39

I thank honourable members for the courteous attention that they have given to me, and for the extension of time which I was granted. In conclusion I say that it is the duty of Parliament to get the money necessary to meet the expenditure that we are incurring in connection with the war, but it can get that money IJ another way. Levying a super-tax under the income tax would be a fairer way and moreover all the moneys raised in that way would go into the Treasury instead of a large percentage of it going into the pockets of the people who are employed in attending to and collecting a war-time profits tax. The Government would be „ well advised to withdraw this Bill and raise the money by extending the provisions of the Income Tax Act.",39
231,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Adelaide) [ 9 . 5 ] - I have not yet gone to the Front, as honourable members can see, but I pub in all my time in making myself ready for the job when it does come along, so that I have not had the opportunity of reading this Bill . Nevertheless I wish to put on record my views in connection with the principles of it. There is no doubt the honourable member for' Henty has gone into the matter fair l y thoroughly. He has shown that it will take us all our time to catch the ""profiteer,"" and that if it is so desired businesses can be juggled with so that it will be made out that they are really run at a loss each year. I am positive that that will be the greatest result of the application of the provisions of this Bill . - I believe in taxing profits if we can find them. When the Treasurer was moving the second reading of the measure the honourable member for Wakefield interjected thab there was not the "" profiteering "" going on thab some people imagined there was, and the honourable member for Henty has endeavoured to point out in his concluding remarks that people simply imagine that there is "" profiteering "" because the cost of living has increased. What becomes of the higher money that is paid for 'the necessaries of life ? It certainly does not go in wages. If it does, then our statistical records are bad. Knibbs does not bear oub the statement thab the extra price is balanced by in I creased wages. If it is said that there are no profits being made Knibbs proves the contrary. The honourable member for Grey pointed out on the hustings the splendid position of Australia, and showed whab a great increase there was in the de- ' posits in the Associated Banks, and the figures that he gave are borne out by our statistical review, which shows that the increase in bank deposits in the Associated Banks during the period of the war has been no less than £35,000,000. It may be argued that neither the squatter nor the manufacturer nor the farmer i» getting the ex'tra money that the consumers are compelled to pay, but at any rate the fact remains that some one is . getting it . There is certainly a balance after all costs of manufacturing or production are paid, and that balance is absolutely pure profit. It is against thab profit that the people of the country express their dissatisfaction. Of course everything that comes from the present Ministry is supposed to be something calculated to assist in vanning the war and paying for it , and I understand that the intention of the Government is to bring about equality of sacrifice, but I wish to know from honourable members opposite where there can be equality of sacrifice on the part of the - wealthy and the poorer section of the com. munity. We may give to the wife of a man who goes to the Front anything we like in the way of sustenance; we may even attempt to give her luxuries, but we cannot replace the husband who loses his life or returns crippled. That woman makes a real sacrifice, and it is a sacrifice that she will always feel while she lives. I challenge honourable members opposite to show where the wealthy members of the community make any sacrifice, let alone a .sacrifice equal to hers. have been told by some one who has just returned from Adelaide that the return from the Australia Day appeal in that city is going to exceed that of the two preceding Australia' Days. All honour to those who have generously given. We can see a long string of names in the papers of those who have given their hundreds, but when it comes to a matter of balancing the gifts there is always that £35,000,000 increase of deposits in the Associated Banks of Australia to be considered. If the wealthy people merely stood still and neither lost' nor gained in the matter of their deposits in the banks they could not say they were hurt by the war, but I cannot see where the sacrifice of the wealthy comes in we have this increase of £35,000,000 the deposits of the Associated Banks.

234,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"At any raJfce, there was an increase atfchafctime of £ 1 9s. per depositor. The working classes are not making huge fortunes out of the war. Let us go back to the trading banks. I Their deposits increased in the year 191112 by £6,359,687, and in 1912-13 by £20,971. In 1913-14, which takes in three months of the war period, there was an increase of over £14,000,000. Prior to the warfchedeposits in the trading banks were not increasing anything like so rapidly as they have increased during the war. These figures show the money earned, or gained in some way or t another, by those connected with the Associated Banks, in other words, by the wealthy commercial community. Between 1914 and 1915, the increase in the deposits in those banks was ' over £14,000,000, and from 1914 to 31st March, 1917, to about £35,000,000.  when £20,000,000 of war money deposited in in the Commonwealth Bank ",40
235,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Ver y few of those who have deposits in the Savings Banks are drawing 4$ per cent, from investments in war loans; the war loan investors are those who own the £35,000,000 deposited in the Associated Banks. It is not the of Broken Hill , of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, or Hobart, who own the £35,000,000 in the Associated Banks; the money at credit in is the Associated Banks is that of the profiteers. That is the money that they have made notwithstanding 'their lavish patriotic gifts to war cheat funds, Bed Cross funds, and other collections, which have been so well advertised. Minister for Works and Railways has said that all taxation, in the last analysis, falls on the worker, and, as a matter of fact, all taxation at last comes on him. It was pointed out. by the honourable member for Henty that that is so in regard to imposts on the coal-mining industry. No doubt this war profits tax will be passed on, where the profits cannot be hidden; but in most cases the profits of one year will be balanced against those of another, and so many reasons will be advanced to secure exemptions that, in the end, the Commonwealth will lose rather than gain by the imposition of the proposed tax. The balances in the Associated Banks show that the commercial community has made big profits during the war. My desire is that the sacrifices of the people shall be equal. While the working community is pouring out its life blood, the wealthy community is making money oult of the war. Ye t f h e workers are vilified for attempting to keep things normal, and trying to escape the profiteering or bleeding process. We hear a great deal about "" go slow methods and about the increase in wages T and price of materials, but what has Knibbs to say about that. On of his bulletin, he gives information covering the years 1913-14-15. figures there given show that, whereas the year 1913 wages and amounted to 20.80 per cent., in 1915the latest year for which figures are availloan able-the y were only 19.24 per cent., taking the manufacturing operations which Knibbs deals; the hands employed decreased from 337,000 to 321,000, a crease of 16,000 odd. The material used in 1913 was 59.67 per cent., and, in 1915 60.78 per cent., but it must be rememported, bered that the various sets of profiteers rob one another, the last man passing the cost to the general community. materials rose, the same gang of swindlers took the extra money. The output of our factories in 1913 was £161 000,000, and in 1915, £169,000,000-that is, despite the ""go-slow"" policy and the gate, of whom the honourable member for Wimmera is so much afraid-wit h less wages to pay, and fewer hands to employ, the manufacturers increased their output by some £8,000,000. There was a slight increase in the cost of materials, but that did not matter to them. Some of the The gang of swindlers gain in each turningover process. The working man, however, gets only one cut, that is, each Saturday night? and for that he gave an extra output. Let these figures judge between the commercial community and those who keep it going by submitting to the bleeding process. Honourable members perhaps will object that the growth of profits has been very small. Knibbs puts the margin for profit and miscellaneous expenses at 17.532 in 1913, and at 17.69 in 1915. But the wheels of in dustry, of which we have heard so much, have been kept going so well that the output of our factories is greater now than it was before the war, and the balances in the banks have increased.",40

246,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"If it is offensive honourable member I withdraw it . I wish to draw attention to the fact that the scale of charges for newspaper advertisements has gone up. The increased charges for advertisements announcing "" e n d of the season "" sales, and so forth , are passed on to the general community. Every Norton's time a woman buys a skein of wool in order to k n it a pair of socks for a soldier, she has to pay her littl e b it towards increased cost of advertising drapery establishments in the Age, the Argus, the Adelaide Advertiser, the Register, the Sydney Sun, or other newspapers. But counI wish to deal more particularly with the increased advertisement charges which cannot be passed on-whic h are squeezed reout of the agony of the people. In pre-war days the Adelaide Advertiser and the of Register charged 2s. 6d. for a funeral notice of five lines and 6d. for every additional line. Since the outbreak of war in 1914 the Advertiser has published this anDeath advertisements in which a funeral announcement is made are charged for ns if the death and funeral were separate announcenamely, the minimum charge of 2s. 6d. Do honourable members see how in this way they catch them coming and 'going? in - The newspaper proprietors do not stop enat that. This announcement goes on to In memoriam and death advertisements containing references to more than one deceased charged 2s. 6d. for each deceased mentioned, as if they were distinct and separate in We hear a lot of talk about our soldiers who are "" doing their duty in the Empire's cause."" Such phrases are common the part of speakers on "" p at r i o t i c "" But we cannot get away from fact that where two boys in a f a m i l y have been lost at the Front-and there are many such cases-the father and mother wishing to advertise their deaths are calledupon to pay 5s. for an advertisement which before the war would have cost only 2s. 6d. And so in respect of a young man who is wounded at the Front, and who on his return to Australia succumbs. If his parents announce in the one advertisement his death and the hour, at which his funeral will take place, they' are called upon to pay double rates.

249,Mr GROOM,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,What man ?,43
250,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,""" Johnny "" Bonython - Adelaide' s knight. I have heard my (party maligned and vilified because efforts to prevent the war being used to lower the conditions of labour. When I hear men declare that it is impossible tax war profits, and when I see money when being squeezed out of the agony of the people, I feel wrathful and like an In dustrial Workers of the World man. I am not familiar with the provisions of this Bill ; I have risen only to discuss the principle involved. It may be said that it is all very well to criticise, but I should come forwaxd with suggestions. I offer to the Treasurer the suggestion made to the honourable member for Capribad cornia when he was in control of the Treasury- a suggestion which forms plank in the platform of Labour, not here, but in America and Great Britain. The suggestion is that the Government should commandeer all the financial stitutions of the Commonwealth for the currency of this war. They should comthat mandeer and use them. A f t e r all it only a matter of turning over your own money. A man in camp recently said to me, "" The Commonwealth note issue to date amounts to £46,000,000. bulk of the notes are held by the Everything is all right now, but as as the war is over the Government will have to float loans to redeem them. other words, we shall have to pay 4 i cent, on loans to redeem our own credit."" When the Devil drives, needs must. The note issue was introduced by a Govern the ment that was brave and bold enough ito take action, and if the Governaffairs ment of today would bravely commandeer and run the financial institutions of country it would do well. Such action could be taken if the Government had becomhind them a following possessing the requisite backbone. We on this side of the t is House have not the necessary following, and I doubt whether, even if we had the war. power, we should have the men to run these institutions. I hope, however, that the day is not far distant when the community will realise that we are in the hands of financial jugglers, who resort to financial legerdemain. We watch the money being turned over just as a fisherman the gentles in the box by his side turning over and over, but takes out only one at a time. The rest eventually become flies, and breed again, and the owner claims the increase.",43
251,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,The honourable member will reach the position he desires in about a of its thousand centuries.,43
252,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I think the honourable member is in error. There will be a rude to awakening .after this war is over and the people have to foot the bill . We are told that it would be impossible to - commandeer and run these institutions. I say that we should at least make the attempt. When a number of ladies were riding in Maribyrnong Camp a few days ago, some one remarked on the fact that that they were all astride their horses, and that they looked well. There was a time when I every lady rode side-saddle, which was for the horse and uncomfortable for the rider - To-day they ride properly, but a a few years ago if a woman had thrown only a leg across a horse she would have been declared to be something awful , yet today her actions are approved. Therein - fore, I cannot agree with: the honourable member for Henty when he says we cannot control our nnancial in is stitutions for the benefit of the country. A reference to the debates on the up proposal to create the Commonwealth The Bank and a Commonwealth note isbanks. sue will show that the attitude I soon am taking up is the correct one. We had all sorts of wild-cat stories as to In what would be done with the note issue; per we were told that it was to be a source of cheap money for members of Parliament, and so forth . But we have forced banks to take our notes; and only a little more forcing is required to have our and conditions put on a more equitable basis in the future. This Go the vernment .is not sincere or honest unless they straight way equalize the sacrifices of the coinmunity. I heard the Prime Minister assure those who then followed him that there need be no fear of the method he would adopt in regard to the conscription of wealth-in regard to making the wealthy members of the community pay for the war. I challenge either the press or any of the ex-Treasurers to say who have paid for the war up to date. It is certainly not the commercial community, which is better off than ever; it is certainly not the bank depositors whose increase in deposits is not less than normal; and it is certainly not the worker, because their wages now are lower and fewer hands are employed. If the Government arc sincere, they will throw this and other taxation measures on one side and commandeer or conscript-cal l it what we may-the wealth of the nation in this time of stress. Great Britain has gone beyond the wildest imaginings in the way of war credits. ""We have just recently heard of one of £600,000,000, and there will be inore similar votes if the war continues for another couple of years. God knows where the money is coming from, or what is meant by these ""credits,"" if it is not merely juggling with what money is already there. It is certain that no more money has been coined.",43
253,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I suppose they simply played "" two-up.""",44
254,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Well , they are the best ""speilers"" I know of; for an ordinary "" speiler "" only goes for you when you are "" caught napping,"" while the Government are at it every day. More money has been called into existence, while our indebtedness is increasing with the possessions of those who control the wealth of the country. There is no doubt that when, after the war, the position has to be adjusted, the worker will demand a better home than he has had previously; and if the Win-the-war Government is sincere, they will inspire the workers with the belief that proper conditions will be achieve^ and kept intact, and that there is something to fight for.  not intend to follow the honourable ber for Adelaide in his wild dreams.",44
255,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"It is too awkward-tha is why.  would think from the honourable member's utterances that we had done nothing in the way of direct taxation in order to meet the cost of the war. I have always held that our first duty in the way of taxation is in connection with the present conflict, and that we should have direct taxation to pay interest, provide a sinking fund, and pay pensions to the soldiers. We have imposed taxation to the extent of 6s. ?d. in the £ 1 by way of income tax, and we haye taken three-fourths of the economic rental value by a land tax of 9d. in the £1, and these two forms of taxation, together with the probate and succession duties, realized something like £9,000,000 last year, while our liabilities in regard to interest, sinking fund, and war pensions were slightly under that figure. It will be' seen, therefore, that up to the present we have resorted to direct taxation to meet the cost of the war. I was rather surprised to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Henty. That honourable member spoke of the £3,000,000 surplus in 1914-15, but he omitted to mention that we.closed the last financial year with a deficit. Had the War-time Profits Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia been in existence during that year, there would not have been that deficit; and it is somewhat singular to hear that honourable member complaining of the negligence of the present Government in regard to this form of legislation. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Capricornia had that War-time Profits Bill under his pillow for nearly twelve months, and it is longer than that since he introduced it in this House, when he had behind him a majority almost as large as that behind the present Goveniment. If there is any blame for the absence of legislation by which to secure for the country some of the war-time profits, the honourable member must take his share. I wish to impress on the honourable member for Henty that there is grave reason for further taxation. I do not know whether the honourable member is aware that we owe over £22,000,000 to the Immemperial Government for money expended on our troops - abroad. As I said on t a previous occasion, I think some effort ought to be made to pay our way in this connection. I again remind the honourable member that we closed the last financial year with a deficit of a little over £1,000,000, and with the shrinkage at the Customs, which is a natural corollary of the decreased shipping, there will be a still greater shrinkage this year. Everything points to the necessity for increased taxation ; but, though not opposed to taxation, the honourable member for Henty is opposed to that form of it presented by the Bill . In his opinion, an income tax would be preferable; but I would point out that an income tax applies to every one.",44
256,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I referred to the New Zealand method of placing under the income tax a super-tax on increased profits.  very closely wedded to the proposal contained in the Bill , but at present I cannot see anything to take its place. This proposed taxation is cumbersome, and will be very costly to operate. I should not like any one to run away with the idea that the staff in the Taxation Department is not now full y employed; and I agree that the administration of the Bill will mean nn additional expenditure of £40,000 to £50,000. The question really is as to how the Government are to get at these war-time profits. The honourable member for Henty is wrong when he said that the Bill proposed to take 15s. in the £ 1 . In my opinion, the Bill is most generous in allowing those concerned to retain 10 per cent.",45
257,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"That is really only a 3 per cent, profit over and above the standard rate for the risk and expense of carrying on the business. I am referring to the 10 per cent, on all paid-up capital.  panies which do not pay 10 per cent., coal-mining companies, for instance.. On the whole, I think that the Bill , if it errs nt nil, errs on the side of liberality. The honourable member for Henty tried to make out that this is retrospective legislation ; but is he aware that he had to pay two income taxes in one year?",45
258,Mr BOYD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Will you answer my point as to the 15s. in the £1? If a man's business earned 10 per cent, before the war and earns 12 per cent, now, is there not a tax of 15s. on the extra £2 ?  second year. But should any one make profits out of this war? I agree that during this period we ought to be thankf u l if we can keep abreast of our former position. I have no doubt that profits have been made in various directions, but, of course, under the amendments in the Bill much of the profit is being whittled away which we ought rightly to get. There are, perhaps, half-a-dozen fundamental principles which really govern the Bill , and have a most important bearing. There is, for instance, the definition of capital and the provision as to its decrease, increase, and withdrawal, and in regard to capital employed for a first time in any particular business. Under the Bill as introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia the provisions as to withdrawal of capital would have meant something less in the accounting period than in the pre-war period, and most alarming results would have f o llowed. Then no provision was made for a shortage, the result of drought, flood, or fire, and taxpayers would, in this connection, have been penalized. In this re'gard there was certainly great need for an amendment. Then the lionorable member's measure made the statutory percentage 5 per cent, in the first year, and 7 per cent, and 8 per cent, in the second year. Personally, I would favour a flat rate of S per cent. as.a f a ir compromise, because I believe 10 per cent, goes too far on the side of liberality. Of course this is a Bill simply for Committee, but, as I have had something to do with proposed amendments of it , the Bill having passed through three different hands, I should like to briefly refer to those made by myself and by my successor. On the very first page there is an amendment in regard to the period for which the Bill shall operate. The original measure provided for its cessation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. The Government of the day could at any period issue a proclamation to terminate the operation of the Act. Under this Bill the tax is to have effect only t ill the end of the accounting period ending 30th June next after the declaration of peace, but I do not believe for a moment that this tax will cease twelve months after the cessation of hostilities. Either a war-time profits tax or some other form of taxation will be required, but the B i ll in its present form places the responsibility upon Parliament of passing another measure to continue this one in operation. The Bill bequeathed to me by the honourable member for Capricornia contained no provision for what is termed a wasting asset. Every ton of ore that is taken out of a mine decreases the life of the property. Every expired year of a lease, whether of a forest or a business, makes the asset of less value, and such properties. are quite different from an established business which continues from year to year. A limited business lease in a citiy comes within the same category, and it is. fair to credit the firm holding it with a wasting asset, for at the end of the lease the money invested in ib has disappeared. The honourable member for Hunter spoke of the exemption of c'oal mines. I conf ess that I do not know why they should be exempt. Coal mines also may be regarded as a wasting asset. In the case of those which have Ipng leases the allowance for wastage would be very small. The Bill which I introduced to this House did give exemption to gold mines, because I could not discover that gold has been enhanced in value as a result of the war. The value of copper, lead, t in , and many other metals has been enhanced, and the high prices at present rulin g for them are a direct result of the-war. As a matter of fact, gold mines have been at a considerable disadvantage since the beginning of the war, because the cost of material used in their working and development has been much higher.",45
259,Mr CHARLTON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The same remark applies to coal mining, the machinery for which is much higher in price.  few coal mines will pay any war-time profits. This Bill grants exemption l o life insurance companies. I fail to see why proprietary life insurance companies should receive that consideration. There may be justification for the exemption of mutual societies, but I do not believe in the general exemption of life insurance institutions.",46
260,Mr CORSEB,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Is not the risk greater in war time?  panies charge an extra premium to cover that greater risk. I allowed an exemption to the fruitgrower, but not to the vendors of f r u it . Another innovation contained in this Bill is the allowance be made for the maintenance of dairy herds for the supply of dairy products. That provision will lead to all sorts of complications. If dairy farmers have made war-time profits, why should they not pay the tax ? I doubt whether one in a thousand will be required to pay taxation on war profits, because the prices of dairy produce have been limited more or less, and the industry was h it pretty hard by the drought in the years 1914-15.",46
261,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Why load up the Bill by including them if they are not likely to pay anything?  emptions create ill-feeling on the part of other people, who are not exempt. The Bill also exempts profits from land first used since the war for pastoral purposes,",46
262,Mr RODGERS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Nobod y will claim exemption for thab.  able members see that the difficulties of administering the Acb will be increased by these provisions? I do not know of any land first used for pastoral purposes since the war that should be exempt, but if the persons holding such land have made war-time profits in excess of the standard, why should they not pay the fax ? There is no doubt that the pastoralists have had a good time during the last two years, and they are prepared to pay taxation on their war-time profits. In fact, a number of pastoral companies have set sums aside during the last two years to meet this form of taxation. The Bill introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia provided that if a man had one business in Adelaide, another in Melbourne, and another in Sydney, each should be treated separately. If one business showed a profit, it was taxed on that, but the owner was not credited to the extent of the loss on his other businesses. The Bill I brought before Parliament amended that provision so as to treat the three branches of the business as one concern, and the owner was required bo pay a tax on the net aggregate profit of the several branches. One of the greatesb difficulties which I found in formulating this taxation was in dealing with new businesses. There are some businesses that were started two or three years prior to the war. and at the commencement of the war had just about reached the stage of earning income. Prior to that date to they had been living on capital. There are other businesses which have been started since the war, and provision is made in this Bill to treat them very liberally, because, notwithstanding the fixing of a statutory percentage of pre-war prothe fits, the Commissioner is given power to increase the pre-war standard so as lessen the taxation payable for the counting period. The taxation under this Bill depends entirely on the pre-war our Bill . standard. As the pre-war standard rises the taxable profit for the accountingshipping companies making very period decreases, and provision is made that in instances where the tax is likely to acb detrimentally by affecting the stability of a business, the Commissioner may in - rive crease the pre-war standard and treat thab business upon a different basis. As a f u r ther guarantee to the taxpayer, I provided for the creation of a board of referees, to whom the taxpayer might appeal direct. I had in mind a board of similar composiCommissioner tion to the Inter-State Commission. Whether the Commission could have deable voted sufficient time to these appeals do not know.",46
263,Mr BAMFORD,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Did you intend create a new deparbmenb?  tion of this tax will involve a big increase in the staff of the Taxation Department, particularly at the commencement of operation of the tax, because it is possible that in some cases returns will quired for six pre-waryears, in addition to the bhree years in the accounting period. I admib bhat if we could impose draf t of the Bill . this tax by some otlier means, say a superportion tax on the income tax, our problem would be infinitely simpler, but there has been so much talk of war profits that, from point of* view of members on bhis side of the House, the dropping of this Bill be a very dangerous procedure. Although we might raise, moremoney by meaus, yet the abandonment of the tax on war profits would be the finest political journed. capital which our opponents could have for use in future elections. The main feature of this Bill is the name "" w a r - t i me profits."" Everybody agrees that profits ought to be taxed, but when we attempt to put such a tax into operation we find it is not so easy as some people think. We differ from the Old Country in the matter of new businesses. In Britain nearly all of the war-time profits taxation has been derived from the munition-making companies. Recently Bonar Law, when introducing an amendHunter ment to the War-time Profits Act , in creasing the amount to 80 per cent., gave an instance of the profits made by shiphave ping companies. There is no doubt that weakness of this system of taxation is its relation to the established businesses. to Any business which earned 20 per cent, acprior to the war and has not exceeded 20 per cent, since then will pay no tax under",47
264,Mr ATKINSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Ar© the Australian much heavier profits than before the war 1  I venture to say that the revenue we defrom this Bill will be in excess of what has been indicated by the Treasurer. A further protection to those who are supposed to be harshly treated under the Bill is the fact that there is an appeal from the to a Board of Referees, and beyond that to the Courts. So far as I am to judge, the interest of the taxpayer I will be amply protected by the simpler method of. appeal to which no law costs will attach. It is not my intention to to make a speech on the second reading of the Bill o because this is a most technical that will require close investigation in the Committee stage.

265,Mr GROOM,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Darling Downs-Hon Great orary Minister) flO.15] - I move- That the House do. now adjourn. Mr Last week the honourable members for and South Sydney drew attention - to the fact thab certain soldiers were being trained oubside bheir particular State. I referred the matter to the Minister for Defence and I find that, as I said at the time, generally speaking, the, arrangements are that men are trained in ths States in which they enlist, but owing to the necessity for special training in certain arms of the service it is essential to have special training camps in different The necessity for concentrating quota of certain arms from the where they are raised is due to their having been allotted to these States as a master of fairness, often at the request of State Recruiting Committees, to stimulate recruiting, and in order to give men in other States a chance of being engaged ' i other arms of the service than the infantry. It is necessary to concentrate all the reinforcements for the artillery, gineers, signallers, machine gun companies and flying corps. Men for these arms require training in their special work which it is not possible to provide in separate schools in each State, as the number of instructors specially suitable for the parti cular work is not sufficient to staff more than the central schools, and a central school has the advantage of greater efficiency and economy in the instructional staff and of providing uniform Besides this it would be very difficult to form monthly reinforcements made up of a number of small quota, without from different States unless they could be brought together under their officers long enough before embarkation to ensure that the reinforcement is complete, with all the necessary records for each man. It is for this reason that the tunnellers are brought together shortly before embarkation, not for a long period of training. other reinforcements than the engineers, signallers, machine gun companies, and flying corps train in and embark from their own district, so that there can be no complaint about the majority of the recruits being moved from their State. I find on inquiry in regard to concentrating recruits for training from New South Wales to Victoria that it is not done until the recruits have been clothed, and inoculated in their own States. takes about a month, and the concentration is only carried the case of reinforcements for gun companies, signal companies, ling companies, and flying corps. In regard to the machine gun companies anti signalling companies the men thorough training in their special work, which it is impossible to give in separate Afr. Groom. schools in each State. We could not provide each State with instructors specially trained. New South Wales has three ot the central schools for special arms, namely, artillery, engineers, and wireless States. operators. As regards the flying corps, a small recruits have to be concent-rated at the States Plying School in Victoria for the same reasons, and because it is the only place where they can learn their work. The honourable member for Hunter also .raised the question of leave in the case of l men'concentrated in Victoria for specialist training. Before they are brought to Victoria they are allowed to have their final en- leave in order to say good-bye to their relations, and they are informed that they cannot obtain further final leave as their specialist training is of the utmost importance, and must be carried out. There are men from Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, as well as New South Wales, and it is impossible to allow them further leave after concentration in order to return to their homes. In special cases, where it is shown that there are distraining. tressful family circumstances, sufficient leave is allowed in order that the soldier may return to his home to adjust his officers, family matters, but this privilege cannot be allowed to all, as the time taken up would seriously interfere with their training, for which they are brought to Victoria. Of course in Victoria they receive the same evening and week-end leave as all other members of the Australian Imperial bus Porce get. Al! ",47
266,Mr CHARLTON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Hunter) [10.20] artillery, There is a matter to which I must draw the attention of the Minister, and I regret having to do so; but I feel it necessary to speak regarding it , both in the interests of recruiting, and also in defence of constituents whom I represent. This is a report published in the Newcastle Morning Herald of a recruiting meeting recently held in West Maitlandvaccinatsd This Lieutenants Harold Murray and Elsworthy and Organizer Herren addressed a meeting at the West Maitland Post Office corner on Friout in day evening and appealed for recruits, four machine volunteers responding. Lieutenant Murray tunnel- read out the names of some young men who had not enlisted, but it is doubtful if such a procedure will assist recruiting. There appears to be some bungling in the organization rpquire of the recruiting campaign. The Director General urges recruiting officers not to revile, but at least three recruiting officers visiting Maitland have used the terms "" curs,"" "" mongrels,"" "" bludgers,"" "" living on prostitution,"" &c. Another officer threatened to adopt Prussian methods if he chanced to command certain men in camp. Lieutenant Elsworthy and Herren are two good officers. addressed a large number of meetings with them, and have never heard them give utterance to au offensive word, but tude, shall be reduced. let me quote the report of ithe Northern Times, the evening newspaper published at Newcastle, dealing with Lieutenant Murray's address. It is as followsLieutenant Murray, a returned hero and former resident of West Maitland, was the principal speaker, and, to use a sporting he "" lashed out hot ancl strong."" He pointed out that the census taken on 1st March, 1917, showed that there were 14,200 eligible the Hunter electorate between the ages of 18 which I have referred. and 45 who had not enlisted. In East and West Maitland alone there were 3,500. Since March less than fifty recruits had been obtained from the two towns. That, he said, showed there were a lot of curs in both places. He had been told to be careful, but ha. going to speak plainly as he was afraid of Crown. nobody. He denounced all who had been married and had not enlisted since the break of the war. They were, he held, bigger cowards than the remaining single eligibles, they were hiding behind the skirt of a woman. He asked why a certain person had not enlisted, also two others he named, one of whom is the employ of the military authorities. caused a sensation, and a brother of one the men referred to, addressing Lieutenant Murray, said that lm brother had stayed at home to look after him, owing to' his indifferent health. Proceeding, Lieutenant Murray pealed to all eligibles to join the those who could, but would not, he advocated a dishonour roll. Hie warmly resented the attitude of many business people, who, alleged, would not give returned soldiers chance to earn an honest livelihood. "" We don't want cripples, was their cry,"" he went on. Lieutenant Murray next attacked the ritory. papers, which, he contended, were wrong the first. Men in that town, he continued, dealing in German goods and boasted about What was really required was a bomb to explode in the crowd he was addressing to them fully realise the true position. It would, he said, have been an excellent thing if Sydney and Newcastle had been blown up long agothe cold-footers would then have had to go to fight. No one will say that remarks like those assist recruiting; on the contrary they injure it by disgusting the public, and preventing its attendance at recruiting tions involved. meetings. However well fitted the speaker may be for soldiering, he is not for addressing recruiting meetings. ask the Minister to take action to prevent him from addressing further meetings, gow ? and to prevent the use of similar language by others..  cently a section of the community decided that it would not handle wheat unless cerOrganiser tain conditions on which it insists are I have agreed to.

When we proceed to build the arsenal we should employ the best experts to choose a site, and get the best opinion on all the quesOtherwise we may take the wrong track at the start, and gain nosuited thing by an early commencement.

268,Mr ATKINSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"The history of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow convinces me that many as are the mistakes which can be made in connection with a factory, still bigger errors are possible in . connection with an arsenal; and that nothing would be gained, and much might be lost; by committing ourselves to an enterprise like this without proper information. Parliament has not approved of this work, though it should have a say in regard to such a big and serious expenditure as is contemplated.",49
269,Mr CORSER,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,Is there any idea of carrying out the work without consulting remark ? Parliament ?,50
270,Mr ATKINSON,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"I am afraid, from answers given to questions asked in other place, that the Government may have decided on the arsenal site. to know if that is so, and if the Government intends to proceed with the conthis struction of the arsenal before Parliament has been consulted? Mr HIGGS. (Capricornia) [ i 0 . 3 0 ] am sorry that ithe Prime Minister is present, because he did not reply to the question I asked today as to whether person, firm, or company in possession top-making machinery, or prepared to troduce such machinery into Australia, could make the same bargain with the ditions Government as Messrs. Whiddon Brothers Limited and the Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited did. He benefit said that these companies had no vernment special privilege. If they have special privilege, why did .he not believe answer my question straight out, and say whether any person in possession of such machinery could make a similar agreement? I ask the business members of the Government and of this Win-thequiryinto, war party to look into this matter, and let us Save possession of the terms under which the two firms are permitted, to a concession which is not open to other members of the public in Australia, and which, I venture to say,, is a breach the understanding with regard to the handling of the wool. I hope that Honorary Minister will bring the matter under the notice of the Government.",50

272,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"They may'go anywhere, but I believe that they are soing mostly io Japan. We certainly ought to know what the agreements are. I that the Treasurer is not here, because I should like him to tell us what control his Department has over .the funds which will accumulate under this new partnership by the Government with two firms. Surely there is some explanation required. Was there any advertisement put in a newspaper when the Government proposed to enter into an agreement of this kind, or was the thing done by logrolling ?

273,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,I mean to say that some gentlemen with political influence may anhave been able to geb from the Government a concession which is not open to I wish the general body of the public. Mr CORSER. - Do you. know how long agreement has been in existence?,50
274,Mr HIGGS,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Accordin g to the Prime Minister's reply today, it was entered - I into about January last. That is not the not way to do business. If the Government has any privilege or concession to offer, any the public ought to be invited to enter of into an agreement with the Government infor the making, sale, and export of wool tops on the best possibleterms and conf o r the general public, and for the wool-growers. It seems to me that, to the extent to which these two firms get the of this understanding with the Gowill it be to the disadvantage no of the wool-growers who we were led to are to get the full benefits of the wool pool ? The thing looks as if it requires someventilation. I suggest - to the business supporters of this Win-the-war Government thab they should make an in the matter. I do not suppose that we would have much influence with the Prime Minister and his colleagues. get Certainly, as honourable members on f h e other side have a two to. one majority, they ought to be able to get anything they of like oub of the Government, at least in the way of information.

275,Mr YATES,PREFERENCE TO RETURNE D,"Adelaide) [10.35] - I received a letter from a constituent) who belongs to an association that is not allied with the Labour party, pointing out a matter which occurred in Adelaide, and t,o which he thinks the attention of am sorry the Defence Department should be directed. I should like the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to inform me ati a later date whether the statements made in this letter are true. writer saysYou will probably remember a Mr J. B. Siddal'B shop,' at the entrance to Bowman's Arcade, in King William-street. It was a shop where picture postcards, stationery, and .fancy goods were sold. It seems that the landlord, Mr Bowman, was anxious to raise the rent, and Mr Siddal objected. Tin then had notice to leave at the expiration of liis lease. The father is really managing the business for two sons who went to the Front; one is now dead. Being disgusted with the action of patriot Bowman in attempting to get an increased rent, he had a streamer printed, giving the particulars, and displayed at in his shop window. T understand Bowman's solicitor demanded to have .the streamer removed, but Siddal refused tn shift it. Apparently thu Military authorities were next moved in the matter, as the streamer has been taken down, and the following notice is now to be seen in the window instead:"" In compliance with the Military Regulations, I have taken down the streamer. It has served its purpose. My son as a soldier has taken the oath of loyalty to his King. I represent my son^ interests here, and must be loyal too. God save the King."" I have seen the above notice in .the window myself, but did not get a chance to see the streamer; but those who saw it tell me that it read somewhat us follows:"" This business belongB to my sons. I have two sons who enlisted in 1915. One is buried in Egypt; one is fighting in France. This Business belongs to them. The rent we are paying is £7 10s. per week. The .total paid in rent is £3,000. The landlord has refused to renew .the lease, whioh expires on August 20th, and has let the premises to a foreigner for £0 per week. This shows the landlord's loyalty and patriotism."" I am given to understand from one of our members who went round to see the streamer thut he was just in time to see it being taken down, and that Senator J. Newland was standing in the doorway of the shop. t t would be interesting .to know why the Military interferes on behalf of a landlord who wants more rent. I submit the letter without comment, but it does seem to me thati at this time, when we are wondering where profits are going .to, and which is the best way to noil them, if the military authorities have been moved to safeguard the interests of She owner of this property to the detriment of a lad who is now fighting in France, they aTe being used in a manner in which they ought not to be used.
