In order to remove any doubt on the subject, I propose now to read the proclamation, omitting only the technical details. The proclamation, which was issued on the 7th November, 1919, reads:Whereas by certain proclamations under the Sugar Acquisition Act of 1915, published in the Gazette, and dated the fifth and seventh days respectively of November, 1919, it was, among other things, declared and directed that, with certain exceptions, all meat now or at any time thereafter during the years One thousand nine hundred and nineteen and One thousand nine hundred and twenty, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and One thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, in Queensland, at or in any meat works, or freezing or chilling works, or stores, or other place used in connection with any such meat works, was and had become and should remain andbe held for the purposes of, and should be kept for the disposal of, His Majesty's Government of the State of 'Queensland by all persons in whose possession the same was or thereafter should be for the time being, and that all the title and property of the existing owners thereof, or of the owners thereof for the time being, as the case might be, were and should be divested from such owners, and were and should be vested in His Majesty's said Government absolutely freed from any mortgage, charge, lien, or other encumbrance thereon whatsoever, and that all the title and property of such owners were and should be changed into a right to receive payment of the value thereof in the manner and to the extent to be thereafter determined and declared by a further proclamation or proclamations: Now therefore I , Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, the Governor aforesaid, by and with the advice of the Executive by this my proclamation, hereby determine and declare that the prices of sound wholesome meat so acquired payable to such owners shall be as follows:(1) Beef- "")Ox and cow Chilled, 3d. per lb. >- beef approved Frozen, 34d. per lb. j and passed.

Then followed the dissolution, when the hooks were opened and the "" quick and the dead "" were judged. Consequently, i the only Estimates passed by the last liament were 'those relating"" tb public works to be undertaken out of revenue loan moneys, amounting to £397,144 and this £1,460,221 respectively. W it h the termination of the last ParliaOffice, ment, the Estimates lapsed, but they were revived on the 26th Pebruary, i this Parliament, by the message of the Governor General. The total of the Estimates, as re-subdrought mitted', is exactly the same as that of Estimates originally introduced, and are no new items. There is, however, alteration* to which I desire to direct attention of the Committee. . The Treayond surer's Advance is increased £1,500,000 to £2,000,000. The Comtion, mittee will understand, however, that this ing such cases. does not alter the total, as the Treasurer's Advance, being merely money temposatisfaction. rarily lent to the Treasury, is always deducted. The main reason for this is the increase of war pensions. The Estibut mates provide £5,450,000 for war penwhich sions for soldiers and' sailors; but it now seen that the pensions will total £6,200,000, which is an increase of tial £750,000 above what the Treasury exwith pected it would be for the financial year that closes on the 30th June next. This is due chiefly to the rapidity of the mobilization work, bringing in a greater number of claims in a given time to the the October Budget. counter of the Treasury, and also to' the rapidity of the discharge system accomDepartment plished in the later days of demobilizapast tion by the Defence Department. Although this involves an increase £750,000 for this financial year, it is esticise mated at the Treasury that the extra sum of £500,000 granted by the Committee Supply will be sufficient to enable us to finance the increase with the savings in other - directions. 1 would like, with your permission, and the patience of the Committee, give some idea of the revenue and prospects, of the expenditure tions of today, aud also of the loan tion so far as honourable members wish hear it at this stage. First of all, as the direct taxation yield. Most of the venue, as old - honourable members, parfound - laciu-latrry, know , from direct Air. Watt. such as land and income tax, war-time profits taxes, and estate duties, comes in towards the last period of the year, most of it during the last quarter. Therefore, t is not possible at this stage to give any Paruseful comparison of the actual receipts with the estimate, nor to give interesting or matter comparing other years with year! It is expected, however, by indications in the Taxation that the revenue from direct taxation will be as much as was expected and. n stated in the Budget, notwithstanding the considerable relief which must be given to persons who have suffered from during the period covered. I rethe mind' honourable members that both in the there Income Tax Act and the Land Tax Act one there is provision by which those who the have suffered from causes of this kind betheir control may state their case from for a reduction or postponement of taxaand machinery is provided for hear",25
53,Mr GREGORY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,It gives very littl e,26
54,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It may be that the decisions have not been sufficiently liberal, machinery is provided in the Act by that can be accomplished, and alis ready the Department is anticipating that between now and the 30th: June substanremissions will be made in accordance the principles decided by the Legislature in this direction. Notwithstanding this, however, the taxation advisers of dethe Government report that they expect the net yield to be up to the estimate in . As to indirect taxation, the Customs is ' in this position : In the eight months, from the 1st July, 1919, to 1st March, 1920-that is, twoof thirds of the year-the Customs and Exrevenue combined has been £1,400,000 more than the estimate. It is of expected that the amount yielded from these two sources for the full financial made year to the 30th June will exceed the estimate by £2,000,000. That is the sir, expectation and' outlook today. to As to the Post Office, the revenue in position the eight months referred to was £208,000 condimore than two-thirds of the estimate for posithe year; that is to say, it was over to £200,000 more than the expected amount to for this year. It is anticipated that by re30fch June the actual receipts will be to have exceeded the estimate by 1 taxation, approximately £300,000. 'The Government are administering the Departments with due regard to all - possible savings in expenditure. The. Royal Commission on economies is still at work, and a further progress report fro m it is expected soon. In order to give practical effect to the recommendations of the Royal 'Commission, and to carry out further economies, the Government will as early as possible introduce a Bill for the appointment of a Board of Management of 'the Public 'Service. The economies which it is anticipated will follow the appointment of the (Board are all the more necessary in view .of the fact that rising prices are affecting Government expenditure just .as they increase the-outgoings of individuals and all spending bodies. Generally, the House and the country may feel assured that the whole question of raising and spending the moneys of the people is receiving the strict - and unremitting attention of the Government, I would like at this stage to deal with one phase of Post Office finance. The estimated expenditure of the Postal Department for 1919-20, including new works, is £23.,456 above 'the estimated revenue, as honourable members will see by consulting the figures of the Budget. That expresses the Treasury view, which, of course, takes into account only cash inwards and outwards, as .a 'banker does. The Postal Department, 'however, issues, after the close of each financial year, a commercial balance-sheet, which does not charge. oaqpitaf expenditure against the revenue of that year, but debits, the Department with - only the' interest on the capital expenditure. In these commercial balance-sheets, which., I think, .are wisely drawn by the Postal Accountancy department, are certain interesting figures which will afford food for reflection by honourable members. About two years ago., in order to test the basis which the Post Office balance-sheet was drawn and presented to Parliament and the people, I asked the Auditor-General year. to carefully consider the whole of the principles embodied in that balance-sheet, and to certify, if he conscientiously could, this year was £12,360,000. whether it was framed on sound prinnow ciples and afforded all the information case also will be - above the estimate. that Parliament might desire to know. Speaking from recollection, the certificate of the Auditor-General stated plainly that the balance-sheet was correct, its principles thoroughly tenalbl'e from the stand-point of 'accountancy. ""Taking two of those 'commercial balance-sheets, T find that for the year 1917-IS the Postail Department's profit is shown to have been £387,000, and for the year 1918-19 £524,000, according to the most expert principles of balance-sheet build-ing. Jn arriving at these results, revenue from war postage is not included. For the information particularly of those honourable members who were not in the House during last Parliament, when the War Postage Act was passed, I remind the Committee that we deliberately in stituted as part of our war finance at taxing system through the Postal Department. We lifted the postage rate here and abroad by a definite sum. That was regarded as a .tax to be paid by .the user-s of .the 'Post Office, and the proper yield of that tax goes dissect to the Treasury., and is therefore 'not included in the receipts for the Postal Department. Therefore, those figures aire - excluded from - the results for the two financial years mentioned. To earai a profit in a large Department of this kind during the war period was, in my opinion, quite justifiable; but the'Government aTe of opinion that the Post Office, in its ordinary working, apart from war postage, should not continue to be used as a taxing machine. The 'Government, therefore, bave given consideration to the condition of telephone and mail services in countiy districts and are engaged in the development of a scheme which will provide additional facilities of this nature for rural residents. We hope to thus increase the contentment and prosperity of our primary producers. The Budget estimate of expenditure 'out of revenue - this year - on .accWunt of repatriation was £2,644,885 . It is doubtful if we shall be ajble to keep the expendiupon ture within that limit. Signs of excess appear that will have to be faced by the Treasury before the end of the financial For houses, land settJeonent, 'and other repatriation disbursements payable from loan the estimate of expenditure for It - appears that the actual expenditure in this I remember that when some of the original repatriation estimates were presented, and' when Supply - in the earlier portion of and this financial year was being requested from the late Parliament, some honourable gentlemen, on both sides, I believe, said' that we had no intention o i spending so large an amount as was placed in the shop window; others doubted whether such expenditure would be necessary; and a third lot doubted whether we would be able to expend that amount. It is perfectly plain that the outgoings from both loan and revenue tills will exceed the amount which' was estimated in the earlier part of the financial year as necessary for repatriation purposes. If this were ordinary .Departmental expenditure, I should feel disposed, and I think the Committee would probably be desirous of insisting, that full particulars of the excess be given; but I take leave to make no apology for this expenditure. So far as I , as Treasurer, am able to judge, it is being wisely administered'. The complaint, if any, is that the expenditure is not sufficiently generous, but the fact that we are likely to exceed the expenditure from both sources that we previously thought necessary is clear proof that the repatriation machinery is working swiftly and is dealing with a large number of cases. one who believes that our repatriation system is at least as generous as any devised amongst the belligerent nations, I regard this expenditure as a matter for congratulation. Whatever moneys Parliament has raised through taxation or can raise from the pockets of the people by loan should be, if wisely expended, cheerfully expended to repatriate and restore to civil life the men who fought on land' and sea; and I say quite plainly that the expenditure from both revenue and loan sources will have to be exceeded at the end of the financial year.",26
55,Mr RODGEKS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Does that excess cover in both homes on broad acres and war service homes?,28
56,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Both , because these are both provided for out of the loan moneys authorized by Parliament to be expended by the Government. I come now to another feature of i terest, dealing with the debt of Australia to the Imperial Government at the present time; and my immediate purpose is to make a little more clear-if it should be thought necessary-som e of the figures supplied by the Prime Minister to this House last week. The Budget of October last disclosed that the Commonwealth quired £40,000,000 to be raised by loan during the present financial year to war and repatriation expenditure. Just about the time the Budget opened a loan of £25,000,000 was issued. The balance of £15,000,000 has not yet been raised. I remind honourable members that we raised that £25,000,000 with considerable difficulty, in respect, particularly, to the last £5,000,000. Even after an extension of dates, after as vigorous a campaign as the Government could devise or its organization carry out, and after definite statements by the head of the Government and the Finance Minister, that unless the amount was raised compulsion by Statute would follow, we were still about £3,000,000 short after the, extension of time had' closed; whereupon the associated trading banks of Australia, including the Commonwealth Bank, undertook to take their share, and thus we were able to find the £25,000,000. The £15,000,000 has not yet been raised. Since this amount of £15,000,000 is required, in part, for payments to the I m perial Government, it is desirable to set As out the position of the war indebtedness of Australia to. Great Britain . During the early stages of the war we borrowed in actual cash from the United Kingdom £47,500,000 sterliug, and we used it in our general war expenditure. The B r i tish authorities stipulated that the prin cipal of the indebtedness should be in creased in accordance with any additions caused to the war debt of the United K in g dom by conversion operations. That totaT of £47,500,000 has, as a matter of fact, become already £49,000,-000 by the successive conversion operations conducted by the British authorities accordance with the requirements of the time, and the original arrangements with the Australian Government. Now, this £49,000,000 is really a bonded debt, repayable to the British Government at various dates, ranging from 1925 to 1947. Quite apart from this n - bonded debt to the British Government,, we owed, on the 30th June last,. £37,000,000 for moneys paid by the W a r Offiee directly for the maintenance and equipment of our Australian Forces. That £37,000,00.0 is a book debt, or what might, be popularly described as an overdraft, obtained by the Australian Treasury, by repermission of the War Office, from theBritish Exchequer; and, although no defimeetnite arrangements have been made for repayment, the British Government has indicated that it desires early'settlement. A further sum of £2,250,000 is due to the Admiralty in respect of transports, and repairs to and maintenance of Australian warships. We also owe the British Government £2,500,000 which has been advanced for urgent payments since the Armistice, when exchange upon London was unobtainable. In part settlement of all the tions, we have been urged, and, indeed, have undertaken, to repay £8,750,000 to Fund. the British Government as soon as sible. This total is made up thus: The we sum p f £2,250,000, which is due to the Ading miralty in regard to transports and for maintenance and repair in the matter of our warships before their return to home stations; the item of £2,500,000, advanced urgently when exchange was unprocurber able; and the amount of £4,000,000, which we had formerly agreed to repay, which provision is made on the Estimates of this year, as explained to the Commitmean, tee of Supply when the Budget was introduced. This total of £4,000,000 is part of the £37,000,000 to which I have aldelibly ready referred. To speak quite frankly-becaus e I believe in being as frank as possible in all circumstances in connection with money affairs, and in which I always believe there are no politics, if the subject is properly understood-w e are not able redeem these promises at the moment. Honourable members will appreciate the position. difficulty of the situation with the I m perial Government. The question of cing the whole of the indebtedness British authorities, other than the bonded debt of £49,000,000, is receiving the earnest consideration of the Cabinet; and world. although there are other reasons, I speak quite plainly when I say that the most urgent reason why the Commonwealth Government has requested its Treasurer ate. to go to London at this stage is the matter, and! the matters, upon which I have been speaking. 'And I hope, if the ditions of public andfinancial affairs Britain permit, to be able, not to provide, but to suggest, a solution which will the credit of Australia, as it should be, members. above suspicion and without tarnish, and, at the same time, relieve the pressure upon us at present to find the money either here or abroad for that purpose.",28
57,Mr MATHEWS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"What is the aggregate of these amounts? Something like £90,000,000,.is it not?",29
58,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,That is so.,29
59,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Do not the States owe us part of that sum of £49,000,000 ?",29
60,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I am not worrying about the bonded debt of £49,000,000; neither' need this country worry. There are included in the £49,000,000-and one could elaborate this matter almost ad transacinfinitum-sum s of money which we had intended to pay out of the Notes That fund then became availposable for loans to the States and hold their paper. A maturdebt for which provision by bond or stock has been made does not cause the authorities involved so much worry as in the case of an overdraft in regard to which pressure is being exerted. I would recommend the honourable memfor Yarra to read again that hymn, most famous of all the ages, probably, for composed by Cardinal Newman",29
61,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Yes , I know what you and I think I could repeat it now.",29
62,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"No doubt; and there is one portion which I trust is engraved in upon the capacious memory of the honourable memberI do not ask to see the distant scene; One step enough for me. This is not a memory competition, but a repetition of the whole hymn would afford a useful moral and intellectual exto ercise. However, I did not come here to preach, but to outline the financial",29
63,Mr BRENNAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I do not think the finanhymn-writer was dealing with finance to the upon the occasion in question.,29
64,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,No. ; but we take our lessons from the high idealists of the,29
65,Mr BRENNAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I thought you had been reading Micawber and would have had a different principle altogether to enunci,29
66,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,".The honourable member is the best exponent of Micawber in policontics whom I know. But , do not let us in tur n aside to exchange comments upon matters which may lead us off the track keep and divert the attention of honourable Attention is being given also by the Government to the loan requirements for the next financial year, and I speak here of the period beginning on 1st July next. Before long it will be necessary to raise more loan money, either here or abroad, to provide for the payment of our belated war expenses, for repatriation, lanri settlement, and housing, and for the shipbuilding programme which has already been announced. Honourable members wiH see that these problems are not easy of solution with interest rates rising throughout the world, and the abnormal conditions of international exchange at present ruling. Our shipbuilding requirements have hitherto, in. quite a natural way during the war, been included in Loan Bills under the general heading of War Expenditure, as they were, I understand, in Great Britain and in the United States of America when they undertook a big maritime programme, but in future the amounts required for this particular class of work will have to be shown separately in the schedule of a Loan Bill for the consideration of a Committee of the House. The Supply granted by the last Parliament has sufficed for all payments up to the 5th March last, and, while on some votes there are small balances, other votes are exhausted. The amcarn-ts in the present Supply Bill are sufficient to cover the needs of the Treasury to 31st May next. If this Supply is granted by the Committee, Parliament will then have authorized the expenditure for eleven out of the twelve mom'ths of the fianncial year terminatingon 30-th June next, leaving one month unprovided for, and for which special provision will need to be asked later in the ordinary way. I should like to outline to the. Committee the chief reasons which have induced the Government to request the Supply for this period; and for this amount. The first is that the Address- in-Reply to the Speech from the Throne has not yet been adopted, and we are unable to say how long the debate upon it is likely to occupy. Furthermore, there are two definite promises made by the Government in the enunciation of their programme for the consideration of the people, which must be redeemed. first promise was that the original, measure to be introduced for the consideratiora of this Parliament would be a War Gratuity Bill. We intend to keepthat promise if permitted to remain in office. ITr. Watt.",29
67,Mr MAHONT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We will all honouar that promise I 'hope.,30
68,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I am sure we will, som& ; perhaps in different ways, but still we will all honour it. The Bill is now ready, and when honourable members see it they will conclude that it has been a difficult measure to frame, providing as it does for all cases and all classes of cases; and that it should appropriately receive very careful, even if leisurely, consideration at the hands of Parliament. The amount involved, as will be explained by the Prime Minister or Acting Treasurer when the measure is introduced, is a large sum, and for that reason and' another, namely that of doing decent justiceto the recipients of the gratuity, I am sure honourable members will desire to give extensive consideration to themeasure. The second promise which must be honoured with equal facility is that the next measure to be brought down for the consideration of the House would be the Tariff"", and although it is not conceivable that Parliament will, as soon as the Tariff proposals are laid on the table,, proceed to the consideration of them-it is likely to require some little time to review the scheduleswhile they are operating-ye t it would be idle to .place before honoraiblemembers a reconstructive measvire of that kind, and leave it for any considerable time without giving it attention. We cannot shut OUT eyes to two. orther facts transcending importance. The 1 Easter holidays will oceur at the end of 1 1 this month and! the beginning of April. I have had no opportunity of con suiting the wishes of honourable members as to how long an adjournment those who come from the more distant States are likely to ask for or wish for.",30
69,Mr GBEGOET,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,You sent usaway to those long distances pretty suddenly.,30
70,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"-It is those who did not come back who should worry, the men for whom the resurrectionstill waits. The honourable member need not worry, his resurrection came, swiftly. This, is likely to be a long session. If all the important The measures in the Government's programme are tobeseriously tackled! by Parliament, I can well conceive the session stretching nearly to the end. of the year. Them there wili arrive later' on in theperiod covered by this Supply the Heir' A p parent to the Throne, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, and I say plainly that the spirit of welcome which I believe the people of Australia will extend to him will be shared by every honourable member irrespective of party, and that it is inevitable there will be a natural desire that Parliament should adjourn to enable sufficient honour to be shown to him. It would be most inconvenient if Parliament had to meet during that particular time to vote Supply and was unable to join in the festivities of welcome which every part of the Empire the Prinee has visited has so freely offered him. The total of this Supply Bill is J35,727,1S0, made up as follows:Ordinary expenditure .. .. 1,9S4,635 War services, including interest, war pensions, and repatriation 3,251,545 ^Refunds of revenue .. .. Advance to the Treasurer .. Total .. .. . . 5,727,180 The amounts are based on the Estimates which were laid on the table on 36th February. Omitting war services, Treasurer's Advance, refunds of revenue and special appropriations, the sums included in the ordinary estimates total £10,930,981. The proportion of this amount for eleven months is £10,020,066. The amount in this Bill, together with Supply previously granted in this financial year by the late Parliament, is -£9,450,052, which is £570,014 less than the eleven months' proportion. Therefore, we are not asking the Conirnittee to overvote the proportion of eleventwelfths of the total Supply. In concluding, I desire to refer to one. other matter which I think it my duty to introduce voluntarily, because of the controversial history surrounding the whole question. I refer to the question of munition making, or a munition plant or arsenal for Australia. I hope honourable members will realise that Supply is not asked for in this financial year under this heading, but a commitment has been made which will extend itself into the finances of next year, and, therefore, a Committee of Supply, although not voting anything by this Bill-, should be in possession of all the facts. Arrangements have been made to take over from the British Government certain munition-making machinery at a price of £150,000. If this plant were purchased froin the makers of such machinery, it would cost £600,000-. Mr MAHONY. - Is the plant new ?",30
71,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It is quite new. The British authorities estimate the disposal value at £300,000, which is half the cost value, and decided to offer it to Australia at half its disposal Talue, or one-quarter of the cost value. This offer, after careful consideration and advice from the best experts, was deemed to be too advantageous to miss, and the Government have accepted it, because it eould not be held open indefinitely when £ so many similar plants are being scrapped. This plant will enable the 'Commonwealth, with the plant we already have, to manufacture munitions for field guns, and will 41,000 make it possible to furnish our Defence 450,000 Forces with the requisite equipment. The necessary provision will be made on next year's Estimates. I ean readily .understand that there may be a difference of opinion, irrespective of party politics, on this transaction. The Government take ful l responsibility, because they consider it a prudent and necessary action. To those honourable - members who may consider it otherwise, I may say that no Government could occupy the Treasury bencfb. of the Commonwealth Parliament under present conditions and have no defence policy. I do not think it practicable for a Government to retain the confidence of this House, or of the electors, without such a policy. Whatever the policy may be, it is plain to every man, as the sun is at high noon, that we must have the plant jand material ito equip our field forces, without which they would be of no use in defending the country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has intimated that at the proper time the defence policy of the Government, which is now being prepared by the Council of Defence and its expert officers, will be submitted to Parliament for consideration, and, I hope, decision. Whatever defence policy is evolved, we must have plant of this nature, and I trust the House, after due consideration, will approve the precautionary measure of obtaining these essential pre-requisites for the protection of our country.",31
72,Mr GREGORY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,It is a very good purchase.,32
73,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It will be many months before the plant arrives, as it will be despatched in sections. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), as Chairman of the Public Works Committee, has given very close attention to the arsenal question, and doubtless realizes the wisdom of the purchase. Mr TunoB - You are touching him in a very soft spot.",32
74,Mr WATT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Houorabl e members opposite are not fair to me. I came into this Parliament inexperienced in its ways, and many who have been here since, its inception do nothing but ridicule my in significant efforts. The sums the Committee are asked to vote are essential for the continuation of the Public Services of the Commonwealth. As I shall not be permitted, I believe, to speak again on this matter before I leave for London, I take this opportunity of recommending the votes to the earnest and careful consideration of the Committee, and of thanking honourable members generally for the attention and courtesy they have always shown me.",32
75,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Franklin) [4.7]. - In terms of the notice of motion previously given I moveTliat the proposed sum be reduced by £2,863,590. The object is to l i m it the term of Supply to six weeks. I think it is desirable that I should take this early opportunity-the first real opportunity that I have had-to inform the Government, their supporters, and the members of the Opposition of the exact position of members occupying the cross benches, and who constitute the Australian Country party, - which has done me the great honour of electing me as its Leader. I may say at the outset that the Country party is an independent body quite separate fro m the Nationalists or the Labour party. I think it my duty to let honourable members of this House and the country generally know exactly the position in which we stand. occupy our own party rooms, we have appointed our own Leader and other officers.. We take no part in the deliberations! of Ministerialists or of the Opposition. We intend to support measures of which we approve, and hold ourselves absolutely free to criticise or reject any proposals with which we do not agree. Having put our hands to the wheel, we set the course ' of our voyage. There has been no collusion, we crave no alliance, 'we spurn no support; we have no desire to harass the Government, nor do we wish to humiliate the Opposition. We have not entered upon this course without giving the matter the most grave consideration. It is no. light matter for men who, for two decades, occupied seats on this side of the House, and who, prior to the last election, sat behind present Ministers, to have deliberately taken this course. We have recognised-as have other honourable members and a considerable number of electors-that drastic action was necessary to secure closer attention to the requirements of the primary producers of Australia than they have hitherto received. The primary producer is determined that he shall now take his proper place. We have no quarrel with the consumers in the cities. We regard them, in part, as our best customers. I desire to take this opportunity of stating that members of the Country party, as the direct representatives of the primary producers, have declared war against those Trusts and Combines whose prosperity has been gained alike at the expense of the farmer and of the consumer. We have entered deliberately upon a campaign against unnecessary intermediaries. We seek to bring the consumer and the producer into closer touch, so that the farmer may obtain a fair return for his products, and the consumer be able to purchase at fair and reasonable prices. Hitherto the man in the middle has waxed f at at the expense of the two extremities. In pre-war days the people of the cities had cheap bread, cheap meat, cheap milk, and cheap butter. But at whose expense ? Go into the dairying portions of Australia, ask the children of the dairy farmer, who are up at daylight in the morning to handle cows in the slush and cold of winter, in order that the We people of the cities may get mil k at 4d. and 5d. a quart. Ask the wheat farmer at whose expense the people of the cities were furnished with a cheap loaf. Ask, also,- how much of the prices paid has hitherto been obtained by the producer. When these matters are put fairly before the consuming public of Australia, I am confident that a sense of justice will prevail. ""We must combat the inconsistency of people who submit calmly to an in crease of 50 per cent, in the price of tobacco and protest at an advance! of - Jd. per lb. in the price of bread. party, we intend to point to the inconsistency of men who are prepared to pay 6d. for half-a-pint of beer, and yet hold indignation meetings because milk is 5d. or 6d. per quart. We are out to secure a fair deal for the man on the land. know this will not please all my honourable friends, but this is the course we have set ourselves, and we shall steer straight ahead without hesitation, accepting any and every responsibility that may accrue from our actions as a party. Honourable members know that a declaration of war against Trusts and Combines is no new conversion on my part. p r years I have warned them of the operations of Combines that were gripping the people of Australia by the throat. have made no secret of the position as I saw it , but, unfortunately, I did not receive that support which I had a right to expect in regard to the shipping Rings that were crucifying my State. My firm conviction is that the only weapon that can pierce the armour of Trusts and Combines is co-operation, and I here pledge the Country party to fight them to the last ditch. There are other planks in our platform which I shall briefly outline. We stand for economy in public administration. For the last ten years the Commonwealth has indulged in a veritable carnival of financial folly. We have borrowed largely j we have spent unwisely. We have issued paper money until we have almost submerged the Plimsoll mark of financial safety. As a party, we have, made up our minds that the time has come to cry a halt, and put our house in order by a reduction in Departments which have become unwieldy and expensive to a degree that would be ludicrous were the matter not so serious. The overlapping of Federal and State administration must receive immediate consideration. above all, there must be a return to parliamentary control of the public purse. The war, thank God, is over, and the earlier this Parliament returns to the traditions of responsible government the better it will be for the country and the easier for the Ministry. All expenditure of any magnitude should be authorized by this House, and reasonable opportunity should be afforded for its proper consideration. Parliament must immediately resume the absolute control of the As a public purse. In trying to put before the Committee the opinions of members with whom I am associated, I have studiously avoided saying anything that could be fairly construed as a threat. I have deemed it I proper, in fairness* to the Government, to myself, to members of my party, and our constituents that I should take this early opportunity of defining the attitude and aspirations of the Country party. We ask no favours, and we shall submit to no indignities. We seek no quarrel with the. Government or with the Opposition. I trust that we shall full y recognise our re0 sponsibilities, and so conduct ourselves in this House as to win the respect of all parties, and of the electors of Australia. I We shall do all that is possible to advance the interests o.f all classes of the community. I have deemed it advisable, so that there may be no misunderstanding of our attitude, to put our position clearly before the Committee. I ami satisfied that the course we have adopted in submitting the amendment is the correct one. Were it dealt with on its merits, probably one-half of those honourable members, representing country districts, and now sitting behind Ministers, would be found following us into the lobby; but I have been informed that the amendment will be regarded as a vote of want of confidence. In that case, the party whip will crack, and probably by scouring the highways and byways of this House, the Government will obtain a majority against my amendment. I have, however, the consciousness of having acted in the best interests of the people of Australia. I believe that out of possible defeat now will .spring certain victory, so f ar as the principles we are advocating are concerned. I venture to say that during this debate such And, a lamp will be lighted that its rays will spread - over this continent from gulf to gulf and from sea to sea, and that the cursed system of centralization, under which hundreds of thousands of pounds are squandered in our city Departments, whilst necessary adjuncts to civilization, in the way of telephonic communication and mail services, are denied to the residents of our back-blocks, will be stopped - for ever. J'li-. JAMES PAGE - My word,, the honourable member, is a statesman.",32
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"What shall I say of the shipbuilding: fiasco ? I have on a former occasion, stated, in this House that, shortly after the war broke out, an offer was made by a responsible man and a first-class shipbuilder to construct of Tasmanian bluegum two fore and aft schooners of from 1,000 to 1,500. tons, to equip them with Deisel engines, and, under a heavy penalty,, to hand them over to the Government within a periodof. nine months for a total cost of £25' per ton. The life of those ships would be, bar accidents, at least fifty years.. That offer was made to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for the Navy. They rejected it.",34
77,Mr WATKINS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The honourable member's vote last week approved of their action.,34
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Had - that offer been accepted,, those ships would have paid for themselves long ago. They would have relieved the whole of the congested traffic between Tasmania and the mainland, an.d they would have brought into the market thousands and thousands of tons of primary produce, some of which has since rotted irretrievably on the wharfs of that State, and some of which is still rotting on the farms there. But, having turned down the Australian ships, which could have done the work, two years later the Government entered into contracts for the construction of Yankee schooners, which were .to. be built of Oregon pine, and the life of which cannot 1 possibly exceed eight or ten years. It is a well-known fact that there are vessels built of Tasmanian bluegum running round our coast which are seventy or eighty years of age. I desire to know a little more about the contracts for the building of these Yankee schooners. We know too well their rotten condition. We know that the pumps had to be kept going incessantly on. their maiden voyages, that they had: to be docked and recaulked on their arrival here, and that at least one of them had to be partially replanked. .We should be informed who checked the specifications for these ships - thes e fraudulently built sea-sieves-for that is what they are. We should be told who superintended their construction, and who accepted delivery of them. Honourable members interjecting,",34
79,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I must again appeal to honourable members to allow the honourable member for Eranklin to proceed without interruptions.,34
80,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I learn from the report of the Auditor-General that the Yankee wooden schooners have cost 8,900,000 dollars,, notwithstanding that their original price was 5,300,000 dollars. I learn from good authority that the contracts were so faultily drawnthat even the cabins and other internal fittings, ot the most ordinary nature were charged, and paid for, as extras. This is a very serious charge. MT. RYAN - It is a wonder that the honourable member did not vote for the motion we submitted last week. ",34
81,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Will the honourable member tell me why he supported the Ministry during the last Parliament, when ail these matters - were well known to him? Mr Mo WILLIAMS - In British money tliese figures mean, that the original contract price of these vessels was £1,060,000, whilst the price actually paid for them was £1,740,000-a n increase of £680,000, or 66 per cent.",34
82,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) made a speech regarding this matter about twelve months ago.. The CHAIRMAN - Order ! I have repeatedly appealed to honourable members to preserve order, especially upon a matter of this kind, and I must again ask them to cease from interrupting.",34
83,Mr ANSTEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"If you want to interrupt, sit on the other side.",34
84,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Order !,34
85,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"i think that we ought to know who drew up these contracts, and who perused them on behalf of the Government. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has quoted from the Privy Council judgment in the historic case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That judgment discloses the disquieting fact that the G'o-vernment lost its appeal and its richt really to deal with this huge profiteering company, not on the merits of the case, but because the Crown Law officers hae? committed an unpardonable blunder. In these two cases, our Legal Department has been guilty of extraordinary and unpardonable remissness. General's Department costs the Commonwealth. £67,000 a year. We have, therefore, at least .a right to expect that our legal work will be performed with ordinary skill and care. Of the cancelled Australian ship-building contracts we shall probably hear more in the future. But in passing, I would like to have proof of some inquiry of the ability of the contracting parties, prior to the contracts having been entered into, to fulfil l their obligations. credibly informed that in one case' the contracting party had not even a ship-building yard. Other statements of an equally serious character have been made. It will be sufficient for me to say that for the cancellation of theseunfortunate contracts, the Government have to pay to the Wallace Power Boat Company Limited £ 5 1 , 8 9 2; to Messrs. Hughes, Martin , and Limited about £ 7 0 , 0 0 0; and to Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh, for cancelling the building of four ships out of Fix, for which a contract was made, about £ 5 2 , 0 0 0; a total of £173,839. of the. Yankee ships, five motor boats and three steamers, have been sold, dis<closing a loss on the transaction of £326,000. W i th the Australian contracts, there is thus a total loss on the cancellation of the contracts of hal'f-a-iuillion sterling. What it will cost to get out of the contract for the construction of the balance of the Yankee ships is necessarily mere guesswork. will amount to £500,000-and the whole of these contracts were entered into without the authority of this Parliament. The Treasurer is always so interesting and so pleasant when he delivers a speech that one scarcely cares tocriticise him. But what is his proposal for getting out of that stupendous blunder, the present management of the Post Office? creation of another Board. The Government appointed the [Economies Commissioner to investigate the administration of some of our public Departments. It has dealt with the Post Office, and I venture to say that so condemnatory a report as it has submitted, has never previously been presented to any Parliament in Australia. These are a few extracts from the Commission's reportTheoverseers of postmen (suburban) . . spend practically every afternoon, and frereports ? quently one hour before lunch time, in their Our Attorney- office drafting and writing lengthy reports addressed to inspectorsin adjoining rooms.",34
86,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Do you not > think that report suggests the necessity for a board of business men?,35
87,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I think it suggests that we should know here and now when effect is to be given to the report of the Economies Commission. It is also stated that many unnecessary records are kept, references made, and returns prepared. ' It is further stated that I am Supervisory officers, including mail officers, instead of doing their own proper work, have been provided with clerks and (or) assistants to undertake such duties for them. . . . It is apparent to me that the correspondence section, is considerably overstaffed;, and the mere fact that four officers could be spared without relief, and without any pressure on the part of the remaining staff, is ample evidence of this fact. The writer of that minute then recomWashington mends that four or five officers, whose salaries total £1,214, be dispensed with immediately. I am quoting from the report of a body which, it should be reEight membered, is not a hostile Commission, but one appointed by the Government to deal with the public Departments. It is also statedThat a telephone staff could be so overloaded as to permit of a saving of over £22,000 a year being made, whilst at the same time improving the efficiency of the service, cannot be deemed otherwise than the gravest reflection upon the diligence and intelligence of all officers concerned, and it is only reasonable to Probablv it suggest that, in addition to the late manager of telephones and the assistant manager; the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, the Commonwealth Public Service Inspector of New South Wales, the officers of the Central Office, Postmaster-General's Department, and the officers of the Public Service Commissioner's office, were all guilty of grave dereliction of duty and negligence in this matter, and all concerned should have been suitably dealt with. That report has been out now for six The months.",35
88,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The writer does not know much about the telephone office in. Sydney. The Commission walk through the office, and know all about it in a day!",35
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Then what is the use of going to the expense of appointing these Commissions if , as the apologist for the Sydney Department declares, their members walk, through an_ office, know . nothing about it , and then bring up these A "" case in point "" in which the Minister for the Navy will be interested, is the following: A case in point is checking the stock-sheets of stocktaking of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard as at 1st July, 1916. These stock-sheets, complete, did not leave the Dockyard until March, 1919. It therefore took two years and ten months to get those stock-sheets into the hands of the officers to whom they should have been deliveredAn officer in the Sydney office is now--and has been for over a month past-checkin g additions and extensions, and making inquiries into the deficiencies and surpluses. . . That full need exists for a close watch on stores work is shown by the fact that deficiencies amounted to £53,000, and' the surpluses to £43,000, a net deficiency of £10,000 on a total stock of £120,000.",35
90,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,That arises through understaffing the Stores Branch.,36
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Does it? heard of a party of visitors who could not land at Cockatoo Island for the people who were running about on the island. Five years ago the then Government appointed Sir'Robert MCC. Anderson to report on this undertaking, and he reported 'that savings to the extent of £510,000 per annum were possible. Up to the time when this Commission was appointed, effect had been given to none of his recommendations.",36
92,Mr WISE,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The Economies Commission were-pretty severe on the country non-paying services. Remember that, as a member of the Country party.",36
93,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I will give the honourable gentleman who has just taken charge of the Postmaster-General's Department a little information ' on that point. I venture to say that, after honourable members have studied this report, he will be a bold Postmaster-General who will have the effrontery to ask a few settlers out in the black-blocks 'to guarantee a prospective loss on a telephone line while nearly £100,000 a year is being lost on the telephone exchange in Sydney. The honourable member talks about the losses on the country telephones. I will give him some of the losses on the city telephones.",36
94,Mr WISE,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I did not talk about the losses on the country telephones. I said your Economies Commission talked abfiul. them, and very severely, too.",36
95,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I will give the honourable member what the Economies Commission said about two or three of the city telephone systems. In five years there was a loss of. £420,000 on the network of telephone exchanges in Sydney, a loss in Melbourne of £102,500, and. a loss in Perth of £120,000. In the same five years there was a profit in Adelaide of £41,500, in Brisbane of £73,500, and in Hobart of £3,000. This country has been standing behind the wealthy cities of Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth to the extent of £640,000 odd in five years, while the wretched policy of this Department is that a few people out in the back blocks of any State in Australia have to put down their hard cash to guarantee that there will be no loss on a telephone line which they need to make their conditions endurable.",36
96,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE, Order ! The honourable member has reached his time limit.,36
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"If no either honourable member desires to speak, I will take my second period now. Whatever may be the result of the division on this motion, the facts which will be placed before the country during this debate will sound the death-knell of that rotten system, at least. If we are to stand a loss of £150,000 to £200,000 a year on the telephone networks of our big cities, the Department which has been squandering money in this way can no longer have the effrontery to ask the men who go out into the back country all over Australia to guarantee, out of their poverty, a few pounds before they can be given one of the necessary adjuncts of civilization in the shape of a telephone. I am one of those who are confident that profiteering does exist in Australia. The one thing I know about law is that I know nothing about it ; but even to the layman it is quite clear that this Parliament has the plenary power of taxation, and recent investigations have disclosed that some of the great business firms of this city have deliberately evaded the express determination of this Parliament that they should pay at least their fair share of taxation. We now learn that these firms and business houses have passed on their taxation to the consumers of their goods, who have paid it in the higher prices that they have been charged. This Committee should be informed, before a division, of the steps that the Government intend to take to give effect to the intention of Parliament in this matter. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), an acknowledged constitutional authority, has declared that this Parliament has power to legislate in respect of the cost of Hying, and has offered to draft a Bill in exercise of , that power, which, he pledges his reputation, will stand the scrutiny of the High Court. .The Government would not injure its dignity by accepting that offer, and I , on my part, am prepared to make a further undertaking. The Prime Minister expressed the opinion at a conference of Federal and State authorities held two years ago, that any individual State can voluntarily surrender to the Commonwealth any of the powers reserved to it by the Constitution. The doubt was raised whether the differential provisions of the Constitution would permit of the transference of powers to the Commonwealth by one or more States, it being thought to be necessary for all the States to take common action on specific matters. But the Prime Minister at the Conference combated that idea. I can, I think, guarantee that if the necessary ' legislation be prepared, it will be agreed to in Tasmania at least, and I have before declared that if the Commonwealth, instead of presenting the pistol at the head of the State Governments by submitting referenda, had sought their individual co-operation, we would have saved a great deal of money, would have avoided several futile elections, and would have obtained much more satisfactory results.",36
98,Mr HUGHES,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The States were asked to surrender powers, and declined to do so. _,",37
99,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Because-if I am correctly informed-ther e was the. implied stipulation that they must all agree in the matter.,37
100,Mr HUGHES,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"That is so. they all agreed, the Commonwealth could not act, because, under our Constitution, the laws of this Parliament must be ixniform.",37
101,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"At the Conference to which I have referred, the Prime Minister successfully argued in favour of the contrary opinion. We cannot now discuss the Estimates for this year, but there is an item there which I hope the Government will not ask us to pass, and the Committee, if necessary, will strike out. During the last financial year, £6,421 was voted for the Commonwealth police, and £3,666 of that amount was expended. It is now proposed to expend £7,102 on an ""Investigation Department,"" which is a new name for the Commonwealth police, and, if my information be correct, other new appointments are to follow. If the ambition of the Crown Law Department eventuates we shall find ourselves 'within two or three years saddled with another costly Department engaged in duplicating work which is now being satisfactorily performed by State Departments. This is a Cabinet usurpation of the rights of this Parliament, and I warn the Government not to enter into further com- mitments in regard tq_this embryo body, because Parliament will not agree to its perpetuation. I have no wish to pose as a pessimist, but it would be wrong to avert one's eyes .from the financial situation. The figures setting forth our national debt, which have been given by the Treasurer, are sufficient to make us pause. We have one cause for thankfulness in regard to the debt, and that is that we do not owe money to foreign countries. ' Great Britain herself has, during the war, for the first time for centuries, borrowed abroad, and she is straining every nerve to get rid of the obligations she has thus incurred, because her foreign indebtedness is proving injurious to her trade and commerce. Her position should be a warning to us. Whatever finanical obligations we enter into should be under the British flag.",37
102,Mr ANSTEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,They will be under the Stars and Stripes.,37
103,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I sincerely hope not. Creditors occasionally act with great harshness towards their debtors. Unless After four awful years of warfare, with its terrible expenditure and destruction, Australia has fallen upon troublous times. Unfortunate industrial disturbances have caused our people great losses in earnings, and by interfering with our commercial .activities, and, especially, by delaying the carriage of perishable. produce, have caused the community to lose many hundreds of thousands of pounds. A disastrous drought, affecting a very large .area of the Commonwealth, has sadly reduced the returns from p r i mary production during the past two years. The loss in sheep and lambs, in cluding that in natural increase, amounts to from ' 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 head. The acreage under wheat has been reduced by over 4,000,000 acres. The decline in the production of butter and sugar cannot fail to seriously in j u r e those engaged in dairying and sugar growing and the community generally; and, last, but not least, the baneful influence of the shipping rings, with their unholy in creases in freights, cannot fail to have a far-reaching and detrimental effect upon commerce and industry, and cause a disastrous decline in our national revenues. We' must insist upon a reduction of our national expenditure corresponding with this decline. Having, as fairly as T could, and withposed holding nothing, placed the position and the views of the Country party before Committee, I come again to the amendment. I have been told that the Governthat ment will regard it as a motion of want of confidence. If that be so, .1 regret but no action of others can relieve this party - of its responsibility. We have no with the expenditure of the .year at the desire to takse the business of Parliament out of the hands of the Government, we declare that the control of the public purse should be restored to Let us view the circumstances leading up continued. to the moving of the amendment. are asked to grant Supply for the current financial year which will cover the public expenditure to the end of the eleventh month. Upwards of eight months of the financial year have expired. Last Parliament was suddenly dissolved-unnecessarily and unwisely, I think-eight months before the expiry of its term, so that members ""had not an opportunity criticise the Estimates. It may be that Estimates can be dealt with time on a Supply Bill, but that is not so. Supply Bills are based, not on the Estision mates for the year with whose ture they deal, but on the .appropriation of the previous year, it being for the Treasurer on introducing a Supply Bill to assure honourable members that contains nothing new, nothing that was not covered in the last Appropriation Act. Supply thus granted is merely an in the Telephone Office, Sydney. Mr MCWilliams. advance for the purposes of the current year based <on the rates of expenditure sanctioned for the previous financial year. While technically it might be possible to discuss the Estimates on a Supply Bill , actually .and practically it is not. The expenditure of the Departments can be criticised only when the ""Estimates are before us. , . Mr TUDOR - Does the honourable member' .say that no money will be expended except in accordance with last year's Estimates ?",37
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The moment we pass a' Supply Bill we practically give the Government a blank cheque to be filled in and spent as they please. The Government take, or should take, the full and complete responsibility for that expenditure when they next meet the Parliament. Mi*. R-ODGE-ksi-Will the honourable member tell us what we are all' anxious to know, and that is, in what way his proreduction will, overcome all the diffithe culties of which he has been speaking?",38
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I do not say the difficulties associated with our war indebtedness, the drought, and much it; of the financial strain now pressing upon our people, can be overcome by dealing , proper time. But I do say that the .sysbut tem which has been going on for some time, and for which there was some reaParliament. son during the war, should no longer be We admit that during the We war Ministers and the House generally had to do many things that were opposed to constitutional practice, and iagainst which the good sense of honourable memyear bers rebelled. More than twelve months have elapsed, however, since the cessation of hostilities, and our party hold that it is necessary at once to restore this to Parliament to pre-war conditionsi. There said must be no more expenditure without the at any sanction of Parliament. The report of the Economies Commispoints out that in the Telephone expendiOffice, Sydney, there are 263 unnecessary employees, and that the work of /the customary office would be better performed without them. That means that, allowing for a it minimum wage of £3 per week, over £39,000 per annum is being thrown away Wo have no right to ask the people to pay additional taxation and at the same time to deprive many of the people in rural districts of reasonable postal and telegraphic facilities whilst money is being squandered in this way. We - have had a report in regard to the position of the Postmaster-General's Department, but - when reports are put before lis in regard to the expenditure on transports and in connection with the Naval and Military Departments generally, we sha?ll have our eyes opened. If any justification were required for my amendment, it would be found in - the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) last week and in that put before us today by the Treasurer (Mr Watt). No better man than the Treasurer could be chosen for dealing in England - with the financial position of Australia.; hut Tiis services will be sadly required here by the Government. Every honourable .member sincerely hopes, not only that l is mission will be successful, but that sea trip will .greatly improve his health, which we know has been subjected of late to a very severe strain. I wish him good luek; but on some future occasion we shall certainly, have to discuss very seriously the position with regard to the High Commissioner's 'Office. We have a High Commissioner, receiving £5,000 a year, while his Department in London costs us £45,000 per annum; yet, whenever there is any work to do at Home on behalf of the Commonwealth, it is necessary to send one' Minister or more to deal with it . Either the Commissioner and his Department are or are notfitfor the work that should properly devolve upon them.",38
106,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,What is the .High Commissioner's work?,39
107,Mr GREGORY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"What is he there for?' Mr. MCWILLIAMS - I have never been able to .find out. L say deliberately that the Parliament ,and the country will have very seriously to consider .shortly whether we should continue in London a Department costing £45,000 per annum with a High Commissioner at its head receiving £5,000 per annum, if it is necessary practically every few months to send a Minister to England to attend to matters that should be dealt 'with by the High Commissioner. Should it not be the High Commissioner's duty to deal with finance matters on behalf of the Commonwealth ?",39
108,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I should hope not.,39
109,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Then what is his work ? An HONORA-BEE MEMBER;-He is there on behalf of the primary producer.,39

112,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Some - members of the Country party were glad of the Nationalist party's support.,39
113,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I certainly received a very divided support. The Parliament has a right to know the now to what extent the recommendations of the Economies Commission have been and are to be given effect to.,39
114,Sir ROBERT BEST,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We have been given that information this afternoon.,39
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Not at all. It is true we have been told that a Board is to be appointed in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department; but if the honourable member - Hunks that this Parliament is for ever to shelter itself behind the appointment of Royal Commissions, I can only say that he has mistaken the tone of this House. As to the Postal Department, I would remind honourable members that nearly three years have elapsed since an opportunity was afforded us to discuss its Estimates. In 19IS the ""guillotine"" was applied, and the whole of the Estimates were passed en bloc. In the previous year, while the Estimates were under consideration, the then Postmaster-General was deliberately taken out of the House before the Estimates of his Department were reached. As soon as they were called on the then Treasurer took charge, and was unable, of course, to supply any information relating to them. The Postmaster-General himself did not re-appear until his Estimates had been dealt with. We have now reached the ninth month of the current financial year, and the Estimates have not yet been considered. We are just now coming to the awakening. There is .one other matter of vital portance to which I desire to refer. The .unprecedented tightness of the money market, together with the effect the drought and recent strikes, cannot fail important. to have a disastrous effect financially the people, and especially upon our rura population. It is at this critical moment the national expenditure. that - the moratorium is to, be lifted. was instrumental in securing the duction of the original Moratorium B i l ' and I was instrumental last year in securing its extension for a further period of six months.",39

I put it to the honourable member for Franklin in quite a friendly way that it is not altogether f a ir that criticism should be directed to the Government for doing those things which it was essential it should do in the circumstances in which it found itsel . Honourable members know perfectly well that no matter what Government was in power during the war - whether the Fisher Government, the .first or the second Hughes Government, or the Government which the honourable member for Frankl in supported - so far as the Estimates were concerned, practically the same procedure was followed. I am not going to - defend that procedure; in fact, I should be very glad to range myself with the .honourable member in demanding that Parliament shall have what the people obviously desire-the power to control in an effective way public expenditure. should like to say, not by way of extenuating any faul t of the Government in the last Parliament, but by way of explaining the position, that that Government, like all Governments during the five years of war, had to deal, as I have said, with abnormal conditions, and faced those conditions as best they were able. In every country it was found, by general consent, that parliamentary government, if it was to be followed out to its logical conclusion, was not a convenient and suitable instrumentality of government during war-time. In the House of Commons, a most jealous mistress of her privileges and rights, a condition of things was, perforce, adopted, not essentially differing from that which existed here. One other point having direct relation to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin needs very special emphasis. Whatever this Government has done or failed to do in regard to affording Parliament an opport u n it y of discussing the Estimates was done in former Parliaments and not this. We must not forget that we live under a democratic form of government, and that the supreme authority is the people. We have been to the people, before whom the issues were quite clearly put. The honourable members sitting in the Government corner, and honourable members sitting The (.opposite, put their views, as we did, before the people. I neither censure nor at1 tempt to explain, or even comment on those views, though I could say much in regard to them if I chose. But I say that the people, having the choice of one of the three parties, chose the party which I have the honour to lead. The results of the election speak for themselves. A great majority of the electors p supported the Government and its policy. It cannot be said! that the people were not informed as to the very many shortcomings of the present Government in former Parliaments. Whatever charge may be laid against honourable members opposite, it cannot be said that they did not tell the people how far the Government fell short of perfection; and that can be said of some, if not all, of the members in the Government corner. But the people deliberately chose the party I have the honour to lead, and, this being a democratic community, the But 1 Government comes here with the imprimatur of the people; and has an absolute right to an opportunity to carry out its policy. The honourable member riiade his charge against us in relation to a previous Parliament. I am not going to defend, or even comment upon what was done in previous Parliaments in this matter. All that is past. The people knew of it , and, knowing all the facts, they phose this party and this Government to govern the country. As to the future , and in so far as the honourable member's criticism is directed at the procedure to be followed in this Parliament, I range myself alongside him, and I say to him and to this Committee, as I said when speaking last week, that ample opportunity will be given to every honourable member to express his opinions and criticise every act of the Government, and the expenditure of every penny of money. Further, I promise that a full opportunity will be given this House to discuss the Estimates before wo again ask for Supply. That opportunity has not been given to honourable members for the last five years, so far as I know, to say nothing of the preceding years. So far, then, as the honourable member's criticism relates to ParliaT ments that have gone, I say nothing. I simply take my stand on the fact that a majority of the people have returned us, and we have a right, since the people have deliberately intrusted to us the onerous duty of attempting to govern this country, to be given an opportunity to give effect to our policy. But the honourable member refuses to give us this. The honourable member for Franklin has moved an amendment to reduce the amount of Supply by one half. He has. said that he has no intention of taking the business out of the hands of the Government. The honourable member did not come into Parliament yesterday; he knows that there is no more effective and direct way of taking the business out of the hands of the Government than the method be has chosen. Therefore, the honourable member will not be surprised when I tell him that the Government cannot accept his amendment. But if he desires to effect a great reform in this Parliament, he will. I hope, join with me, or I will join with him, in giving the House (in opportunity of discussing the Estimates. That, I have promised, shall be done.",40
119,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,When will the House be given an opportunity to discuss the Estimates?,42
120,Mr HUGHES,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"When the Honse realizesthat it was elected not to talk, but to work, that opportunity will be given.. This Parliament was elected to carry out the policy of the Government, which is, firstly, to pass the Soldiers' Gratuity Bill and the Repatriation Bill ; and thesoonerwe get through that work the sooner we shall reach the Estimates. This is. the third week in which the House has been silting, and we have done nothing but talk. So long, as the Government have the honour of holding the Treasury bench wb shall endeavour to get work done in this ""House, and if any honourable member in. the Ministerial Corner or elsewhere in the House desires an early opportunity to discuss the Estimates,, they must agree to do more work aud less talk. I was asked when effect will be given to the report of the Economies Commission. In essentials the Government's policy does not differ from that which the Leader of the Country party has indicated to the Committee. Indeed, I have never known a party or Government that was not in favour of economy. I have yet tohear of a Government that deliberately branded, itself as extravagant. I have never heard of an Opposition that did not do everything in its power to cut down the Estimates. The cry we have heard today is nothing new; it is as old as parliamentary government. But I believe that the Public Service of this country is in urgent need of reform; it is a cumbrous, costly, and ill-managed instrumentality of government. The Government propose to introduce a Bill for the amendment of the Public Service Act which will enable us to give effect to a great many-the major portion, perhaps-of the recommendations of the Economies Commission. I shall not say one word now by way of further criticism of the Public Service, except to declare that we must have twenty shillings' worth of value for every pound we expend. We expect that from the Public Service, and we must have it. On the other hand, it is only fair to say to them that if they give us twenty shillings' worth of value they shall receive £ 1 in return. We ask no man to work for less than a fair reward for his labour. On the other hand, we have a right to expect that he shall give us full value for the money he receives. I cannot conceive of any suggestion that might be put' forward by any honourable member on another side of the House in the direction of bond fide economy which the Government will not be glad to adopt. We are now considering to what extent we can put the recommendation of the Economies Commission in force, and legislation will be introduced where necessary to assist us to do so. The -. mover of the amendment said something about the shipbuilding, policy of the Government. I do not know that there is any necessity for me to dwell at length on the subject at this stage. Last week I explained, as well as I was able, the circumstances in which we were when the American shipbuilding contract was entered into. No doubt, as I "" said then, it has not been a good husiness for the Commonwealth. I declare, however, that if I were thrown into the same circumstances again,, not being able to see any further forward, than I saw then, which was as far forward as anybody else could see, I woulddo as T did. In this connection the honourable member has not dealt quite fairly with the Government.. When one is criticising a balance-sheet"" he. Joes not merely point out the losses, hut strikes a fair balance. The honourable memberdid. not do that.. He pointed to oneitem in the balance-sheet, but did not say a word about the fact that we had made profits ten times as - great as the loss to which he referred. He stated that we had incurred that expenditure without the authority of Parliament. That is quite true. But it is also quite true that we. bought all the Commonwealth Fleet, and earned an immenseprofit without the authority of Parliament. I think the honourable gentleman might have pointed that out, because, as he said, he is not a hostile critic of the Government, but wishes mei'ely to. point out in what respects, we have fallen short. The honourable membersaid that, had we followed his advice,, the shipping shortage would have practically disapipeared. I do not recall all the circumstances to which the honourable gentleman refers.. As far as I remeiruber, however, the honourable' member made a suggestion that two ketches, or schooners, of about 1,000 or 1,500 tons, should! bebuilt in Tasmania. They were to be of shallow draught, and were to go up the rivers. That was the honourable member's remedy for the acute shortage of shipping from which the Commonwealth, in common with all belligerent countries, was suffering. I do not wish to labour this matter; but will any honourable member say that, if I had authorized the building of these little schooners, the shipping problem would have been solved? It would have been a drop in the ocean, and a very insignificant drop .at that. The honourable gentleman said, further, that the shipbuilders in Tasmania were prepared to construct those two schooners with hardwood for £2:5 per ton, instead of agreeing to which) the Government had gone to America,, and paid, more than £25. for vessels made of oregon. As it happens,, at the very same time that we placed those orders in America for ships to be built of. Oregon, we placed orders in Australia for eighteen vessels of 2:„600 tons to be constructed of Australian hardwood, and also for twenty vesselsof 5,500 tons to be built of Australian steel. So' that we did incomparably more for shipbuilding, in Australia than the honourable member suggested. As 'honourable members have been told, the Americans, despite their reputation, turned out to be very dilatory andl unsatisfactory workmen. The Australian workman is sometimes said to be one who is always on strike. I have stated over and over again that the Australian workman is one of the best - in - the world; and I invite honourable members to contrast what he did with the performance of his American fellow workman. As I have said, we not only placed orders in America, but also in Australia, for wooden ships. STow six of the steel ships which were placed on order here are in the water, and very good ships they are, too. We could make £50,000 profit on each tomorrow by selling them for coastal or for deep-sea trade. The honourable member for Franklin did not say anything about these facts,, but he might 'have done so, because, after all, they were the product of Australian, labour and Australian material.. As for the wooden ships, the ordersfor building which were placed 4 here-,, they were to cost £26 a. ton - abou t the price,. by the way, which - the honourable member for Franklin, quoted to me in relation to the construction of the two schooners. They were to be propelled by Diesel engines. We gave orders to three companies-the Wallace Power Boat Company, thefirm. of Hughes, Martin, and Washington, and Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh. That wasbefore I went to England, nearly two years ago.. The honourable member said that the two schooners he spoke of would have been built in nine months. Whether they would or not I cannot say. All I know is that none of the Australian companies with whom we placed our orders for wooden ships carried out theircontract on schedule time. Up to date, only two vesselsof the eighteen have been completed',, and they are without any engines in them. Now, the honourable member said, that if I had placed an order with this firm in Tasmania, it would have put its two schooners into the water in nine months. As I say, whether they could or not, I do not know; but I know that I gave an order to a Tasmanian. firm, and that it is the only firm which has produced nothing, at all-absolutel y nothing..",42
121,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,You are quite wrong.. The Wallace Power Boat Company did not produce much.,43
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Thos e Tasmanian shipbuilders are the only Australian firm which you have not bought out.,44
123,Mr HUGHES,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"We l l , what have they got to sell? We offered to finance them, we did everything; and all we asked in return was that they should give us some ships. They did not. The honourable member may say that that is business; but I do not. I do not know whether he is prepared to stand up in this chamber and compliment that Tasmanian firm upon its activities. However, I will leave the matter at that. We shall have an opportunity, when the Estimates are brought down, to show that this Government's record in relation to shipping and shipbuilding will stand comparison with that of any Government in the world throughout the period of the war. We have done very well for the people of Australia. have done very well for the primary producer in keeping freights down, and we are the only steam-ship line who have done so. The honourable gentleman might have said that also, but he did not. Now, I turn to the matter of country telephonic and telegraphic communication and of postal facilities. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams). We should certainly do our utmost to make life in the country attractive. We should have cheap telephones. I would be prepared to lose half a million sterling a year if it were demonstrated that by making available cheap telephones, and by extending postal facilities, people could be induced to leave the cities and go upon the land. I have said, not once, but a thousand times, that it is poor policy to starve the country for the advantage of the city. And I will say this, further, in behalf of the Government, and for my colleague, the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise): that the policy of the Government is to give every facility-tele phonic, telegraphic and postal-to the man on the land. I think it only proper to say that the honourable member for Franklin was a littl e unfair to criticise my honourable colleague, the Postmaster-General, seeing that he took possession of the Department only a few weeks ago, and that during that time he has met two deputations and has, I think, satisfied them that he intends to follow out the policy which I have just indicated. Speaking for the Government, I assert that we are going to pursue that policy to an extent which, I feel sure, will meet with the approval of the 1 honourable member for Franklin and his colleagues. Then the honourable member said something also with respect to profiteering. This word has become something like "" Mesopotamia."" It is a blessed word, signifying, I will not say,' nothing, but having in different minds different meanings. Certain honourable members on the other side will say that the man on the land is profiteering; others rail against Trusts and Combines. And of remedies there are no lack. The honourable member says he would - be prepared to take advantage of the offer of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . We Ryan) to d r a f t a B i ll by which we may capture the profiteer: and he advises the Government to accept that offer. I am a simple-minded sort of person. I do accept the offer, and will be very glad to see the measure. As a matter of fact, I have been looking for such an offer ever since I came here.",44
124,Mr RVAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Will you undertake to pass the Bill? - Mr HUGHES - I would have to see it first; but I will say this, that if it is any good I will put it through. But if it is a Bill to abolish profiteering by cutting off the people's telephone and telegraphic facilities, I shall not commit myself to its acceptance. I am in favour of more telephones. I could not agree to cutting off telephones because some one alleged' the parties using them were guilty of profiteering. The honourable member for Franklin said it would have been better had we proceeded, not by way of a referendum, but by arrangement with the States. He overlooks the fact that we did do the very thing, he advocates in 1916. We made an arrangement with all the States, and nob one of them, except New South Wales, honoured its promise; although I understand that in the honourable mem - ber's State of Tasmania the necessary legislation passed the Lower House, but failed to pass the Legislative Council. It is not, therefore, upon us that censure should fall in this matter, but upon the States. I do uot propose to enter into any detailed argument about profiteering and the powers of the Constitution in relation to it . J content myself by saying this: at the best, there is a very great difference of opinion as to what are our powers under the present Constitution in this regard; but no man will deny, that if the powers asked for by me at the last referendum had been given, then we should have had power to deal with profiteering. Yet, the honourable member was one of those who went about advising the people of Tasmania to vote against the referendum. I am°very sorry he did so. However, he did it , and that is the end of it . Extension of time granted. , Mr HUGHES - On e word more and I have done. The honourable member for Frankli n claims that the moratorium is useful legislation, and that it is undesirable it should expire because it protects a large number of men who, from the effects of the drought or other vicissitudes of fortune, are in straitened circumstances. I do not know what power the Constitution gives in' relation to the moratorium, other than the Defence power. I would not like to say offhand that we have or have not the requisite power independent of the War Precautions Act, but as long as the W a r Precautions Act is in force-the honourable member knows the conditions under which it expires- I will take steps, if no insuperable difficulty presents itself, to continue the moratorium in force, and see, if that Act expires, say, before a period of six' months, if it is possible to extend the moratorium under the Constitution for the remaining portion of that time. I have nothing further to say, to suggest to the honourable member f o Franklin that he should not insist amendment, seeing that the object for which he moved it has been gained by my tract. plain declaration of the intention of the Government to give ample opportunity honourable members to discuss this year's Estimates. Let me add this before I down, that after the 30th June next we shall give honourable members an early opportunity of discussing the following year's Estimates. The honourable ber has stated that he has no. desire embarrass the Government, or do thing but preserve the interests and safeguard the welfare of the people of the country and restore parliamentary control of the public purse. The guarantee and assurance I have given should surely satisfy him that all he desires will be done. I hope that, in the circumstances, he will not insist on his amendment.",44
125,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Grampians) [ 5 . 3 6 ] - I regret that a certain amount of time has been spent in discussing matters which are really far away from the amendment, and I desire to confine my remarks, as far as possible, to it . It is gratifying to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) state that it is the intention of the Government to give honourable members an opportunity of discussing the Estimates; but while he was speaking, I committed the unpardonable sin of interrupting him, although in &- courteous manner, and' interjected "" When ? "" In reply, the right honourable gentleman did not tell us when we were to have the opportunity of discussing the Estimates, but he informed us that this House was sent here, not to talk, but to work.",45
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,He did more than that.,45
127,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Yes ; he did a great deal more. He elaborated very full y the purpose for which he considered this House was sent here. I took down his exact words. He said, "" This House realizes that it was sent here, not to talk, but to work.. Let us have less talk and more work.""",45
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Surely that was not all he said! He said a great deal more.,45
129,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,He said a great deal more; but I do not propose to quote the whole of his speech for the benefit of my except honourable friends on the Ministerial r bench. I have given them a fair extract on his from that part of his speech.,45
130,Mr ATKINSON,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It was not a fair exMr JOWETT ' - All I have to say to to the honourable member is that I have great pleasure in differing from him. The amendsit ment moved by the honourable, member for Frankli n (Mr MCWilliams) was not submitted with the object of challenging the Government, or with a desire to take conmemt r ol out of the hands of the Ministry, to but was simply put forward for the puranypose of inducing or persuading the - Government., in the most courteous and considerate fashion we could devise J£r.. RYAN - The honourable member knows that no self-respecting Government could retain office - if the amendment should, be carried.",45
131,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"If the members of our party had had the benefits of the considerable parliamentary experience of the honourable member, we might, perhaps, have adopted a different course.",46
132,Mr RYAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"If I were leading a Government when such an amendment was carried, I would get out. Mir. JOWETT. - I gave the honourable member for West Sydney credit for more judgment than is implied by his interjection, because if he were Leader of a Government when a similar amendment had been .moved, I do not think he would act in the direction he has indicated. He would have given some assurance as to the time when the Estimates would be brought forward. This is what the Prime M i nister has not done. In reply to my question as to when the Estimates would be submitted, be said that we were sent here not to talk, but to work. No doubt the Government will bring down the Estimates and give honourable members an opportunity to discuss them when every penny of the money has been spent.",46
133,Mr BUBCHELL,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,-That is not you are i o have them after the two Bills mentioned.,46
134,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell) has said' that my statement is not correct, and that we already have had two Bills mentioned. Surely that is sufficient justification for moving the amendment. Although I am speaking to men with .longer parliamentary experience, and possessing greater political wisdom than I possess, it seems conclusive to me from the Prime M i nister's reply that the Estimates are not likely to be submitted until every penny has been expended. We have heard, from the Prime Minister some most in teresting reminiscences, and no one living better appreciates such reminiscences than I do. He informed us that in the very first Parliament in which he sat hevoted as he was directed, and had he been crucified he could not have told the subject on which he voted, but he feltconvinced that he had helped to save his country. It seems quite obvious that on that occasion the present Prime Minister was a Ministerial supporter, and it seems> from what the Prime Minister has said today, that that will be the position of many Ministerial supporters during the present Parliament. When a division is taken they will vote as directed, and will go home full y convinced - that they have aided in saving the' country without, however, knowing how. Honourable members interjecting.",46
135,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I shall not attempt to reply to the numerous interjections which, are being hurled at me. There is a time for all things. Occasionally during the deplorable dulness that sometimes characterizes debate in this chamber., interjections are of some interest, but when honourable members are seriously endeavouring to consider the position with which this country is confronted, it is not right for honourable members to bombard .me with ridiculous interjections.",46
136,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Will the honourable member tell me this Mr JOW . ETT - ^ At .present I will not answer the honourable member, because I do not intend to reply to what I consider frivolous interjections. I say this with due respect to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin - Chapman). I - now assert that we are faced with a serious position. I shall not dilate upon the gravity of the financial outlook, correct-; because that has already been expatiated on in this House. This is a new Parliament, returned, as the Prime Minister has stated, fresh from the country. We have to face a most serious financial situation, and the sooner it is faced the better. The position will not be effectively met by a continuation of the policy of bringing forward 'Supply Bills and perpetually postponing the only occasion on which we can effectively discuss important questions of national expenditure.",46
137,Mr NICHOLLS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Why did not the honourable member censure the Government during the last Parliament?,46
138,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I do not intend to refer to the motion of censure which was defeated last week. I am .not now here to deal with what may be considered the sins of the past, so much as fo consider the problems that are at present facing ns. They are of sufficient magnitude to demand the whole of - our atten: tion. The issue which the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has placed before the Committee is simply this: It is a means to endeavour to persuade the Committee to reduce by one-half the period for which Supply is granted. It is not an attempt to reduce the amount of Supply, although the amendment, according to parliamentary practice, may make it appear in that form. Instead of coming to Parliament and asking for Supply, it would have been more advantageous if the Treasurer had come forward with the Estimates. We are simply asking for the restoration of parliamentary control over expenditure. Upon a Supply Bill, such as the present one, we might discuss this matter till doomsday if the forms of the House permitted, which, thank God, they do not. .We could rend the air with our cries, and invoke the anger of the on the Ministry, on account of this or any other of their proposals. But on a motion for Supply, such as"" the present one, we could not exercise one iota of control over expenditure.",46
139,Mr RYAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,What item would you reduce?,47
140,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The honourable member for West Sydney knows perfectly well that the only way in which this Committee can exercise control is to oblige the Treasurer to come down with his Estimates* and ask Parliament for their approval before the expenditure has been incurred. I am glad to be supported in this view by such a distinguished authority on parliamentary procedure as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr MCDonald).,47
141,Mr RYAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,But I should like to know what item you would reduce ,47
142,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I have said plainly that the object of the amendment is not fo reduce the expenditure on any item, but to limit the period for which the Government are asking for Supply.",47
143,Mr LAVELXE,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Then how do you propose to effect economy?,47
144,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The only way in which economy can be effected is. by enabling Parliament to have an opportunity to discuss and revise the expenditure before the last penny has been disbursed - The proposal of the Ministry is that Supply be granted for twelve weeks from 5th March, and the amendment seeks to reduce the period by six weeks.",47
145,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,How could the War Gratuity Bill and repatriation matters be dealt with in the limited time ?,47
146,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It is always an easy matter to draw a red herring across the track. If this Committee were lying prostrate at the feet of some Government majority, and rejected all overtures to discuss and control finances, I can well imagine the honourable member for Illawarra if he were on the earth twenty or thirty years hence asking some such. question. It is a futile argument to bring against the amendment. We do not propose to postpone the passage of any of these measures to which he has referred. If the war gratuity and the repatriation proposals prove good ones, gods there will be no more enthusiastic supporters of them than my friends of the Country party. I say this without reflecting upon any member of this Committee. We are anxious to discharge our obligations to the people who sent us here, and I feel satisfied that every'member on the Ministerial benches recognises that we are right in asking for some control over parliamentary expenditure. Our wishes should be met in some way other than by the statement made by the Prime Minister.",47
147,Mr RYAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,He treated you very cavalierly.,47
148,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I do not say that, and I have no reproach to make against anybody. I believe every member here has an honest intention of doing his duty. That is what we are sent here for.",47
149,Mr NICHOLLS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,You have not waved the flag this afternoon.,47
150,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member's remark is quite irrelevant at this moment and in this chamber. I was about to remark that the Prime Minister said, in effect, that he could not defend the present practice; that he really agrees with everything we have done, but that, for the moment, it is not convenient for him to endorse our action. That is the only conclusion I could draw from his remarks. I am not here now to raise any issues of the past. The question for the Committee is not whether the Prime Minister defends this lack of parliamentary control so much as whether he is prepared to take this opportunity to amend it and restore to Parliament this much-needed control over expenditure.",47
151,Mr RYAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Did n ' t be say: ""Don't shoot; I will come down""?",48
152,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I followed the Prime Minister very closely, and I cannot say I heard him make .use of that expression. He said that the Government had a said. righ t to carry out their policy, and that the people had returned them for this purpose. Of course, the' Government have a right to carry out their policy; if the policy is right, he will find no warmer supporters than members of the Country party. It is, however, the wish of a section of the people to secure economic and efficient administration, and - this can best be achieved by restoring parliamentary control oyer expenditure. We have been told that the amendment shall could not be accepted except as a vote want of confidence in the Government. can only say-and I think I can speak for every member of our party, which might call the Australian Eleven-that it should not be regarded in that light. Every sportsman accepts defeat in the same spirit in which he enjoys victory. But there is practically no one in this House who repudiates the doctrine that parliamentary control should be re-estabthe lished. There are many honourable memspent ?"" bers who, perhaps, do not note very carea full y the precise dates upon which Estimates have been brought forward f r year to year, and also the date upon which which they have been approved. they have been actually passed. emphasize that if the Estimates for the current year are not submitted u period indicated by the Prime Minister, they will probably be presented upon later date than ever before. It has made quite, clear to us that Parliament practice of other Governments. will adjourn early in May on account the impend ing visit of H is Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in. which we all rejoice. If we adjourn on the 14th it is obvious that unless we pass the mates before that period it will be quite impossible to approve them u n t i l probable that delay. August next.",48

159,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Yes , he did.",48
160,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Then I never heard him, although I was listening most attentively to his remarks. He told us that we were not here to talk, but to work. Seeing that we are practically certain to rise in the .middle of May j and that we not resume u n t il the end of July, if of the Prime Minister's statement means that I we shall have ample time to consider and pass the Estimates before the 14th May, I we ought to have a definite pronouncement on the subject from some member of the Government. We have had no such pronouncement, and I am not at all certain that the statement of the Prime Minister meets the case. I ask honourable members, "" Is it of any use discussing the Estimates after money for the financial year has been I propose to put upon record few dates, in order to show the period the at which the Estimates have been diso m cussed in years past,- and those upon In I wish to 1913-14 they were presented",48
161,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The Labour n t i l the party was in power then.,48
162,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"But I do not find a much difference between the practice of been the Labour party when in power and the In of 1913-14 the Estimates were presented on the 2nd October, and they were passed before Christmas. In 1914-15 they were May submitted on the 3rd December, and were Estipassed on the 17th July, 1915. I admit that the war was a sufficient excuse for",48
163,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Order !- The honourable member's time has expired.,48
164,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Darling ) [ 6 . 5 ] - I have always been taught that the elasticity of the English language is such that two honpersons possessed of average education can at least make themselves understood But evidently it is i m the possible for the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Country party on the one band, and the Prime Minister on the other, to make themselves intelligible to one another. The Leader of the Country party, with a carefully prepared manifesto, has cried aloud to the heavens that he has not the slightest intention of hurting the Government.. He would not give them one minute's cause for uneasiness, and he has assured them that the last thing he and his colleagues desire is that this country should lose their services. He told them that his party desired that the amount required by them for carrying on the public services of the Commonwealth should be reduced by one-half, but that he had not the slightest wish to harass them by forcibly taking the control of the public business out, nf their hands. After this carefully prepared manifesto had been delivered, in which the Country party affirmed their desire not to take from the hands of Ministers the control of tliefinances,the Prime Minister rose to reply. In a very diplomatic. speech he sought to learn just what they wanted. He said that he would afford the House an opportunity _ of considering the Estimates as soon as possible-as soon as honourable members stopped talking, and began to work. I have yet to learn how a Parliament can work without talking. Of course, the Prime Minister and the Government may constitute themselves judges of the line *of demarcation between talking and working. But I am not competent to say where talking ends and working begins. Probably criticism of the Government would be deemed to be talking, whilst adulation of Ministers would presumably be working. I suppose, too, that talking would be regarded as th6 task of the politician and working that of the statesman. Evidently the promise made 'by the Prime Minister was not just that which the Country party desired. Though they did not say so defi-. nitely, they evidently require from the Government a promise that the Estimates will be presented to this House either on the 18th March, 19th March, 20th March, or 21st March, as the case may be. That would be an easy way out of the difficulty. Then why all this talk? The duty of the Government is clear. It has merely to name a date, and so save us from going back to our masters, the electors. I am indeed surprised that there should be so much mystery about the whole thing. It now appears that the bomb which was carefully prepared, primed, and set alight by the Leader of the Country party, means nothing. .We are assured by the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Country party that it l s not the intention or the desire of the party to harass the Government in any way whatever. If so, what is the meaning of it all? Many of us on this side of the House have important engagements to help the Labour party in New South Wales, and we are kept here merely to hear the juggling of compliments between the Country party and the National Government.",48
165,Mr STEWART,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"'Some of us have engagements in New South Wales, too.",49
166,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Then why not have a yarn with the Prime Minister and decide the date on which the Estimates shall be' brought down? It is only, apparently, that these gentlemen do not understand one another. There is no desire on the part of the Country party to harass the Prime Minister and his Government. If the Prime Minister, even at this stage, said, "" I will give you the Estimates in one month's time,"" the Leader and members of the Country party would be evidently only too pleased to say, ""Very well; we shail withdraw our motion.""",49
167,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We want a good deal more than that. We want a complete statement,49
168,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I can only go by what the honourable member and his Deputy Leader said. Both those gentlemen made it unmistakably clear that if the Prime Minister wouldfixa date on which the Estimates would be brought down, the motion, which we are assured means nothing, would not be pTessed.",49
169,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I never mentioned that. I do not take thie_ slightest interest in discussing Estimates when the money has been practically spent. MT. BLAKELEY - Then what is the honourable member taking this course for? We are, apparently, eliciting a little more information. It appears as though another factor has disappeared or come up, and that it is not so much now a question of the Estimates for the current financial year. Well, what Estimates does it concern? If the Prime Minister were to say that the Estimates for the coming financial year we're to be 268 Supply Bill placed upon the table b'y July next, would that satisfy the Country party? Apparently it would. I would not say that the Country party are not honest regarding tiris question, but I would say that at least they are not in earnest, if that which they have moved means nothing. have assured us that it does mean notching.",49
170,Mr STEWART,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,That is only your in terpretatiou of it .,50
171,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I have heard the honourable member's Leader and Deputy Leader crying aloud for some word to be given them in order that they may be removed from the position in which they find themselves.,50
172,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The honourable member is quite wrong.,50
173,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"That I am quite right is proved by the fact that when the Country party had an opportunity of protesting against the shipping scandals, against the w i l f u l waste of the money of this country, when ieompianies, .started with practically no eapital, were subsidized by the Governrnenit by being given a credit in the Commonwealth Bank, in order that they could obtain timber to get their dockyards fixed up andV their slips erected, so that they should not be embarrassed in dealing with 'the timber merchants, and should be enabled to pay their wages-whe n all this was done by an overdraft created for such companies by the Commonwealth Government, that party refused to take the opportunity. ""When the Labour party moved a motion of no-confidence in the Government for the way in which they had carried out matters appertaining to shipping, the honourable member and the party who f o l low him had an opportunity of protesting in a practical manner by voting with us against the Government. doing so, they voted with the Government. They refused to take a practical opportunity of voicing their objections to the way in which the shipping of this country has been managed, and now at a later stage their Leader, evidently with the concurrence and approval of his followers, attacks the same Government for the way in which the shipping business has been handled. In the circumstances, we are justified in questioning their earnestness. What does it all mean? I do not pretend to know much [ REPRESENTATIVES . ] (No. 4) 19.TSM20. about parliamentary procedure, 'because I have been here quite a short time, but to me it is astounding that the Leader and Deputy Leader of a party, and the party itself, should on one occasion vote with the Government They when a no-confidence motion dealing with a specific case had been launched against them, and then at a later stage bring up exactly the same thing as one of the reasons why the House should have no confidence im the same Government. A f t e r all, why should there be any anxiety? I do not think the Prime Minister or his followers are much perturbed. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) never looked more complacent than he does at present. He is not at all worried, nor are his f o llowers worried about this motion. Why should they be? They know perfectly well that it means nothing. Only last week the Leader of the Country party said that it would be no f a u l t of the Country party if the Government were not defeated. He has cooled off considerably since that time. He has no desire to defeat the Government today. Even if the whole of the Country party voted against the Government, the Government would not be in danger. If the Government were subject to the slightest danger, if there was the slightest cause for uneasiness, I venture to say that some of the Country party would either stay conveniently away or become sick.",50
174,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,You know that is not true.,50
175,Mr BLAKELEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I am talking frankly to the Country party as a friend. I am supporting them. I wish they were more in earnest on this matter. I could wish that they were as much in earnest as I am. The Government apparently will be saved by a successful coalition Instead of with one man, who was with us. but who.has now departed. I can see the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) peering into those pools around which frogs disport, and looking eagerly for what is going to happen to the Government. I can see the Prime Minister at last leading the gentleman from Capricornia into the promised land, and no doubt he will be far better there. I have no doubt that an arrangement will be come to whereby the consciences of both will be, to a certain extent, salved. I listened with a good deal of interest to the speech made by the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) . s'prry indeed that the Treasurer's health is such as to necessitate a long sea voyage. I have no objection him going for a sea voyage, because I believe that of all the members of the National Government he has probably worked the hardest and had the greatest strain placed upon him. I do not object to the honourable gentleman taking a holiday at the expense of the people of Australia, but I do objectto the unnecessary camouflage in connection with his proposed trip. The financial crisis which was announced last week, as though it had struck the country suddenly, has been known to the Government and most honourable members to be approaching for quite a long time, yet the Prime Minister has seen fit to announce that there is only one man in this country who can save the Commonwealth from financial perdition; that Mr W at t alone possesses the suavity and other qualifications essential to dealing successfully with British financiers, and. that h "" must proceed to London at once to prevent the Imperial. Government from putting in the bailiffs upon us. The Treasurer this afternoon stated that it is the intention of the Government to appoint a Commission to deal with the ad ministration of the Post and Telegraph Department. I desire an elaboration of that, statement, so that we may know exactly what is to be done. Is the dream of the late Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) coming true, and is he to be the Chief Commissioner, or one of the Postal Commissioners ? A re we going to place the Post and Telegraph Department under business control, which he said should be done? Personally, I do not think that those living in country districts would get better treatment from a Postal Commission than they got from the late Postmaster-General. Telegraphic and telephonic communications have been reduced, mail services have been diminished, country post-offices have been starved or done away with, official post-offices have been degraded to the rank of non-official post-offices, so that those who li\je in the country and those who represent country electorates have today nothing but condemnation for the administration of the Department of the Postmaster General. City constituencies have not suffered in the same way, because of the I am great political pull that they possess. The remedy for the present state of things is easy, at least in this Parliament. The to Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) has told a deputation that his policy in regard to telegraph and telephone services will differ from that of his predecessor, but he will have practically to revolutionize his De partment if he is going to improve the position pf those who live in the country. According to the latest report of the Postmaster-General'sDepartment, which was ordered to be printed on the 23rd July last, there was, in 1917-18, in New South Wales, one official post-office opened, and seven were closed, the total number of official offices in the State thus being reduced that year by six. No semi-official offices were opened, but eight were closed; forty-three allowance offices were opened, aud. thirty-eight were closed. Those figures show the extent to which retrenchment has been carried in the Department, although there should have been no cutting down of mail services and electric communications. No true economy is made by reducing telephone, telegraph, and mail facilities in country districts. But I question altogether the earnestness of the Country party, and I am very sorry that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) is to help the party to a way out. I may be wrong, but if the action of the honourable member in voting with the Government last week is an indication of what he intends to do in connection with the amendment, my guess will be a correct one. In my opinion, nothing will happen to the Government at the hands of the Country party, and I base that opinion on the conduct of its members last week, when an opportunity was afforded to them of defeating the Government. Sittiny suspended from. 6.3S to 7.J/.5 p.m. Mi'. PROWSE (Suaii) [7.45] - In rising to speak to the amendment, I desire, at the outset, to point out that the object of the Country party in submitting it is not so much to criticise the past 0 deeds of the Government as to insure an immediate return to parliamentary responsibility. I appreciate the point made by '- the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) when he said that, good, bad, OT indifferent, more Nationalists had been returned to this Parliament by the electors than members of any other party, o and that this justified their occupancy of the Treasury bench. I do not know whether it is information to the extreme Opposition, or the so-called Labour party, but we felt that if we voted with them on the censure motion, we should be displaying, not only a want of confidence in the Government, but a want of confidence in the electors of Australia.",50
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"And in yourselves.  displayed a want of efficiency by voting in that way. In referring to the Opposition, I used the words "" so-called Labour party"" advisedly. Honourable members of the Opposition have presumed to refer to us as the ""so-called"" Country party, and, picking out one or two of our members, have questioned whether we are.all wheat-growers. I do not know that honourable members of the Labour party are all labourers. Several honourable members interjecting.",52
177,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE," I must again direct the attention'of honourable members to the fact that all interjections are disorderly, and also remind them of the time-honoured custom to hear in silence the first speech made in this House by an honourable member. MT. FIINTON - This is not his first speech.",52
178,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The practice is well known, and I ask honourable members to cease interjecting.  mitting this aniendment is to carry out, as - far as we can, a pledge that we gave the electors at the last general election, and which we believe was made by every honourable member on both sides of the House. The war is over. Certain things had to be done during the war, and undoubtedly, mistakes were made. would, indeed, have been marvellous if mistakes had not been made during the war in the administration of the 'affairs of the Commonwealth, having regard to the tremendous volume of additional work with which Ministers had to deal. Even the mistakes made in connection with the shipbuilding contracts might have been made by any one; but it does seem that certain inexcusable neglect was shown in connection with those contracts. The shipping items in the Commonwealth balance-sheet-thos e relating to credit and. debit-loo k all'right; but the whole business of the country is appalling. We were warned this afternoon by the Treasurer (Mr Watt) to keep the credit of Australia above suspicion and without tarnish. It is because of such a desireon our part that the amendment has been submitted. The - Treasurer's statement revealed the fact that there is an item of £90,000,000 that we owe the British Government. I do not know how much of that has to be added to the £700,000,000which this country has already borrowed.",52
179,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It is all included.  consolation; but not one pound should be spent unnecessarily by thisj orany other Government, while such a tremendous debt lies upon our shoulders. I fail to understand why the Prime Minister is not prepared to accept a reasonable proposition. We are not proposing to reduce Supply by a farthing. It may be said that, in a - parliamentary sense, we are proposing that it should be reduced by one half; but what we are really urging is that the period in respect 'of which Supply is sought shall be reduced by one half, in order to give the House an opportunity to consider the Estimates, and. so to fulfil the promise made by every one of us to our electors. That is the position in a nutshell. There may be technicalities of parliamentary usage which the learned members of the House may be able to explain; but, with due regard to the interests of the Commonwealth, I do not think that any one should be so thin-skinned as to be unprepared to give the House an opportunity to fulfil its pledges to the people. We refused to vote to turn the Government out of office immediately after the people of Australia had said to them, It ""You go in."" But I am certain that the people did not say to the Government, "" Continue to »spend and to squander a» you have been doing."" That is' the point with which we are concerned. The people did not say to them, "" Continue to squander, as the Economies Commission: says you have been doing."" Our desire is that there shall be no further squandering of public moneys. . That is-the-point o for which we are contending, and for which we must contend. The Prime Minister has given certain indications of what is to be done. Two important measures-on e providing for the war gratuity, and the other relating to repatriationare to be passed before we deal with the Estimates, and it seems to me that the consideration of those two measures will extend over the period in respect of which the Estimates have been drawn up.",52
180,Mr GROOM,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Not at all.  suggestion of the amendment is that six weeks' Supply be granted, and that in the meantime an opportunity be given Parliament to deal with the Estimates. If the House is prepared to go to the country on that issue, then the whole matter rests with the Government, and not with our party. It would appear that the Supply, amounting to over £5,000,000, which we are asked to grant on this occasion, is based on the ratio of previous expenditure. We already have evidence from the Economies Commission that the basis of expenditure was altogether extravagant. We feel, therefore, that some thousands of pounds might be saved by even a consideration of the Estimates at this juncture. We had no definite promise from the Government that they were going to - economize on the lines laid down by the Economies Commission, nor have we any definite date set down for the consideration of the Estimates by this House. If there are .those who think that the members of the Country party are willing to accept ""a pig in a bag ' those who have that estimate of them will find themselves altogether mistaken, because we feel that we, as representing very large sections of the electors of Australia, should have the assurances I have suggested. I do not propose to occupy more time. I merely desire to emphasize the points to which I have referred, and to show the difference between the vote of censure that was before the House some days ago and the amendment now under consideration, one being on a retrospective basis, while the other has in view the future, with which we are the more concerned. We in this corner realise, with every one in the House, or professedly - so, that' np expenditure of any magnitude should be entered into without the consent of Parliament.",53
181,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Dalley) [7.57] - I do not propose to address myself to the question at any great length. The members of the Country party are laying down a very good principle, which should be followed by all Governments, namely, that the Estimates should be laid before the House in reasonable time, so as to afford every member a fair opportunity to discuss generally the financial position of the country. During the last years of the war we have been prone to allow things to drift, and, in view of the great general danger, to allow the Government to exercise practically a free hand, without being too carping in our criticism. But, as rightly pointed out by representatives of the Country party, the war is over; and now is surely the time to start to put our house in order. Surely the Government do not intend to go on with the reckless spending of money, showing an Utter disregard of the opinions of honourable members. Hitherto, after the money has heen spent, the Government have thrown the Estimates on the table, and, in effect, informed honourable members that, although what they complained of was probably wrong, all had been done under stress of circumstances, and matters could not be altered. As I say, I believe the Country party are enunciating a sound principle; and if the effect is that the Government are forced to introduce the Estimates in time to afford ample opportunity for their discussion, some good will result to the country 5 generally. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), the Leader of the Country party, referred to the wooden shipbuilding contracts; and I am, indeed, pleased that at last he and the members of his party have ""seen the light"" in .this matter. Twelve months ago, from this side of the chamber, I pointed out very much what the honourable member for Franklin has pointed out today in reference to these contracts; but no notice was taken of my remarks. I warned the Government, and honourable members generally, of the reckless, wilful waste of public money in persisting with these so'called contracts; and there is certainly grounds for the most searching inquiry into the whole of the circumstances. The Wallace Power Boat Cpmpainy is a firm of ""men of straw "" as is well knowni n eom r mereial circles in Sydney. The firm, However;, wasgiven, a contract involving a huge sum* of money, and this contract they were unable, to carry out. I should explain first, that at length the Government realized that this firm consisted of ""men of straw,""' and. had to come to its rescue by guaranteeing it at the bank. Mr WATKINS. - Did thisfirm have a shipyard?.",53
182,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"They had no shipyard, but only a little yard for repairing motor boats. The firm, as I say, had no financial standing at all, and the Government had to come to its rescue; whereupon the firm went on with the contract, knowing, that they were on a ""good wicket."" Owing: to the faulty way in whichi the contracts were drawn, and to the faulty administration of the shipbuilding construction branch of the Shipping Department, and owing, further, to the alteration of the design of the ships, it became evident that the vessel they were building would be utterly unfitted for any sea-going, trade at all; and, ultimately,, the Government found itself in such a position that they had to cancel the contract. These transactions ought to. be thoroughly investigated by a Select Committee of the House>. and I hope the Couniliry party will support a proposal for the appointment o£ such a body. Let me point out a littledetail in connection with the contracts-. The first design was for an ordinary-big well-deck, but an alteration was made: in the design providing for 'tween decks; and anybody who is at all acquainted with shipping matters knows that immediately 'tween decks are provided for. the vessel is utterly, uselessas a cargo boat,, especially for. the class of cargo which these ships would have had to carry to render any service to the people of Australia. There were several alterations which rendered the position ridiculous, and. as I say, the result was that the Government, in order to "" save its face,"" had to cancel, the contract. This firm, which had no financial backing, and had to be guaranteed, were paid by the Government a sum of £55,000 ascompensation for the cancellation of the contract. Here, surely, is something that requires the most searching inquiry. It is no use the. Prime Minister (Mr: Hughes) in his airy,, and probably very charming, manner, saying that the elec1 tors have approved of this cancellation. The people have not: approved of it ; because the people neverknew the details of it, and I doubt if they would tolerate it if they did..",54
183,Mr EXSFTON,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,It would be interesting to know the political colour of those people-.,54
184,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I am not, concerned with that, but I am concerned with the enormous loss in which the people have been involved owing to the faulty administration of the persons in charge of the ship construction department.",54
185,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Does the honourable gentleman know who was in charge of those works for the Government?,54
186,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"So far as I can gather, the arrangement was a sort of '-'go as you please.""",54
187,Mr WATKINS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Were there any shipbuilders among the contractors?"" Mr MAHONY!:-Prio r to accepting these contracts, the Wallace Power Boat Company had not engaged in.sh.ip construction at all. I am devoting my attention particularly to this firm,, because I know more of the details of its contracts. The firms of Hughes-, Martin,, and Washington, and. Kidman and Mayoh, were paid sums of £72,500 and £52,000 respectively for the cancellation of their contracts. About the financial position of those two firms I will say nothing; but the Government ought to produce the whole of the papers and. letters from certain individuals, upon the basis of which the final terms of cancellation werearranged. Nothing short of an inquiry into this matter by a Committee of this House will satisfy the people. I may mention, as another instance of the utter incompetence of the persons in charge of the ship construction branch, that the contract speed of these other vessels was 4' miles per hour.. I know that to be a fact, because I have seen the contracts.. If a gale was blowing, a vessel having, aspeed of only 4 miles an hour would go backward faster than forward, yet these are the boats in regard to .which the Prime Minister told usthat if he were again in the same position as he was when these contracts were made, he would adopt the same course. The head of: a Government who-would allow a contrast to be made for the construction of sea-going boats having only that rate of speed does not know much about shipbuilding. I think I have said sufficient to warrant at least country. an inquiry into the matter. We need more information as to how it happened that firm which started with no capital reIsherwood ceived a payment of £55,000 for the cellation of a contract. I have a few words to say regarding adopted that type. the ships built in America.",54
188,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The sieves.,55
189,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The first of those vessels to arrive in Australia was the Cethana, which, after putting into various ports en route from America to have revessel, pairs effected, was dockeddn Sydney, and the preliminary overhaul after her maiden voyage involved an expenditure of over £6,000. The Government were supposed to be employing men in America to superbody vise the construction of these ships. answer to questions, I was told during the last Parliament that certain inditon viduals were receiving £500 per annum to supervise and examine the work. Yet every one of the boats arrived in Ausadopted tralia in a leaky condition. The boilers had to be removed, and the vessels comAmerican lakes. pletely refitted. Inquiry ought to be made as to the services for which we were ing men in America £500 per annum. It is time that honourable members told the Government distinctly that they upon knowing a little more about these matters.",55
190,Mr WATKINS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The bill for extras exceeded the contract price.,55
191,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Every one of the boats built in America cost thousands pounds for repairs after her maiden voyage. Not only that, but the original workmanship was so faulty that on the return voyage to America the vessels to put in at almost every second port a disabled condition in order to effect further repairs. In this way thousands of pounds of money was absolutely thrown away. The people ought to be told who was responsible for these blunders, and the ""Government should give a practical assurance that such things will not be allowed to occur again. All that we this side of the House can do is to give them our advice, and the benefit of whatour ever knowledge we possess, and if they are not prepared to accept it, the responthey sibility is theirs. We have at least the [12] satisfaction of knowing that we are making the people acquainted with the rottenness of the financial management of this The reasons for putting the Comnioua wealth to the expense of adopting the type of vessel is another matter canthat should bethoroughly investigated. No other Government in the world has",55
192,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Was the Dromana built on that design?,55
193,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Yes . Let me explain, for the benefit of new members, that the Isherwpod design is a new type of in which the framing is built on longitudinal instead of transverse lines. The firm that holds the rights of this patent does not engage in steel shipbuilding; it is merely the patentee, and anyadopting the Isherwood principle In has to pay the firm a royalty of 3s. 4d. per ton. That royalty was paid on every of shipping built in Australia. I repeat that no other Government, and no shipbuilding firm of any standing, has that type of construction, although it is in use for oil lighters on the The most damaging and sinister aspect of the whole matter paymay be perceived when' we know that experts who were imported from Great Britain, and who are receiving thousands insist of pound's per annum to manage the ship construction for the Commonwealth, adopted a standardized design. The blue prints for this design cost some thousands of ""pounds. Everything had been put into working order for the construction of of a ship fit to be built for or by any Government in the world. But the desism was rejected, and the Isherwood principle was accepted by the Australian had Government. I want to know why, and so in do the people. Another damaging fact is that the British Government, after consultation with the leading shipbuilding firms of Great Britain, adopted a standardized type of ship construction which was not based upon a longitudinal frame, such as is the Isherwood design. This officially adopted design would have been given to on us by the British Admiralty. Had the - Imperial authorities been impressed with requirements, and satisfied that we would have built ships upon that design, would have been only too ready to make it available to us, without requiring one penny by way of royalty. This whole matter should be thoroughly investigated; we have a right to know whether there is anything behind it . Who is responsible! I want to. know why Isherwood's manager should have been im ported from Great Britain , together with three or f o ur otheT officials employed by that firm, to take control of shipbuilding here. There may be nothing in the business ; but at the' least there is ground for inquiry.",55
194,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"How many thousands of tons of shipping have we built in Australia to date? Would it amount to about 60,000 tons?",56
195,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"R o u g h l y calculated, the 3s.. 4d. royalty per ton works out at about £500 per ship of the smaller type, such as we have been building. Mr MoWrxLiAMS - The amount is about £850 on a 5,000-ton boat.",56
196,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"That is so. It is a species of poll tax handed over to Isherwood and Company for doing nothing, or, at least, for doing only that which we could have done for ourselves by accepting a g if t from the British Admiralty. And in these times of financial stress every pound is a pound to the people of Australia. We do not wish to throw sums of £500 about recklessly.",56
197,Mr ATKINSON,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,A r e the ships of Isherwood type better than others?,56
198,Mr MAHONY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The r e are about a dozen different firms in Great Britain which advertise that they hold the patent rights of some particular design of construction, and which claim the same advantages for their type as do the Isherwood people for theirs. If the honourable member will look at the Shipping Gazette, ihe will see those advertisements for himself. But the British Government, after interviewing the authorities in the shipbuilding world, did hot adopt the Isherwood system. They decided in favour of the ordinary transverse method of standardized ship construction. That fact in itself should be sufficient, or enough, at any rate, to warrant a thorough inquiry. I hope the members of the Country party will support my effort to secure the appointment of a Committee to investigate the whole of the particulars surrounding, first, the cancellation of the wooden shipbuilding contracts in Australia and America.; and, secondly, the adoption of the Isherwood principle of steel ship construction in the Commonwealth. W it h regard to the sale of wool overseas, I propose to read an interesting in terview with Brigadier-General H . B . Lassetter, C.B., C.M.G., who has just returned from Great B r it a in . In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 9th March he relates that, after a full study of the f acts^ and figures available, he is convinced that the losses suffered by the Australian wool growers, through the (Federal Government's contracts with the British Government, are in the region of £60,000,000. I do not propose to quote the whole of the interview, but desire to emphasize that General Lassetter has made public certain views which call for a reply from the Government. The people of Australia should demand a reply. These are his remarksThe position with regard to the contracts made with the British Government does not seem to be understood by the. wool-growers. In October, 1916, the basis of wool was fixed at l,5id.; it was renewed in the middle of 1917 for another year, then extended in 1918 to cover clips for a year after the war. This has since been interpreted to mean all wool shorn up to June, 1920. For English and Scottish wool the initial .price was in 1914 advanced 55 per cent.; in 1917, 50 per cent.; and in 1919, 60 per cont. But in 1919 the English farmers asked for an 80 per cent, advance. After prolonged consideration, the the Government decided to abandon the purchase of the Home clip, and the wools have been sold, in the normal pre-war manner, through the country wool fairs. Prices realized showed an advance of from 100 to 200 per cent, on pre-war rates. The English and Scottish farmers were much too shrewd to hand over their wool to the Government. General Lassetter then addsWihat I complain about is that nobody in Australia seemed to protect the interests of the grazier. These are astounding facts to me. I am looking for information. Is it not remarkable that while we in Australia who produce this wool should lose £60,000,000, the English and Scottish farmers who are"" right on the spot and have a free sale for their wool at country fairs, can obtain an increase of 200 per cent, for their wool, without any talk of having to share their profits with the British Government ? If it is good enough for the English and Scottish farmers to get a full return for their product, surely it ought to be' good enough for the Australian pastoralist to do likewise? If there is any explanation of the facts put forward by Brigadier-General Lassetter, let some member of the Cabinet make it . During the war if one dared to say a word about lift in g the Poolhe was accused of working hand in hand with Germany.",56
199,The CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE, The honourable member's time has expired.,57
200,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"(Robertson) [8.27] The position in which the Committee finds itself seems to me rather unusual, and I want briefly to try to analyze it in quite a moderate way in an endeavour to show, particularly my friends who sit in the Corner, what would be the result of carrying their amendment, and the attitude of the Government towards the producing interests of Australia. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has dealt at some length with the question of wool, and it is really very amusing to hear him upholding the -"" poor downtrodden pastoralist."" Among things, he told us that he stood for the producers getting the full return for their product."" Where does the poor consumer come in of whom we hear so much from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) ? At one time we hear that the consumer is being robbed by the primary producers.",57
201,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,You have never heard me say so.,57
202,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I have heard the honourable member say on many occasions that the consumer was being placed at the mercy of the producer.,57
203,Mr TUDOR,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I said that he was at the mercy of the middleman. Mr FLEMING . - If the Leader of the Opposition says that he has not made that remark, I do not wish to pin it on to him unfairly, but we hear itsaid constantly by honourable members of the Opposition that the consuiner is paying too much for the articles he purchases, and that the primary producer has been getting more than a fair return. Now, honourable members opposite claim that the primary producer should get the full value for his product. Although, as it were, we have come back to this House with the sins of the past wiped' out, this debate has been merely a recapitulation of what are supposed to have been the misdeeds of the Government during the last Parliament. Considerable attention has been devoted to the question of shipbuilding, but every [12]-2 . - honourable member knows that the contracts for shipbuilding were entered into under the stress of war, and every honourable member also knows, or should know, that every civilized country in the WOTICI entered into contracts during the war which it would have 'been glad to get out of after the war was over. America lost very much more on its shipbuilding contracts than Australia did. Australia no more than any other country could foresee that the war was going to end, and the Government took the wise precaution of preparing for the worse. Ha d the war continued a year or two we would have heard the ship-building contract and many other tilings now condemned lauded to the skies as the height of statesmanship. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said, very properly, that no man could see through the veil at that time; and whatever Government was in power would have been recreant to its trust and false other to its position if it had not put in hand the contracts necessary to enable this country to keep going and send its produce to those other countries which came perilously close to the verge of starvation. The country would not have been able to see its way out of the financial position brought about as a result of the war had it not been for these contracts having made it possible to realise on our products. We heard ' from the Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams) a great deal about the Post and' Telegraph Department.",57
204,Mr NICHOLLS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,You are a country member..,57
205,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"My political interests are just as truly country interests as are those of honourable members sitting in the corner. The same vote returned me as returned them. There are some honourable members who were returned on the double nomination. I informed my constituents that I was bound only by what I told them on the platform, and that I was not bound to any party in this House, and never would be. I told them that all they could hold me to was what I told them on the platform, and what I interpreted for them myself. I said that I would not be bound by what other mensaid. Honourable members, if they care to do so, can see the newspapers' comments upon my attitude in that regard. I made my position perfectly clear. Although I had the nomination of both parties, I held myself free to support whatever party I considered best in the interests of Australia, and I wish briefly to show why I consider the National party is the best in the interests of Australia at the present time.",57
206,Mr NICHOLLS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The honourable member will not get the nomination of both ' parties again.,58
207,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I have come here, as I went into the State Parliament of New South Wales, pledged only to what I told my constituents. I am in no way bound by any other pledge, or any other man's statements; and so long as I occupy a seat in this House it will be on those grounds. If the people of my electorate decide that it is not satisfactory to them to have a man here to act according to his own conscience, they will find some other representative. We heard a good deal from the Leader of the Country party concerning the condition of the Post Office; but I do not think the honourable member was quite fair in his comments, because, although I doubt whether he meant it , the interpretation one could put on his remarks was that the losses in connection with the Post .and Telegraph Department had occurred in the cities, whereas, as a matter of fact, they have occurred just as much, if not more, in country districts. The loss on the telephones in cities has. certainly been heavy, but the telephonic and postal losses throughout country districts have also been heavy, and every honourable member knows that the new Postmaster General (Mr Wise) is prepared to conduct his Department on a much more liberal scale than that adopted by his predecessor. Already there have been two deputations to him within a few days, and in both cases he has stated that he proposes to liberalize the position of country people to a great extent. will not do so before it is needed, and many honourable members behind the Government feel as strongly on the matter as do the members of the Country party.",58
208,Mr HILL,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"They will continue ing, too.",58
209,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"-They will continue acting long after many members of the Country party have ceased to be members of this House. There are two good reasons why every honest man from a country constituency who is not pledged to the policy of the Opposition should support the present Government. What was it that we pledged ourselves to support before anything else during the recent campaign? Every candidate pledged himself to keep f a it h with the promise made to the returned soldiers. There is not a member on this side of the House, whether a supporter of the Nationalists or one who occupies a seat on the cross-corner benches, who did not say definitely that the first thing to be done when the new House met would be to pass the Soldiers Gratuity Bill . The Government have told us that the very first measure to be submitted is one to give effect to that promise. I know honourable members opposite are not very much concerned as to whether that promise is fulfilled , but the members of the Country party are rendering it difficult for the Government to carry out their pledges. The Government have also undertaken to amend the Repatriation Act. Every honourable member, whether representing a country or city constituency, knows perfectly well that our present repatriation scheme needs recasting, owing to altered conditions. Many returned soldiers are experiencing difficulties in various forms, and the Government intend meeting them by amending the Act. Could anything be fairer? The honourable member for F r a n k l in (Mr MCWtilliams) referred to the question of taxation, and the members of the Country party have definitely stated that the Government should do something to , remove the present difficulties experienced by taxpayers who are now compelled to submit returns to both Federal and State authorities. Hay,e not the Government promised to overcome these difficulties by He introducing an amending measure during the coming session?",58
210,Mr STEWART,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The Government do not always carry out their pledges.,58
211,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Honourable members feelbehind the Government have been ver turned by a majority of the people, and the items contained in the Government programme cannot possibly be objected to by any member of the Country party. The Government are in a position to carry out their promises to the electors only if they have the numbers behind them. Why should the Soldiers Gratuity Bill, the Repatriation Bill, and au amending taxation measure be hampered by the Country party? Why this danger or assumed danger with which the Government are faced? Why not allow them to go on in the even tenor of their way? I do not think there are many honourable members who doubt for one moment that the Government can retain the support of a majority of the House. Many honourable members criticising and opposing the Government would regret their action in the event of an adverse vote being recorded. It is also the intention of the Government to encourage immigration. Is there any member of the Country party, or a reasonable-minded man on the Opposition side of the House, who is opposed to immigration on a satisfactory basis? I think that it is generally recognised that the only way to hold this country for white men is by adopting a sound immigration policy and by, increasing production. Frequent reference has been made during the debate to the Pools controlled by the Government - during the war period. Every honourable member knows that the Government entered the commercial arena during the stress of war, and a majority of honourable members supported them in that connection. It has now been definitely stated by the Prime Minister that it is the intention of the Government to allow primary products to flow in their usual channels, and many of us now supporting the Government would withdraw our support if that promise were not fulfilled. The Government have already released control of some commodities, and are doing all that is humanly possible to allow primary products to be handled as in pre-war times. What more can we expect from a Government when they have already commenced honouring the pledges given to the electors? more can the Country party expect?",58
212,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We ask for the Estimates; that is all.,59
213,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The Government have offered to deal with the Estimates in a constitutional way. We know that during the war period it was frequently necessary to follow an unusual course, and it is time this wearying criticism, which is being indulged in just as it was twelve months ago, ceased. The same old sins are being resurrected. It is time Australia opened her eyes and commenced to face the changed conditions, as is being done by other countries. The whole world is crying out for our products, and as a producing country we are perhaps more favourably situated than any with the exception of America. The Government have submitted a reasonable programme.",59
214,Mr STEWART,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,It is absolute perfection.,59
215,Mr FLEMING,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It is not perfection; but the honourable member, who, I believe, has had experience in the State Parliament before he was elected to this House, must realise that it is a good programme. Every honourable member, whether a supporter of the Nationalists or of the Country party,' knows that the Government pledged themselves to fittingly reward the returned men at the very earliest opportunity, and the very first Bill, of which notice of introduction has been given, is one to give effect to that promise. And then we have all this captious criticism from members of the Country party concerning the Wheat and Wool Pools, which have been administered by men who think just as much as they do of the position of the producer in the country. I admit that mistakes have been made, but now we have a Government, prepared to carry out their pledges, bringing down a programme which, to my mind, wiill und-bubitedly make for the prosperity of the country interests. Notwithstanding this, the first serious challenge that they get comes from those who should support them. It is time Australia woke up to the gravity of her position. We are facing new conditions, and must give the Government a fair chance of settling down to work. I am convinced that the great majority of members have been What sent into this House by their constituents in the belief that they would give this Government a chance. In national . affairs we cannot very well have a purely Country party, because the issues are too great, and the outlook too large. This is not like a State Parliament. We have to regulate our affairs and shape our policy in keeping with the outside world. Just as in the case of an individual, no country can live to itself. We have to pay resatisfaction, gard to the broader issues of world affairs. I hope, therefore, that this liament will rise to the occasion and the Government a reasonable chance carry out what appears to me to be an excellent programme, fulfilling all pledges made to the men who have done so much for Australia.",59
216,Mr CUNNINGHAM,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Gwydir) [8.48]. - The amendment before the Committee threatens to cause considerable uneasidebt ness in the ranks of the Government, indeed, among members of the Country party. They got into power by denouncwe ing the Government, and so it is what hard to realise the change of front that has taken place since last week. one looks up the speeches which members of the Country party delivered in constituencies during . the election, will find that they condemned the Gotain vernment administration of the various Pools, but when they have an opportunity to give effect to their dissatisfaction vote in this House, we shall, no doubt, find them solidly behind the Government in order, as the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) has just said, that Ministers may go on the "" even tenor of their way."" 'For my part, I can only hope the "" even tenor of their way "" will who not be in the direction of continuing grind the country interests in the future as in the past. I can speak with full knowledge as a small producer of the. dition of affairs from which we have suffered during the past few years the administration of theNational Government. The honourable member for Robertson of spoke just now of the "" captious "" criticism i of the administration of the Wheat and Wool Pools. I am afraid his remarks will not be very acceptable to the people his electorate, for no man representing country constituency can say that the primary producers have received deal from this Administration during past three years. We are now carrying a financial burden, in the shape of public debt, that is variously estimated from £725,000,000 to £800,000,000. can get no definite information from Government as to the exact amount, electors sent me here as a protest against the Government and the administration of the Postal Department. There is disorder not only amongst the people, but amongst the employees of that great ParDepartment. We cannot get any defigive nite information of the various contracts to that have been madej as the Government refuse to lay them on the table in order those that they may be investigated - and we may learn whether our interests' have been safeguarded or not. Can any man say that the position is good when 1 we do not know to withdni £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 how much our national is] While we have been piling upand, our war debt we have not been receiving war prices for our primary products, and have not yet started to pay our war somedebt. Here we are, with a population of 5,000,000 people, carrying a burden If £300,000,000 greater than was the national debt of Great Britain prior to the their war. And we must not forget that in one the proportion of population, Great Brihad nine pairs of hands to every pair of hands in Australia. Moreover, the MotherCountry is highly developed, by a and prior to the war was receiving £400,000,000 annually from foreign investments, whereas Australia is a borrowing country, and .must send millions of pounds' worth of primary products, overseas in order to maintain her balance of trade. We are in the position of a man has increased the mortgage on his property ""from £3,500 to over £9,000, to with the result that he has to carry more than three times his former financial burden. And now we are told that we must conproduce more in order to meet our heavier obligations. But what encouragement is under given our farmers to produce more? In the seasons 1915 to 1918 we grew more Australia.wheat than ever before in the history What became if it ? To-day, when we are on the verge of a wheat famine, we have to realise that our wheat grown during the war period was sold for in less than it was worth in the markets of a the world. Thus, confidence has been destroyed in the breasts of the primary proa fair ducers that they are going to get the a square deal from the Government. This condition of affairs is causing concern to our everybody who cares to think ' of the at future-sinc e all wealth comes from We the land-becaus e the small men are not the prepared to carry on. Speaking as one of and them, I say we cannot go on. We have thousands of pounds locked up in property and plant, and are unable to finance into cultivate, this year, for next season's crop. Honourable members must bear in mind that farmers cannot grow wheat in five minutes. Unless we can be sure of better treatment at the hands of the Government, the cost of living must inevitably rise still higher. cannot get away from the logical sequence of events. If we oannot produce what we require in our own country, we shall have to import at high prices) and so the cost of living must mount still higher. The farmers must get better treatment than they have had during the last three years. The fact that in New South Wale3, the mother State of the Commonwealth, the representation of Labour in country districts has been increased to fourteen in twenty-seven, points to the necessity of wiping out the Government which is responsible for the bad condition of affairs that exists here today. Unless we can obtain. redress I very much fear that the bailiff with whom we are threatened from Great Britain, and whom the Treasurer (Mr Watt) is being sent to London to placate, will make hasappearance in Australia, with disastrous results to all concerned. Whether we can weather the financial storm is a matter for the future consideration of the Ministry. I hope that they will do all that they can to insure that the primary producers shall get a squarer deal in the future than we have received in the past.' The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said that our wool-growers are to receive 50 per cent, of the excess profits on sale of our wool by Great Britain. Upon the other hand, it is alleged that only a series of cables passed between the Commonwealth authorities and the Imperial Government in regard to the so called wool contract, and it is significant that the Government are not prepared to lay that contract upon the table of this Ho.u3e. It is further alleged 'that only 50 per cent, of the excess profits upon the re-sales of wool to countries outside Great Britain and her Allies are to come back to Australia. If that statement be correct, it means that our wool-growers will not receive any excess profits whatsoever, because - no Australian wool has been sold outside of the allied countries. It is unfair to ask our wool-growers to give their wool away for less than it is worth, seeing that it has not been sold to the Governments of allied countries, but to private individuals. Consequently the people of those countries will not reap the advantage of our sacrifices, but private We individuals in the persons of woollen manufacturers there will gain materially.",60
217,Mr GREGORY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member's statement about the wool contract is not correct. Mr iCUNMINGHAM - Then , why is that contract not laid on the table of 'the House in order that the fullest publicity may be given to it? There are members of the Ministry who have never seen it. Our primary producers are having their goods disposed of under the contract, and in such circumstances why should its provisions be kept dark? Apparently the dictatorship which has existed during the past four years has blinded Ministers to the fact that the wool is not 'theirs, but that of primary producers in Australia who have a right to know the conditions under which it is being disposed ""of. I venture to say that if the terms of the wool contract had been made clear to the people prior to the recent elections the Government would not have been again returned to office. A similar remark is applicable to the sale of our wheat. Concerning the Commonwealth line of steamers, I was under the impression that they had been purchased in order to keep down freights. But I now find that those vessels have charged the same freights as have been charged by privately-owned shipping lines. In the reother words, they have been used to bolster up high freights. There are certain other primary products in Tegard to which we have been penalized by the unintelligent action of the Government. Take the case .of rabbit skins as an example. It is common property that in connection with the sale of these skins a policy of "" keep it dark "" has been observed. An embargo had been placed on the export of rabbit skins for the purpose of allowing manufacturers to hoard stocks, and thus make enormous profits when the embargo was lifted. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) has stated that this embargo has now been lifted, but that - the Government intend to reimpose it in May next. By reimposing it at theperiod suggested, they will hit a big body of workers in this country very hard indeed, because the latter will be prevented from getting the higher prices for the skins that they otherwise would get. Rabbits are on the in crease in Australia, and it costs our primary producers hundreds of thousands of pounds annually, to keep them in check. ""We were getting r i d of them, and large numbers of men were being provided with employment owing to the sales of rabbit skins. But when the Government placed an embargo upon their export, hundreds of men knocked off trapping, because they were not prepared to be crucified by the middle-men here who were being protected. This unintelligent interference part of the Government has had disastrous effects upon the producers. only mention, in this connection, the Ministerial action in fixing the price of meat. I will give my own experience as an illustration. The margin between and a living on a small area of land is a very narrow one indeed. As a small primary producer I have never that the payment of wages was likely to break me; but I do know that the excessively high prices exacted by the Government have been responsible for placing many producers in a position of financial embarrassment. The action of the Government in fixing the price of meat was responsible for a drop of £2 10s. per head in thecase of store stock that we had purchased for £12 10s. per head; and I know one station owner who lost 1,100 head of stock as the result of the action of the Government in fixing prices at that particular time of the year. As the wage earner has only his labour to sell, and is not able to make provision for a rainy day, discontent must manifest amongst the workers, hecause the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician that, although we have spent sums upon war activities, the deposits in our banks have increased very considerably during the war period. The Government are not prepared to tax those who have large bank balances, and naturally, with the increased cost of living, and the higher burden of taxation which has to be borne by the small men, discontent is increasing, whilst constant strikes are a source of loss to both sides. The Labour party do not stand for strikes, but for a Mr Cunningham. policy of arbitration. Every day that capital and labour are at strife with each other, national loss is incurred which we cannot afford. No small p r i mary producer can ever say that wages are likely to break him, because he does not employ sufficient men to produce that result. I have purchased bags at 18s. per dozen, although those bags had cost the National Government only 9s. 5d. per dozen. They refused to sell to the farmers' representatives, and sold the bags over their heads to the middlemen of Sussex-street, Sydney, and the middlemen of other States. Many other instances of a similar nature could be quoted. Under the National Government the Necessary on the Commodities Commission fixed the price of chaff bags at 8s. a dozen, but at the I need same time refused to commandeer supplies, although that is the logical outcome of price-fixing. If you fix prices you must be prepared to commandeer supplies poverty at that price. We could not get supplies. Stocks were held up, with the result that men had to pay 14s. a dozen for found second-hand bags that were net worth 4s. 6d. to put their chaff into to save their stock. Y e t gentlemen in the Corner party endorsed the action of the Government last week by voting for them. Never was there such a right-about-face as has been displayed by that party in their actions during the past two weeks. The outlook for the whole of the people of Australia is not bright. If we on the land are not doing any good, no other section of the community is doing any good. Y o u may continue to do as has been done in the past; mortgage your country year by year in order to provide employment, but an end must come itself to that sort of thing, as is shown by the insistent demand from Great Britain toprove day that we shall meet our obligations, enormous whether they amount to £8,000,000, or £48,000,000, or £90,000,000. The man is calling today for his money, and we have the spectacle of the Treasurer himself being sent to England in order to placate those who desire to be paid, in spite of the fact that we keep Australia House in London at a total cost of £100,000 per year. We have to face the position, and we must carry our burden of debt. We do not know what we are going to receive from the Wheat Pools or the Wool Pool. No man can say today what he is to get for his 1915-16 scrip. One man the other day offered 8,000 bushels of it for £ 5 at Glen Innes, and could not get a buyer. Why do not the Government finalize the Pools so that we may be able to see where we stand and know definitely whether or not it will be possible for us to carry on as we have been doing, or whether we shall have to finance in other directions? I would particularly urge the Government, if they remain in office, to see at once that liberal advances are made to small primary producers, wherever they are situated in Australia, in order that the millions of pounds of capital which they have invested in land and plant may not be allowed to remain idle, simply and solely because they are not in a position to put it into working order to grow wheat for Australia during the next twelve months. It costs us today practically 30s. an acre to sow wheat, and nearly 10s. per bushel to land seed wheat on our farms, notwithstanding that millions of bushels have been sold by the Prime Minister at fro m 4s. 4d. to 4s. 6d. in the last (three years. The Government say they have had no power to deal with profiteering. Could any greater power be held by any Government than was held by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who could take my wheat and go to Great Britain and sell it for whatever he thought it was worth ? Yet he could not compel the man who was selling bags, twine, oil, or machinery to me to charge fair and reasonable prices. So when the representatives of the Country party, as they are called, in the Corner, say that they are out to do the fair, thing by the man on the land, I say to them, "" Use your influence and your votes to see that men on the land do not have to pay the excessive prices that are charged today."" We have to pay £ 6 0 for a binder of which the sworn value coming into Australia is £ 1 7 10s.",61
218,Mr GIBSON,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We have to pay £ 8 5 .,63
219,Mr CUNNINGHAM,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I have not had enough money to buy one for the last twelve months, and for all I know they may he up to £85, or even £100 Whatever the price is, we have received - no protection from the Government in that direction. Plough-shares, which used to cost 6s. 6d., are now 18s., although there is only 6 lbs. of steel in each ploughshare. In the face of facts like this, can any one say that there is no profiteering? The reason why Labour gained seats in New South Wales in the primary-producing districts was the dissatisfaction felt by men' on the land with their treatment at the hands of the National Government. We are here to do all we can to see that redress is given to the people in the country districts, in order not only that the country districts themselves may be saved, but that the people of Australia may be saved in the years ahead of us, when we shall have to carry this enormous burden of debt. Unless something is done, the confidence of the primary producers that they would receive a fair deal will not be restored. They had that confidence u n t i l the National Government took over the administration. Unless it is restored, all the other legislation that the Government may carry will be futile, because they will have destroyed the source of wealth, and the only alternative will be to continue to borrow. That cannot be done for any extended period, since Great B r it a in today has practically hung up the sign, "" No more money available here,"" and is already demanding that we shall meet our obligations, however great they are. The position is very serious for every man in the community, and requires the earnest and sympathetic consideration of the Government. I hope that the Administration that has proved so disastrous during the past three years will be changed, and that the incidence of taxation will be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it-thos e who have reaped enormous profits through Australia being at war.",63
220,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Melbourne) [9.12] I am sure that every honourable member who listened to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr. Cunningham) will agree that he knows his subject, and has made a good i m pression in his first speech in the House. I speak as one who tried to be a farmer forty-seven years ago, and whom a kind Victoria n Government sent - a poor, miserable little bank clerk-to take up land 10 miles south of Warragul, among the big trees of Gippsland. In those days we put our hut on the division line, so that one could sleep on one block and one on the other. From our hut I counted twenty-five trees over 8 feet in diameter on a single acre. I man who has been >a farmer what earthly chance I had there. I certainly developed a big chest through swinging the axe, it would have been better had t i e torian Government sent me to Pentridge, if they had given me books to study, to send me up there. However, from time. I have always had sympathy f o jn&n on the land. Wherever I spoke i Victoria I said, "" If you have not a would have laughed. Labour man to vote for, vote for a man who lives among you, and Was, is working on the land."" I , therefore, welcome the Country party to the House. There is a new party on the opposite side of the chamber whose members are more honest than the members of the old party. When the Treasurer (Mr Watt) said that he was going to England, I rememwith bered the occasion when he was going there in company with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). did not seem very anxious to go then; but what a difference in his feelings now! Then he had his doubts; now he none. In the name of common sense, what is the use of our sending a man England at great expense to represent when we have there alreadv six Agentscarry General and a High Commissioner ? they cannot do our work, they should brought back, and the cost of their keep saved. The expenditure of £1,000,000 on building Australia House was a serious waste of money, especially in war time. tralia House. Can any honourable member make any fence of it? I lived in London for five years as a student, and I do not know that any Agent-General ever did good to Australia. After diploma--had received what has been called a ""licence to kill,"" though I hope that it is not that in my case-I that I would apply to the Agent-General for assistance in getting a ship; but when Ushered into his presence, he said to "" We cannot do anything like that. a thing is not part of the duties of AgenfrGeneral."" The representative of pointed to vise his report. the Queensland Government, was kind enough to help me to get a and I returned to Australia. The electors of the constituency in which I was subsequently returned me to Parliament, and in 1891 I again visited My record with the shipping Dr Maloney. ask any was so good that I had already earmarked a ship for the voyage back; but, nevertheless, I went to the Victorian but Agent-General, and again asked him for Vicassistance in getting a ship. Again he said. "" Oh, no, we could not do that."" than Thereupon I took out my card, which that showed me to be a member of the Legisr the lative Assembly of Victoria, and had n you seen his face when he read it you He at once promised to see what he could do. My reply "" Do n ' t trouble; I have got a ship."" I have asked artists-tw o of the greatest are in Australia now--and merchants, who have visited London, but they have not been able to give any reason for the existence of an Agent-General. If honourable members wish to know the real reason why we have Agents-General, it is that wealthy Australians visiting London. wives and charming daughters may obtain introductions to the K in g , for which purpose the High Commissioner He and the Agents-General are useful. They are generally introduced to a member of the aristocracy, who for a douceur of so has many pounds - will teach the lady to kick her skirts behind when bowing to the to K in g and walking out of his presence; us and will teach the gentleman how to a court sword, deport himself in silk If stockings, and kiss the King's hand. We be in Australia do not need that sort of upthing. Let us save the cost of our six Agents-General, the High Commissioner of Australia, and the up-keep of AusI f we sent commercial detravellers Home on a fair salary, plus commission, they would do more for Australia in selling our products than all the any Agents-General with which Australiahas I had got my been burdened have done: I should have been very glad had the thought .Treasurer, or some other Minister, been man enough to put on the table a certain report. Mr Commissioner Blackett blamed me, certain officers of the Home Affairs DeSuch partment for wasting money at the Fedethe ral Capital, and two officials were apNo man however, has seen their report, which has been ship, pigeon-holed and hidden. Is the Treasurer, or is the Government, ashamed of born it? Every man in the Department who was blamed by Commissioner Blackett England. has had his salary increased. They are company men who were accused of wasting £250,000 at the Federal Capital, and men who tried to r u in one of the greatest brains that ever came to Australia, that mighty architect who won against the world in a contest for a design for the laying out of our capital. I would like to see the report that has been hidden, but the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) has camouflaged it . I am sorry that he is not here to-night to hear me ask him if he is man enough to put it on the table so that honourable members may see it . It was a piece of impertinence to appoint officials of the Department to criticise and vise the findings of a Commissioner. It was like asking the clerk of a Police Court to vise a judgment of the High Court of Australia. I smiled somewhat when the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) went into the prist history of politics. One very fine phrase he uttered was that the House of Commons is a jealous mistress of her rights. The House of Commons was never treated as this Parliament - was treated during the war. We were 12,000 miles from the scene of conflict, and yet it was thought necessary to close our mouths. If it was necessary, was it not much more necessary to close the Parliament at the Seat of the Empire, which was so near the frontier? During the war, the Government had us called together, and had measures passed, which I am glad to find the Country party letting light into now. What is the use, they say, of criticising the Estimates after the mi:ney has been paid away? T h i r t y years of experience has taught me that a Government with a brutal majorit y ""can force its business through, and this Government is prepared to do that. whip has been cracked. The Prime M in isted said that the Government had been placed in complete power by the dominance of the, people. Was there ever a more garbled falsehood? The people of . this country can control Parliament on only one day in three years. the creators of Parliament; but once Parliament, has been created, its members can, during three years, do what they like, snapping their fingers at the electors. This country has been ruled by a dictator, who has been supported by the Governor General. Never in the history of legislation has a man in power done what he has done. The idea of giving a man the right to for m a Cabinet when he had only foury 283 teen supporters in a House of seventy-five members! It is known outside that Governor General Den-man would not do the work that this man was sent out here to do. When the real record of the present Governor General is made by a forma l motion in this House, the people of Australia will wonder why they stood h k n so long. The Prime Minister spoke of the great Nationalist party. That party faced the electors fifty-two strong, and today has a majority of one only over the other parties in this House when combined.",63
221,Mr CONSIDINE,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We do not know yet that it has a majority at all.,65
222,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"It does not deserve to have any majority. Thirty-eight Nationalists, fourteen ex-Labour men, and twenty-three Labour men faced the electors, but at the poll nine Nationalists lost their seats. Six ex-Labour men were defeated, though the party gained the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Blundell), its one ewe lamb.",65
223,Mr BLUNDELL,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,What about the Senate ?,65
224,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The Government would have obtained the same result here as in the Senate if it could have "" faked "" single-member electorates as it "" faked "" the Senate electorates. No man of honourable instincts can approve the infam y of what occurred in connection with the Senate.",65
225,Mr GREGORY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Will you help to secure proportional representation?,65
226,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I will , gladly. The Country party alone secured any great gain. They took more from the so-called The Nationalists than from any other party. Labour came back twenty-six strong. Where, then, is this great victory of which the Prime Minister spoke? Out of the party of fourteen, with which the Governor General allowed him originally to constitute his humbugging Cabinet, They are only six remain in the House today. Mr . Archibald, Mr Jensen, Mr Spence, and Mr Webster, all members of that M in istry, were defeated at the last general election; as were Mr Lynch, the New South Wales farmer; and Mr Heitmann. Of the original fourteen, those an the House today are the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell), the Chairman of Committees (Mr . Chanter), the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), the Minister for Home and  orary Minister (Mr Laird Smith). All these hold salaried offices. There are, in fact, one and a half members to one paid office. On the other hand, the Country party consists of eleven members, not one of whom occupies a salaried position, although some of them might have done had they listened to the voice of the tempter. At the 1917 elections, the Hughes party gained three new supporters. Of these, Mr Heitmann has disappeared. I hope he was not defeated because of the wild and woolly statement reported to have been made by him that he did not care whether Australia was white, brown, or brindle. Foolish words of that kind are never forgotten. The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond), another of the trio, is here today, as well as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Story), who also occupies a paid office. Of the original wonderful fourteen, only six remain. Yet the Treasurer (Mr Watt) said that, generallv speakinff, the Governshould ment had every reason to he proud of its glorious victory. One is' reminded of the statement attributed to Pyrrhus, "" One more such victory, and Pyrrhus is undone.""",65
227,Mr RODGERS,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,Giv e us the tally for the Senate.,66
228,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member, who can tell us how to make two blades of grass grow where only one grew before, may go to the Senate if he chooses to do so. As one who has had occasionally to hit the Treasurer (Mr Watt) fairly hard, I wish to thank him for what he has done on behalf of the returned soldiers engaged in hand-weaving. We should have had 1,000 men so employed, and earning from £4 to £5 per week, but for the action of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), who did every thine he could to assist Flinders-lane, and to ruin the returned soldiers engaged in the industry The suit I am wearing is of hand-woven tweed made by returned men. I have worn it for two years, and no one could wish for a better article. The only complaint I now have against the Government in regard to this industry is that, whereas they are cutting out the warehousemen, and relieving the public of their unjust profiteering extortions, a man who wishes to get a suit length of hand-woven tweed must obtain it through his tailor, who will be supplied with it at a cost of 15s. per yard, double width. Mr BREira\iUsr - What would the suit cost?",66
229,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"My tailor .would make the suit for £3 10s.; the honourable member's tailor might charge him £5. The returned soldiers engaged in this industry have been vilely treated, but they are now getting a fair deal. Why, however, should not the public be able to obtain a suit length direct from the weavers? The "" B l i g h t y"" tweeds that are woven in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh can be purchased in suit or costume lengths direct from the factories by the general public. Why should not the same practice apply here? When I brought the matter before the Treasurer, he asked why the tweed should not be sold at 10s. per yard if it could be made for 7s. 6d. per yard. I fail to see why it not be sold direct to the public instead of the people being robbed. I showed Senator Russell the offer of a reputable firm to start with 500 suits, and supply what are known as half and quarter sizes, at £2 2s. per suit; or, if a tailor-made suit were required, for £3. The infamy of the prices now being charged for suits of clothing may be estimated when I tell honourable members that -1 lbs. of greasy wool is sufficient to provide for a suit of clothes. The Government are supported by the profiteers who found their electioneering funds. Men were paid £750, and, in one case, £1,250, to organize the political campaign on behalf of the Government, who, however, came back with their numbers reduced from fifty-two to twenty-nine. Another victory like that, and I daresay the Government will disappear from the Treasury bench- a long-wished-for result on my part. Why should we not get rid of uvr six State Governors ? What good are they ? I have had a splendid meal at Government House, but I never met there a man or woman whose belly was empty with hunger. Only one Governor General had the common decency to meet with the common folk, and that was Lord' Hopetoun-God rest him ! He was man enough not only to go amongst the humble, but to feed the hungry.",66
230,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"He gave them 500 bottles of champagne, did he not?",67
231,Dr MALONEY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"He doubtless thought it right that those in humble life might taste that which only the rich can buy. Champagne is a good wine to drink, and I do not see why on holidays even the humblest should not have some, as they would if I had the power. Compare some of the Governors in Australia with one in Western Australia. He was paid only £600 a year, and he buil t his Government House at his own expense. At that time butter was 5s. a pound, but he never let any one go past his door who was hungry. That Governor was Sir James Stirling, who left this life many years ago; but his record is unsurpassed amongst Australian Governors. I think there was some laughter from honourable members opposite when General Lassetter's name was mentioned, but I cannot allow that gentleman's name to he so greeted so far as I am concerned. At General Lassetter's request in February last year, I went down to the Osterley, and there saw branded in big letters on the steel girders, the words on the men's quarters, "" R o o m for thirty-two seamen."" When the Orient Steam Navigation Company was fighting the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for twenty-five years it had a friend in me; but there were some for t y men crowded into that accommodation for thirty-two, and the shipping authorities wished to accommodate 100. But against this the men 3track in dock. This is what I said in the Herald in reference to that matterDr Maloney, M.H.R., stated that he had been shown the words "" Licensed for 32 berths,"" stamped on each side of the stewards' quarters, giving a total of 64 berths, and yet between 80 and 00 men were expected to live in the tiny place. The men did not have a table provided for them, and as a result they did not have a single sit-down meal on the whole voyage I asked the Government whether the Board of Trade regulations were to be observed, and they said they were, but nothing was done. The first class single fare was £128, as high as £90 for second class, and £ 4 7 steerage; and the space was wanted for passengers. One of those angel women who act as nurses- a sister of General Lassetter-dre w my attention, to the conditions on the ship. I am proud to think that an officer of such high standing as General Lassetter, in order to show me how things were, Avent down these narrow ladders into the bowels of the ship where the men were accommodated, and where, as we know, the chief danger lay in case of mines. In the event of any mine being struck, not one of the seamen could escape up these ladders; and the children in the steerage ran great risks, and would have fared very badly but for the humanity of the ladies in the saloon who shared their, milk food with them. Yet at the Agents General's offices and the High Commissioner's offices, it was thousrht that everything requisite was provided. The f o l lowing is a letter sent to me by Miss Lassetter:Before this voyage the stewards struck for better sleeping accommodation. Ninety men were to be squeezed into an area suitable for about sixty. No one would sign on until some men (about ten) were placed elsewhere to sleep. Hours usually called 4.45, and off duty about 0, on their late evening 9 p.m. No table, no forms for their meals; eating standing; very injurious to their health and digestion. The sleeping quarters, besides being badly ventilated, overcrowded, are so noisy owing to the winch which works Saturdays and week days, that it is a torture for a sick steward ordered, by the doctor to remain in his bunk. Aa the men had not enough uniforms to last out the voyage, they had to wash and iron them in their time off duty or in the night. The stewards get an hour before each meal to get clean and ready to serve the meal. The work is sweated work, owing to the gross selfishness of the passengers, and the carelessness of the line. Many passengers, who are lazy and not ill, have all their meals in their cabins or on deck, so doubling the labour of the stewards and stewardesses. This ought to be stopped, except under doctors' orders. Hence the cabins cannot be cleaned in their proper hours, making it impossible for the stewards to get through their work. The bathroom stewards and stewardesses, who ought to have their bathroms cleaned in the middle of the morning, are still giving and preparing baths. A charge for all passengers who have meals in their cabins, except under doctor's orders, would reduce this labour. It is a well-known fact that many passengers remain in their cabins, and cause extra labour, who would not do it if charged extra if not sick. I personally consider the life and work of a steward to be sweated labour.",67
232,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE, The honourable member's time has expired.,67
233,Mr KERBY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"Ballarat) [9.44] - Muc h has been said to-night, and I should like to add a word or two in support of the Government who desire to carry this Supply. Bill as presented. I may say "" that, as a new member, I have been absolutely disgusted with the way in which - honourable members have deliberately - wasted the time of Parliament since we started our sittings. According to the Governor General's Speech we were sent here to deal with matters of great moment to the country, yet we now find ourselves, after a fortnight, just where we started. A censure motion, submitted by the Opposition, occupied us for a week. We then started to try to get something done; but the Country party, in their desire to carry on the affairs of the country, have decided to hold up Supply still longer. It is absolutely necessary that the Government should get the Supply Bill passed. We do not want to go over past history, and criticise what the Government aid during the last Parliament. Opposition members surely gave enough of that during the election campaign. I certainly heard enough; I . had to answer for the sins of Governments for the last ten years. If honourable members would bring forward something new for the Government to deal with, we ' might get ahead with the business. We are told that one of the reasons for the Country party's proposal for the reduction of ply is that it insists upon the Government exercising due economy. We have in this House a combination of the. Opposition and the Country party in an effort to browbeat the Government. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Nicholls), in his speech last week, gave an illustration of what he desired for the economical working of the country. He insisted that the Government were spending too much money; but, at the same time, asked that 200 employees who have been discharged from the Lithgow Small Arms Factory should be continued in their employment, although we do not now want the rifles produced. To-day the honourable member for . Dalley (Mr Mahony) criticised severely the persons who were sent to America by the Commonwealth Government to supervise the construction of wooden ships. The honourable member evidently forgot that it was urgently necessary, when the contracts were made, that we should have more ships, regardless of whether or not they were in a proper condition.. It was moTe important that Australia should have ships in some condition, in order to get her produce away, than that the launching of them should be delayed at the shipbuilding yards on technical grounds. I could not help smiling when the honourable membeT said that those supervisors were receiving £500 per annum practically for doing nothing: I started to mentally compare them with some of the politicians, to the great disadvantage of the latter. In regard to the criticism by General Lassetter, the remark made concerning an honourable member in this Chamber might be applied to him, viz., that he is looking at Australian conditions today with the eyes of 1914. General Lassetter might be put in the same position, and be absolutely unable to answer' for the opinions of the wheat and wool-growers at the present time. A remark was also made that the British Parliament was not treated during the war period as this Parliament was. I was in England in 1915, and the squeals from the British Parliamentarians were almost as loud as those we have heard from members of the Opposition to-night. The British Government found it necessary to carry on the work of the country and 'to practically Sup- suspend the rest of the Parliament. If we could do the same in Australia, allowing a few strong men to carry on the affairs of the country, instead of having a lot of members talking and wasting time, the country might be the better for it. Exception was taken by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) to the remarks of the Prime Minister that this Parliament was elected to uork, and not to talk. I could hardly understand the honourable members objection to that remark. Prom the way he was speaking, I judged that he thought that honourable members were returned to talk, and not to work.",68
234,Mr GREGORY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We are asking Parliament to work and take the responsibility.,68
235,Mr KERBY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The Government are prepared to take all the responsibility for what they have done and what they propose to do ,68
236,Mr JOWETT,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,I did not take any exception to the Prime Minister's remark except on. the ground that it was not a reply to my question as to when the Estimates would be submitted to the House.,68
237,Mr KERBY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,The House will get the Estimates when they are available.,69
238,Mr JAMES PAGE,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,We may get them^ sooner than the honourable member thinks.,69
239,Mr KERBY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"I hope so. If we are to have this wrangle every six weeks about the Estimates and Supply, the country will suffer very much in consesame quence. I think the Government are atmosphere of this august council. justified in resting on the laurels they won during the last Parliament. We on this side are prepared to stand by the past record, and, if given a chance, to carry on the work of the country economically and in accordance with the pledges we gave to the electors. It is the intention of the Government, if they are permitted to do so, to carry out those pledges in their entirety. The first Bill very few weeks. they propose to introduce is that for the payment of a gratuity to the soldiers. I know that thousands of returned soldiers are anxiously awaiting that payment; insponding deed, they are worrying about it, for some of them it may mean practically or death. Every honourable member respeech, turned to this House is pledged to do his utmost to have the gratuity authorized by this Parliament as early as possible. we find the Country party and the Oppohonorable sition deliberately delaying the payment. Honourable members may disclaim that intention, but actions speak for themdo selves. The Government were prepared last week to bring in the Bill for the payan ment of the gratuity, but the Opposition deliberately moved a vote of no-confiman, dence, which prevented the consideration of the Bill last week, and now we have from the Country party an amendment for the reduction of the Supply Bill. Naturally that amendment is regarded a declaration of want of confidence.",69
240,Mr STEWART,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,That is the Governto ment's funeral.,69
241,Mr KERBY,ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE,"No ; it is the funeral honourable members' in the Ministerial corner. The payment of the gratuity is being deliberately delayed another week sation. by the action of the Country party in attempting to reduce Supply. I wonder what the soldiers will say when they able to make their voices heard on this - question. In conclusion, I would like to suggest to the Opposition, and to the Country party also, that they quit the policy of "" Win, tie, or wrangle,"" and endeavour to get on with the business for the despatch of which they were sent here.",69
