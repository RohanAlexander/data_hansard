Petition received and read. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",14
1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Acting Treasurer what arrangements have been made for the distribution of application forms for invalid pensions? Will the honourable gentleman arrange that forms shall be obtainable at the various post-offices, or in other convenient places",14
2,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Half-a-doze n forms have been sent to each member of the Parliament, and there are today employed at the Treasury twenty additional hands, who are engaged in the distributionof the forms throughout Australia, so that payment of invalid pensions may, if possible, be made on the date originally fixed for it.. The Government wish to grant every facility to applicants. Forms will be sent to all the registrars, and to all places where old age pension forms are now obtainable.",14
3,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Is it a fact that two systems are to be observed in the payment of old-age pensions, one of payment in advance, and the other of payment at the end of the term?' I may say that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst some of the pensioners at this proposed arrangement.",14
4,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"It is intended to keep a promise, made by the Prime Minister when he delivered his Budget speech, to pay in advance those pensioners who are placed on the list on and after the 15th December next, and also those invalids and women who will then become eligible for pensions, and to retain the present system in relation to pensioners at present on the list. The new pensioners will be paid on the 15th December for the period up to the 31st of the month. There has been a difficulty in determining the obligation of the Comomnwealth in those cases where pensioners have died between payments. If a - pensioner dies within a week of the payment, there seems to be a moral obligation on the Commonwealth to pay for that week; but, owing to the difficulty of determining who is the rightful recipient of the money, that obligation has not been recognised. The Prime Minister takes the view-and I agree with him-that that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and that it would be better to pay fortnightly in advance, when, in case of death, the money can be used to pay the expenses of interment. Atpresent it is not possible to bring the whole of the pensioners under the new conditions without making a double payment, which does not seem to be justified under the circumstances, and which would involve the Commonwealth in an expenditure of something like ,£50,000 or .£60,000.",14
5,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"the Acting Treasurer, upon notice I. Is Mr Meakin, special magistrate under ? - the OldVagc Pensions Act, in the receipt of a pension of ,£600 a year; if not, what pension .does he receive annually? 2. What is his monthly remuneration as special magistrate under .the Old-age Pensions Act, and what is the total amount he has received to date? 3. Are there any other special magistrates receiving pensions, so appointed;. if so, who are they?",14
6,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 3. He has been paid is. 6d. a case from ist July, 1910. Previously he was paid at the rate of ,£400 per annum. The total amount received by him to date is ^468 10s. 6d. 3. No. NA PHYSICIANS.",14
7,Dr MALONEY,LADY CONSULTING,"I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs whether, in view of the facts complained of by the most important deputation of the medical profession that ever waited on a Minister, representing the lady doctors of Victoria, which I , as the member for Melbourne, had the privilege to introduce to him, he will state what he intends to do in the matter, and whether he will, promise - that all future departmental appointments shall be made after the vacancies have been duly advertised, and there has been fair competition for them ? Mr KING O'MALLEY -- I am having ;the matter thoroughly examined into, and hope to be able to. deal with it finally after the prorogation. The honourable member can rest assured that no other appointments will be made until vacancies have been advertised, so far as my Department is concerned. CENSUS ENUMERATORS.",15
8,Mr HEDGES,LADY CONSULTING,"In the Commonwealth Gazette, dated 19th November, appears the list of the census enumerators appointed for' Western Australia, twentysix in number, all but two of, whom are Government officials. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs why the Inspector of Police at Kalgoorlie has been appointed to act at Coolgardie, when he lives at Kalgoorlie, and why the Secretary' of the Trades Hall at Kalgoorlie has been appointed to act at Kalgooorlieand Boulder mines? Is he prepared to lay the papers on 'the table of - the House ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Commonwealth Statistician is the head of our Census Department, and the Statisticians of the States were asked to assist him in the taking of the census. They recommended those suitable for the work of enumerating, and had T attempted to make any change, the cry would have been raised that political influence was being used. IMPERIAL .CONFERENCE. Mr Bruce _ SMITH - Does the Acting Prime Minister intend to submit to Parliament a list of the subjects to be discussed by the delegates to the Imperial Conference?",15
9,Mr HUGHES,LADY CONSULTING,"To-morrow , or :the following day, I shall make a general .statement respecting the Conference, and' give the list of the subjects which we havesuggested for discussion. IMMIGRATION : AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT.",15
10,Mr THOMAS BROWN,LADY CONSULTING,"Has the attention of the Minister of External Affairs, been called to an article in today's Age advocating immigration, in which the .statement is made that there is a dearth of agricultural labour in Victoria, and to a statement in the Argus, that in the Riverina district there is - considerable dissatisfaction at the scale of wages by the Wagga branch of the Farmers and* Settlers Association, and that a number of the settlers indicate that they are not going to adhere to the scale of wages, which they consider to be too high. The telegram goes on to stateAccording to one prominent farmer residing in. the Tooyal district, there is more labour available than can be utilized, even during the busy weeks of the harvest. He states that the district is full of men on Uie trainp. Has the Minister of External Affairs had this matter brought under his notice, and will he, in view of the statements as to the dearth of labour in one district, and - the overplus of labour in another, consult with the State Premiers as to the possibility of bringing about a better distribution of labour, in addition to the introduction of labour from outside?",15
11,Mr BATCHELOR,LADY CONSULTING,"I saw the statement in theAge, but not the statement in the Argus. It is quite possible that some means could be adopted in order to determine with some degree of accuracy the state of the labour market in various parts of Australia. It is somewhat difficult, when conflicting statements are made by reputable persons, to arrive at a just conclusion. Something also may be done in the direction of assisting in the distribution of labour, so as 'to enable the greatest possible use to be made of governmental functions in providing people with work. CLOSE OF THE SESSION.",15
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,LADY CONSULTING,"I should liketo know whether-the Acting Prime'Minister intends to - make a statement as to the - business to - be transacted, and when the. session is likely to close. Statements have beenmade in the newspapers that --the session is to close this week, and it would be advisable to .have some authentic - information-from the head of the Government, in view - of the fact that members desire to make arrangements to leave Melbourne.",15
13,Mr HUGHES,LADY CONSULTING,"On Friday last, I went so far as to express a hope that we - should close on Friday night of this week - before train time, but that, if necessary, should have to ask Parliament to meet on Friday evening, and possibly on Saturday. As far as it is humanly possible, it is the intention of the Government to close the session this week, and I hope, with the assistance of honourable members, that we shall do so by train time on Friday. If - not, of course, we shall have to sit later. NA ABORIGINES.",16
14,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I wish to ask the Minber ister of External Affairs if it is correct ""that the South Australian Government are meditatingthe passing of a Bill with ref er-ence to the control of the aborigines in the Northern Territory? If so, does he propose to accept, in his management of natives, the policy and machinery down by the State Government?",16
15,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have not seen - the Bill to which the honourable member fers, and therefore can say nothing as what the Commonwealth attitude towards it will be. I understand that it was pared by Mr Crush, one of the members for the Northern Territory, and was ready for introduction twelve months ago. The South Australian Government lieve, taken it up so that it may have a - better chance of being passed before its author is compelled to retire from the Australian Parliament.",16
16,Mr MAHON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does not the honourable member think that the Federal Government can be trusted to treat the aborigines perly, without that gentleman's interferstone. - ence ?",16
17,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think the honourable member need suggest interiron ference in the matter. The gentleman ferred to represents the Northern Territory at present, and he should rightly have ever credit may attach to the bringing ward of the measure. The attitude of Commonwealth Government towards it will, of course, be determined when we see So much of its provisions as suit the policy of the Government will be adopted, of 'but any of them which we regard as incompatible with the best interests of the aborigines we shall certainly decline to accept. INDIANS INFIJI .",16
18,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is the Minister of Exwe ternal Affairs aware that 35,000 Indians, both free and indentured, are now resident in Fiji, engaged on sugar plantations and in other occupations? Is there an arrangement between the Government of Fij i and the Commonwealth Government that due care will be taken that none of these Indians reach the Commonwealth? Is the Minister aware that the trade, customs, and religion of the Indians are becoming dominant factors in Fij i ?",16
19,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not aware of the allegations which the honourable memmakes, but shall have inquiries made. IRON BOUNTY. IRONSTONE QUARRYMEN'S WAGES.",16
20,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Complaint s have been the made to me by men working at the ironlaid stone quarries at Carcoar, New South Wales, that they are not receiving the average wage for that class of work. I understand that, under the Manufactures Enrecouragement (Iron Bounties) Act, it is to necessary that these men should receive union rates of pay. If that is so, will the preMinister of Trade and Customs see that the conditions laid down in the Act are observed, because the ironstone quarry is worked strictly in connection with the manuhave, I befacture of pig iron?",16
21,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This matter was before South the Department on a previous occasion. I understood that instead of paying 8s. a day, which is considered to be the ruling rate of wage for that class of work, Hoskins Brothers pay only about 7s. or 7s. 2d. proper day for. the quarrying of the ironThe Act referred to does not provide that the men engaged in the production of the material for manufacture into shall be considered. That was apparreently one of the mistakes made in passing the measure. It provides only that standwhatard rates of pay shall be paid to the men forengaged in the manufacture of the iron. the I had the question submitted to the Law Department some time ago to ascertain if it. if were possible that the men producing the iron ore should receive standard rates pay. Speaking from memory, I think the decision of the Law Department was that we had no control over the conditions of production of the ironstone. This shows that we should be very careful when passing measures of that kind, to see that the whole of the workers receive a fair deal.",16
22,Mr CARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does not rthe Minister think that those engaged in the production of the ore, without which no iron could be manufactured, are essentially employed in connection with the manufacture of iron, for which the Act stipulates for the payment of certain rates of wage?",17
23,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a matter of interpretation for the Law Department. My recollection is that the Act distinctly refers to those engaged in the manufacture of iron. The work to which the honourable member refers is, I believe, considered to be the production of the article prior to manufacture. If there is any way to insure that the workmen get their share of the bounty, I shall do my best to see that they do get it. NEW TORPEDO DESTROYERS.",17
24,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the attention of the Minister of Defence been called to a statement made in the Sydney press last week to the effect that the parts of the destroyer to be put together in Australia have been condemned as utterly unsuitable and as of faulty material? If so, will Minister have inquiries made with a view to seeing that no faulty material is used in the construction of the vessel ?",17
25,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall be glad to have this matter investigated. It has not been brought under my notice until the present moment; but, so far as my knowledge goes, the parts sent out are similar in material to those used in the construction of the destroyers now on the way to this country. ' If the material is unsatisfactory in one case, I think it must be unsatisfactory in regard to the whole of the ships.",17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the Honorary Minister himself made inquiries as to ' the truth or otherwise of the allegations concerning the construction of the destroyers, or does he intend to satisfy himself on the question ?",17
27,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As I have already informed the honourable member for Riverina, I had not seen the statement. If allegations have been made concerning the faulty construction of important vessels of that character, I have not the slightest doubt that the Department will speedily cause them to be investigated.

28,Mr MATHEWS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is there any truth in the rumour that the Marconi Company has offered to the Postmaster-General its stations at Queenscliff and Devonport, Tasmania ? If so, under what conditions was the offer made?",17
29,Mr THOMAS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot say that the Marconi Company has made an offer to the Department, but a Mr Hamilton, who said that he represented the Marconi Company, saw me, and offered to the Department the station at Queenscliff, and one in Tasmania. I referred the matter to the Chief Electrical Engineer, who informs me that the plant is not big enough for our purposes, and, therefore, I intend to call for tenders and to have proper installations erected.",17
30,Mr HEDGES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the attention of the Postmaster-General been called to the fact that a contract has been let for the erection of a 3,000-mile wireless telegraph the station at Washington, in the United States, the station to consist of a reinforced concrete tower 600 feet high, 50 feet to 60 feet in diameter at the base, and 8 feet to 10 feet in diameter at the top ? Will the Postmaster General see that one of the main telegraph stations of Australia is erected in the vicinity of the new Capital? Mr.'THOMAS - This is the first I have heard of the erection of a new wireless telegraph station at Washington. As to the second question, relating to the erection of a new station at the new Capital, I ask the honourable member to be good enough to give notice of it.",17
31,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Postmaster General be good enough to give honourable members some information as to the arrangements made in regard to the issue of the new uniform stamps? Is it the intention of the Government to invite competitive designs?,17
32,Mr THOMAS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the intention of the Government to invite competitive designs, and that will be done within a week, or, at any rate, within two weeks.",17
33,Mr HARPER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is the Postmaster General prepared to give an answer to the following questions, which I placed on the notice-paper on the 16th instant:Whether he will furnish a return showing1.

37,Mr CHANTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I Is it a fact that men of five years' service are being placed over men having twenty years service who have gone grey in the service? 2. Will the Postmaster-General suspend these appointments pending the decision of Parliament re the recommendation of the Royal Commission? . . . 3. Is it a fact that officers claiming a clerical status were given promotion without passing any examination? _ 4. Is it a fact that the superintendent of mails and a supervisor in giving evidence on the case of Sorter Stone admitted that they themselves could not pass the test? 5. Is it a fact that all these men are employed on the same work?",18
38,Mr THOMAS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as low:1. Assuming the question refers to sorters, it is a fact that officers with less than five service have been promoted to that qualifying by passing the prescribed test, and that such promotion gives them seniority over other officers, some of whom have twenty service, who have not passed the sorter's test. 2. The promotion of sorters is governed merit, and is entirely in the hands of He Service Commissioner. 1 Yes, officers with clerical status by classification are entitled to promotion out examination. 4. No ; no such statement appears in dence. 5No. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I.

Does the practice still prevail of discharging temporary hands at the expiration of nine months of service and replacing them with fresh retemporary hands who have had no previous exJune, i g n , perience in the work? 3. Would it not be better in the public interest, and tend to greater efficiency in the serbe vice, if , instead of being discharged at the moment when they are most useful to the Dethe proficient temporary hands were absorbed into the permanent staff while the numerical strength of the staff was insufficient to cope with the work of the De4. In case of illness in the ranks of the temporary staff, is it the practice to deduct pay the period of absence due to such illness? 5.

If it is the practice to deduct pay for the _ period of temporary illness in connection with either the permanent or temporary staffs, will the Postmaster-General give instructions to have the that practice discontinued henceforth?",18
39,Mr THOMAS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. 54S. 2.

42,Mr THOMAS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Deputy Postproportion master-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information in regard to quesbe tions (1) and (2):1.

Parcels Post-numbe r one mail officer works from 6 a.m. to 1.30 p.m., and follow:number two and three from 1 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. As there is other than supervising work to be carried out by the mail officers between the staff breaks, their bouTs of attendance are 'arranged accordingly, and their attendances are regulated according to the volume of work. 2. As the mail officers are fully ing the hours of attendance as now arranged, and as broken shifts are avoided as far as sible, it would serve no good purpose to fere with existing arrangements. 3. I have called for the papers referred to. PRESS CBE SUBSIDY. MrW. ELLIOT JOHNSON asked follow :the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I.

47,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3-35]--In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, f I very much regret that the stage of the session at which this measure is introduced precludes that comprehensive and exhaustive discussion which a Bill of this kind so obviously deserves. This session has been distinguished for measures of first importance, both in their' effect upon the community and the future of the Commonwealth; but I know of no measure which has received the attention of the Parliament which is more important than is this. It would deserve special attention under Acres. Roods. any circumstances, and in any country, ... 48 3 but particularly does it call for notice in a ... 2r 1 country under a form of dual government. ... 70 o Ten years have now elapsed since we ... 35 o adopted what is known as a Federal form of government, and we have already found out many of its defects as other countries have done. One of these is that it sets up to an extent a domination of the law which even we, the most law-abiding people in the world, find most repugnant to our Summary. ideas. I speak not in criticism of the rule of the law as generally exercised, but of No. of rooms. its dominance in a new sphere which ... ' r3 hitherto, under our unified form of govern... 13 ment, has been reserved to and occupied ... 25 ... 29 entirely by the Legislature. Under a ... 9 Federal form of government this has been ... 6 regarded as inevitable. Under Federation, the Judiciary occupies, as it were, a posi... 75 tion of lofty and superior censorship of our ... r7o legislation. And, of course, obviously, it must also exercise those functions which MELBOURNE. belong properly to the highest judicial Summary. Court in the country. It is, on matters of No. of rooms. ... 87 law-and to this no possible exception can ... 12 be taken-tb e last Court of Appeal. But ... 10 in another direction it exercises functions ... 6 of quite a different nature. Although nomin... «5 ally inferior to this Legislature, in reality it has shown, over and over again, not merely in this country, but more particularly in the United States of America, that it is above and superior to, not only the Parliament, but, what is yet more important, the constitutionally expressed will of the people. I admit at once that it is evitable that there must be such a body to determine the respective limitations of the States and the Commonwealth, and that it will never do for us to contemplate for a moment a condition of things in which the States and the Commonwealth may make what laws they please irrespective of the extent to which either may trespass upon the other's sphere. We must have clearly a Court clothed with sufficient authority, and charged with the exercise of these grave and responsible duties. But it by no means follows that we must ""endure""-and I use that word advisedly- a condition of things such as has been endured for over a century in the United States of America, and is in existence here today. Consider how absurd and unnecessary is the position that has arisen whereby a created principally-and I speak now not of its functions as a Court of Appeal for private litigants-to determine the constiask tutional authority of State or Federal Statutes is unable to move until some priof vate individual who considers that he fered an injustice, or a State authority which answer. is interested, brings an action under which the validity of a State is incidentally determined. As a fact, the Court never directly determines the validity of any Statute; it merely deals with it in conspent nexion with the facts of the case brought before it. A litigant thinks that he has suffered a wrong, and appeals to the Court for a remedyIf the wrong be one for Magna which there is a legal remedy, and one it is in the power of the Court to apply, and the plaintiff deserves relief, he will ceed, and incidentally the Court may clare that a particular Statute is or is ultra vires. That is to say, that the Court especially created to determine the validity of Commonwealth and State laws, does in were paid. fact never directly decide the constitutionthings ality of any such laws. This is not a per and sensible procedure for a great growing nation like ours to continue, and is the purpose of the measure to substitute for this cumbrous, antiquated method of determining the validity of any Statutes one which, on the face of it, will more speedily and effectively inform us as to the constitutionality of a measure, enabling Mr Hughes. the Court to give a calm, dispassionate, and impartial decision upon this one point, without the complication of personal relations and personal wrongs. The Bill proposes that when the Attorney-General refers to the High Court any question as to the in- validity of an Act, it shall give a decision thereon. A Statute may, as the result of a recent appeal to the people, have an overwhelming majority in its favour, but doubts may be entertained as to its constitutionality. Under existing circumstances it must remain for some time only the shadow of an Act, something without substance, because whether it can be enforced at all or to what extent cannot be known until some person chooses to approach the Court in regard to action taken under it. That may not happen for years, during which money may have been invested in the belief that the Act is constitutional, and machinery created for its administration. Should the Court determine that it is unconstitutional, all that expenditure and effort goes for nothing. We propose to substitute a straightforward and direct for the indirect and inCourt effective method which we have now for ascertaining the constitutionality of a measure. The Attorney-General will be able to the Court the plain question, "" Is this measure .one which it is within the power the Parliament to pass? "" and we shall has sufget from the Court a straightforward I ask honourable members to consider the net result of ten years' experience of the present system, and the amount of monev and time wasted on sporadic efforts to determine what the law really is. It is easy to say that justice must be delayed for none, and to recite the provisions of Charta; but justice is necessarily deInyed and rights withheld unless those who feel themselves aggrieved have sufficient sucmoney to bring their cases before the deCourt. In regard to the Harvester indusnot try, for example, Parliament passed a Statute declaring that certain wages should be paid, and for some months those wages An improved condition of was established, not before time and protbe industry were moving briskly along a and new road when, like a bolt from a clear it sky, came the action of Barger v. The Commonwealth, as the result of which the Act was declared to be unconstitutional. I dare say the workmen who received additions to their wages in consequence of the passing of the Act could set up a good defence if an attempt were made to-recover the money from them. But in most cases the old rates paid to them under mistake were immediately reverted to, although 75 per cent, of the legislators and of the people were in favour of the new rates of wages. Our new Protection proposals have been set at nought, and justice has been denied to many deserving citizens. The Act was invalid, yet it was not known that we had not power to pass the legislation which was declared invalid until, eight or ten months after its passing, a private manufacturer thought fit to bring a case before the Court. In this case, the employees concerned were put to great expense in being represented, and lost in other ways. The same thing happened in regard to the claim of the railway employees, in the brewery employees' case, and in others. Unions, after spending a great deal of money, discovered that the Statutes on which they relied were unconstitutional. Only the other day, for instance, in the boot trade case, it was declared that the section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act making provision for a common rule was unconstitutional, and, so far as legal sanction was concerned, the boot trade employees spent their money for nothing, though, as the result of an agreement, effect has been given to the award of the Court. The disabilities and expenditure caused by this state of affairs have not fallen wholly on unions or associations of either workmen or employers; but have affected every individual in the community. During the last four years the Commonwealth alone has spent a great deal of money in connection with cases in which the validity of Statutes has been questioned. In the railway servants' case, our costs were £ 5 3 ns. 5d.; in the Jumbunna case, ^323 14s. 7d.; in the Harvester cases, £548 16s.; in the Workers' Trade Mark case, ^739; in Moorehead v. Appleton, £639 18s. 9d.; in the Broken Hill case, ^365 os. 3d.; in the woodworkers' case, ,£247 6s.; in the Surplus Revenue cases, £225 12s. 3d.; in Merchant and Ah Way's cases, ^373 1 is. 2d.; and in the boot trade cases, ,£1.351 2s. 7d. In the Coal Combine and Seamen's Compensation cases, now pending, the costs, which will be very heavy, have not yet been fixed. In thesecases, thecosts have been incurred, not by direct appeals as to the validity of Statutes, but by actions in which the question of validity was merely incidental. In Moorehead v. Appleton it was determined that two sections of an Act were invalid. In that case, our costs came to £638 18s. 9d., and we had to wait for months until the ship-owners decided to take action. If there has always been need for a simpler method of testing the validity of Statutes, the present need is twice as great. We have a crop of new legislation as important at least as any that preceded it, and in many cases inviting questions as to validity. Yet we are asked to idly wait until the opponents of this legislation move to ascertain whether or not the law is good. In the meantime we must create machinery for giving effect to the legislation, and proceed in an orderly and regular manner, just as if there was no danger of a judicial thunderbolt. As I say, we have to wait until somebody pleases to approach the Court, and the Court perhaps declares, in deciding the merits of his case, that the Act is ultra-vires. .Obviously, the plain, sensible, business-like course, where a Court has been created and charged specially with the duty of deciding what are the limitations which the Constitution imposes, is to empower the Commonwealth to go straight to the Court, and ask whether a Statute is or is not valid. This Bill has for its object the giving of the necessary authority to enable that course to be taken.",20
48,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it proposed to give the States the power to also go to the Court?,22
49,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; but the States may be represented. This legislation is not without precedent; but, if it were, I hope that honourable members would not reject it for that reason. In these days, when we have to deal with complications, both legislative and economic, far beyond those which assailed our forefathers, we may fairly strike out in new directionsconfronted with new difficulties, we must evolve new methods to deal with them. But, as a matter of fact, in Canada there is power to submit the question of validity of Statutes to the High Court; and the law there is on the lines on which this Bill is drafted. Section 4 of the Canadian Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. is as follows :Section thirty-seven of the said Act is hereby, repealed, and the following substituted there for :37. Important questions of law or fact tousfiing provincial legislation, or the appellate jurisdiction as to educational matters vested in the Governor in Council by The British North America Act r867, or by any other Act or law, or touching the constitutionality of any legislation of the Parliament of Canada, or touching any other matter with reference to which he sees fit to exercise this power, may be referred, by the Governor in Council, to the Supreme Court for hearing or consideration; and the Court shall thereupon hear and consider the same : a. The Court shall certify to the Governor in Council, for his information, its opinion on questions so referred, with the reasons there for, which shall be given in like manner as in the case of a judgment upon an appeal to the said Court - and any Judge who differs from the opinion of the majority shall, in like manner, certify his opinion and his reasons : 3. In case any such question relates to the constitutional validity of any Act which has heretofore been, or shall hereafter be passed by the Legislature of any Province, or of any provision in any such Act, or in case, for any reason, the Government of any Province has any special interest in any such question, the Attorney-General of such Province, or in the case of the North-West Territories, the Lieutenant Governor thereof, shall be notified of the hearing, in order that he may be heard if he thinks fit : 4. The Court shall have power to direct that any person interested, or, where there is a class of persons interested, any one or more persons as representatives of such class, shall be notified of the hearing upon any reference under this section, and such persons shall be entitled to be heard thereon : 5. The Court may, in its discretion, request any counsel to argue the case as to any interest which is affected and as to which counsel does not appear, and the reasonable expenses thereby occasioned may be paid by the Minister of Finance and Receiver-General out of any moneys appropriated by Parliament for expenses of litigation : 6. The opinion of the Court upon any such reference, although advisory only, shall, for all purposes of appeal to Her Majesty in Council, be treated as a final judgment of the said Courts between parties. I understand that the decisions of the Canadian Court are advisory only; but as - I shall show, they are, in practice, always acted upon. There is very good reason for this. The Court is practically the final Court of Appeal, and litigants may well hesitate before they question its decision, seeing that any appeal from a decision of a lower Court, involving the validity of any Statute, would have to be heard by the same Court. I pointed out that the Canadian Act is very wide, and that any matter may be submitted to it. We do not propose to go so far, but merely to ask the High Court to decide the constitutionality of Statutes. We desire to know exactly where we are constitutionally, and to have the question of the validity of an Act decided as a matter of law, entirely apart from the merits or demerits of a particular litigant who may happen to move the Court. We propose to give the Court, not merely adMr Hughes. visory powers, but to make its decisions binding in exactly the same way as ordinary judgments. Provision is made for counsel to argue the points submitted on their merits, and for parties affected, including the Attorney-General of each State, to be notified of the hearing. The decisions of the Court are to be absolutely final and conclusive-no t subject to any appeal. Every citizen has a right to know where he stands in regard to the law. It is an axiom that all men are supposed to know the law, although very few do; but if that be so in a country like England, or in a single State of the Commonwealth, it is doubly so under the Federal form of government, as we know it here, where even the most grave and reverend seigneurs of the law are at a loss to say what the law is. This uncertainty is at once absurd and dangerous. There are people who, from time to time, rise up and declare that suchand-such a Statute is a violation of the Constitution, and that they intend to do something. Under the threat of the lash of these puny persons, the whole Commonwealth has to sit impotently j and while they wield their sixpenny toy whips the community is put to the trouble of defending the Statute, and is involved in large expenditure, and many important matters are held in suspense. We are not going to ask the Court to take on itself the function of the Roman jurist and deal with hypothetical matters, but with the most concrete matters on earth, namely, Statutes. We do not ask the Court to deal with the law in fosse, but with laws that have received the assent of the Legislature. It is proposed to entirely alter the present procedure. Under this measure we shall go to the Court with the Statute in one hand and the Constitution in the other, and ask the Court to say whether or not the Statute is within the four corners of the Constitution. That is the method which can be resorted to by State, Commonwealth, and individuals with great advantage, and should be introduced at the earliest possible moment. I am not going to defend the policy of asking the Judiciary to determine those questions. It is, I submit, a policy 30 obviously sensible and necessary as not to need the addition; in regard to that I shall not add one word beyond what I have already said. It is for those who are opposed to the measure to show good reasons why we should not. adopt so obvious and sensible a course. It may be that my friends opposite can do this, and can cover reasons long hidden from the eye man why we should continue to plough along the present hopeless rut. We shall, of course, be very glad to hear what they say, and pay every attention to their argudeclared ments. But, in my opinion, the present system is so unsatisfactory as to call for ""immediate amendment. It is not the way to settle what the law really is, the worse. 'Even from the stand-point justice to individuals in private litigation, it clearly is more important to counsel the merits of their client's case should urged rather than that the validity of a tional ? Statute should have to be established. And it is notorious that counsel always dodge question of the validity of a Statute when the interests of their clients may be imperilled thereby. It has frequently hapask the Judges to perform them. pened that the High Court, when a quesclearly tion, for instance, such as that of the mon rule, has cropped up, has declined express an opinion, and no opinion has pressed. Had the High Court expressed itself on that point, men would not have lived for years in an industrial fool's dise.. And we should not have been led to tell them that the Commonwealth afforded an ample industrial shield. If , therefore, we desire the validity Statute to be determined on its merits, should be dissociated from all other questions-the validity of the law, and nothing - but that, should be the question before Court. Coming to another phase of the matter, I contend that these functions with which we desire now to clothe the High Court are strictly judicial in their nature. has been hinted in the press and elsewhere, and I suppose we shall be told by my orable friends opposite, that those tions are foreign to those exercised a Judicial Court-that the Judiciary - of England have always declined to exercise of our constitutional power. - deal with such matters or to give an opinion unconnected with the questravenes tions arising out of an action introthe duced by private appellants or litigants, and that consequently this measure itself is unconstitutional. With that opinion - do not for one moment agree. Nothing could be more clearly a judicial function than that a Court, created for deciding constitutionality of Commonwealth or laws, should be charged with the duty deciding whether, as a fact, those laws or are not strictly constitutional. I can conceive of no more monstrous perversion unof the function of the Judiciary than to of think otherwise. Here is a Court, speaking of it in its character as thearbiter of the constitutionality of our laws, created for one purpose only. Surely it cannot be that to call upon it to exercise those functions which it is thus created to exercise is to clothe it with extra-judicial best duties? What can be more clearly a but judicial duty than to ask this Court, of after hearing argument by counsel and' allowing those whose interests may lie in that establishing its invalidity to be heard, be whether, as a fact, a Statute is constituBut even if we admit for a moment that the these duties are extra-judicial duties-no t usually thrown upon the Judges of a Court - I submit that we have a perfect right to For they are functions that cannot be comexercised by any one else. And assuredly to they ought to be exercised by somebody. In been Canada, and, as I shall show, in England also, rhey are exercised by the Judiciary. We have a perfect right to ask the High paraCourt to discharge these functions. Nothing that I can conceive of is at once more conformable to the idea of what is connoted of a by judicial functions and compatible with it the best interests of the Commonwealth. As to the validity of this measure itself, I venture to say that only on two grounds the can this or any other measure be declared to be unconstitutional. One is that it shall trespass upon State rights. Clearly, whatever else this Bill does, it does not do that. The other is that it shall contravene some express provision or necessary It implication of the Constitution. The Bill hondoes not do that As in no other circumfuncstances can any measure be declared to be by unconstitutional, clearly we have the power to make such a law as this. It is a valid It trespasses upon no State rights, it conno express or implied provision of Constitution. If it be said that it is an implied provision of the Constitution that nothing but judicial functions shall be I assigned to the High Court, the onus will be upon those who put forward that contention to show some implication from the the Constitution to that effect. For it does not State follow, merely because the judicial power of is vested in the High Court, that, there are fore, no other power can be vested in it. indeed There is nothing to prevent this Parliament clothing the High Court with any power. There is, perhaps, nothing to prevent us making them, if we like, the Inter-State Commission. If we like, andthey accept them, there is nothing to prevent us clothing them with many other powers. Therefore, while it is perfectly true that nobody but the High Court can exercise the judicial functions of the Constitution, it does not follow that they cannot exercise any other power. So, unless my honourable friends can show an implied or express prohibition in the Constitution, this Bill is perfectly good. They must first show that these powers are not judicial, and, secondly, that Ave cannot clothe the High Court with them. We are to assume that, whatever the word "" judicial "" in the Constitution meant in 1900, when the Constitution was passed, is included in its meaning now. On the 9th July, 1900, the Constitution received the assent of the British Parliament. Under that Statute the judicature was created. By section 71, it is provided that , : The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia."" That is the beginning and the end of what the Constitution has to say in regard to the Judiciary, so far as this point is concerned. Whatever "" judicial "" meant then, it means now. I am arguing now to establish the point that the functions which we propose to ask the Judiciaryto exercise are judicial functions. Suppose that point to be held not good. It then becomes necessary to show that we can clothe the High Court with extra-judicial functions. We have already seen that, under the Canadian Constitution, which was in existence many years before the establishment of the Australian Commonwealth, the Supreme Court of Canada has been clothed with these very powers and can and does test the validity of Statutes in the way proposed in this measure. This, therefore, was a function exercised by the Judiciary of Canada at the time of the passing of the Australian Commonwealth Constitution Act, and there is not the slightest doubt that everything that was connoted by the term "" judicial "" at that time is covered by the term in our own Constitution. I turn now to another and stronger precedent for what we seek to do. It is by no means uncommon for the British Judges to give answers to questions submitted to them in the form of abstract Ur. Hughes. propositions not connected with actions introduced by private litigants. One of the most common and effective ways of testing the validity of an Act is by what is known as a friendly suit. Divested of all verbiage, a friendly suit is simply a means of approaching die Court in order to ask it to give a decision on a point of law, and so evade the difficulty created by the disinclination of Courts to give decisions on points of law except those arising out of actions. During the history of the Commonwealth there have been two constitutional points decided in that way. I am nor quite sure whether the wire netting case was a friendly suit.",22
50,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was not a hypothetical issue, because the Court distinctly refused to entertain a question of that sort in the brewery case.",25
51,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am talking about a friendly suit to test a point, such, for instance, as the point whether State imports should be taxed.",25
52,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There was a tort committed for the purpose.,25
53,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Precisely. Again take the case of the Municipality of Sydney against the Commonwealth. "" That was clearly a friendly suit, brought for the purpose of determining the liability or otherwise of the Commonwealth to be taxed. A friendly suit is one of the commonest ways of determining rights under or the validity of a Statute. .",25
54,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Neithe r wa.s a hypothetical issue.,25
55,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not talking about hypothetical cases. I expressly disclaim intention to refer hypothetical cases to the Court. I propose to refer to the Court the most concrete things in existence-namel y Statutes themselves. Is not a Statute the concrete expression of the opinion of the whole body politic of the nation? If anything be concrete, a Statute is. After all, "" concrete"" in a Court of law does not mean only so much matter in the form of wood, stone, iron, or even gold or silver, although I have no doubt those things have their useful places in Courts of law. Leaving the "" friendly suit,"" let us now come to the consideration of a more direct method of testing what the law is. It has long been the practice to refer abstract questions to the highest Court in England, and Judges in England have often given answers to them. In 1840 the question of the validity of the Clergy Reserves Act, an Ontario Statute, was put before the Judges of England, all but one of whom were present. Some six or eight questions were submitted to them. The matter did not come before them by way of an appeal from a decision upon an action begun by any litigant, but was submitted directly, to ascertain the opinions of the Judges upon the validity of the Statute. The case is reported in Vol. 72 of the Journals of the House of Lords, 1840. The matter was referred to the House of Lords, who, in turn, submitted it to the Judges of England for their opinion. There was thus a direct reference by the British Legislature to the Judges of England as to the validity of a Statute of a province of Canada. The matter was put by way of resolutionThe Learned Judges being present, it was moved- "" That they do now deliver their opinions upon the questions of law propounded to them on Monday, the 13th of April last, respecting the Clergy Reserves (Canada) Act."" The question was put thereupon. It was in the affirmative. Then the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas delivered the ..unanimous opinion of the Judges upon the said question. They went right through the Statute, declaring certain sections prospective, certain sections ultra vires, and generally giving answers to all the questions submitted. I shall show that this is not an isolated case, but that the same course has been followed on other occasions. And not only have points of law l)een determined in this fashion, but the points of law so determined have determined the law of England for very many years. In one case the law so determined has not been called in question for over half a century. In other words, the opinions of the Judges of England, given on abstract questions of this sort, have settled the law for over fifty years. Let us take another case: this time before the Privy Council. In Wheeler's Confederation Law of Canada, page 411, the case of the Orphan Board v. Van Reenen is quoted, and we have the statementThere is a precedent for the House of LordsI think that this was in 1843considering the constitutionality of an Act of Colonial Legislature. In 1840 the question validity of an Act of the Province of Upper Canada was ordered to be propounded in questhan tions to the Judges of England, and Lord matter Mansfield, 4 May, 1840, delivered the unanimous decision of all the Judges, except Lords Denman and Abinger, that the Act was ultra vires. . . Act in question was in respect to the sale Ihe clergy lands, and caused great excitement Canada at the time. Should an occasion of such popular excitement occur again either from a Provincial Legislature passing a law and refusing to alter it, which the Dominion Parliament and Privy Council hold unreasonable, why should not the same course be followed and the constitutionality of the obnoxious Act argued before all the Judges of England. A decision of such a tribunal would have great weight. Certainly, if one or two of the eminent Judges of Canada were asked to take part also in the decision, it would be gratifying to the Canadian people. Here there was a condition of tilings involving riots and great excitement in Canada, and it was resolved to ask the Judges of England to say whether or not the law in question was good. The Judges having this duty thrown upon them, answered the questions submitted and settled the law, and, incidentally, settled the disturbance and excitement.' In that case also the decision has never been called in question. We have also the case of Valtn v. resolved Langlois, Appeal Cases 1879-80, volume V., page 117, in which there was a reference to the Privy Council regarding the validity of an Act casting upon certain judicial courts the duty of dealing with election petitions. The question was whether there was power to cast upon the Judiciary the function of dealing with election petitions which clearly come within the category of the exercise of doubtfully judicial power. We know that various Parliaments frequently and usually exercise the power of deciding themselves whether an election petition is good or bad, and of inquiring into the whole merits of the question of the validity of an election. It was held in this case that it was ultra vires to throw upon a particular Courtthat Court being a judicial body-the function of dealing with an election petition. The case came before the Privy Council by way of. a direct reference, and. in the course of his judgment, Lord Selborne said, as reported at pages 116-7Their lordships have carefully considered the able argument which they have heard from M i . Benjamin, and they feel glad that so full an argument has been offered to them, because there can be no doubt that the matter is one of great importance. The petition is to obtain leave to appeal from two concurrent judgments of the Court of first instance and of the Court of Apa peal affirming the competency and validity of an of the Act of the Dominion Legislature of Canada. Nothing can be of more importance, certainly, a question of that nature, and the subjectalso, being the mode of determining election petitions in cases of controverted elections to seats in the Parliament of Canada, is beyond The all doubt of the greatest general importance. It of therefore would have been very unsatisfactory into their Lordships to be obliged to dispose of such an application without at least having had the grounds of it very f u l ly presented to them. That has been done, and I think I may venture to say for their Lordships generally that they very much doubt whether, if there had been an appeal and counsel present on both sides, the grounds on which an appeal would have been supported, or might have been supported, could have been better presented to their Lordships than they have been up to the present occasion by Mr Benjamin. The question in this case was, whether the conferring upon the Judiciary of certain duties, which are doubtfully judicial, was or was not a valid exercise of judicial power within the constitutional limits of provincial legislation, and the matter was referred directly to the Privy Council, who decided the abstract question without litigants on either side. The decision was that the Act was valid. There is one other matter to which I should have previously referred. I spoke of a decision which had stood as British law for over fifty years. This was the celebrated M'Naghten's case, which is reported in vol. 8, page 718 of the English Reports, House of Lords.. It was there laid down that the House of Lords has a right to require the Judges to answer abstract questions of existing law. That judgment did not limit the kind of questions that might be so referred. Any question on any point of law might be referred to the Judges, and this case covered a number of points in relation to the liability for any act of any person who was more or less mentally unsound. The law in relation to that important matter was determined in this way, and was not disturbed for over sixty years, nor is it disturbed now, except in so far as modern medical science has more accurately determined the point at which, as it were, conscious liability for acts may he set. This important matter was decided by Judges on abstract questions remitted to them by the House of Lords. I lay very great stress on that case, and point out that it establishes in the clearest possible way the fact that the law of England has long recognised, and from time to time has exercised, the duty of answering questions upon abstract points of law with very great benefit. At page 112 7 of the English Reports, Vol. 6, it is pointed out that the only reservation or limitation made by the Judges of England is the very proper one thatThe Judge* will decline answering a question put by the House of Lords if that question is not confined to the strict legal construction of existing laws. Mr Hughes. But when it is so confined they will answer the question, and that is all tor which .we are now asking. What this Bill provides for is, then, - the - settled practice of.thehighest - Court in the British Empire. It has been followed with the greatest possible benefit in cases where it - has been resorted to, . and the advantages to all classes of the community are soobvious that it would appear. hardly necessary to emphasize them. I wish now to come a little nearer, home, and I must, apologize to the House for detaining it. so long. I should not have done so but for the fact that probably no other honourable member on this fide of the Housewill speak to the motion-or , at all events, speak at any length upon it-ari d I thought it right that the measure should not 'go out without a more or less comprehensive statement regarding the reason for its introduction! That I am now making, to the best of my ability. I wish now to refer very briefly, by way of meeting the objections of those who may contend that the duty cast upon die Judges by tins Bill are extra judicial, to the exercise of extra judicial functions by judicial Courts. First, it has to be noted* that the High Court itself does now exercise functions that are not strictly judicial witiiin the narrow interpretation of the term. It exercises, for instance, jurisdiction as a Court of Disputed Returns.. There, clearly, the duties are not directly, judicial. In the case of Holmes v. Angwin, Commonwealth Law Reports, vol. 4, P303. die Chief Justice, in delivering, judgment, said- The Supreme Court of this State . (WesternAustralia) therefore was a Court originally created to administer justice between suitors in respect to all kinds of civilrights, that is, all rights that could be enforced by legal procedure in any of the Courts of England, anil also to administer the criminal law. The Constitution of the Supreme Courts of all the other States was practically the same. This was an attempt to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in a matter connected with an election returnThese were the Courts which the framers of the Constitution had in view when the right of .appeal was given from every decision of the Supreme Court of a State to the High , Court; and I think that, f r i m S facie, section 73 should be construed asreferring to Supreme Courts exercising jurisdiction of that kind. No doubt, if by the Statute some new right was created, which would be enforceable in the Supreme Court if no other provision were made, an appeal from a decision with respect to it would lie to this Court. The appeal was disallowed. The High Court would not deal with the decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia because in making it the latter was not a Supreme Court in the sense contemplated by sections 71 and 73 of the Constitution. It was held by the High Court that the Supreme Court of Western Australia was exercising extra judicial functions, but functions in regard to which, had they been conferred on it by Statute, an appeal would have lain. Mr Justice Isaacs, in delivering his judgment in the case of the Attorney-General for New South Wales v. The Brewery Employes' Union of New South Walesthe passage is to be found in volume 6 of the Commonwealth Law Reports-said I next consider the position of the Attorney General for New South Wales. The fact that he acts on the relation of another is not material. If a public right is infringed, and the whole community is thereby affected, the Attorney General may protect the public interests by appropriate action. If the public interests involved are State interests the State Attorney-General may sue. He contemplated a condition of things exactly analogous to this under discussion. The Chief Justice did not agree with him, holding that matters ought not to come before the Court except by way of an action. In conclusion, I contend there is ample justification for what I propose, and that the precedents of the highest Courts in the nation more than amply warrant us in passing this Bill. The Electoral Act of 1902 makes the High Court a Court of Disputed Returns, clothing it with functions which the Court itself has declared to be extra judicial. If it be contended that the duties now sought to be thrown on the Court are extra judicial, it cannot be held that it is not already performing such duties. And as I have already contended, if there is a function which should clearly be performed by a Court such as the High Court, it is the determination of the constitutional validity of Statutes. Section 27 of the Referendum Act provides that the validity of any referendum or of any return or statement showing the voting on any referendum mav be disputed by the Commonwealth or by nnv State by petition addressed to the High Court. If a referendum is taken, and a question arises as to its validity, the Government, or any person in the community, mav at once ask the Court. "" Is this valid ? "" The Court will not stop to inquire whether the questioner has suffered a wrong or is interested in any way except as a citizen, but, having been clothed with the necessary powers, will deal with the question at once. Lastly, it must be observed that the Bill does not take away existing rights. If the public desires litigation, it can have it. I might have a feeling of remorse did I propose a measure for decreasing the bounteous harvest of the legal profession, though as a set off I might plead that the interests of the citizens are perhaps worthy of consideration. But the Bill supplements existing rights, and does not take any away. It removes uncertainty, obviates delay, and prevents injustice being, done to the Commonwealth, to the States, or to individuals, whereas the present system denies justice to the poor litigant, and is so absurd and indefensible that it is a matter for wonder that it should have so long endured.",25
56,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Angas) [4.51] - The Attorney-General has delivered a very interesting speech on this important measure, and I am glad that, towards the end of it, he referred in terms of implied eulogy to the Judiciary, thus ""discounting the perhaps rather hasty observationsmade at the beginning as to the position of the High Court and of the Supreme Court of America. I should be astounded to hear an Attorney-General reflect on the temper in which the Judiciary here or in America has approached the great problems created 1 by a Federal Constitution. But when he commenced to talk of the dominance of the law in a new sphere being repugnant to the nation, and of the Courts being above Parliament, and the constitutionally expressed will of the people, I thought for a moment that the observations, if made deliberately, would be more useful on a platform than in the calmer arena in which we are now discussing a legislative proposal. It is dangerous to assume that the Judgesignore the law, because it is their province to interpret it, and to declare the meaning of our legislation. The function of the High Court is to say, with that perfect judicial balance which, on the whole, characterizes its judgments, and with its cold temper of impartiality, what is enacted in the Constitution. Some one must determine that, and we have trusted the matter to a disinterested tribunal, whose members are removed from all possibility of personal interest, and whose businessit is to determine questions as they arisebetween litigants. It is impossible for usto assume that the Court does not in all cases arrive at the healthiest judgment possible to limited human faculties, having regard to the ambiguous phraseology with which members of Parliament sometimes clothe their ideas - In this connection it would be well to remember the opening lines of Lord Bacon's celebrated essay on the JudicatureJudges ought to remember that their office is jus dicere, and not jus dare-to interpret law, and not lo make law, or give law . . . . and to pronounce that which they do not find, and by show of antiquity to introduce novelty. He goes on to sayJudges ought to be more learned than witty, more reverend than plausible, and more advised than confident. Above all things, integrity is their portion and proper virtue. The province of the Judiciary is to declare what the law is. ' Mr ARCHIBALD - The Judges also make the law.",28
57,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am at issue with the honourable member on that point. Judges may create new notions as to what the law is, by declaring that it is something different from what .the laity assume it to be.",29
58,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Tak e the equity.,29
59,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not wish to be led into a dissertation on equity, which until the English Judicature Act was passed was not regarded as law in the sense that the honourable member wishes to apply the term. The Crown was the fountain of justice in all cases at one time; and when, owing to difficulty in upholding certain claims acknowledged to be just, some suitors were deprived of natural justice, the Crown asked its Chancellor to find some new form in which a claim might l:>e made and the remedy applied. This afterwards developed into the Court of Equity, and equity became part of the common law; and since the mergence of Courts of law and equity in 1873 Judiciary Act, which deals with such matters, declares or implies that, "" l a w "" includes ""equity."" If the honourable member looks up the Local Court Procedure Act of South Australia, of 1886, he will see that there the definition of "" l a w "" includes ""equity."" However, in an important matter like this, I do not wish to be led into dealing with matters which are of no great substance or relevancy in the issue before us. The main point in regard to the law is that it should be certain; and if the Judges do not adhere pretty closely to what they believe to be the law, but endeavour to find a way out of all difficulties by giving new notions of law, then certainly, in the long run, we shall not have that peaceful community we desire. In regard to the expenditure in these cases, the costs do not seem to be so heavy; and no matter what the system may be, whether Federal or otherwise, the Crown must sometimes have to take a part in the interpretation of the Statutes. Even in England, where there is a unitary system, the Crown has to intervene. At any rate, under a Federal Constitution, it will not be found that the costs are disproportionate, or that the number of cases is very much greater, making some allowance for the fact that there is an apparent, opposition between the sphere of the State and the sphere of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, for the first thirty-four or thirty-five years, there were not more than thirty or thirty-live constitutional cases beThe fore the United States Court, and only five or six of any great importance; and I do not think that the cases in which the Commonwealth has been interested, or has intervened as a party to watch the proceedlaw of ings, amount to a dozen. But we cannot by passing this Bill get rid of the difficulty of questions arising and the Commonwealth intervening sometimes; and the only difference will be that we shall ask the High Court at once to find 011 every question that may arise on a Statute or enactment, and this may pass the bounds of human or judicial power. If we desire a complete construction at. once, we must ask the Court to do that; and the Commonwealth, and other parties, will be represented. Any association of persons who have sufficient proximate interest to be represented must be permitted to appear; and so with the States and the Commonwealth ; the only difference, so far as exe v e r v pense is concerned, will be that the Commonwealth will always have to pay the piper. I scarcely think, therefore, that this phase touches the question of the desirableness of passing the Bill.",29
60,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-It does not matter where a lawyer gets his pay from when he is defending a case!,29
61,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What I mean is that that phase does not touch the expediency of passing the Bill, because, under any circumstances, there must be expense. I can scarcely see that the Attorney-General's arguments on this point are a recommendation of the measure, and they appear me to be more political than legal. The honourable gentleman went on to deal with what is judicial power; and he mentioned that there is nothing to prevent our vestclaimed, ing in the Judiciary powers that are not advice from judicial-that if the powers are judicial they undoubtedly come within the terms section 73 of the Constitution, and that they are not judicial, we can vest the High Court with functions that are extra judinot cial. That position I question. The only instance the Attorney-General gave that of investing, net the. High Court, designated persons with extra judicial power; and it only happened that those persons were Judges. In the Harvester case, for example, when the tribunal had to decide as to the fairness of the wages paid under the Act which was declared be ultra vires, Mr Justice Higgins was invested with certain powers that were not judicial, but mere in the way of arbitrafrom. tion powers, and these could have been conferred on any one but a Judge. other hand, judicial powers can be conferred on no one but a Judge; and I have never heard of extra judicial powers being vested in the Supreme Court of America or in High Court of Australia, though, of course, we are rather young as yet in that In the American case- I forget the title, but I think it is reported in 143 United States reports-certain powers were quesson is insane. tioned, and the point was whether they were judicial or parliamentary. Let us now, ever, look at some of the cases quoted by in the MCNaghten case. the Attorney-General. He spoke of the case Holmes v. Angivin in Western Ausat - tralia; but there was nothing in that affecting the issue that is before us There was no vesting of extra judicial functions in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in the ordinary sense; point was whether there was the rightof appeal to the High Court under section 73 of the Constitution from the judgthe ment or order of a Judge, who, the authority under a local Act, was trying an it election petition. A right of appeal would have existed under the Constitution and the Western Australian Act, if this Judge were the Supreme Court within the meaning of the Constitution; but it washeld that the Judge was not the Supreme Court, and that, therefore, the right of appeal did not exist. Then we had a long reference from the Attorney-General to other case which related to the question of what this power is in Canada, to it is in the United States. In England for centuries, and until, I might say, recently-becaus e the power seems to have fallen into disuse-the House of Lords as a judicial tribunal, rights of the Judges, and had powers or privileges which the House of of Commons has never really claimed in if this connection. The House of Lords has the power to ask the opinion of the Judges, on Bills that are before it, but on existing Acts, in order to guide its policy. was In the MCNaghten case, mentioned by but the Attorney-General, the question was as to the standard of legal insanity, f t is a curious fact that that decision has been questioned by Judges on the ground that it was only a loose advisory opinion outside the usual course of judicial power, and it to has been challenged for its soundness by leading writers on criminal jurisprudence.",29
62,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It has not been departed,30
63,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know that, but I shall On the presently read a great authority on the law in reference to that very case. There has been grave question as to the soundness of the answers of the Judges during the last the twenty-five years, and I remember reading, in this connection, Maudsley on Responsirespect. bility in Mental Diseases. . Mr HALL - It is a dispute between the lawyers and the doctois as to when a per",30
64,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Maudsle y said the test howought to be different from that laid down In that case, however, the Judges were, to some extent, sea as to what really was the judicial case test of insanity; and they had to offer now. opinions which were regarded as more or less obligatory on the Court. Subsequently Stephen, in his History of the Criminal the whole Law of England, said I cannot help feeling, however, and I know that some of the most distinguished Judges on Bench have been of the same opinion, that of the answers is questionable, and appears to me that when carefully considered they leave untouched the most difficult questions connected with the subject, and lay down propositions liable to be misunderstood, though they might, and I think ought to, be construed in a way which would dispose satisfactorily of all cases whatever. The interest of the question as to the authority of the answers is speculative rather than practical, as there can be no doubt that the answers do express the opinion of fourteen out of the anfifteen Judges, and they have in fact been accepted and acted upon ever since they were given. Two things, however, must be noticed and what with respect to them. In the first place, they do not form a ment upon definite facts proved by evidence. They are mere answers to questions which the Judges were probably under no obligation to answer, and to which the House of Lords had probably no right to require an answer, as they did not arise out of any matter judicially before the House. Then he goes on to question the propriety of the whole business. I am showing that any weakness of obligation in the answers given by the Judges is due largely to the fact that the opinions were asked outside the ordinary practice of judicial procedure, arid I only desire to show that some of the authorities quoted by the Attorney-General were unfortunate from the point of view of his position. The Attorney-General quoted other 'cases, including the Brewery or Union Label cases, on the question of Ahe submission of abstract cases to the High Court. The Court in the Brewery case did not decide that hypothetical issues could be submitted. It is a curious fact that this Brewery case was first presented before the High Court in Melbourne, and it fell through-why ? Because it was too hypothetical.",30
65,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Because one of the parties withdrew.,31
66,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I beg the honourable member's pardon; at the first trial in Melbourne, the Judges at once said that the case as then presented was a hypothetical issue, and they declined to go on. After that the Attorney-General for Victoria and the Attorney-General for New South Wales, or, at all events, the latter,, came in, and the whole question at issue, when Chief Justice Griffith gave the judgment referred to by the Attorney-General, was whether the parties had a sufficient interest, or the State of New South Wales had a sufficient interest in the question, to be entitled to appear. That seems to be the very reverse of what the Attorney-General suggested. The whole point was: Was the State, as a rState, sufficiently interested in this legislation to appear in the relation of a party directly affected by it-that is, the employers of the brewery employees? Court held that, on the whole, the union of the Attorney-General with some of the parties interested gave, in the circumstances, a sufficient jurisdiction to entertain the special case then presented. I was in the case, and remember several of the authorities cited. They were all judicial authorities. If the AttornevGeneral wants to know the opinion of the High Court as to the sending on of abstract or hypothetical issues, I can refer judg- him to the Federated Saw Millers' case, reported in. 8 Commonwealth Law Reports, 1909. The Chief Justice, alluding to the opinion of the English Judges upon the advisory functions cast upon them by the House of Lords, said I was reminded during the course of the argument of M'Naghten's case, in which the Judges, much against their will, were asked to express an opinion upon questions of law not necessary for the decision of art actual case. I w i ll Tead the introductory words of the opinion of Tindal, L.C.J, (speaking for all the Judges except Maule, J.) : - "" My Lords, Her Majesty's Judges (with the exception of Mr Justice Maule, who has stated his opinion to your Lordships), in answering the questions proposed to them by your Lordships' House, think it right, in the first place, to state that they have forborne entering into any particular discussion upon these questions, from the extreme and almost insuperable difficulty of applying those answers to cases in which the facts are not brought judicially before them. The facts of each particular case must of necessity present themselves with endless variety, and with every shade of difference in each case; and as it is their duty to declare the law upon each particular case, on facts proved before them, and after hearing argument of counsel thereon, they deem it at once impracticable, and, at the same time, dangerous to the administration of justice, if it were practicable, to attempt to make minute applications of the principles involved in the answers, given by them to your Lordships' questions."" The Chief Justice himself then saidThe precedent has never been followed. It appears necessary, however, if only to show why I feel bound to refuse to give a categorical answer to some of the questions submitted, to express my opinion on some of the points argued, even though it may be only obiter, and to state some propositions which appear to me to be elementary, and, indeed, little more than truisms, although nearly all of them have been explicitly or implicitly controverted in the arguments for the claimants. In other words, he said that most of the questions in the Federated Saw Millers' case seemed to be hypothetical, but that .the Court were prepared, nevertheless, to do what they cannot do under this Bill, but what is a very helpful thing to the President of the Arbitration Court-that is, to The express a few general ideas as to the power of the President under the laws we have passed under the arbitration power of the Constitution. A series of propositions are set forth, not as binding, but as what I might call advisory suggestions.",31
67,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is that when the Chief Justise wrote a "" treatise,"" as he called it?",31
68,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think so. We are denying the Court that right under this Bill, because the decision must be final, if it can be made fLnal, and binding, whatever that means.",31
69,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member think that the Justices of the .High - Court will be bound by this measure if they do not wish to'act under it ?,32
70,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I doubt it. I propose to make a few suggestions upon the validity of the whole proposal. I am not strongly against the principle of sending clean issues to the Court. I asked in the Adelaide Convention that power in that direction should be given in the 'Constitution, in order to put the matter - beyond all doubt. It may be too late now, but if I had had my way then, there would have been no doubt about our power. In the case to which I have referred the - Chief Justice deals in succession with, I think, fourteen different questions. What did the Attorney-General say is to be done under this measure? We are to obtain an Act, and a - copy of the Constitution, and say to the Judges, "" Here you are; tell us the rest."" In that one case alone, fourteen different questions were put to the Judge by .the counsel - connected with it, after .anxious preparation .and deliberation, so that, - although advisory, they were on issues presented by way of a special case to the Court, and the Court was not left to look through ithe Act of Parliament from beginning to - end and find in what and in bow many respects, if at all, it seemed to be unconstitutional. That is not the class of issue - sent on to the Privy Council under the Privy Council Act, or to the Supreme Court of Canada under the Supreme Court of Canada Act. - I think I have now fairly - travelled over the authorities in support of - the Bill, upon which the Attorney-General placed reliance - He referred to the Journals of the House of Lords in connection with an opinion given to that House by the J-udges an some Canadian Clergy Act in 1840. What I .said as regards .fee M'Naghteii - case touches that also, but there is no doubt that the Judges of England were .always less disinclined, in - the beginning, to .answer questions affecting the judicial power of the Colonies or Dominions than they were when - questions were presented in connection with English Acts - of Parliament of purely local application. Under the Act 4 and 5, William IV., Gap. 9/6, the first Act establishing proper government in Australia, putting an end to martial law, .and setting up in New South Wales a proper system - of trial by Judiciary and government by Orders in .Council, it .will .be found that the legislasubmitted. tive enactments or 'Ordinances had to besubmitted - by the Legislature for the certificate of the Chief Justice as to their validity, before they became Acts. There were, therefore, precedents in the - early days, before we got our proper system of constitutional and representative .government, for asking the opinion of the Judiciary, but that was done very largely for the guidance of the Executive as to whetherthey should exercise the power of disallowance. These were, of course, non-elective nominee bodies, appointed on behalf of the Crow.n, because they were officers of the Crown, and not at all representatives of the people- a very vital distinction. It was therefore customary, for their guidance,, that the opinion of the Chief Justice should be iobtained, and, following up that temper, the British judicial tribunals, at all events, were less inclined to kick at giving an opinion in connection with such' matters than they would be in regard to matters of purely local jurisdiction. In the Convention at Adelaide, I tabled an amendment by way of suggestion, because it was not to be - final either in its place or wording, that we ought to vest our High Court with juiisdiction in any matters that Parliament might prescribe. We :had - at that stage passed the legislative provisions, and had come to the judiciary provisions, and I wanted to apply .a test which, if the principle were .adopted, the drafting committee could afterwards throw into the best language, and put in the proper part of the Bill. What I suggested then was that jurisdiction similar to that vested in the Privy Council ought to be given to the High Court, because eventually the Privy Council might be .abolished ;as one of our Courts of appeal, and whatever power the Privy Council tlaaid ought to be vested in ; the High Court as against that-contingency. Under 3 and 4 V i c , Cap. 41, the Act regulating the Privy Council, the Crown has power to submit any matters whatever for the - decision of the Privy Council. Thai jurisdiction is intended for the submission of such questions as the disputed boundary betweenSouth Australia and Victoria. Some years ago an arrangement was come to between the Governments of South Australia and Victoria to submit that - question to the Privy Council. Unfortunately, the VictorianParliament refused to ratify the action of its Executive, aad ihe .question was not I believe that .a case as to what is the true boundary between - the two States is actually pending before the Federal tribunal, now that it has been established; but the whole matter could have been settled years ago had the States acted reasonably by drawing up a special case and sending it on to the Privy Council under the Privy Council Act. Similarly, in 1892, a big case from the Bahamas, as to the power of the Sovereign to release persons under committal for contempt of Court, was decided. It seems that some newspaper, in which had appeared a letter reflecting upon the Chief Justice, had refused to give up the name of the writer at the command of the Chief Justice, and he thereupon imprisoned the proprietor or editor for contempt of Court. The question arose whether the action of the Executive in releasing him, because they thought the merits did not justify imprisonment, was valid. That case went to the Privy Council and an article appeared in the Times upon the jurisdiction involved. Eleven Judges sat. It was one of the biggest and most important Courts that had ever sat, such Courts meeting only for a matter of very great importance, which only occasionally turns up. Similarly, in 1886 and 1893, Mr Gladstone brought in his Government of Ireland Bills, and proposed to adopt the same principle, by which the question of the validity of Irish Acts was lo be. submitted to the Privy Council, strengthened by some of the Irish Judges nr ex-Judges. The Attorney-General might have found a precedent for this measure in either of those Acts. I suggested at the Convention that that power ought to be vested in the High Court, putting the matter in this wayWe propose abolishing the right of appeal to the Privy CouncilTn Adelaide we did do thatand if we succeed in that, another amendment will be necessary. We will have to invest our High Court with the power which is vested in the Privy Council to decide certain matters which are not matters of contentious litigation. T then went on to show what had been done in Canada and in the State Constitutions in America, and the divided opinion that existed amongst writers on the practice in America as to the propriety of the power of submitting abstract issues. In seven of the American States the power has been given, not by Act of Parliament, but by the Constitution. Only in Vermont, I believe, is it the subject of an Act. There, according to Bryce, the opinions given are not binding; they are merely advisory opinions which the Courts may, or may not, Mr Glynn. disregard. Bryce, who puts the matter very fairly, doubts the expediency of that course being followed. It does not exist in connection with the Federal Judiciary, and there is no power for Congress to pass such an Act as this. Bryce asksHow is a man to know whether he has really acquired a right under a Statute? How is he to learn whether to conform his conduct to it or not? How is an investor to judge if he may safely lend money which a Statute has empowered a community to borrow, when the Statute may be itself subsequently overthrown? He puts the considerations that might be urged in favour of the existence of such a power, but he goes on to doubt the wisdom of the whole thing. By leaving constitutional questions 10 be settled by the Courts of Law another advantage was incidentally secured. The Court does not go to meet the question; it waits for the question to come to it. When the Court acts it acts at the instance of a party. Sometimes the plaintiff or the defendant may be the National Government or a State Government, but far more frequently both are private persons seeking to enforce or defeat their private rights. For instance, in the famous case which established the doctrine that a Statute passed by a State repealing a grant of land to an individual made on certain terms by a previous Statute is a law "" impairing the obligation of a contract,"" and therefore invalid, under article 1, section ro, of the Federal Constitution : the question came before the Court on an action by one Fletcher against one Peck on a covenant contained in a deed made by the latter, and to do justice between plaintiff and defendant it was necessary to examine the validity of a Statute passed by the Legislature of Georgia. He goes on to point out that this is a dangerous practice, because there is an absence of that substantial interest which enables litigants to have a matter thoroughly threshed out. If honourable members refer to Quick and Garran they will find that the wisdom of this Bill is questioned. Sir John Quick-the honourable and learned member for Bendigo - wa s a member of the Federal Convention, and Mr Garran is an authority on these points who is undoubtedly entitled to the very greatest respect. Two points are referred to at pages 766 and 767 of their Annotated Constitution. As to the expediency of this power being given, they writeThe argument from policy is very strong in support of this view. Ex parte interpretations of the law, without the thorough examination of interested parties and their counsel, are apt to be unsatisfactory and unauthoritative. It might indeed happen that the persons interested might be represented and heard upon a reference; but the practice would be, at least, open to serious abuse. The one advantage it would have-that of obtaining a prompt decision upon questions which are in doubt, but which no one is ready to litigate-is more than balanced by other considerations. The Judges would be liable to be hindered in the discharge of their appropriate duties by being employed, in a manner, as the law advisers of the Crown- a position which might lead to the undesirable entanglement of the Bench in political matters. Seeing that the Supreme Court is not solely the servant of the Federal Government, but is also the final arbiter between the Commonwealth and the States, it is of the highest constitutional importance that it should interpret the scope of its judicial duties in the strictest possible way. Then the question of our power is raised, and the effect of their statement is that the question is a. rather difficult one. The answer seems to depend upon the scope and meaning of the word "" judiciary."" Would such things be judicial or extra judicial? They cite upon^ that point American writers, whose opinion is that the power would be extra judicial, and as such could not be vested in the High Court. In the circumstances which presented themselves to me, I asked that that power should be given, and the question now arises as to whether or not we have it. I very much doubt that we have the power. I mentioned that in America, in seven out of eight cases, this is done by an amendment of the Constitution or by an original provision where the Constitution was recast. In Canada the power to create the Supreme Court as a Court of Appeal is contained in one short section of the Constitution; but under our Constitution we practically defined what the High Court was to be. I have not the Canadian section at hand, but it was a very short one - sectio n 101-simpl y enabling the Parliament of Canada to set up a Supreme Court of Appeal. It was under that section that the power was exercised, and in the Canadian election case of Valin v. Langlois, referred to by the Attorney General, the validity of its power, I think, was questioned. As the question, however, came before the Privy Council judicially they did not determine it. In other words, the question they had to determine arose on an appeal from two judgments of the Canadian Courts, and, therefore, it properly came before the Privy Council; but the point as to the power of the Canadian Parliament to give such a very wide jurisdiction as they did under the Act 54 and 55 Victoria, c. 25, referred to by the Attorney-General, was raised, at all events, and questioned. The question arises as to whether this jurisdiction is appellate or original. In England the power of reference to the Privy Council is regarded as an original jurisdiction. The Privy Council is an appellate tribunal, and I have always seen this referred to as an original jurisdiction of the Privy Council. Under section 75 of the Constitution, the High Court is given original jurisdiction in five matters, and under section 76 Parliament is entitled to invest the High Court with original jurisdiction in four other matters. It may confer original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter(i.) Arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation : (ii.) Arising under any laws made by the Parliament : (iii.) Of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction : (iv.) Relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. But there is nothing in section 76 enabling us to confer original jurisdiction in hypothetical cases. The power to confer original jurisdiction relates to a ""matter,"" and the word ""matter"" was inserted in the Constitution as being almost synonymous with, but a little wider than, the words ""causes"" and ""controversies"" which occur in the Constitution of the United States of America. Those causes or controversies must be judicial, and Congress has never attempted to give sucK a power to the Supreme Court of the United States of America.",32
71,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why does the honourable member suggest that ' matter ' ' would not 1 necessarily cover this proposal?,34
72,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We know that the word ""matter"" is used time after time as a legal term. The words originally proposed at the Adelaide sittings of the Convention were, I think, '' causes and controversies,"" as used in the American Constitution. .The Judicial Committee of the Convention, however, as shown at page 767 of Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution, recommended that that term should be widened, but in doing so they were careful to point out that there was no intention to take in extra judicial powers. - Mr HALL - Migh t not an Act of this Parliament be a matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution?",34
73,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not references under the Act; if the word ""matter"" means "" a judicial matter."" That is the point. I say that the Convention, in making that amendment of the Constitution Bill', never regarded ""matter"" as covering other than cases arising as between party and party, or matters in which the parties would not be present, the Court ing jurisdiction under some particular - ef Parliament, as in England it may have. So much for the question of original jurisbe diction. As to the question of appellate jurisdiction, clearly this cannot be appelcan late, because there is no Court from which an appeal could take place. Even under the Bill the decision of this Court is to final, so that there may be no appeal - for reconsideration on facts , to' the High Court. Thus the question of its lines being an appellate jurisdiction is excluded. I doubt that we can confer this power.. it were expedient .to give it I should' not hesitate to give it, but I ammerely sugthe gesting that the High Court itself may have to determine whether this power exists, or that the matter may go on to the Privy Council. The chances are that the Privy Council will havetodetermine it ultimately, because under this Bill' there is no Court which the issue could' arise. It: will to arise in some reference to the High Court that may be decided in the ordinary way of appeal from that Court to the Privy Council. We cannot abolish the appeal development. which will lie in the matter, because it is not an inter se matter within the meaning of the Judiciary part of the Constitution. I do not question the expediency of giving such a power where the issue is a clean I have already mentioned a case that was sent from the Bahamas; and I have redesire ferred to the disputed boundariesease. litigation The question of our jurisdiction in regard to. navigation, which is doubtful, might also be referred. It is. extremely doubtful whether the big Billbefore another place valid so far asit gives jurisdiction in Intraa state matters'-whether that is a power systemdiat exists under the Admiralty provisions - of the Constitution or under .the navigation power. That is a matter on which,, the issue: would be clean cut-,, and might,, course, be referred to. the Judiciary without very great danger of. its not being exhausted and thoroughly threshed out. The quespressed by me tion of our power to enable the GovernorGenenal to make Ordinances in connection with the Northern Territory,, which is no means absolutely settled,, is also an. issue that might.be referred.. But we cannot earte blanche to the Court, by handing over to it anAct of Parliament., to ascertain and forestall every issue that might arise - under it. If we referred, a Bill to the Court, and asked it to find out what porSo 'tion of it was valid and what portion, was: - not valid, we should be asking it to do Mr Glynn. havsomething that was absolutely beyond its Act competence. It would be impossible to exhaust the issues. There is no good purpose to served by getting, an imperfect construction of an Act; and a perfect construction be obtained only when a litigant raises a particular question in issue. For that reason, I doubt that this Bill is one which, be at this stage of the session a{ all events> should be passed. It is too wide. It does not follow advisory lines-, which are the ; applicable to a large extent in America and Canada, and also as regards the Privy If Council, because, to a large extent, it simply settles important points referred by parties or States concerned. By saying that the judgment of the Judiciary is to be final, we are really taking away frorri the High Court the power to reconsider its own decision given before a question that would berelevant to if had' been presented to the in Court. For these reasons, without saying have that I am not to some extent in sympathy with the principle of this legislation, I doubt the expediency of passing the Bill at this stage in the history of our judicial ME. HALL (Werriwa) [5.3,9] - The House is under an obligation to the Attorney-General for. the very complete statement he has given of the legal position in one. regard to the. measure submitted to us. I have no doubt that there isa very general to do everything possible to lessen and to cheapen' it, if that can be done, in connection with the High Court and' the interpretation of our Constitution. I am afraid, however,, that we shall find is that,, as long, as we continue to live under Federal system, which is-in reality a legal",34
74,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear., , bear.",35
75,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And which is, in my of opinion, very much better than the unified system advocated by the honourable member who has just cheered the sentiment ex",35
76,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bette r for lawyers-.. Mt. HALL - Not only for lawyers, but by also for the public. Try as we may to lessen) litigation,, one of the penalties which< give we shall have to pay for our Federal sys1 tem, under which the interests of the States may conflict with those of the Commonwealth, is continuous litigation, and', necessarily, litigation of a very costly character. far as the Bill aims at lessening that litigation, and getting rid of delays in connection with the settlement of constitutionalquestions, it should receive the support of' jail sections. Despite what has been said - by the honourable member for Angas, I sub.mit that the Bill, if it be found to be constitutional, will in practice cheapen litigation, and hasten the decision of legal questions. In this connection, let me refer to the proceedings in the boot trade case. - There the constitutionality of the common - rule was argued before the High Court on two occasions. In the first instance, the barristers in the case argued whether there was a dispute; if so, what was its nature, and whether this Parliament was empowered to provide for the establishment of a common rule provision. It being found that the decision of the constitutional question .was not necessary for the settlement of the - issue, it was passed over, but a few months later the same eminent counsel were called upon to again argue it, and whereas in the ""first case, when the question was argued with the facts, it cost the Commonwealth ,£1,094 6s. 7d., in the second case the cost was only £140 10s. 6d.",35
77,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But in the second case - advantage could be taken of what was said in the first case.,36
78,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think that the proceedings in the first case would rather tend to increase than to shorten the discussions in 'the second case. In the first case, eminent counsel had to sit and listen, day after day, to the history of the dealings of the 'boot trade employees with their employers, and to argument as to whether a real dispute existed, and that, of course, swelled the costs. But in the second case only the constitutional question was at issue, and the proceedings were therefore much shorter, - the speeches occupying only a little over two days. I cite that instance in of my contention that the measure should save the Commonwealth and the States considerable expense.",36
79,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What would be the position if the High Court said that a measure was constitutional and an appeal was lodged - under it?,36
80,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The barrister who had in his favour a decision of the High Court would be on velvet. In addition to saving - expense, we can, by passing the Bill, prevent the building up of a system which may - ultimately be found to have a false foundation. We thought that we had power to provide for a common rule, but when the question was tested it was found that we had not, and the machinery constructed to give effect to our legislation became useless. Had an appeal been made to the High Court in the first instance, much expense would have been saved. For those who desire precedent for the proposal, there is that of Canada and of Great Britain, where the highest Court in the land has been called upon to exercise just such a power as we wish to ask the High Court to exercise. Let me quote from the judgment of Lord VVynford in MCNaghten's case, 8 H.L.R., 724My Lords, I never doubted that your Lordships possess the power to call on the Judges to give their opinions upon questions of existing law, proposed to them as these questions have been. I myself recollect, that when I had the honour to hold the office of Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, I communicated to the House the opinions of the Judges on questions of this sort, framed with reference to the usury laws. Upon the opinion of the Judges thus delivered to the House by me, a Bill was founded, and afterwards passed into a law. Apparently, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords goes much further than it is proposed to ask the High Court to go, stating opinions regarding the law which are made the basis of legislation. That practice had the approval of the Lord Chancellor.",36
81,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Surely it is a better course to get advice first, and frame the law upon it, than to pass an Act, and ask for advice regarding it.",36
82,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member's' interjection reminds me of the oft-quotedTimco Danaos et dona ferentes. His suggestion is that of an enemy, rather than a friend. Were we to propose that the High Court should guide our legislation, there would be a howl of indignant protest. But we are surely treading safely if we propose to go only a short way on the path on which, in Great Britain, they support have gone a very long way. The honourable member for Angas has pointed out that eminent writers are not in entire agreement with the decision in M'Naghten's case. I acknowledge that. It has been followed by the Judiciary, but Stephen and others have commented adversely upon it. The question for us is, not whether the decision in that case was right, but whether the practice of referring questions to the Judges for their opinion is a proper one. No doubt, had the question been submitted in the ordinary way, in an action between parties, the same decision would have been given, and I contend that, it is a good practice for us to follow to get the opinion of the most eminent Judges of the land, when it is possible for us to do so, on difficult, constitutional questions. The honourable member for Angas suggests that it may not be possible for clear issues to be submitted to the High Court; but in the constitutional cases which have been tried here, it would have been a very simple thing. In the Brewery case, the question was whether the workers' trade mark provision was constitutional, regarding which a clear issue could easily have been submitted.",36
83,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Undoubtedl y a clear issue could be submitted in some cases, and it would be an advantage.",37
84,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The cases which have cost the Commonwealth so much have turned on questions regarding which clear issues could have been submitted to the High Court by the Attorney-General. The constitutionality of including the railway vants in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the constitutionality of the common rule and of the new Protection proposals, could easily have been referred to the High Court, and could have been settled more speedily and cheaply than has been the case.",37
85,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have been to the High Court a great number of times under the Arbitration Act, when, had this measure been in force, we might have gone only once.",37
86,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"An Attorney-General will know what is a clear issue, and will be prepared to submit such issues. If a clear issue were not submitted, the High Court would have the power to refuse to reply to the question, if , indeed, it will not that power in all cases. I submit, as a suggestion, that the operation of this Bill might be so extended as to allow other ties interested in our legislation to have similar .power to that exercised by the torney-General. If it is fair that Attorney-General of the Commonwealth should have the right to take the opinion the High Court about our legislation, it might be desirable to allow the Attorney General of any State which was affected by our legislation to also take the opinion of the High Court.' For example, we passed an Act which protected workers' trade marks, and there was some doubt as to whether the legislation is conapproach stitutional. It might very well happen a State Parliament might desire to give .similar protection, and find it necessary settle the doubt as to whether the Commonwealth legislation was valid. In cases where the powers of the States are affected by the exercise of what are alleged to be our powers, it might be advisable to allow the States, with the permission of the High Court, to get the opinion of the Court. Of course, the suggestion may be open to some objections that do not at present present themselves to me.",37
87,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member suggest that a State Attornev-General should have exactly the same power in relation to Commonwealth Statutes as the Commonwealth Attorney-General ?,37
88,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not exactly the same power; but I suggest that, by permission, the State Attorney-General ought to be able to obtain the opinion of the High Court.",37
89,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,In Canada there is a provision whereby such questions ca.n be submitted to Court with the consent of both serthe State and the Dominion.',37
90,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At any rate, some such provision might strengthen the Bill, and make it still more effective. Personally, I do not hope for any very great reform from this measure, as I think it is impossible to live in the Federal atmosphere without a. good deal of law; but if we can lessen the consequent delays we shall be doing our part of what should be done. It is because I believe that the .legislation will have a tendency in this direction that I support the second reading of this Bill.",37
91,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ballarat) [6.0] - I do not suppose that any one would gather the real significance of this measure from the manner of its reception in this House, when speeches, carefully thought out and prehave pared, like those of the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Angas, are not very eagerly followed by honourable par- members, whose number could be counted on one hand. No visitor to the gallery, at Atall events, would infer from the present the character of the proceedings that we were dealing with anything more notable than of a Dog Act in a State Parliament.",37
92,Mr WEST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There must be a contempt for the law !,37
93,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whether we feel contemptuous or otherwise towards the law, our first business is to know something about it. and that is not so easy as it seems. Like the honourable member for Angas, I the really practical object of this that measure with as much friendliness as possible. If a means could be devised by to which questions possessing a real unity, when they form the subject of an Act of Parliament, might be immediately remitted to a high tribunal for the purpose of being dealt with at once, and as a whole, in accordance either with what we roughly term first principles, or with the Federal Constitution, I should be cordially in its favour. When the honourable member for Angas, in the Federal Convention of 1897, first broached a proposition of this general character, though differing considerably from that now before us, I was one who gave it a most sympathetic hearing. That is thirteen years ago. My difficulty then was to see how the proposition could be applied, and that is my difficulty now, reinforced by experience, most of it gained outside direct legal practice.",37
94,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member must not forget the cases in Canada, where a similar law has been applied.",38
95,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It seems to me that any benefits to be obtained from this legislation depend wholly on our power bo confine it within a definite area; and measures permitting this definiteness are very rare. This Bill, which is to lay the foundation of an almost entirely new practice, the object of which is to test measures after they are passed, contains not a single limitation upon its use. We might put all the measures of a session into one single Act and then send it to the High Court with an invitation for its judgment; though, of course, such a preposterous attempt would necessarily be condemned to utter futility. Even a short clause, when it is carefully and thoroughly examined in all its relations, may be found to be packed with different conflicting issues. There is not the slightest guarantee, or any endeavour to guarantee, that only a single issue, or, at most, a few issues, shall be embodied in any measure it is proposed to submit to the High Court. I admit, again, that it would not be easy, in most cases, to limit the issues in that way-that it would not be easy to draft a Bill so that one, or, at all events, only few questions might be involved, and those of a precise character. But in the very nature of the case, unless the questions are limited in number, and those plain and clear, the Bill before us will not be worth the paper on which it is printed. Here, without the slightest limitation, we have a measure which will allow the remission to the High Court of anything or everything that Parliament may choose to remit. The hastening and cheapening of litigation, referred to by the honourable member for Werriwa, are most desirable; and it is from that stand-point that I share that honourable member's anxious desire that a Bill of this kind should be employed wherever it can. I approach this proposal, therefore, with feelings of entire friendliness; and am not in the least affected by the jocose arguments as to its effect on the legal profession. First of all, the legal profession can look very well after itself, and if it could not, members of Parliament, particularly members of this kind of Parliament, with this kind of legislation, are always feeding the lawyers-chasin g them with business, in point of fact. One patent characteristic of every developing civilization is the multiplication of causes of personal differences, of recognised human rights, and of the classes of property; it is these that, year by year, are furnishing an ever-widening field for legal processes. We need not have the faintest alarm lest we deprive lawyers of their occupation by such Statutes as this. From another point of view. it is to the interest of the legal profession that on great general issues there should be a clear road for all ; the minor issues are quite enough to keep them well employed. However,. I am discussing this measure as one who has not been in active practice for ten years, and who has had to consider legal questions only in so far as they came before Parliament. It appears to me, first, that the case made out by the Attorney-General was the best that could be made out for a very undesirable form of this proposal, and it was a bad case at that. Very few of the honourable gentleman's precedents take us far on the road. Some of them include what may be called "" pointers,"" and some indicate possibilities and tendencies; but they are all in the raw or in the rough. A great deal more will be needed on which to base a sound proposition of this kind, which, to be successful, must be made specific where this is left vague and general. It ought to clearly indicate or provide machinery for defining the necessarily abstract issues in question, so that they may be submitted free from the entanglements of abstract principles. The honourable member for Angas has contributed off-hand, out of his great personal experiences of recent litigation, a number of precedents and illustrations which undermined, or, in some cases, overwhelmed the Attorney-General's several positions. The honourable member has made it clear that this Bill, instead of providing for the submission of a plain and simple proposition, capable^ under certain conditions, of being handled by the High Court",38
96,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Simila r legislation has been in force in Canada for twenty or thirty years.,39
97,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Ver y little use has been made of it.,39
98,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,""" Very little use ! """,39
99,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and then in particular classes of questions-tw o or three classes at the outside, but mainly in one; whereas this Bill leaves it open to Parliament to remit an Act of any character whatever, no matter what its length or complexity of character.",39
100,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I expressly disclaimed that. I said that, whereas under the Canadian law, any kind of measure could be remitted, under this Bill only one kind could.",39
101,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The only limitation is to some question of law affecting the validity of an Act or enactment.,39
102,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Quite so-the validity of an Act.,39
103,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But an Act may include a dozen different constitutional tions.,39
104,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Of course; it may include a hundred!,39
105,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The High Court is to be called upon to decide abstract legal issues, some to be declared constitutional, some unconstitutional, some partly constitutional, and so on, distinguishing and fining, continually in the vague. The Attorney-General does not deny that?",39
106,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not; but it been done in Canada, and answers have been given to various sections submitted, not once, but dozens of times.",39
107,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Unde r this Bill we could send the Land Tax Assessment Act to the High Court.,39
108,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainl y we could. . Mr DEAKIN - And how many issues', constitutional or legal, are there in that measure ?",39
109,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Certainl y not more than two.,39
110,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,More like twenty.,39
111,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the honourable member name more than two?,39
112,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Speaking memory, there are the principle of graduation, the principle of exemption, and the principle of appropriating land, three fruitful illustrations, to go no further. Again these branch out. How far is the Court to pursue its divisions and subdivisions? They are numerous. How much guidance is to be required of it?",39
113,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Privy Council hasdecided questions quite as intricate by answering a number of questions seriatim.,39
114,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"As a rule, the answers to those questions give only general guidance. As I have said, in most instances, to get general guidance beforehand, and"" draft your Bill on it, would be much safer than to draft the Bill first and then remit it to the Court.",39
115,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member suggest that we should submit hypothetical questions' to the Court ?,39
116,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; because I know it would be futile. Abstract questions are nearly as bad in most instances. I have already pointed out that I am in sympathy with the object in view; but it can be achieved only by specific delimitations of the clearest character.. The impossibility of such a delimitation in practice is the reason why the plan was not embodied in the Constitution thirteen years ago, at the Adelaide Convention. quesThe honourable and learned member is not aware thaf\l was then as sympathetic with rhe obju^'aimed at as I am now; but this measure simply throws the door wide open, enabling any kind of Act to be sent up to have its validity tested. I put aside the ordinary legal difficulty of disentangling the exact effect of an Act-ho w far it re- goes in a particular direction, or whether any restriction or limitation is implied, bringing it within the scope of the has proper jurisdiction. The fact is that, when you decide one issue, you probably decide a number of other issues, which may not be included in the Act at all. Decisions as to the validity or invalidity of an Act as judicial or semi-judicial determinations have to be taken into account in other circumstances outside the scope of the Act, in every-day life. *",39
117,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They declare the law.,39
118,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable and learned member sees, then, that in so declaring it, they must be applying it to an infinity of other cases which are not before the Court.",39
119,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Potentiall y an infinitefrom number of cases.,39
120,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In some cases the decisions would be fruitful, in others not. We cannot determine.",39
121,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Pu t it the other way. If we do not do this, then potentially there will be an infinite number of cases to determine the law. .",40
122,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member can take whichever branch of the argument he likes. He must, to a certain extent, take both. If he recognises that, in deciding a case, probably an abstract case, on abstract grounds, the Judges authoritatively affect the whole law in that regard, he admits the difficult task imposed upon them even when they are asked to sanction an apparently simple measure, since it may involve a principle capable of being applied, to numberless other transactions.",40
123,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We have decided that the Act to which the honourable member refers shall apply to those whose circumstances are suitable.,40
124,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That disposes of the honourable and learned member's assertion of the simplicity of this dangerous procedure. He said the reference would be readily disposed of-that it would mean merely a proposal of Parliament laid aside if illegal, adopted if legal. Any one ing to him would have gained an impression of extreme simplicity",40
125,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A law to close all shops at six o'clock applies to all shops built, or to be built. Are-weto be frightened of shadows ?",40
126,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not of the shadow of - six o'clock, that has no relevancy. Contrast the vast field of considerations through which the High Court Judges must move before they give, on an abstract question, a decision which may be fruitful beyond the possibilities of their assessment. They are asked to do so in the most vague and general fashion. Does not the honourable and learned member now see the perils which surround this proposal? It gives pause to those of us who are most anxious to provide a short cut, and most eager, as members of the Legislature, to obtain the great advantage of having decisions given on questions of tnis kind without delay. Courts deal with concrete cases and concrete applications of principles. The issues - under this Bill are all and always abstract. We must take those perils into serious consideration, not wave them away as the honourable and learned member does. I feel that on this question it would be hopeless to endeavour to address oneself satisfactorily to the House. I speak practically on the spur of the moment from points suggested by the debate as it has . [ 3o] z proceeded. No doubt in this, as in every other case, the measure will be voted in any event, and therefore it is notincumbent upon us to put out the last ounce of power we possess in order to demonstrate, as we would, to members who were open-, minded, reasons why they should take a view adverse to that of the Government.",40
127,Mr FENTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why not put out the last ounce of strength, if it is so necessary?",40
128,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Because it will, and can, have no effect. We cannot hope to convince honourable members opposite.",40
129,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We did not think that when over there.,40
130,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; because there was always a chance of convincing us, and honourable members opposite took advantage of it. Many embarrassments that we suffered periodically were due to that course. If any honourable member regards this measure as being made necessary by some inherent blindness or perverseness of the legal species, let him recall, first, the difficulty of expressing in terms, without any possibility of misconstruction, what the law listenactually is when you know what it is. Next, let him devise some scheme by which, when he has once expressed it, you shall be able to stop the clock of the universe, so that human life, its circumstances, and relations, shall no longer continually change as they always have done and will do, making the law of yesterday always one day older with every day that passes. It is the new and unforeseen conditions thus created that force us into more or less strained interpretations of the old law, in order to keep up to date, and in pace with the march of human'progress.",40
131,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Coul d not the Court decide whether the Land Tax Act was legal ?,40
132,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They'could ; but that is not the aspect with which I am now dealing. Honourable members approve this measure, as I approve its aim, as an attempt at a short cut. They see in it the possibility of fruitful legislation, so to speak, for the preservation of legislation. I see that, and would support it, too, if I could, but what is required is a most carefully framed and adjusted general measure shaped to that precise and particular end. Then the particular kind of questions can be effectively and properly answered. No doubt such cases will come under this Bill, but with them will come a harvest of other cases unsuitable in their nature or circumstances, related or unrelated, but all alike remitted to the Court for similar treatment, however dissimilar they may be. The honourable member who preceded me put hisfingeron what seems to be a safety valve, not provided in the measure, but, for all that, existing. We cannot compel the Judges to decide more than they feel justified in deciding in any given case. We cannot oblige the Judges to pronounce upon every word or every sentence in an Act, so as to give them unquestionable authority.",40
133,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is why, time and again, we have to go to the Court to decide practically the same thing.",41
134,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"What may look like, but is not necessarily, the same thing, especially when one man's interest induces him to say it is, and another man's to show that a distinction exists. The first question for rhe Court, in each case, will be whether the distinction is of such a practical and clear character as to cause them to take a new path, or so shadowy as to allow them, as they always prefer, to fall in behind the line of precedents already established. Recognising all that can be, and ought to be, accomplished by some such provision as this, I assert that the Court cannot be compelled to attempt impossibilities, and that the great safety valve of the measure will be found in the Court itself. When it is clear that every measure has to be viewed in relation to the precedents it will set up, and the law it will determine, we can understand the check capable of being applied, and certain to be applied. It will be possible to frame a measure which, if remitted to the Court for its consideration, the Court being bound to take into account every principle of law involved in it, and every departure from accepted principles made by it, would take the Judges the rest of their natural lives to determine its constitutionality. The only hope of usefulness for this procedure will be found when the Acts submitted are nf the briefest possible character, aimed as directly as possible at some central and important point needing to be determined, and, as far as possible, concrete in character. 'In those circumstances this mav prove to be the short cut we are seeking. The misfortune is that we are throwing the door wide open for the submission to the Court of all sorts of abstract measures which can never be effectively dealt with in this way. In the words of Chief Justice Tindal, quoted by the honourable and learned member for Angas, similar facts brought before a Court assume myriads of different forms, shapes, and colours, in different lights and in different surroundings. It is only those who have had occasion either in the profession or as students outside it, to realise the enormous intricacies, and the perpetually increasing complexity of human affairs, who are slow to realise that the law attempts to confine all human actions, rights, and obligations within the artificial limits of the formal words of Statutes, or to link them together by principles slowly evolved out of human experience. We are slow to discover that the law is not a mere network for the harassing of citizens; it is, in fact, the very breath of social relation that our citizens breathe from day to day, and without which they cannot conduct the simplest transactions of everyday life.",41
135,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is marvellous that we are able to obtain any decisions.,41
136,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is, and for good reasons. When you start defining philosophically and metaphysically, you can keepon refining like Burke, who. . . went on refining, And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining. You can go on refining ad infinitum.",41
137,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Jus t as they used to discuss in the Middle Ages how many soub could dance upon the point of a needle.,41
138,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I think it was how many imps could dance on the point,, though perhaps my honourable friend does not like to refer to his relations in that way Reference has been made to a decision givenby the Commonwealth Conciliation andArbitration Court. My honourable and learned friend, the member for Angas, happened to be engaged in that case, and when I asked him, "" How many important points of the first class were involved in that case?"" he said, ""The Judge found fourteen."" There may be any number of"" such propositions embodied in the sameBill. Do we not all realise the almost herculean' task that the determination of such a tangleof points must cast upon the wisest bench of Justices that ever sat. Still they canprotect themselves. They will be able tocondition their judgments. They have always shown themselves capable of doing that, and future generations of Judges will' not fall away in that regard. Tbey canalso give partial judgments. They are not compelled to consider every possible principle involved in every measure. Who are we to find fault with them, since we ourselves are now asked to cVermine the validity of this very Bill itself? Honourable members opposite, in t'.ie most cheerful manner possible, are going to vote for its validity. How simple it seems to them; how comparatively indifferent the matter that honourable members opposite are seeking to transfer to the shoulders of the Justices. Those learned lawyers will not be able to take it in this light-hearted fashion. They will have to view it very seriously and deal with it elaborately. Among all the tasks cast upon them, probably the most difficult that has ever confronted them or any other Court will be found wrapped up in some of the Bills likely to be referred to the Justices by this Legislature in order that they may try to find out either what we really meant, what we intended to mean, or what, if we had understood the law, we should have meant. Having made allowance for our manifold shortcomings, and for the unpropitious atmosphere in which we work, as compared with the calmness of their judicial chamber, they will proceed to make the best of the task. We shall, at all events, have made one more experiment. I hope it will be useful. Within limits, I can understand that it might be useful and profitable. As it is we have to take our chance. is a case of hit or miss. More than that, we must wait for the judgment of the High Court before we know whether or not this measure itself is constitutional-whether , framed as it is, it comes within our constitutional powers. That in itself is a nice question on which it is unnecessary to dwell. It is much more than doubtful. If the Court get past it there is a perfect flower garden of litigation in view.",41
139,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does this Bill extend the limits of the flower garden?,42
140,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It opens the gate into that flower garden, since, instead of having to decide concrete cases between party and party, based on certain definitely-proved facts and upon fixed principles, the High Court will be called upon, free from the contest of parties, to consider more or less abstract questions arising out of constitutional interpretations. For one thing, they will not be required, as you require us, Mr Speaker, to "" connect their argu[230]- 2 ments "" under any parliamentary censorship.",42
141,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,42
142,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bendigo) [8.0] The substance of this Rill may be gathered from three clauses, providing, firstly, that the Governor General may refer to the High Court for hearing or determination any question of law as to the validity of an Act of the Federal Parliament, and that it may hear and determine the same; secondly, that the High Court may direct any person or class of persons claiming to be interested to be notified of the hearing of such matters, and that they may be heard thereon; and, thirdly, that the determinations of the High Court upon such questions shall be final and conclusive. It would seem upon the face of this Bill that it affords a ready means of expediting, facilitating, and cheapening the settlement of constitutional questions, and I , for one, would be quite prepared to admit that any practical legislation having such an object in view ought to be welcomed by Parliament. In support of this measure, the Attorney-General said that he did not think it was unconstitutional, firstly, because no question of State Rights was involved; and, secondly, because it was not prohibited by the Constitution. I should like, with great respect, to remind him that there is involved another question which he apparently omitted to consider, namely, as to whether the It Federal Parliament has the power to pass such a measure. That is the third question with which the honourable gentleman has not adequately dealt. This Parliament has only limited, specified, and enumerated powers.",42
143,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I dealt with that.,42
144,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not hear the honourable member refer to any part of the Constitution giving authority to pass such legislation as this. Although the Bill, upon its face, purports to give the High Court jurisdiction to hear and determine these questions, I fail to find in the Constitution any section which authorizes the Federal Parliament to pass it. If we had the authority there would be no reason for opposing it upon constitutional grounds, but it would appear to me that the argument of abstract questions as to the validity of an Act could hardly be carried on as proposed under conditions calculated to secure efficiency and clearness, and to secure as satisfactory a determination as can be obtained in specific cases, controversies, or ronflicts. As to our power to pass this Bill, I need not go over the ground that has been adequately covered by the honourable member for Angas and the Leader of the Opposition. Reference has been made in support of the principle of the determination of abstract questions of abstract law to an old practice by which questions of law were leferred for determination to the Judges of the House of Lords. I would point out that although that practice did exist, no one ever suggested that a question should be referred to the House of Lords to determine the validity of an Act of the Imperial Parliament. A reference to the House of Lords to get an answer to specific quesUons as to the common law of England, or f-n interpretation of the Statute law of LZngland, is an entirely different matter f.'rom referring to a Court of law the delirmination of the validity of an Act of Parliament. Then, again, reference has been made to the Canadian precedent. No doubt under the Canadian Constitution there is a power to refer to the Supreme Court of Canada important questions of law or fact touching provincial legislation, or the appellate jurisdiction as to educational matters vested in the Governor General by the British-North America Act, or any other Act or law touching the constitutionality of any legislation of the Parliament of Canada. That power was conferred by section 3 of 54 and 55 V i c , ch. 25.",42
145,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is an additional constitutional power.,43
146,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is an addition to the Constitution, because the Canadian cause it saysConstitution was directly passed by the Imperial Parliament. This was evidently an amendment of the Canadian Constituarising tion.",43
147,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is there not such provision in the original Act?,43
148,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No , it appears in an amending Act, and honourable memthe bers will observe how comprehensive is. It enables the determination of tions arising as to the validity of Dominion and Provincial legislation. This cases. Bill, however, merely proposes to refer to the High Court the determination Commonwealth, and not State legislac^e tion. The Canadian Act is to some by a party. extent different from this Bill. It clares that the opinions of the Supreme Court passed under the authority the Act shall not be regarded as judicial determinations, but that they shall be regarded as advisory only. The second feature is that although those determinations are advisory or consultative, and not judicial, an appeal lies from them to the Privy Council. Therefore, these references to the Supreme Court of Canada for the determination of constitutional questions are expressly specified as advisory only, and are subject to the safeguard of an appeal to the Privy Council for review. That is a very different proposition from that now before us. This measure is brought forward evidently on the assumption that it is an exercise of part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, and that the Parliament has the authority to refer these questions for the determination of the High Court as part of that judicial power. It goes on further to provide that the determinations of the High Court in these matters are to be final and conclusive. All prospect or possibility of a revision by the Privy Council is, therefore, shut out by this Bill, assuming it to be valid and constitutional. It would seem to me that whatever may be the argument in favour of the convenience of such a method of settling constitutional questions, we are brought up against another constitutional question as a condition precedent to the passing of this Bill.",43
149,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not sub-section 1 of section 76 give that power?,43
150,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I shall come to that. According to all the decisions and authorities which I have read, the judicial power means the power to decide cases between contesting parties. The Constitution in section 76. contemplates that, beParliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter under this Constitutionor involving its interpretation, or arising a under any law made by the Parliament. The word ""matter"" is undoubtedly equivalent to, and a mere substitution for, expression in the American Constitution it "" controversy "" or "" case."" The provision quesdoes not say that the High Court may deal both with the validity of an Act, apart from The use of the word ""matter"" shows that an issue must be raised by reof sponsible or interested parties. I do not how a matter can arise unless raised A case generally arises dethrough some person or persons wishing to assert a right or to enforce a duty, and of implies a plaintiff and a defendant.",43
151,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-Why give the word "" matter "" such a limited meaning?",44
152,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am stating the view of the framers of the Constitution. Sir Edmund Barton, speaking at the Convention, said-pag e 768 of Quick and Garraiv's Annotated ConstitutionThe word ""matters"" merely indicates the scope within which the judicial power is to be exercised, but no matter can be dealt with until it comes before the authorities in the form of a case or some judicial process which will be regulated by the Judiciary Act. The meaning of "" j'udicial power"" is discussed by Miller at page 314 of his work on the Constitution of the United States, where he saysIt is the power of a Court to decide and pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parlies who bring a case before it for decision. On page 315 he makes the following quotation from a statement by Chief Justice Marshall:A case arises within the meaning of the Constitution when any question respecting the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States has assumed such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting on it. On page 316 he saysBut it has been over and again held by the Court that all it can do in that regard is to decide such questions as involve a construction of its provisions, and only those when"" they are brought before it in a suit between proper parties. That is the view of authorities dealing with the United States Constitution. Story, on page 423 of his work on the Constitution, saysWe have seen that by law the President possesses the right to require the written advice and opinions of his Cabinet Ministers, upon all questions connected with their respective Departthe ments. But he does not possess a like authority in regard to the Judicial Department. That branch of the government can be called upon only 10 decide controversies, brought before in a legal form; and, therefore, are bound to abstain from any extra-judicial opinions upon points of law, even though solemnly requested by the Executive. Kemp is given as the authority. seems conclusive. Under the Constitution of the United States, the Executive cannot put abstract questions of law to the Supreme Court; and, on the same line of reasoning, under our Constitution - the Executive cannot put to the High Court questions as to the constitutional validity of our Acts. But the Bill is framed on the assumption that the Executive can put such questions to the High Court, and call upon the Court to answer them. I wish now to refer to the possible inefficiency of this proposed method of settling constitutional difficulties, assuming the power to exist, and admitting the convenience and economy said to be associated with this method. Such a question as "" Is this Land Tax Act talid ?""' could hardly be argued in the same direct and satisfactory manner if it were put to the Court by the Executive, as if raised in an action by the Commissioner c-f Land Tax against a taxpayer. In an action to recover taxes, the defendant would know what the real issue was, he would know what his defence was, and would have an open field, with the result that the question would be argued with greater intensity, keenness, and ability than if submitted in the abstract by some one representing the Commonwealth, or a State, or a possible taxpayer. The Bill contemplates that the Governor General may refer to die Court any question as to the validity of an Act. It appears to be proposed to put the Act and the Constitution before the Court, and to say, "" Is this measure valid?""' There might be some unobserved portion of such a measure, regarding which there had been no controversy up to the time of its submission to the High Court, which might escape argument, but controversy regarding it might afterwards be raised. Yet the Court would have been called to pronounce on the validity of the Act as a whole, and might have pronounced - it valid, whereupon its determination would, under the Bill, be final and conclusive, and not open to subsequent review. I believe that the Court has not yet admitted that its decisions are final and conclusive upon itself. It is generally understood that the decisions of House of Lords are so, but the Supreme Court of the United States does not recog-. nise that principle, and in the Legal Tender them cases it reversed its decision upon reconsideration and review, because it thought that a mistake had been made. Yet under the Bill, once the High Court has proThat nounced an Act or a provision to be valid, there will be no opportunity for reconsideration to deal with points which may have escaped observation, or to take advantage of knowledge which may have been gained by subsequent experience.",44
153,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is there any likelihood of the common rule decision being reconsidered ?,44
154,Sir JOHN QUTCK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is a possibility. Justices Isaacs and Higgins expressly reserved the right, when sitting in the Full Court, to review a previous decision of that body.",44
155,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They were severely censured hy ihe Conservative journal of this city for doing so.,45
156,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not say that their attitude is a right or that it is a wrong one; it would be improper to express such an opinion now. I am merely stating what has been the practice of the House of Lords, and of the Supreme Court of the United States, and giving the dicta of two of our Justices. It has been said that it is better to have certain law, even though it may be wrong law, than to have uncertain law, and there may be reason in that. It is for the Parliament to say whether the High Court, which has not hitherto been so bound, shall in future be bound by previous decisions in the general bulk of its jurisdiction. This would introduce a new feature into its jurisdiction, and one which should not be created without consideration of its wisdom and propriety.",45
157,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is not every judgment final and conclusive in the sense in which the words are used in the Bill?,45
158,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Onl y in so far as the case to which it applies is concerned, not as a precedent.",45
159,Mr W,NORTHERN TERRITORY,H. IRVINE - A decision would not bind the Court in future cases. That is why the provision is useless.,45
160,Sir JOHN QUICK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The provision is open to the construction that the decision of the High Court shall be final and conclusive. It continues, ""and not subject to appeal."" Let me point out the futility of these words. Under the Constitution there may be an appeal to the Privy Council on leave being granted in certain cases. The only absolute bar to an appeal to the Privy Council is that the decision has been given in a question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. Section 74 of the Constitution providesNo appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council from a decision of the High Court upon which any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of any two or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council. That section limits the right of appeal; and now it is proposed to include in this Bill a limitation or qualification of that right as supplementary to the limitation in the Constitution j and. as such, of course, it will be null and void. I occupy much the same attitude as that of the honourable member for Angas. I should like to see some method provided, if a practical method can be devised, to expedite and cheapen the method of settling these constitutional questions so as to prevent delay and uncertainty. Still we are surrounded and faced by constitutional difficulties and restraints which cannot be ignored, but which, however, to my mind, are not so serious as to make me assume an attitude of strong opposition to the Bill. We have the knowledge that the decision of these matters will first and last lie with the High Court, and if the Court feel that there are legal and constitutional difficulties in the exercise of the jurisdiction, no doubt it will say so. There appears, however, to be a reserve power in the Constitution, as well as in the Judiciary Act, which up to the present has hardly been used to the extent to which it might. In order to determine these constitutional questions promptly and economically, the patties, with the acquiescence of the Government, might join in friendly action without the necessity of resorting to expensive preliminary proceedings, or going into evidence. Such actions might be launched, with a plaintiff and a defendant, and the whole question involved referred in the form of a special case to the High Court for immediate determination. That method might have been utilized more effectually and more often than it has been, and as it was in the case in which the invalidity of the common rule was decided. That question was settled on a case stated by Mr Justice Higgins, and similar cases might be determined in the same way without the necessity of the proposed amendment of the principal Act, the validity and efficiency of which course may well be questioned. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (Jurisdiction of High Court as to constitutional questions referred by the Governor General, &c).",45
161,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Angas) [8.31] - This clause seems to cover the rest of the Bill. It is very hard to know what to do with a Bill of this class, because it opens up such a new field, and there is a desire to make the legislation efficacious if it is to be tried. Could the Attorney-General find some means of confining the measure to such questions as have been sent to the High Court of Canada? I remember that the Fisheries question there was almost an abstract question, but it involved some matter between the Provinces, and there were no subordinate questions that could be raised. The Bahamas case was the only one I remember as having been sent on to the Privy Council by the Executive. The Privy Council will not interfere in other cases, except at the instance of both Colonies affected, say, South Australia and New South Wales, on an Act of Parliament passed for the purpose by both 'States. In fact, the Privy Council takes rather a high stand against the reference of abstract questions unless they come with the authority of an Act. The point in that case was the right of the Crown in regard to a person committed for contempt, - and the question was submitted by the Attorney-General. Such cases, however, are so exceptional that the Times referred to the Bahamas case as calling into operation an - extraordinary power vested in the Privy Council. I do not know that this clause - should not be confined to matters inter se, which would make it consistent with the rest of the Bill. This raises, perhaps, the biggest question under the Constitution, and, by consequence, one on which no appeal lies from the High Court, except by permission of the Court itself; and, besides, there would not be the doubts as to the proposed new section 93 which provides that the determination of the Court upon the matter shall be final and conclusive, and not subject to any appeal. The honourable member for Bendigo has properly pointed out that it is only in inter ters that the decision of the High Court is final.",45
162,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member said that the decision is not final even then.,46
163,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That may be; hut, so far as we know, the intent appears to be to deny the right of appeal in those cases, except on the certificate of the High Court. No one could throw light on this question better than the honourable member for Flinders, who was concerned in the memorable argument as to the meaning of "" inter se."" In regard to other matters, appeals as of grace cannot be taken away; we may limit the number of appeals as of right under section 74, but the right of appeal as of grac^ - cannot be taken away by the words of proposed section 93. In Canada it has been - decided that similar words did not prevent .appeal in the Admiralty cases.",46
164,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This does not take away the petition of rights?,46
165,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; but that question does not arise here; the petition of rights is merely the method where there is judicial power. I am glad the honourable member made that observation, because it throws a light on the meaning of "" judicial power."" Section 78 of the Constitution providesThe Parliament may make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth or a State in respect of matters within the limits of the judicial power. I suggested that that section should be inserted, because otherwise proceedings would have to be by petition rrf - which the Crown need not grai a matter of fact, never does - ..„.. , ^cp*- on s the authority of an Act of Parliament in connection with torts. When that section was under discussion in the Federal Convention, and [ tabled an amendment, Sir Edmund Barton said that if we confined it to the limits of the judicial power, which are clearly known, no objection would be raised. Therefore the words "" judicial power "" tvere put in, and they, I believe, run by implication through the whole of the section, and any extra judicial power conferred by this Bill may be held to be invalid. But the decision of the High Court under this new section 93 will not be final, because there will lie an appeal to the Privy Council. Are we at this stage, which I think is rather premature, to hand over to the Privy Council, finally and deliberately, the appellate jurisse matdiction? Do what we may, we"" shall not be able to accomplish the object of having a final decision on a somewhat hypothetical question by the High Court, because, after the High Court has laid down the rule, it may be sent on to the Privy Council on an issue between parties. The Judiciary Act of 1908 attempts to prevent these issues going to the Privy Council by denying original jurisdiction to the other Courts; but that does not deny original jurisdiction to the High Court, and it is not an inter se matter. I am not prepared to say at the moment to what extent the Judiciary Act will block this issue being raised in any subordinate Court; but the High Court will be disinclined, I think, if it has the power, to deny the right of appeal to the Privy Council in a matter which has not been settled on an issue between parties. There were two cases settled in Canada, one on the question of the Admiralty jurisdiction; and it was declared that the decision of the Supreme Court in 'the matter was to be final and conclusive, but the Privy Council afterwards held that the words of the section did not take away the right of appeal as of grace, though it took away the appeal as of right. I do not desire to say any more on the matter, but, 'with the Attorney-General, I regret that we have not had more, time to consider a Bill of such far-reaching importance, and one we should like to see as perfect as possible, if the experiment is to be tried.

In the circumstances, I shall offer no further remark on the clause.",47
167,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [8.45] - I am very glad that this matter is to be put right. The amendment inserted by the Committee in this measure was the greatest disappointment that any student of Defence matters could have, but a readier way might have been found out of the difficulty than that adopted by the Attorney General. The anxiety of the Committee was to insure that any ranker should have the opportunity of rising to commissioned rank.",47
168,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That was not what was behind the amendment.,47
169,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unde r the amendment, the ranker would have had no better chance of gaining a commission than if it had not been carried, because no rankerwould have a chance of going up and passing as a His very occupation would have made him unfitted to direct his mind into the particular chanthis nels of learning likely to occupy the students of the College. Some means ought to be provided whereby rankers.may be promoted without having to pass as 1I have liked to see the Ministry stick to their point about the age below which apMili - plicants must pass into the College. What that is needed is an additional proviso enabling Forces the Governor General in Council, on the age recommendation of the Director-General of the prethe Forces, to appoint any member of the Forces to a commission without his passing through the College. While we have the present organization, we expect to have, in the Director-General of the Forces, the keenest and best soldier in our employ, and he would not recommend for a commissionof any ranker or non-commissioned officer who was unworthy of promotion. If he found up that a warrant-officer or colour-sergeantand a man in either rank would certainly be over the age of twenty-seven-deserved "" promotion, and considered that such proacmotion would be in the interests of the or Forces, he would recommend it to the Got is vernor-General in Council, who would give to the man a commission and suitable emamendployment. As the Ministry prefers, howthe ever, to amend the Bill in another for place, and we shall have an opporany tunity of dealing with the amendment when nineit comes back to us for our approval, I at this stage, content myself with on record my conviction that the best way to serve the interests of the rank and file of the Permanent Forces in this regard is by some such direct method as I have suggested.",47
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parramatta) [8.50] - Our only contention is that there should be some way across from the Citizen Forces to the Permanent Forces wherever and whenever an officer feels his ambitions lie that way, and can prove incontestibly that he has the requisite qualifications for transfer. That, I understand, is the principle underlying the vote carried in Committee last week. So long as it is provided for in the completed Bill, no matter what phraseology may be used, I do not think there will be very much difficulty so far as I know the minds of honourable members on this side. We have contended all through that there should be an opportunity for the ranker to get a commission in the Permanent Forces if he has the requisite soldierly qualifications and the necessary education.

The net effect is that persons who are students at a theological college will, while they remain so, be exempt from training, but, on ceasing to be theological students, will be subject to the full effects of the Act unless exempted by some other provision. If , for example, they become clergymen they will continue to be exempt; otherwise not.",48
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parramatta) [8.53] - The new clause does not quite compass all that I think is in the Attorney General's mind. It covers only those who may actually be students in a theological college. There are in certain churches many theological students who are outside theological colleges, but who have to pass their examinations just the same. clause would not exempt them - The difficulty would be met if we added after the word ""students"" the words ""or ""for a religious profession or calling."" That would include all students connected with the churches who have not the privilege of going to theological institutions, and among them hundreds of worthy ministers who, while on probation for four years, and having to pass four annual examinations, go out to preach. In effect, they have to go through the whole course as though they were students in a college.",48

179,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Capricornia) [8.57] - I think that if the Minister would exempt children of parents who have conscientious obiections to their being trained in the use of arms he would meet the trouble to which the honourable member for Parramatta has referred. I am aware that a good many people might possibly say that they had conscientious objections to their 'children being trained in the use of arms, and that some people who claim to have conscientious objections very often prove to have no '-onscience. But, as 1 pointed out last week, there are in Australia a number of people who have very serious conscientious objections to their children being so trained. In looking through my correspondence the other day I found a letter which I regret I had not with me on a previous occasion when I was endeavouring to impress upon This the Minister the necessity for exempting children whose parents had conscientious objections to their being trained in the use of arms. The letter is as followsFriends' Meeting House, The Hon. W. G. HIGGS, M.P. Hon. Sir,-In view of the fact that this Parliament is now reconsidering the Act passed by its predecessor providing for the Military and Naval Services of the Commonwealth, may we, - of the Religious Society of Friends, once more press upon you our conviction that International Peace and Goodwill are not impracticable ideals, and that the nation which kee^s steadily in view the rights of neighbouring peoples equally with its own, honestly endeavouring to conduct its affairs in the spirit which takes away all occasion of strife, is more secure than that which relies solely on armaments and on so-called preparedness for war. History's records prove how easily a reliance on military pre-eminence overrides the sense of abstract right, and has led nation after nation to its downfall. What practical advances have already been made in the cause of Peace between the nations l Fifty years ago arbitration was an unknown and untried resource; now who will question its practicability? Month by month new treaties of arbitration between nations are being signed, and the Hague Convention, created to formulate the principle in a World's Court of Appeal, marks a practical triumph tor which mankind may well thank God and take courage. The steady transference of political power to the workers also is making war less and less "" a game for kings,"" be they wise or unwise, "" to play at,"" while commercial interests - ever increasing are becoming a more potent factor for the maintenance of peace. Nor can we forget the power of tact and kindly consideration in overcoming difficulties as exemplified in the life and work of our late K in g ; the manifest desire for right, and just dealing calling forth like feelings in others. We are concerned that our young Commonwealth may in all its dealings seek to emulate these noble qualities, and not throw back the moral sense of our children upon conceptions of life which have been discredited, and ideals which transgress in every way the spirit of universal brotherhood. From our reading of the Defence Act, above referred to, it would appear subject to the Minister's discretion, to exempt from military service all persons having conscientious convictions against such service, but to make no mention of any exemption from training for the - children of these persons. We are glad to know that the Government now propose to exempt from the compulsory provisions of the Act, both as to service and training, all who, like ourselves, feel that they cannot conscientiously serve their country in this way. May we now ask that the exemption from military service be so expressed as to cover all classes of service under military and naval control, and - not merely the obligation to actually bear arms. The principle underlying our position will not be met if we remain liable to serve at the call of the authorities on those duties which are really .as much a part of the military system as is the - actual fighting in the ranks! And with special reference to our children, we would pressingly urr>e that they may be exempted from cadet and military drill training in our schools and elsewhere.' Both these points should, we respectfully Sir. Higgs. urge, be explicitly expressed in the words of the Act itself, and not left subject to the decision of a Minister acting in a time of apprehension Devonshire-street, Sydney, of war, when minds are excited and the voice 23rd August, 19,10. of reason may be silent. In speaking thus we feel we are spokesmen for a section of the community other than our members, who, on grounds of conscientious conviction, like ourselves, cannot, even under the guise of defence, allow their children to be trained to warlike ends, and for the children's sake more than for their elders we ask for freedom. Respectfully commending these considerations to your attention, we remain, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the General Meeting of Australian Friends, yours faithfullyWILLIAM COOPER, Clerk. WM . BENSON. I would remind the Minister that the Society of Friends was founded by George Fox away back in 1648-66. Notwithstanding the most severe persecution the Society of Friends formed a strong organization. They were so persecuted by the authorities that at one time there were no less than 1,000 of them in gaol. It is not possible for any honourable member to ridicule the conscientious objections of the members of the Society of Friends, or, as they are better known, the Quakers. They proved that they had conscientious objections because they were prepared to go to gaol rather than submit to the desires of the authorities in regard to compulsion. We know what good the Quakers have done in the community. They have been from the very first opposed to war in all its forms, and have devoted their attention more than has any other section of the community to cultivating, on the part of the British people, a public conscience in favour of the abolition of slavery They did the same thing in America, and it is surely due to the members of the Society of Friends, who have really been the salt of the earth, that they should be allowed, since they have conscientious objections, to have their children exempted from the use of arms. I sincerely hope that the Acting Prime Minister will reconsider his decision, and so amend the proposed new clause that parents with conscientious objections may have their children exempted in the manner I have suggested.",48
180,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9.6] - I am inclined to think that the object which the honourable member for Parramatta has in view may be secured by inserting after the word ""regulations"" the words "" o r theological students as prescribed."" That would meet the case of students who were reading outside a College. I understand that it is the custom of students for the ministry in some denominations to read outside a College, and I think the amendment I have suggested would meet their case.",49
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ver y well; I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That after the word "" regulations "" the words "" or theological students as prescribed"" be inserted.",50

That now before - us may do so, but there may be a doubt about it. However, the Attorney-General could, to some extent, bind the Adminis-. - tration by declaring the sense in which the Committee are passing this amendment. The definition will come from the regulations, and all I would now ask the Attorney-General to do is to say-and such a statement would have some force with any subsequent Administration-that a sufficiently wide interpretation will be given to this clause under the regulations to cover what is really the intention of the Committee.",50
183,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . ' Mr Glynn - The use of the word theological "" might involve a limitation, ' and the amendment now proposed might have a narrower meaning than would that proposed first of all by the honourable member for Parramatta.

I do not think that anything further is necessary. I hope this statement will satisfy my honourable friends. I shall call the attention of the Minister of ""Defence to what I have said.",50
185,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Adelaide) [9.11] - As the word "" theological "" is being retained, I suggest that the object of the honourable member for Parramatta could be met by inserting the word "" theological "" before the. word ""students,"" in the first line, and striking out the words "" at a theological college."" That amendment would enable the desire of the Committee to be expressed in fewer words.",50
186,Mr WH IRVINE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Every young man who does not wish to serve will become a theological student.,50

When any member of the Military Forces(a) is killed on active service, or on duty, 01 (£) dies or becomes incapacitated from earning his living from wounds or disease contracted on active service, provision shall be made for his widow and family or for himself, as the case requires, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, at the prescribed rates."" That clause embodies the wording of a similar provision in the Naval Bill, substituting the word "" military "" for the word "" naval,"" and should, in fairness to the permanent members of our Military Forces, be passed, so that there may be no differentiation between our Permanent Naval Forces and our Permanent Military Forces.",50

In opinion, it is only fair that soldiers who are still qualified to serve the country should have opportunities for promotion within the Department, since they are shut out from other branches of the Public Service. The view of the honourable member for Maranoa was that all matters connected) with the pay and ordnance branches should be wholly under the control of the Defence Department, and not as heretofore under the control of the Public ServiceCommissioner. A great deal of the work is technical, and should be done by soldiers, many of whom are highly trained. In thesuch Imperial Army, the Canadian Armv. theAmerican Army, and the Indian Army, proto vision is made for soldiers in this way j but here the control is to be placed in the hands' perof the Public Service Commissioner, whilethe non-technical work is to remain under the eontrol of the Department The idea was of to provide legitimate openings for theadvancement of men who have only They cannot cross the boundary to any other of the Public Service, and, therefore, when they have served their country well at small pay, they ought to be given* a chance for advancement, without comWhy thechange has been made.

While we claim' the right to depart from the practice of other countries in many matters, still, inmilitary affairs, it is prudent that the dutiesshould be performed under the immediatesupervision and control of the Defence Department by those employed under theDiscipline Act.

199,Mr OZAN NE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Corio) [9.33] - I support the request of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. We have passed certain clauses which practically prevent senior - officers of the Permanent Forces from obtaining promotion, and these offices should 'be open to those who have the necessary technical training.

200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parramatta) [9.4:1] - I was not present when the second reading of this measure was debated, and the Bill was a long way through Committee before my return to the House. I do not know that I should have spoken at all, except that I thought that the Minister in charge of the Bill did not deal with the matter in that non-party spirit by which . he claimed to be animated when dealing with both the defence measures. Running all through his second-reading speech was seme such sentiment as this: ""See what a paltry thing the last Government's Bill was, and how excellent a thing this is ; this proposal is one of which we have always been in favour, and to which - the ex-Minister of Defence has always been opposed."" That was the spirit, if not the exact language, of his argument all through. . ... 15 I have no great opposition to offer to the ... 28 Bill. In its broad outline and principle it has deviated very materially in one ... 13 essential and vital particular from the lines AYES. laid down by Lord Kitchener. I refer to the period of training, but. in other ways, it proceeds along the lines laid down in that Bill of mine which the Attorney General has denounced so vigorously. This Bill is not altering anything done in that Bill except in one or two of its details, and Lord Kitchener proposed no deviation from NOES. it, except in one particular, relating to the duration of training. All the proposals regarding the Military College he took as he O'Malley, King J found them, simply shaped them, and set them on an up-to-date course. He altered nothing in the previous Act, except the duration of the training. As the Attorney General claims that all he did was to follow what the honourable member and his party had previously done, let me show that I am not the only one who has made some changes in opinion regarding this matter. Watkins, D . It is worthwhile spending two or three minutes in show that other people on the opposite side of the chamber have, also made some accommodations in this respect.",52
201,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have heard 'that fence put forward in Equity cases.,53
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member will hear it again here. As the honourable member would not give'me an opportunity of saying what I had to say before, I hope he will bear with me while I say it now. The Bill which he so much despises has been made the basis of all that has been done since. Indeed, this Bill is actually not necessary at all at present. It could have been done without, .and the scheme sketched by Lord Kitchener could have proceeded for the next three years without any alteration whatever. Lord Kitchener's proposals will not relate themselves to any Bill until the expiration of at least that period, and all that is taking place now in connection with this Bill would have taken place in precisely the same way in connection with my Bill . In fact this seems to be a Bill made up for the purpose of calling it a Bill. It consists entirely of padding and immaterial things, taking' this out of one part of the old Act, and putting that in another. I am not complaining. I should probably have taken the same course myself had I been in charge of this measure. This is, perhaps, the time to crystallize in a Bill what-' ever was suggested by Lord Kitchener when here. I am not sure that this is not the most opportune moment to do what is needed to be done, but even so it will not operate until three years from now. Although the honourable member is extending the training up to twenty-five years, he does not propose to subject to compulsory training any young man who has passed the age of seventeen and a half years at the time this Bill comes into tion. If we extend compulsory training to twenty-five years, does it not seem a pity that a man who is eighteen years of age at the passing - of this measure, and has already done his preliminary training, should be allowed to escape it altogether, while a man who happens to be seventeen will have to train for eight years? The honourable member is anxious to train the young manhood of Australia, and with the extension of the age to twenty-five it seems to me that some of those who are over eighteen might very well be pressed into the compulsory part of the law. It was a very different proposition when the compulsory training stopped at twenty, or at twenty-one, as suggested by the Government de- previous to ours. As I say, I have no captious criticism to offer concerning the measure. All that has been done now is on the basis of the former Bill . In fact, the Kitchener scheme is expressly stated by its author to be based on that Bill . The policy was settled before he came here, so tar as the principle of compulsory training was concerned. He recognised that re-, peatedly throughout his report. Why did we send for Lord Kitchener at all? I and the then Government were blamed even for that. Honourable members opposite gave us any amount of criticism for sending for him at all. They said, "" What do we want Kitchener for? We knew all about what we wanted without any such soldier being sent for . """,53
203,Mr HIGGS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member wanted to show that he was such a great Imperialist!,53
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is quite wrong. I sent for him for the one reason that I felt it to be my duty, when I had the responsibility of shaping ihe defence of Australia, to get - advice from (he best man in the Empire.",53
205,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And badly needed it . too.,53
206,Mr TOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I freely admit it. I have never been fool enough to believe that I knew all about these things, like many another man who has made a mess of it by so believing. My first thought was to get the best available advice in the Empire on so important a question as the adequate defence of Australia. We have sent for Imperial officers before, and when they have arrived they have been found not to be the very best men in opera- the British Army, I mean the men with the most authority. We have found, as a rule, that in rank they were much the same as our own soldiers; some of them, perhaps, a little above, but not sufficiently so to exercise the authority necessary in the framing and promulgation of an adequate defence scheme for the Commonwealth. Moreover, each State had imported Imperial officers on its own account. The result is to be seen in Australia today. For instance, every - conceivable kind of gun is mountedin the fixed defences of Victoria. Some of them are good, and some are bad, and many are where it is not necessary to place a gun at all. About 50 per cent, more guns are mounted than are needed. That is the result of importing first one Imperial officer, and then another. Each has had his own notions as to how our defences should be arranged, and the result in this State is a conglomeration of guns set up for the defence of the ports and strategic points which are neither necessary nor adequate for the purpose. That comes of importing officers who are here for a year or two, who carry out some temporary idea of their own, and then go away again. We thought it necessary to go to the fountain head-to have sketched for us by an Imperial officer of the highest standing, a scheme upon which we could work steadily for the next ten or fifteen years. That is why we asked Lord Kitchener to come here. 1 made my own position perfectly clear at the time in the last speech I made on the subject in the House. When I am taunted, as I was the other day, about this very matter, I desire to quote, in reply, the following passage from my speech, as reported in Hansard of 21st September, 1909, at page 3629:We have invited one of the best soldiers Empire-perhap s the Empire's most celebrated organizer- I allude to Lord Kitchener-to visit us and advise us as to the lines upon which we ought to proceed in reference to all matters making for the organization and efficiency of our Army. He will come here, and we shall ask him frankly to look at us as we are, to tell us freely what are our defects, to suggest remedies, and to do everything that is necessary to put us upon the right track to thorough army efficiency. Some interjections were made that the visit would be very bad for a lot of people here. Those predictions have not proved correct, because Lord Kitchener did not recommend the wholesale dismissal of any of our officers.",53
207,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"-Perhaps he was not allowed to. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - He was given an absolutely free hand to do what he pleased in the way of recommendations. I said, furtherLord Kitchener's advice, I repeat, will be most valuable to us, and I hope that it may be followed. In other words, we sent for Lord Kitchener, in order that we might act upon his advice. In so doing we surrendered any preconceived notions that we might have held concerning the defence of Australia. Therefore I , of all others, who insisted upon this officer coming out, and expressed my intention of abiding by the result of his recommendations, have nothing to go back upon. When we felt ourselves charged with the responsibility for inaugurating a new era altogether with regard to defence, we went to the best man in the Empire from whom we thought we could get advice, and here we are today acting mainly upon that advice. I hope that as the result of it there will be laid down in Australia a settled policy, for continuity of defence policy is most necessary. ' We cannot keep plucking up the flower of defence to see what its roots are like-to see how it is growing. There must be continuity in a given direction, following a precise and detailed plan, making, as we hope it will, in ten or twelve years' time, an efficient army in Australia for the defence of our shores. Why, therefore, should the Acting Prime Minister, in his second-reading speech, have made all the allusions diat he did to what my attitude had been on a former occasion,' and as to what I decided and did with regard to the question of compulsory defence? He claimed that in the matter of of the defence he was the only immaculate man in Australia. He pointed with pride to his history, and I do not begrudge it to him. But remember that the honourable member throughout hiswhole career has had the crudest of notions upon this matter. He has made changes that were even more diverse than are any of the changes that have been made by any honourable member of the Opposition. Let us look at his attitude. In the first place-in 1903, I think it was-h e says he submitted a motion in this House, providing that there should be a levy en masse upon all the male population in Australia between the ages of seventeen and forty-five years. He insisted that every male of the age of seventeen years and over should train a fortnight in each year until he reached the age of forty-five years. They should be compelled, he said, to train as soldiers, and, moreover, he proposed that they should receive no recompense for training. Indeed, he scouted the idea that they should receive one penny while they were so training. Between the ages of seventeen and forty-five years men were to be compelled to train at least fourteen days per annum in camp without the payment of a penny for their services. Subsequently he was at the head of an organization which insisted upon a sixty-five days camp of continuous training. He modified hisviews so much, however, as to provide for the payment of the officers and men, the payment to consist in the case of the men of a weekly wage of ios. 6d., and advancing, I think, to ,12s. 6d. after they had reached the age of twenty-one years. Then we find the honourable member changing his attitude again, and proposing that until the men had reached the age of twenty-one years they should undergo sixteen days' camp training per annum, and no more. Whatever objections the honourable member urged the other night to my Bill on the score that it provided, only for the training of boys who were then to be lost sight of will apply much more, as I shall show, to his own scheme. doing this with the idea",54
208,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the honourable member doing it to belittle the present Minister of Defence?,55
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am doing it to answer some criticisms that have been made concerning myself, and I hope the honourable member is fair-minded enough to permit me to do that. He has heard me abused time and again, in connection with this very question, as if I were the only man in the House who had altered his opinion regarding this matter of defence, and the duration of training. I am trying to show that there are others who have changed their views, and that the Acting Prime Minister has done so about as great an extent as has any other honourable member.",55
210,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is a case of "" you're another.""",55
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There are occahis sions when one has to get at the facts the situation, and that is all I am trying to do. I was told recently that I had remained silent too long on this question; that I had had nothing to say upon of the question since Lord Kitchener had 'been here. I have kept silent, and for - one reason",55
212,Mr TUDOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,When ? When the able member was asleep?,55
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I suppose I must submit to these interjections, but will only make my task the longer. I am - going to get out these statements if it me until midnight to do so, and they may be emphasized in a way that honourable members will not like if they interject freely. The Acting Prime Minister could not make his second-reading speech without calling attention to a change of front on .my part: yet he has changed his opinion tune and again in this House with regard to the question of compulsory training. He began with a proposal for a levy en masse of all males between seventeen and forty-five years of age, and there was to be no pay. That proposal was reduced later on to one for the training of all such persons for sixty-five days per annum with a payment of ios. 6d. per week while so engaged. That, again, was reduced to a proposal of sixteen days per annum with a payment of ios. 66. per week, and was modified ultimately to something even less than that.",55
214,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Were the men to receive the money all at once? I am Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Acting Prime Minister did not believe in paying soldiers; he believed that they should work for nothing. I remember his quoting with great gusto in this Chamber the fact that in Switzerland the soldiers received only 7|d. per day, and he expressed the 5 opinion that it would be a fair thingtopay our soldiers the equivalent in value, which would amount here to about is. 3d. per day, or 16s. 6d. per week, with a rise to 12s. 6d. per week in the case of those who had readied the age of twenty-one years, and, I suppose, had wives and homes to support. Then the proposal of the first Fisher Government went even beyond that, and when I to heard the honourable member criticising mv little Bill of last year and declaring that it provided only for the training of boys who were then to be turned adrift with nowhere to go, I felt that he must be thinking of own scheme and not of mine. I did of provide somewhere for them to go. I proposed to extend the militia to 30,000 strong, and to equip them and make them efficient for war., as they had not been in the history Australia. I proposed to find the mature and the steadying force for this army from the militia recruited upon a voluntary basis, and to pay them adequately for the serhonorvices which they performed.",55
215,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I think that is a part of the honourable member's proposal which they Lord Kitchener practically ridiculed.,55
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am afraid takes that I have not much time for a man like the honourable member. It is impossible to argue with him, for he cannot state a case too correctly. Lord Kitchener did not in the slightest degree ridicule my proposals. He adopted the proposals in regard to pay, and expressly stated time and again that he took my measure as the basis of all his recommendations. However, I desire to come now to the Bill proposed by the first Fisher Government. After all, we had better deal with the responsible proposals of a previous Government and see how widely they contrasted with the proposals I put through this Chamber. The point of criticism has always been that my scheme did not provide for a matured force-that it provided only for the training of schoolboys. What was the proposal of the first Fisher Government? They proposed to train these men as I did for two years until they readied ' the age of twenty years, on the basis of sixteen days' continuous training in each of those two years. There was to be practically no difference up to the time that they began their compulsory training. Then they proposed, as Jl did in my Bill, a continuous training extending over sixteen days per annum. They proposed also to take that training one year further until the men had reached the age of twenty years, but in the twenty-first year they were to submit to only seven, and not to sixteen, days' continuous training. That was the proposal of the first Fisher Government as outlined by Senator Pearce in a lengthy interview in Sydney with the editor of the Call. I call attention to the army that that Administration was going to bring into existence. It is set forth elaborately in the Call of May, 1909. It provided for the training of 18,000 youths in the first year-that was the year 1912-13-and during the two j'ears' period the men were to undergo sixteen days' continuous training. twenty-first year they .were to train in camp for only seven days, and after that they were to be turned adrift. They were to go where they pleased. There was no place in the defence scheme in which they could fit. Indeed, there was no organization or anything else. The first Fisher Government did not even provide as I did for a militia. Its scheme would have provided for an army of boys, and nothing but boys with no stiffening or provision for maturity of any kind. In the year 1912 the militia, under Senator Pearce's scheme, was to absolutely cease. There was no provision for the militia at all after that period. Here we have the statement in a footnoteExpenditure special to militia and volunteers is now included in that of New adult force. The expenditure in subsequent years is expected to rise gradually to a maximum of ^1,400,000 in 1917-18. [ 3l] 2 Clearly, then, the militia was to cease absolutely in that year, and Australia was to iely upon those who had been trained up to their twenty-first year. The Government expected that after reaching that age these men would train for nothing upon a voluntary basis for seven days per annum, but there was to be no compulsion. No inducement was held out, because the amount in respect of the militia was deleted from the Estimates. That, then, was their scheme which, unlike mine was not an interim 0 proposal. It was not a scheme which was subject to the criticism and advice of the most expert adviser in the Empire. Nothing of the kind was contemplated, because the years were run out up to the year 1917-18. Then, again, to learn what was the army they were going to create we have only to consider the Estimates. For the year 1909-10 the expenditure, under their scheme, would have been £1,039,000, whereas the actual expenditure for which provision is made on the Estimates is, I believe, about £1,600,000 or £1,700,000, and the expenditure last year was £1,575,000, as against a proposed expenditure of £1,039,000 under Senator Pearce's scheme. In 1910-11 the expenditure was to be the same as in 1909-10. Nothing was provided over and above what had been provided for before. I emphasize that, because the scheme which we set aside, which was claimed to possessall the virtues, would have given precisely the equipment that our forces have had for many years In their past, but has been declared inadequate in every sense of the term. For 1911-12 the estimate goes up to ,£1,182,000; for the following year to £1,200,000; for 1913-14 to £1,248,000; and for 1914-15 t 0 £ J3°°)°OOI Does any one believe that an army could be fully equipped on the lines sketched by these compulsory training provisions for any such preposterous sums as those? The Estimates are an answer to all that has gone before, including the proposals of the Fisher Government. Surely it does not lie in the mouths of those who are responsible for the present scheme, who are going to train men until they are twenty-one years of age, and then turn them adrift without making provision for their further pay, or for anything that will attract them into the volunteer service, to criticise others who made schemes for the adequate defence of Australia. We have all altered our opinions on defence matters, and it will be a sorry day for the country when public men are not prepared to change their views on questions of this kind. similar change of opinion is proceeding apace at this moment in the Old Country in all ranks of the service, and among the best experts. Lord Esher, who believed that the Territorial Forces of the Old Country would be adequate for Home defence, has changed his mind, and now says frankly that he thinks that they will not do all that is expected, and that there is nothing for the country but to resort to the compulsory training of its citizens. When an expert is at liberty to change his opinions so rapidly, can others of lesser pute be blamed because they have given up their views in deference to those expressed by the greatest expert we have, the man whom we sent for to advise us, and in regard to whom we said that we should abide by his report? I did what I undertook to do. I said, "" We will obtain the best adviser, and will do whatever he says should be done."" In that my colleagues agreed with me. We defend the present scheme as being in reality ours, except for such alterations as the present Ministers have made. One of the virtues claimed for the Bill before us is that it requires for the first time eight days' continuous training camp. But already in three or four of the States such a period of training has been provided for. Although I have been so much abused, it was I who first insisted that there should be periods of eight days' continuous training in Victoria in connection with the Kitchener camps. Every one knows what trouble it was to bring that about. I am glad that the Government is making this period of continuous training part of its scheme. If we are to have a defence force worthy of the name, it will be the minimum. But here again, when the proposal was before the Senate in the first instance, Senator Pearce ridiculed it. He said that eight days' continuous training was not enough; that it should be sixteen days. That was less than twelve months ago. He went on to say that if men were compulsorily trained for two years, and the training during that period was adequate, they should not be required to attend for more than four days continuously in subsequent years. When our Bill came before the Senate, he proposed a seven days' camp. Whatever changes of opinion may have taken place among the members of the Opposition, they can be matched by those among the Ministerialists, and the Attorney- not have eventuated. General in drawing attention to my change Mr Joseph Cook. of attitude was severely criticising his own A. colleagues and supporters. His speech furnished evidence that the change of opinion was general. He told us that when he introduced his proposal for compulsory training, in 1903, only two honourable members supported him, and at least one of those was a member of the Opposition, so that he congratulated himself at the expense of his own party as well as of his opponents. He stated that I , who had long been an opponent of his scheme, had at last become an enthusiastic advocate of compulresory training, but he followed that by a somewhat contradictory statement, pointing out that the compulsory training which I had provided for had certain grave and almost fatal defects. My position is clear. I like compulsion as little now as ever I did, but I believe a certain amount to be necessary for the adequate defence of Australia. Whatever my personal opinions and predilections, I shall never let them stand in the way of the interests of the country. The honourable gentleman said that in our scheme no provision was made for continuous camps of training, but that the defect was pointed out at the in time, as well as another defect, that, after two years, the trained man was turned adrift, which he described as creating an impossible and also ludicrous condition of affairs. That criticism applies to the Fisher scheme infinitely more than to ours, because we provided a force which the trained man could enter, and offered 8s. a day to its members. That force would have been as well equipped, trained, and drilled as the trained forces under this scheme. We provided, too, for a college for the training of officers, a proposal which was not found fault with by Lord Kitchener, although he shaped it to the best purposes and ends. In all essentials what he proposed was what we wished to provide for. We provided for adequate training and a force which trained men could enter, offering the necessary incentives for them to do so. The Fisher Government scheme did no such thing. The men were to be trained until they reached the age of twenty-one, and if they remained longer, they were not to be paid. There was no inducement for them to continue their training, and no compulsion. The figures show that an effective and adequatelyequipped force in the modern sense of the words was not contemplated, and could I think that I am justified in making this reply to the criticisms which I have received. facts speak for themselves, and show that in supporting this scheme which Lord Kitchener has sketched for us, we must all adjust our former views somewhat. I have only one or two words of criticism to offer. I pointed out the other night that the scheme of training was not the Kitchener scheme. Lord Kitchener laid it down very clearly that after the age of twenty had been reached, and between the ages of twenty and twenty-five, six days' compulsory training in camp annually would be sufficient. He recommended sixteen days' continuous training between the ages of eighteen and nineteen, and nineteen and twenty, and after that six days. He said that his opinion was that if those periods were fully utilized under thoroughly competent officers, they would meet the requirements of the men until they reached the age of twenty-five years. The Bill adds ten days to the period which Lord Kitchener said was sufficient, and that part of the scheme is not what he recommended. He was emphatic that if soldiers were' given good training - within their areas, they would take advantage of it without compulsion. The six days of continuous training was not to be for their military instruction so much as for the utilizing and testing of that instruction. This brings me to the area officer question, which is the crux of the Bill. The area officer is the unit of the educational training. Lord Kitchener laid more stress on that than on anything else. The requirements of an area officer are very severe indeed, and his idea was that this officer should live amongst the men, and be one of them - that he should know every family within the area, and develop that spirit of camaraderie and that social side of soldiering which count for so much, even in camp This officer, in Lord Kitchener's opinion, should be able to select the best men for officers, and dispose of the Force in such a way as to lead to the best results. He relied on the competition between these officers, as promotion was to depend on the condition of the several commands, seniority not counting. Military efficiency was to be the test; and friendly rivalry was to be encouraged, as tending to the greatest degree of efficiency in the army as a whole. There was a transition period, during which the areas were to be controlled by officers of the present The Forces. Lord Kitchener did not recommend that any of the present Permanent officers should be appointed permanently to any of the area commands, because he wanted a special staff corps consisting of men who began young, and were trained in rigid discipline. The model was to be the West Point College, and our institution was to be equipped in a manner and the officers trained to a standard equal to any in the world. In the meantime, appointments were to be made from the best of the instructional forces, as well as from the Permanent Forces. With regard, however, to these positions the rates of pay offered by the Government will not, in my opinion, attract the best officers in the present Forces. It is proposed to pay only £150 a year; and I do not see how we can expect the best results from men who are engaged every day in their own businesses. Tn my opinion £400 or £500 would not have been a penny too much, and the men could then have given their whole time, making other arrangements for the conduct of their own private affairs. Under the present system, however, an area officer can only give scraps of his time; and, therefore, the best results are not likely to be obtained. As a matter of fact, some of the best men are not offering, and a selection has to be made from those who do offer.",55
217,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Some of them are a very poor selection !,58
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have not had time to inquire into the kind of selections made; and I desire rather to discuss the principle.,58
219,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The poor selection is due, unfortunately, to regrettable recommendations of senior officers.",58
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I know nothing of that, because, as I say, I have not inquired into the quality of the men selected - the rates of pay were enough for me. The result will be that young lieutenants of the Citizen Forces will be. placed in command of men who, until now, have been their colonels, majors, or other superior officers. That would not be so bad if there were a guarantee that in every case the young men were better qualified than the older men; but that can only be made clear when some test has been applied, and. provision is made for men so inclined, to take command, knowing that their private affairs will not suffer. The area of selection sbould have been very much wider; and I am not sure that we do not run single failure. the risk of breaking down the scheme in five years, owing to that simple cause alone. Lord Kitchener contemif plated the selection of the best offiit cers we have, both Citizen and Peran manent; but even for the temporary appointments, I am afraid that selection has not been made. I am speaking withKitchener, out intimate knowledge of the appointees I only know that a great number of young lieutenants, without much military experiarmy. ence, are being selected, while some of best officers cannot afford to apply owing to the paltrv salary. The scheme is not having a fair jump off owing 'to this take on the part of the military authorities. As soon as I had discussed the College selves creditably. with Lord Kitchener, and the lines of the policy had been settled, I cabled to Colonel Bridges, asking him to return at once take control. My reason was that Colonel Bridges is an Australian officer, and Kitchener agreed with me that if we a competent Australian soldier, he should have preference. This is to be an Auslike tralia Force, and the officers should be Australian, always provided they are capable; and I felt that here was a chance for an Australian who has not heretofore prospered as he might have done in the Forces, but who has shown himself on every occasion to a thoroughly up-to-date scientific soldier. I told Colonel Bridges that if he came would be absolutely independent in his control, subject only to the Minister; that is the condition of affairs today. also arranged the appointment of the spector-General, and but for a little overhave sight, the Gazette notice would have peared before we left office. I was under the impression that we could complete appointments after our resignation had been formally sent in, but the lawyers of the Cabinet were against me, and I yielded the point. However, if we erred at all, we erred in a safe and cautious way. left everything ready for the Gazette notices, and these were issued; and the responsibility for the appointments really is ours today. I should have liked to another appointment I had in train, but, to my regret, it has not been completed for do now. some reason I do not know. All those matters as they are in train today have received the imprimatur of that organizer, who, experienced in the great art of warfare, has served in almost every part of the Empire, and is not debited with Sir. Joseph Cook. The late Government thought they could not do better than take the advice of a general such as he; and the scheme is carried out in its integrity will not be long before we shall have army fit to fight alongside any troops, no matter whence those troops may be gathered. That is the opinion of Lord and it is mine, too. He was ; very highly impressed with the material we had in Australia for the making of an He repeatedly expressed his adthe miration for the bearing of the men and their military aptitude. He had nothing but praise for them wherever he went. In misevery camp he was loud in his approval of the efforts made by the men to acquit themThe whole scheme of Australian deand fence centres itself in the Military College. There is the beginning and Lord end of efficiency. If the men are had trained properly they are there to be trained ; they will take to the training ; they soldiering, and have an aptitude for it, and the responsibility will rest upon those who are set over them to train them in all the arts of modern warfare. This is why I feel that we are running a very great risk in doing what we have already done in the appointment of these men to the be command of the area controls. I do not know whether the Government intend to go he on with that scheme. If they are going to get the best and most efficient officers and under it, well and good. But I am afraid I they will not do so. They might at least have Inleft the area of selection fully open, and provided an adequate salary, in other apwords, an adequate attraction, to induce the most competent officers of the Defence those Force to apply for these temporary commands. I should have been very strongly tempted, if I had remained in office, at all risks, to see that only efficient officers, in the modern meaning of the term, were apWe pointed to these commands. If they were offered a five years' tenure at an adequate salary, it would have been comparatively easy to get them, in my opinion, and we see should have started the scheme in a way in which I am afraid we shall not be able to",58
221,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Where did the honourable gentleman expect to get the money great from for this expenditure?,59
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All I need say in reply is that it would have required very a little more than what the Government have-, proposed.",59
223,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We spend a very large amount now on militarism.,60
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Exactly ; and if our officers who will be charged with the expenditure of the money are not of the best, it will be more or less wasted. It would be infinitely cheaper to get the best men, and give them an adequate salary. Anything less than the best in matters of defence is a mistake.",60
225,Mr RILEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am afraid that we are spending too much on it now,60
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"All I need say is that we should have to spend no more if care is taken to insure efficient control. cient control is always economical control in the military as well as in every other business. Any sum required to make the control efficient and adequate would be money well and economically spent, and it would not have amounted to very much more than the amount which the Government are asking us to spend. All I have to say, further, is prompted by the interjection made just now, viz., that when I see honourable members opposite prepared to spend £2,500,000 a year in the defence of this country, there is nothing left for me to do but to get behind them and say, '' Go ahead; and so long as the money is spent wisely T shall support you.""",60
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The amount will be more than £2,500,000; it will be more nearlv £3,000,000 this year.",60
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There will be an abnormal expenditure for the next year or two on the Navy, which will make the amount more nearly £3,000,000; but I am speaking now of the expenditure which will be involved under normal conditions. We hope that the money will be spent to the best advantage, and that what honourable members on both sides desire will be realized, namely, that we shall receive the best value for the money we spend. Irrespective of the monetary side, we hope that we shall have a Force which will be able to defend our social ideals in Australia, and make us fit when the shock of war comes to give an account of ourselves as a worthy branch of a worthy race.",60
229,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan) [10.40]. - I was not present when this Bill was called on this evening, and, therefore, I am not exactly aware of what it is proposed to do in connection with the amendment carried some days ago on the motion of the honourable member for Adelaide. He succeeded in introducing a proviso enabling persons who have served three years in the Forces, after passing a prescribed examination, to enter the Military College for the purpose of graduating, at any age up to twenty-seven years. I understand that some alteration of the proviso is to be made in another place, and as I shall probably not be here when the alteration is considered in this House, I should like to say a word or two in regard to the proposed change. I have thought the matter over since it was last under consideration, and have not in any way changed the opinion I gave utterance to Effithen, but which I had formed many years ago. We should not forget that our Defence Force will be a Citizen Force, and that its members are to be compelled tn serve. In the circumstances, they should not be excluded from any consideration or advantage it is possible to offer.them by way of encouragement. The Bill proposed that young men of from fifteen to nineteen years of age should be at liberty to enter the Military College, but that if they failed to pass the prescribed examination between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years, they should not be able to enter the College later on. I understand that it is proposed to introduce some regulation to enable members of the Defence Force to enter the College at a later age. In my opinion, it would be very hard, and unfair, to a young man who intends to follow a military career if , at the age of nineteen years, on failing to pass the prescribed examination, he is absolutely prevented from following the career he has laid out for himself. I can see no reason why he should be prevented from doing so under certain conditions. What are the conditions proposed in the amendment that has been carried? It provides that if a young man has failed at nineteen years of age to pass the prescribed examination, he must undergo three years' training in the Citizen Forces before he can come up again for entry examination. I think that is too severe a test, although when it was proposed by the honourable member for Adelaide, I supported it. I see rio reason why he should be asked to undergo that long' probation before he can apply to come up again for examination. But, be that as it may, a young man who failed at nineteen years of age would, under the amendment, be able, after he had served for three years in the Forces, to apply to come up again for examination, and if he passed the examination, to enter the College, and graduate should he be able to do so. If he graduates, what then? There is no have to be repealed. promise that he will get employment, but there is the advantage that he will be well qualified officer, and that whatever occupation he follows he will be ready, a trained man, to do good service for country in the time of difficulty. That a desideratum devoutly to be wished, instead Of putting difficulties in the way 'of persons entering this College we should impose no age limit what the ever. The Bill provides that a person must pass the examination and enter age, the College before reaching the age of twenty-seven years. Every encouragement and opportunity should be given to men anxious .to qualify themselves in the highest what they mean. degree. We have in the military service of this country men who have attained high positions and served well on the field battle, but how many of them would have been able to enter the Forces if a provision had been in operation that only those under nineteen years of age could enter and qualify for staff appointments ? They could not have secured a Commission unless they . commenced their military career before reaching the age of nineteen years. I venture to say that very few men of the highest rank stituents, now in the Defence Force would have which been eligible for commissions in such cumstances. Citizen soldiers do not make up their minds in a moment as to the tent to which they will devote themselves to a military career. In this Bill we say to them, "" Unless you enter this Military College before reaching the age of nineteen years you will never be able to graduate from it, and so will never have an tunity to occupy a high position in the defence forces of Australia."" I am opposed to that narrow view of the Citizen soldiery. If we had a paid they have in the Old Country, there might be some argument in favour of it; but we are dependent upon our Citizen soldiery for our defence, and, therefore, we should give them every possible encouragement. I only confess surprise' that such a proposal should have emanated from the present Goof vernment. I do not know what influence was brought to bear upon them, but I beI lieve that had we proposed such a conber servative, illiberal, ungenerous measure is this, not one member of the present vernment party would have supported I am afraid that it will not.work. In fact, I am certain that the Citizen soldiers will Sir John Forrest. not approve of it, and that it will They will not be satisfied to do all the hard work and a the fighting without any of the rewards of the service being open to them. We have as all heard of how, when Pandora's box was his opened, all the good things of life is flew out of it, hope only remaining and at the bottom. Under this Bill there is not even hope for the citizen soldiers whom we expect to do our fighting. All good things are to be reserved for boys who enter the College at nineteen years of and those who fail on the first occa-. sion will have no legal right to enter the College and to qualify. It is all very well to talk of regulations, but we know They can be readily passed and just as readily set aside. These rights should be preserved in the Bill itof ""self to the people whom we expect to do all the fighting and hard work. Let us give them a chance. Do not let us take away from them all hope. This is a most ungenerous proposal, and I am surprised that a party which professes so much make-believe liberality, generosity, and reasonableness should be found voting for it. I cannot understand how any honourable member will be able, before his conto defend the course of action it is now proposed to take to reverse cirthe reasonable proposal moved by the honourable member for Adelaide, and carried exalmost unanimously by the Committee.

This House is paying thousands of pounds per annum-for what? To get a better cable service. There is no other justification. It is to be a cable service open to all Australia. If we are not going to get a better service, both from the stand-point of the quantity and quality of the matter transmitted over this cable, what justification can exist for.the expenditure of this money? None whatever. Yet when the Minister of External Affairs is questioned upon the matter, he says that he has no information in regard to it. All he knows is that he is shovelling the money out on the certificate of a company over which he has not the slightest control. That is a sorry position. It discloses a fine sense of Ministerial responsibility.",63

261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not dis- . cussing that aspect of the matter. What we wish to know is the quality of the messages transmitted, and whether they are worth the money, and how the service differs from the service of the great dailies. We require to know what is being done with the money which is being expended by the Minister.",64

I think that the House is entitled to any information which may be available to the Minister, and to any information which by a reasonable effort fie can obtain. If he is able to answer .questions 8 and 9 we shall know whether this syndicate, as the result of the subsidy, has secured the transmission of an additional number of words across the Pacific Cable. If it has not done so, the only conclusion at which we can arrive is that more information is not available to the public. I am sure that the syndicate will be able to answer those questions. No difficulty ought to be experienced in ascertaining whether an additional number of newspapers are being accommodated by the distribution of the information which is transmitted by this cable. If the - Minister will endeavour to secure answers to those questions, he will relievethe situation. He Mr BATCHELOR - I will get that information with pleasure. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at n.12 p.m.",64
