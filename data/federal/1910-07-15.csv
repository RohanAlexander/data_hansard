1,Mr FINLAYSO N,Unknown,"It has been brought to my notice that last week a policeman called at a house in the electoral division of Brisbane, and asked if a gentleman whose name is on the Federal electoral roll, was living there. The lady of the house replied, "" Yes,"" and requested that her daughter's name might be placed on the roll. I am informed that the policeman said that he had orders not to put any names on the roll, hut to knock off as many as possible. Will the Minister of Home Affairs say if this action is being taken with his authority? If it is not, will he take steps to prevent its continuance? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The mission of the Department of Home Affairs is to see that names are kept on the rolls. The matter will be looked into at once. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Has it been brought to the notice of the Minister that it has been discovered, as the result of private investigation, that roll stuffing was largely practised in the Lang division in connection with the last election. A canvass in connection with the State campaign has disclosed the fact that fictitious enrolment has been systematically practised in certain quarters. Will the Minister take steps to guard against action of this kind in the future, not only in the Lang division, but throughout the Commonwealth?",14
2,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I cannot understand how it is that the names of thousands of dead persons should remain on the rolls. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The persons to whom I refer are very much alive, but they are not Hying at the addresses placed opposite to their names on the rolls.",14
3,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question - I must have some definite in for-. ma tion to go on. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Then I shall deal with the matter shortly in another way.,14
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I wish to know if the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs, has been drawn to the fact that the names of a large number of persons were removed from the Western Australian electoral rolls before the last elections. The names of persons in the Murray district who have lived continuously for fifty years in the same place were improperly removed, and this occurred also in other districts.",14
5,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I am aware that thousands* of names have been left off the rolls. I know that that is so in connection with' the electoral division which I represent.,14
6,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Has an honourable member) the right to make a statement when asking a question? The honourable member for Swan said that the names of certain persons had been left off an electoral roir. That is not a question.,14
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I understood the honourable member to be trying to make his question clear. WIRELESS TELEGRAPH STATIONS .,14
8,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Does the Postmaster-General know whether a hitch hasoccurred in connection with the erection of wireless telegraph stations at or near Sydney and Fremantle, for which contracts were to be let in March last?",14
9,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"A slight difficulty has arisen regarding the sites, the Defence Department not yet having agreed as to where they should be. Immediately this matter has been settled, the work will be pro* ceeded with. TELEPHONE RATES . - Mr CANN - Has the Postmaster General seen the report in today's Argus of an interview with Dr Bell, the inventor of the telephone, in which Dr Bell statesYour service is so cheap that I do not know how you can get a .telephone service at all. . . . We have two systems of paying for telephones-Ba t rate and collage. The collage system is the only equitable one, but Americans do not like it. They would ratherpay a flat sum. TJnder the flat system, the burden of the expense falls upon the little users. Under tollage, the people who use it .most have to pay most. In view of these statements, does the Minister still intend to bring Regulation 7 A into operation on ist September next?",14
10,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I have read the statements referred to, not with "" grim satisfaction}"" but with the greatest amount of pleasure. They confirm my view that the rates which it is proposed to enforce on ist September are fair and equitable.",14
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In determining the new rates, did the Postmaster-General pay heed to the rates in vogue in Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand, and other countries where the telephone developments are ahead of those in other parts of the world, and the rates for service are low, or did he consider only the practices and conditions prevailing in countries controlled by trusts and combines?",15
12,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I did not consider the New Zealand rates,' because there the telephone systems are nothing like so large as those of Melbourne and Sydney. As for the other countries which the honourable member names, I might mention that in Stockholm telephone attendants are paid £ 3 6 a year, whereas we pay .£110. If the honourable member for Parramatta wishes to reduce the pay of our telephone attendants to £ 3 6 a year, we may take into consideration the reduction of the telephone rates.",15
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Has the honourable gentleman paid regard to the proportion of the cost of attendance to the revenue of the telephone system, and will he inform the House whether he has discarded his old theory that cheap wages do aiot mean cheap production?",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There appears to f5e - a tendency on the part of honourable members to abuse, by the introduction of argument, the privilege of asking questions. This should' not be done. It makes my - position uncomfortable, because, not knowing what an honourable member is about to say, I cannot intervene to prevent what I - regard as improper.",15
15,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I should be glad if ""the honourable member will give notice of Hiis question.",15
16,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Was Dr Bell - aware, when making the statements which '.'have been read, that in Victoria alone the profits of the telephone system since Fede\ration have amounted to £142,000?",15
17,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I cannot say.,15
18,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Postmaster-General having indicated that he has examined the rates prevailing in the countries I have mentioned, will he inform - the public what they are?",15
19,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I shall be happy to - do so, and in reply to a question upon notice, to be asked by the honourable mem-""ber for Bendigo, shall furnish most of the - information sought for.",15
20,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, upon noticeCan he give any information as to the scale of telephone rates in force in Stockholm (Sweden), and particularly the rates paid by small users ?",15

22,Mr JH CATTS,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Has his attention been drawn to a statement made by Mr W. C. Clegg at the Liberal Conference in Sydney on 25th May (upon the strength of which acertain resolution was carried) as follows :"" He asserted that during the recent Federal election impersonation and plural voting were rampant"" ? 2. Has that statement been investigated? 3. If so, what was the result? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers ;to the honourable member's questions are: 1. Yes. 2 and 3. The persons responsible for the statements are not prepared to substantiate any of their allegations, or to furnish information which may assist the officers in making inquiries. CAPE LEEUWIN SURVEY.",15
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"the Prime Minister, upon noticei . Whether any communications have taken place with the Admiral on the Australian station as to having the exact position of the rock near Cape Leeuwin, on which the steam-ship Pericles struck and was consequently lost, accurately fixed? 2. If not, will he communicate with the Naval authorities, and urge that it is very necessary that, the area around Cape Leeuwin should be more accurately surveyed, and offer to enter into an arrangement with the' Admiralty for having such survey immediately undertaken?",15
24,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,The answers to the honourable member's questions are: 1. No . 2. The matter will receive consideration. COURTS MARTIAL : APPEALS.,16
25,Mr JH CATTS,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIn order to maintain the principle of a citizen before a soldier in connection with the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth, will he' consider the suggestion that a citizen soldier shall have the right of appeal to the Civil Courts of the Commonwealth from any Court-martial, and that such principle should be incorporated in our Defence Acts?",16
26,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"I ask the honourable member to give notice of this question for Tuesday. May I be allowed to suggest that honourable members do not give notice on Thursday of questions for Friday, unless the questions be very urgent? SURPLUS REVENUE BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 14th July (vide page 451), on motion by Mr FISHERThat this B i ll be now read a second time.",16
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"Swan) [10.45]-This Bill is receiving considerable attention, especially from honourable members on this side of the House, and all will agree that it deals with one of the most important questions that could come before Parliament, namely, the proper division of the Customs and Excise revenue as between the States and the Commonwealth. I do not propose to go into the details of the history of this most important question, because honourable members are, no doubt, well aware of the facts. At the Federal Convention of 1897-8 the division of this revenue presented one of the most difficult problems to be solved, and it was termed "" the lion in the path."" Eventually an arrangement was come to for a perpetualthat is, so far as we can make perpetual anything under the Constitution, every section of which is subject to alteration at the will of the people-paymen t to the States of three-fourths of the revenue, the Commonwealth retaining one-fourth. The Constitution Bill as it left the Convention with this provision in it was accepted by a referendum of the people in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia. It was not submitted to the people in Western Australia or Queensland, the latter not being represented at the Convention. In New South Wales the Constitution with this provision was accepted by a majority of 70,000, but, in the interval between the passing of the Bill by the Convention and the submission of it to the people, the statutory majority in New South Wales in order to pass it had been altered from 60,000 to 80,000. Eventually, as honourable members know, the Constitution Bill was passed by all the States limiting the arrangement to ten years, in accordance with a suggestion made by the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr now Sir George always Reid, and agreed to by the other Premiers at what is called the Premiers' Conference of 1899. The Bill became law in that shape, and the Commonwealth was proclaimed and this Parliament elected. During the ten years since then there has beai constant difficulty between the States and the Commonwealth over the future division of the Customs and Excise revenue; all the disagreement and friction may be traced to this cause. We all desire an amicable and effective settlement. It is qf no use trying the sledge-hammer kind Of politics under Federation. The same people elect both the State Parliaments and die Commonwealth Parliament, and there arises difficulty from the fact that there are two sets of agencies responsible to the same people, though not exactly in the same way, because the constituencies are not of the same size. There is the Commonwealth agency and the State agency, and it is most desirable that the two should work harmoniously. There was a meeting last year, following several previous similar gatherings, with the object of bringing about an amicable arrangement, and one was arrived at, submitted to this House, and then referred to the electors for approval or otherwise. The people of Australia, by a small majority, expressed their disapproval of the agreement thus made between the representativesof the States and the Commonwealth. I do not think I have ever said I was particularly wedded to any arrangement in perpetuity; in fact, up 'till the last Conference I had not been mucli in favour of such a plan.",16
28,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"Hear , hear; and the honourable member said so.",16
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"The difficulties were, in my opinion, so great that we required much experience in order . to guide us to a just conclusion. Honourable members will find that when, on the 31st July, 1906, I , as Treasurer, submitted to this House what, I believe, was the first, and, indeed, the only definite and complete proposal dealing with the whole matter that has been submitted, I said that the"""" scheme I was not in perpetuity, and I repeat that when I use the word "" perpetuity "" I mean an arrangement subject to alteration as provided by the Constitution, and only in that way. The scheme I then submitted was, as I say, not in perpetuity, but for a period of ten years'; and if honourable members will turn to page 2035 of Hansard of 31st July, 1906, tliey will find that in my report to the Prime. Minister I said I would suggest that the period during which the Comomnwealth should undertake to guarantee an annual payment to the States (on the basis hereafter mentioned) be ten years, viz., after 31st December, 1910, up to 31st December, 1920, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. By that time we should have had twenty years' experience of Federation, and would necessarily have acquired ' during that period a greater and wider knowledge of the - question, which would assist the Parliament in making arrangements "" on such basis as it deems fair "" for the future.  ber voted differently.",16
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,The honourable member is always interjecting some rude remark.  truth !,17
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"I think the honourable member ought to hold his tongue, and not make a laughing stock of himself.  as I do not. make a laughing stock of the honourable member- a thing he often does himself.",17
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"I was converted to an approval of the Agreement, being placed in the Constitution- a step I was not in favour of at the Brisbane - Conference-becaus e the terms seemed to me to be very much better than those to which I had hitherto, expected the States to agree. I make the statement in the full knowledge of its truth, that the reason the States were willing to accept 25s. per head - was that they were guaranteed that amount until the people should otherwise direct, and that it did not depend on a chance vote ->of Parliament as on the present occasion. However we m""ay desire to keep faith, no one can deny that the Bill now before us may be repealed next year by another set of members or by another Parliament. I hope that that will not occur; but if there be a cataclysm, as at the last election, it is possible. However much in earnest we may be about the observance of the terms of this Bill for ten years, the present proposed arrangement is not in the same catesuggested gory, or so binding on future Parliaments, as was that proposed by'the late Government. The latter could not be altered except in the same way as it had become law, namely, by a vote of a majority of the people of the whole Commonwealth voting on the question.",17
33,Mr BATCHELOR,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,A referendum can be held at any time.,17
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"Quite so. I am not proposing to go behind the will of the people or the Constitution. However much the Minister of External Affairs and his party may mistrust the people, as-they did by opposing the Financial Agreement being referred to the people, I have never by any word of mine shown that I share that mistrust. The vote of the people is binding on us under the Constitution; and to say that we do not trust them, or that we know better than they do, is simply to say that we do not believe in the Constitution itself. As to the Bill, my observations will be made in no carping spirit, but in order to warn the Treasurer that in its present shape it will not, I think, attain the object he desires. Clause 4 provides that the Commonwealth, for a period of ten years # from the ist July of this year, shall pay by monthly instalments, or apply to the payment of interest on the debts of the Statestaken over by the Commonwealth, 25s. per head of the population; and I submit that that cannot be done during the six months of this year, because the States are entitled in that period to three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue.",17
35,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,I have never denied that.,17
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,But the Bill does not say so.,17
37,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,The Constitution says so.,17
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,Why put into a Bill words which are absolutely opposed to the clear reading of section 87 of the Constitution ?,17
39,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,They are not.,17
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"I submit that they are. If the Prime Minister desires to act openly and in the light of day, he should state in the Bill what he proposes to do. The measure as it stands does not make it clear to any ordinary person, not acquainted with the provisions of the Constitution, what is the full meaning of the proposal. It is shown that £450,000 is to be deducted during the nnancial year from the amount paid to the States, but the Bill does not say that, after paying over three-fourths of the revenue for six months, say, about £4,250,000, there will be about £1,500,000 of that amount deducted from the amount paid during the next six months. Why is that not set out in the schedule ? Where is the sense in paying people money and then taking it back again? It is mucli better to say plainly what it is proposed to do. Any one reading this Bill would think that a mistake had been made as to the payment of the 25s. per head from the ist July, ing that there is no power to legislate in this regard until the 31st December. Then, again, I desire to know why-and the Bill would certainly be misleading to me if I did not know what I do know-the period is said to be ten years when, as honourable members know, it is nine and a half years, with some subtractions. First the sum of £^450,000, and then an amount of about £1,500,000 that will be overpaid beyond the 25s. per capita during the six months that the Commonwealth is bound under the Constitution to return to the States three-quarters of the net Customs and Excise revenue, are to be subtracted. Why, then, has not the Treasurer put nine and a half years and also the subtractions in the Bill, to let people know what he is doing? He is always posing as a man who is anxious to show everything to everybody ; he is almost a Don Quixote in these matters.",17
41,Mr FISHER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,He did not show everything.,18
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"He did a great many foolish things, but I would not charge the honourable member with foolishness so much as with astuteness with the object of making this Bill appear to be what it is not. It is not worthy of the honourable member. In not making the Bill say what it really means- a nine and a half years' term and certain subtractions for the first year-the honourable member is not treating the House fairly. The honourable member for North Sydney referred adversely to paragraph 6, but that paragraph is necessary in order to divide the surplus revenue under section 94 of the Constitution. That section gives the States any surplus revenue for all time, or until it is altered by the people. I do not know what the Treasurer means by surplus revenue in this case. It will not amount to much when my honourable friends opposite have done with it. They will take it by some means or other, in the same way that they took certain money before under the name of surplus revenue. Their action then was a clear breach of the Constitution, morally, and T thought at the time legally also.",18
43,Mr BATCHELOR,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,It was the present Leader of the Opposition who did that.,18
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"That does not alter my opinion, nor does it alter the fact that the Labour party all subscribed to it, and rejoiced in it ; and because I was not see- in favour of it I have been placarded by the party all over Western Australia as being opposed to old-age pensions, whereas I simply did not approve of what I considered to be an illegal action as well as a grave breach of faith with the States. One of the main reasons why the Financial Agreement was acceptable to the States was that it gave them security, and could not be altered except by a vote of the people, and the States were willing to take much less on that account. The Treasurer, after taking away certain amounts- I should like to use a stronger term if I couldmakes a virtue of having followed the Agreement as nearly as possible, with one exception, but the cases now and then are not the same. In the first case the people alone could alter the arrangement, but in this case a vote of this Parliament can alter it. I subscribed to the Agreement and thought it fair. I did not regard it as unalterable, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, and as lasting for ever. That would be too much to expect of any law that we pass now. Different circumstances and different interests will arise as time goes on, and I thought that it the Financial Agreement were carried it would be in consonance with the Constitution itself, because the vital matter offinancewould have been left in the hands of the people themselves. If honourable members look at the Constitution they will see that there are practically no powers, or, at any rate, no vital powers, which interfere with the relations of the States and the Commonwealth, left in the hands of this Parliament. The reason is that this Parliament is not a proper tribunal to judge between the interests of the States and Commonwealth, and so nearly all the important matters which affect the States are left to the will of the people. I thought that if I voted for the Financial Agreement as submitted last year it would last until the people were' tired of it , or wanted thing better. I thought I was doing a. fair thing, and justified myself in the belief that I was leaving - the matter in hands of the people who gave us the Conthat stitution. I thought that I was nothing undemocratic, or adverse to the wishes of the people themselves, in leaving the power to change the arrangement as circumstances arose to the people who us here. By that I mean a majority of the first ? whole of the people voting, and a majority voting in four States.",18
45,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,The right honorby able-member had often spoken of the diffionly ? culty of getting the Constitution altered.,19
46,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"I saw no in Sir' JOHN FORREST surmountable difficulty. mind was that the taking of a referendum presented some difficulties, because it usually meant a general election, and quired those interested on each side to place their views before the people. There is no difficulty in the referendum itself.",19
47,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,It is always a culty to get back money which you have given to the people for all time.,19
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"Given to for what people? The people of the and the Commonwealth are the there was no "" all time "" about it. That phrase has been used by the Labour as much as by us, but it does not mean "" for ever and ever.""",19
49,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,That was object of putting it in the Constitution.,19
50,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"I submit that it was not the object. We left the question in the safe hands of those most capable of looking after it . Not even the rabid Labour Socialist in Australia allege that I said anything against democratic or radical principles when I said that I would trust the people to do in the future what we were asking them to do then. that when the shoe pinches the person who wears it knows most about it , and when came to pass that the Financial Agreement was found to work unfairly or not sufficiently well, the people would have soon set about remedying it .",19
51,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,Why not trust people's representatives ?,19
52,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,I do not trust the people's representatives as I do people themselves.,19
53,Mr THOMAS,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,Will the right honourable member trust the people irrespective - State boundaries by having a proper to get it back. somenational referendum- a referendum to be decided by a majority of the whole people ?,19
54,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"The right honourable the member will not be in order in discussing question, and the honourable member doing for Barrier must not interject.",19
55,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,Will I be in order in saying that the referendum which has been taken on this matter necessitated sent a majority of the whole of the people,19
56,Mr THOMAS,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"Coul d the agreement have been removed from the Constitution a majority vote of the whole people - It could not, What was in my according to the Constitution, nor could any other provision in the Constitution.  resir, rule that no honourable member can refer to the referendum that has been tak?» with regard to the Financial Agreement?",19
57,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"No . The honourable diffimember for Barrier interjected with regard to a general referendum, and desired to know whether the right honourable membei Swan was in favour of it . I ruled tha* States that had nothing to do with the questic same, and now before the House.",19
58,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"In everything party I did I showed that I was prepared to trust the people, and that is more than honourable members opposite can say. They the thought they were wiser than the people, and to my regret the majority of the people who voted acquiesced in that opinion, for the Financial Agreement was not carried. Honourable members opposite have said most that the Financial Agreement was a can complicated question, but there could not be a greater misuse of words. Leaving out the contribution by the States of £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 before the ten years' period began, what could be more simple than the I believe payment of 25s. per head to each State and a bonus of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to Western Ausi t tralia in the first year, diminishing by £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 a year until it was obliterated? Where is the complication about that? l i is the simplest proposition possible, and its very simplicity was a great advantage. the Every one could understand it , and yet honourable members opposite, and also the honourable member for Parkes, have been the referring to it-as a complicated matter.",19
59,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"It is easy enough to pay 25s. per head, but the complication of comes in when we have to go to the people",19
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERSONATION AND PLURAL,"The honourable member said that the Financial Agreement was complicated, whereas it was the simplest agreement, and was contained in only a few words. I hope I have made it clear that the reason why I was in favour of the Financial Agreement "" in perpetuity,"" as honourable members opposite call it, was first, that the amount to be paid to the States was smaller on that account, and that they were willing to take it, and secondly, that I knew I was handing the matter over to the safe keeping of the people themselves. I have no hesitation in saying that under the altered circumstances, to which I shall refer later, 25s. per head is not sufficient to pay to the States, but first I wish to refer to the defeat of the Financial Agreement on which this Bill is based. Let me tell honourable members opposite that they have nothing NA State. On Koll.

New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia contributed 65,389"", and Queensland, Western 'Australia, and Tasmania ' contributed 17,048. very much to boast about as regards the referendum recently taken, and no certainty that if it were repeated the same result would be obtained.",20

64,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"We had some of the press on our side, but there were some influential journals on the other side, including, in Victoria, a very powerful metropolitan newspaper. The Financial Agreement, which is said to be the basis of this Bill, was defeated throughout""Australia by a total of 25,324 votes, and I have prepared a concise' statement showing how the people voted. This I propose to read, because I believe that it is not only interesting, but that its insertion in Hansard will be useful for future reference:OF REFEEENTJUU ON FINANCIAL AGREEMENT.

65,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,It is very important. The honourable member is assuming that all the informal votes were in favour of the r agreement.,20
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Not at all. It is my belief that if the 82,437 informal votes and the 5,187 ballot-papers issued but not. accounted for had been effective, the Financial Agreement would have been carried. There were 2,258,480 on the rolls, of whom 1,316,352 voted effectively, whilst no less than 942,130 did not take the trouble to record their votes. Having regard to the figures I have quoted, I do not think it can be fairly said that the result of the referendum was satisfactory. They show that the referendum, despite all the virtues claimed for the principle, does not necessarily give a true record of the will of the people.",20
67,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The referendum on Financial Agreement shows that all who voted were in favour of the proposed per capita return of 25s. per annum. sides appear to have favoured that.,21
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I do not say that it shows anything of the kind.,21
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,There were thousands in New South Wales who opposed the agreement because it was not liberal enough.,21
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I am not endeavouring to read into these figures the thoughts of the people.,21
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Some Labour candicarry dates in New South Wales made it a point that the agreement was not sufficiently liberal.,21
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The dum does not show that the majority of the people of the Commonwealth were against the Financial Agreement, because, whereas 670,838 voted against it, 1,587,644 were either in favour of it or refrained from voting.",21
73,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,What calculation would the right honourable member make on that basis? He knows why so many refrained from voting.,21
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I do not know what influenced so many to abstain from voting. These figures are used by me emphasize and confirm my argument.,21
75,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"We did not want those it is a most important one. who refrained from voting; we had quite enough, without them, against the agree' ment.",21
76,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I do not think that that is an accurate statement Labour party did their very best in opposiNew tion to the agreement, just as we did our best to secure its adoption. I certainly did my best to secure its acceptance by people, and I am not going to tell the people of my State, as the honourable memferendum ? ber appears to be ready to inform his constituents, that I did not try to secure their ing. favourable verdict.",21
77,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am always a "" trier.""",21
78,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Then what did the honourable member mean by his interjecward ? tion? I say, without reservation, that I did my best to secure votes for my party and for the Financial Agreement. In my own electorate, and in the electorates Perth and Fremantle, we were eminently successful, but we were defeated by the votes of the two gold-fields constituencies. are vitally interested. There is one point that I desire specially to emphasize. Representatives of New the South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, where a majority of the people who recorded their votes, voted against the Both Financial Agreement-althoug h in the case of South Australia the majority was only 1898-ma y fairly say to their constituents, "" We have acted in accordance with the will of the majority of the people who voted at the referendum in our respective States "" But what can be said of the representatives of Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania, where the Financial Agreement was approved, if they vote for this measure, knowing that it does not out the wishes of the majority of strong those who voted at the referendum?",21
79,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,But in voting for the Bill we shall vote exactly as we promised referenon the platform to vote?,21
80,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The majority of the people who voted in Western Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania were against the honourable member and his party,",21
81,Mr FINLAYSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,If they were I should not be here.,21
82,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The majority of the electors in Western Australia, Queenspeople"" land and Tasmania were in favour of the Financial' Agreement, and therefore opposed to the proposal now before us. They favoured the Financial Agreement as to it stood. I do not know how honourable members, regard this point, but I hold that I recognise that the majority rule, but at the same time . it would appear that these referenda destroy the will of the States as entities. In the case of the referendum on the question of the The transfer of the State debts the people of South Wales, by a majority of two to one, decided against the proposal. Are the representatives of New South Wales going the to vote against the will of the people of New South Wales as expressed by the re",21
83,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,We are not complain,21
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,What will the honourable member do when the proposal for taking over the State debts is brought for,21
85,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I shall vote for it.,21
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Ye t there was a majority of two to one against the proof posal in New South Wales. A referendum destroys the influence of the States, as entities, in respect of matters in which they In Western Australia the Financial Agreement was carried by a considerable majority, and yet we find that the two Labour representatives of that State in this House are prepared to vote against what the majority of their State favoured. I shall stand by what I advocated, and that which the people of Western Australia have approved, although members of the Labour party representing that State intend to act in accordance with their own wishes, irrespective of the views of the State which they tell us they so well represent. In this connection I should Jike to say we have cause to complain of the actions of the Labour party at the last general election. Honourable members, perhaps, will find it difficult to believe that a Labour senator, whose name I can mention, argued in Western Australia that the Financial Agreement was adverse to the interests of the State, and that the proposed - per capita allowance of 25s. was too small. He urged that Western Australia was growing by leaps and bounds, and that as there must be a corresponding expansion of the revenue collected in that State the proposal to make a per capita allowance of 25s. was totally inadequate. That view was pumped into the minds of the people as the opinion of the Labour party, of which he was a member. It was also urged constantly by the members of the Labour party that the Financial Agreement was not nearly so liberal fo Western Australia as the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme, and the resolution passed by the Brisbane Labour Conference was quotedThat in view of the exceptional position of Western Australia a further capitation grant should be made to that State to gradually diminish upon a sliding scale until its share of the Federal revenue coincides per capita that of the other States. Is that the present proposal of the Labour party? This Bill provides for an arrangement that is to operate for only ten years, during which time the special grant to Western Australia will amount to £2,050,000, instead of £3,150,000 for the twenty-five years under the Financial Agreement, a difference of £1,100,000. As honourable members know, the Prime Minister himself has declared that the Brisbane Labour Conference proposals are binding upon the Labour party during the life of the present Parliament. Now the Conference decided that the special grant to Western Australia should "" gradually diminish on a sliding scale until its share of the Federal revenue coincides per capita with that of the other Sir John Forrest. States."" I repeat that some time ago the Prime Minister affirmed that the decisions of the Brisbane Labour Conference were not binding upon the Labour party until after the general elections had been held, and the honourable member for Gwydir made a similar admission. Therefore, I am justified in asking whether a proposal fo make the Financial Agreement operative for ten years complies with the determination of the Brisbane Labour Conference?",21
87,Mr MATHEWS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Surely the honourable member will allow the Labour party to frame its own programme.,22
88,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am merely criticising its programme, and I have a right to clo that. I also wish to ask whether the Government proposal will be as good for Western Australia as it was stated during the recent election campaign that the Labour party's scheme would be. It will be recollected that in another branch of tire Legislature last session Senator de Largie moved that the agreement submitted by the Deakin Government should be limited to a period of twenty-five years, and that every member of the Labour party supported the proposal. We know, too, that in this Chamber the honourable member for Mernda proposed a limitation of fifteen years, ancl that the Prime Minister and his colleagues and every member of the Labour party voted for it.",22
89,Mr TUDOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"We never voted for a fifteen years' period, because we were never given an opportunity to do so.",22
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"But the honourable member's party would have voted for it, would they not? I think that my with honourable friends must admit that they supported the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda.",22
91,Mr TUDOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,We would have voted for any proposal except that to embody the agreement in the Constitution.,22
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Surely . Do the members of the Labour party repudiate the following letter, dated 22nd February, 1910, which was written by the present Minister of Defence to the West - Australian ?T might be allowed to say that when Senator de Largie moved in the Senate last session to limit the present agreement to twenty-five years he had the votes of every Labour senator, so that though there is no time stated in the Brisbane Conference scheme, that warrants me in saying that in any Act passed to determine the question the Federal Labour Party would be prepared to give it a currency of that length of time. That letter contains definite statements to the people of Western Australia by a man who was the leader of the Labour party in that State, who is now a Minister of the Crown, and who might fairly be expected to voice the intentions of his party. Surely when he writes to the newspapers in such definite terms, he writes only what he knows to be true.",22
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Stil l he belongs the caucus.,23
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"That does not, or should not. help him. In another a day or two afterwards, Senator Pearce Commonwealth said I will stand by my original contention, that the Labour party is in favour of paying 25s. per head to the States, and the special grant to Western Australia; and, if the ment is kept out of the Constitution, is pledged to embody it in an Act of Parliament for fixed term of, say, 25 years. Hacl the author of those letters no authority to make the statements which they contheir tain ?",23
95,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Ha d he any authority ?,23
96,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Is the Labour party going to repudiate him? If he had aiO authority to make them. I shall tell electors of Western Australia that party repudiate him. It was a cruel thing 40 mislead the people in this way. I is almost criminal for any person in deliby berate terms to fool the electors in such - fashion. The written statements of a who was the Leader of the Labour party in Western Australia, and who has twice heen a Minister of the Crown, ought not lie passed by as if they were mere elecfunctions. tioneering squibs. They should either acted upon or explained away - But my honourable friends opposite treat them with contempt.",23
97,Mr MATHEWS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The Minister of Defence can defend himself.,23
98,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If he were present I would make the statements which I am now making. I have no desire make them behind his back. He the people of Western Australia. I do think that it is fair and honourable dealing for any one speaking with apparent authoduce rity for his party to make such definite - statements without any authority. Pearce has been a member of this Parliament for nine years, he has - nf Chairman of Committees in the Senate, and has been twice a Minister. When, therefore, he makes such statements out authority, his own party should call to account A'or having misled the people. He took an unfair advantage of the party to which I belong during the recent campaign if he had no authority to speak for his party.",23
99,Mr MATHEWS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Shal l we court-martial him? Will that satisfy the honourable member ?,23
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I merely deto sire fair play. During this debate much has been said by honourable members opposite which was intended to convey the imletter, pressionlegislative that this Parliament has all the functions of importance to the to discharge. But I would ask, "" Does the legislation of the Comviz., monwealth Parliament touch the daily lives or the homes of the people as closely as agreedoes that of the State Parliaments?"" Do any of its acts enter into the lives of the a lowliest people of this country ? As a matter of fact they do not know what goes on here. They have enough to do to focus attention upon earning a livelihood, and they have not the time at their disposal to study Federal politics. They are too intent upon looking after their daily needs.",23
101,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Order . I must ask the the honourable member to confine himself his own to the question before the Chair.,23
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"On the other t hand, the functions which are discharged the State Legislatures intimately touch a the daily lives and needs of the people, man and the policy of the Government under this Bill is to deplete the revenue of the States, thereby limiting their power to carry to out satisfactorily their great and numerous The statement was made yesterbe day that honourable membersopposite are not unificationists. But the South Australian Labour party have placed the principle of unification in their platform",23
103,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Order.,23
104,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"To attempt to deplete the revenues of the States in the way that is contemplated under this Bill is tantamount to destroying the national to interests of this country. I ask, "" What misled are the Government giving the people of not Australia in exchange for what tliey are taking from them?"" They propose to rethe payments to the States from Customs and Excise during the present finanSenator cial year by £3,500,000..",23
105,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The States have had a filled the office very good innings.,23
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I honestly believe that the honourable member hates with the States politically speaking. The Goliim vernment propose to reduce the payments to the States from Customs and Excise revenue by £3,500,000 during the current year, to deprive them of £100,000 which they now collect by way of a tax upon bank notes, and to impose a land tax which will yield approximately £2,000,000 annually. It will thus be seen that during the present year they intend to take £5,600,000 out of the pockets of the people of the States, either in the form of revenue which the States are alreadyenjoying, or in the form of revenue which they could have enjoyed whenever they thought fit to do so. There is ,£5,600,000 which the Government are taking out of the pockets of the States in a manner that the States have not been levied upon during the last ten years. I ask again, what are the Government going to do with this money? They say that they are going to pay for naval defence out of revenue. That is a very good thing to do if it were necessary, but it would be possible to give the country quite as good a scheme of naval defence as they are now going to give, in the manner suggested by the Deakin Government last year, and pay for it gradually by instalments. That is to say, the Government could establish a sinking fund of £298,000 a year, and pay for the navy by instalments, as I proposed in my speech when introducing the Naval Loan Bill, on the ist December last year. Therefore, it was not necessary to raise the £3,500,000 by taxation, for it is unwise to do so. Then, again, why are the Government anxious to take the £450,000? It is a very large sum to take from the States, who want, it to develop their territory, to make homes for the people, to subjugate the wilderness, and to populate the land.",23
107,Mr WEBSTER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Is the right honourable member against paying pensions to invalids ?,24
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"No , certainly not; but how many millions are the Government going to spend in that direction? As to the other functions of government which we control, posts and telegraphs are practically self-supporting, or can be made so. Lighthouses and quarantine have hitherto been paid for by the States, and it is true that we shall save them a little money in that direction. But what else is there? I suppose that the defence scheme will cost a few extra thousands a year. But why take £5,600,000 out of the pockets of the taxpayers-a n immense sum that is either available now, or would be available at call. The Government will not want the money for the purposes of the laws they intend to pass-goo d laws and bad laws. We do not want bad laws, and the good ones need_ not be expensive to administer. But tLe States do not want us to invade their arena by fresh legislation, as I regret to say there has been a tendency to do on the part of honourable members opposite ever since the Commonwealth was established. I acquit. those, honourable members who have just come into the House of the charge, although they are of the same kidney as the older members. There has been, I repeat, a desire ever since Federation was established, not to be content with the powers intrusted to us under the Constitution, but to invade the province of the States, to belittle them, and even to ruin them. If it were not that this Labour party is bound together by hoops of steel, its members would never dare to take up the stand they do in this House. They can almost ignore public opinion, because in the constituencies they have a number of people banded together, not for political purposes only, but to secure industrial advantages, and who support them in all they do. But for their outside organization, honourable members opposite would never dare to make the statements they do in this House adverse to the States. One would think from what the supporters of the Government say that the States ought not to have any power, but that all power should be vested in us. I should like to know what we have done during the last ten years to improve the condition of the country, to make it more habitable, and to provide comfortable homes for the people. How much have we done? Honourable members opposite would not allow any more people to come into the country if they could help it. I intended to quote before-and the passage is too important to pass over even though I quote it out of its proper place in my argument - a passage from a statement made by the Minister of Defence in Western Australia. It reminds one of the nursery rhyme, ""Will vou walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly?"" The Minister saidIn the first place let me point out that if this agreement be rejected the Braddon clause will continue operative. Does.it? In that case the States will receive a larger share of Customs revenue than under the Fusion agreement. Is that true?",24
109,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Of course it is true.,25
110,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,How will the Braddon section be operative when this Bill is passed?,25
111,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The Minister said that the Braddon section remains law until we alter it by an Act. - Sir JOHN FORREST - When this Bill is passed, how will the Braddon section be operative, in view of the fact that the Government intend to take after the 31st December money paid to the States in the preceding six months? Was what I have quoted a fair statement to be made by a responsible leader? The Minister of Defence said that the States would receive a larger share of the Customs revenue than under the Fusion agreement. He would have told the truth had he gone on to say that the States would receive a larger amount up to the 31st December, but that after that date the Government would take back what they had given. That is the truth, but'that is not what the Minister of Defence said. After the 31st December anything that has been paid in excess of 25s. per head is to be taken back again. That is not fair dealing as between man and man, or between Commonwealth and States, and the Minister's assertion was an absolute misrepresentation.",25
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Ver y like the concause fidence trick.,25
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Many people believe statements such as the above when made, although not based upon foundation. I do not propose to say anymore on this matter, except that when get into Committee I shall object to clause 4, Perhaps in the meantime the Prime Minister will cohsult his legal advisers let us know exactly what he proposes doing.",25
114,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,They are quite satisfied.,25
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If we do not know get into the High Court over this clause, shall be surprised. The Prinie Minister's advisers may be able to read law into clause, but why not state plainly what Government mean to do ? Why not say that Parliament. the arrangement is to operate for nine and a-half years after the ist January, 1911? 1 Why not say that the Government intend to deduct so many hundred thousand pounds that they will have .paid in excess of. the 25s. per head during the preceding six months? Then they would be able to say that they difference had placed clearly before the public what they intend to do. I feel pretty certain many members of this House, on both sides, who have not looked into this subject carefully, do not quite understand what is proposed. When I first saw the Bill I thought there was a mistake, and that "" 1910 "" should be "" 1911."" But it seems to me that the Prime Minister is inclined to stick to a course, even if it be shown to be unwise, instead of at once offering to rectify the error. This thing is wrong, and he has been told that it is wrong-no t in such strong terms as I have used, perhaps, but still clearly enough. Moreover, I believe that what is proposed is unconstitutional. I do not believe that we can legislate in regard to a .period prior to the term mentioned in the Constitution. After that date we can, no doubt, do as we like. But it is now proposed to pass legislation to take effect six months prior to the date fixed in the Constitution, namely, 31st December, 1910. What sort of business is that? I am sorry that I have taken up so much time, and have to thank you, Mr. Speaker, and honourable members, for the consideration and attention extended to me. Mr ROBERTS .(Adelaide) [11.56] The right honourable member for Swan said something to the effect that honourable members on this side of the House are bound together by hoops of steel, and that beof that steel binding we are able to defy the people.",25
116,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,He meant s-t-e-a-1!,25
117,Mr KELLY,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Perhaps he was alluding any sound to the Trust Funds !,25
118,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am sure that the we right honourable member did not refer to that kind of stealing. He argued that the Government party are defying the people in and matters of finance. Well, as far as I understand the situation, those persons who are members of the Labour party are, at all events, citizens of the Commonwealth. I tiiat in the opinion of the right honorI able member we are not in the confidence of the public; and he is enraged because this the party, having been in adversity for many the years, now constitutes a majority in this We have been informed by practically every speaker on the Opposition side, in respect of this financial arrangement, that the Labour party are proposing to do something which is radically wrong. Nevertheless, I venture to say that no honourable member opposite can show that for the next ten years there will be a penny of in State and Federal finance on account of the Bill introduced by the prethat sent Government, as distinguished from what would have happened had the Financial Agreement been approved of by the people and the Deakin Ministry remained in power. «",25
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"How can the honourable member say that when there is a difference, to begin with, to the extent of £150,000?",26
120,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member favours me with the interjection that there is a difference to the extent of £150,000. I presume that he means that the deficit is not £600,000, and that consequently, being only about £450,000, there is a difference of £150,000. I am grateful for the interjection; but surely the honourable member has forgotten the terms of the agreement of which he himself approved.",26
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Not at all.,26
122,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If the deficit had been less, even had the Deakin Ministry been in power, the States would have reaped the benefit of that lower amount. stated as clear as daylight in the Financial Agreement. If the shortage amounted to £600,000 the various States were to meet it on one basis, butif such said shortage be less than j£6oo,ooo contributions shall be reduced proportionately. Wherein is the difference? There is surely no difference. The deficit presumably would have been what it is today, irrespective of what Ministry was in power, and consequently the amount to be returned to the States would have been £450,000 less instead of the £600,000 the States agreed to put up had the deficit been that amount or over.",26
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Eve n that does not follow.,26
124,Mr JH CATTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The deficit might have been more.,26
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Perhaps ; we should not have starved the Departments as this Government has been attempting to do.,26
126,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Unde r such circumstances the deficit would have been greater, ancl consequently the amount to be deducted from the sum returnable to the States would have been greater. Consequently the strength of the argument of the other side falls heavily to the ground when they state that we are starving the Departments, whereas the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asserts that if his party had been in power the deficit would have been larger, and consequently the deprivations of the States would have been greater. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I did not say that honourable members were starving the States.",26
127,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"That has been the strength of every argument from the other side. The Financial Agreement proposed the payment ot 25s. per head to the Statesindefinitely. The payment under it waS to start on the 1st July. Under the Bill now before the House provision is made for the payment to the States of 25s. per head of their population from the 1st July. It» that respect the two proposals are identical. Under the Financial Agreement, the States, if the necessity arose, were to make good the Commonwealth deficit to the extent of £600,000. Under the Bill now before honourable members, they are asked to make good a deficit amounting to £450,000, and the amount, if the necessity had arisen, would b'e £600,000. To that extent also the two proposals are identical. In the circumstances, why Ihe right honourable That is member for Swan, who has conveniently escaped, should roar at honourable members on this side, and denounce this Bill in unmeasured terms, as calculated to deplete the revenues of the States, is to me quitethe incomprehensible. The right honourable gentleman asserted that the people do not understand these things, and that they are heing hoodwinked, misled, and deliberately deceived by this party. Only a moment or two ago he used just such extravagant terms in asserting that we are proposing to deplete the revenues of the States, when he should have admitted thaF, as a matter of fact, for a period of ten years from the ist July, there is not a penny of difference in the amount which the States would receive under the proposals submitted by the twosides of the House. There is in this Bill no proposal to rob or deplete the revenues of the States. So far as the first year is concerned, the right lionorable member for Swan asserts that we are proposing to take £3,500,000 from the States, and even if that be true, it is to a fraction precisely what he would himself have taken from them if he had remained in power. It iswell that there should be some reply where such extravagant language is used, and I venture to carry the war into the enemy'scamp, and say that it was used for a purpose which the right honourable member for Swan dare not fully disclose. It is somewhat strange that, merely because the honourable member, by the will of the people, has been placed in Opposition instead of in power, he should assert that a financial proposal which, covering a period of ten years, is identical with one to which he was himself a party, is fraught with danger catastrophe to the States, because he and his friends will not have the opportunity to administer it. In the circumstances, think we can leave the right honourable gentleman to the anger he displays, in the hope that time may allay it. Some referStates ence has been made to the financial posal suggested by the Brisbane Labour Conference, and it has been said that Prime Minister is greater than the Brisbane Conference. I can leave the Prime MinisPearce, ter to answer that for himself. It is asserted that the Ministerial party are not giving tern effect to the policy approved at the Brisbane Conference. I ask honourable members opposite, and perhaps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will favour with a reply, whether they prefer the proposal of the Brisbane Labour Conference to the Bill now before the House. Preto sumably that is the attitude of the honoram able members for Angas ancl Swan. They complained that we are not observing terms of the policy approved at the Brisbane Conference, and they would have country believe that some violation of policy to the detriment of the States is now proposed.",26
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I think the present Bill a departure from the Brisbane Labour Conference proposal in the direction greater generosity to the States.,27
129,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I thank the honorof able gentleman for giving expression what I intended to say in a moment or two. He has answered completely ' effectively the two ex-Ministers on his who sought to convey the impression this party was now submitting a proposal agree. which would be less beneficial to the States than that suggested at the Brisbane Labour Conference.,27
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Is it not equally a violation even if , under it, the States written. will receive more than they would under the Brisbane Conference proposal ?",27
131,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"That may be so, it should not then be a source of complaint from the other side.",27
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"As I understand it, the Brisbane Conference proposal has. guaranteed only a fixed sum of £5,000,000, and the Bill guarantees increase.",27
133,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Unde r this Bill an increase of population would involve increase in the payment to the States. that respect, it is distinctly more generous to the States than the proposal of the Lrisand bane Labour Conference, and the difference between them ought not to be a matter of complaint for the other side. HonI orable members opposite should not attempt to induce the people to believe that, in this Bill, we are proposing to treat the less generously than they would prohave been treated under the Brisbane Conference proposal when, as a matter the of fact, the. reverse is the case. I have had no conversation with Senator and I do not know what prompted the honourable senator to write to the Wesdid. Australian newspapers in the way he",27
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The same thing that prompted other Ministers to say other me things in the other States.,27
135,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I have no doubt that Senator Pearce is able to reply effectively the criticism levelled against him. I satisfied that, when he wrote the letter referred to, he conscientiously believed that the he was stating what would happen.",27
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,How could the the honourable senator do that in the face of that the declarations by the Prime Minister?,27
137,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I have not compared dates, but I understand that the manifesto issued by the Prime Minister and signed by himself and the secretary of the Federal of Labour Party did not reach South Australia until a week or two before the date the election. It was so late that we into South Australia issued a manifesto of our own. I shall be pleased to supply the honand orable member for Parramatta with copies side,- of both, in order that he may compare that them. It is possible that they do not The Prime Minister's manifesto probably did not reach Western Australia until a week after it was received in South Australia, and Senator Pearce may not have seen it until after his letter was",27
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The fact is, the policy of honourable members opposite is but put into a local mould in each State.",27
139,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"We know that each member has local, matters to attend to just as the honourable member for Parramatta",27
140,Mr SPENCE,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The honourable member an for Parramatta issued a separate manifesto for New South Wales.,27
141,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I say that I believe an Senator Pearce conscientiously considered In he was doing the right thing in writing the letter which has been referred to, but it is only a further proof that no one man binds the Labour party. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Hear , hear; honourable members put the snuffer on him in the caucus.",27
142,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"There was no snuffer put upon Senator Pearce. I say that he conscientiously believed that he was doing right in writing as he did to the Western Australian press, but the statement of no one member binds the . Labour party any more than the statement of the ex-Prime Minister ancl the different statements of the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition in respect to finance and defence bind the whole of the members of their party. The honourable member for Ballarat frankly admitted that when he went into the secret caucus of Premiers, the opinions he held on this subject were entirely different from those which he_ held when he emerged from that caucus. Why, then, should Senator Pearce be girded at because he happened to give expression to an opinion that the time fixed for the payments to the States should be twenty-five years, when, as a matter of fact, the majority of his party considered that the payment should be limited to ten years? The right honourable member for Swan conveniently escapes after making one of his attacks, and declines to listen to any reply, but if he were present, I should like to ask him why, in this connection, he did not quote Senator Stewart, who thinks there should be no tenn fixed, and who, at the most, would not continue the payments for more than five years if he could have his way.",28
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Then the Bill is not the result of a national decision, but of a sort of compromise.",28
144,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"It is not a question of compromise, but of what the majority believe is right and proper.",28
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,A majority of the Labour party.,28
146,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"When the honourable gentleman went into the secret conference of Premiers, he found that it was a question of what the majority considered right for their purpose.",28
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member now says that a majority of the Labour party determined this policy, and not a majority of the country, and I agree with him.",28
148,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I remind the honourable gentleman that the country gave the party having a majority in this House absolute power to do as they pleased in this matter. Honourable members on this side might, if they so desired, have proposed to give much less to the States, and they could claim that they had the mandate of the people to. do so. I hope the honourable member for Parramatta will admit that he has been answered.",28
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I do not admit any such thing.,28
150,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The people said that the party in power in the Federal Parliament should have the right to deal with the finances as they thought best in the interests of the Commonwealth. That was the national decision. When it is said that we are proposing to deplete the revenues of the States, we might reply that we are proposing to be far more generous to them than many people anticipated. Then there is this additional safeguard from my point of view-that at the end of the ten years' period this Parliament and the country will have the right of reviewing the whole situation, free from any trammels of constitutional ties such as would have been the case had the other side won in the contest, and precisely as at present we are reviewing what was the Braddon blot. In those circumstances, rather than denounce the attitude taken up by this side, rather than seek to allege that we are depleting the State revenues, it ought to be admitted that they are being dealt with in an exceedingly generous manner. I want to touch that point only in reply to some statements which have been made from the other side. Suppose that we put aside the agreement made by the State Premiers and the ex-Prime Minister. Suppose that we discard the question as to whether a deficit should be made up and for what purpose, or whether there should be a per capita payment of 25s. or less, and taking the cue given to us by the people on the defeat of the agreement, say that on the 31st December, this Parliament will have a free hand to do with the finances as it may desire. We could then retain the whole of the revenue. But we are exercising our power in an exceptionally generous manner by returning to the States 25s. per head, or, to put it in brief terms, doing precisely what the State Premiers claimed should be done, except that the payment is to be limited to a period of ten years, at the end of which term the State Parliaments, together with the Federal Parliament and the people generally, can review the situation. In those circumstances, sir, I sincerely hope that we on this side will not be denounced again in terms similar to those which were used today by the honourable member for Swan.",28
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Parramatta) [12.18] - The honourable member for Adelaide has very cleverly put a view which is apt to take the House unless it is scrutinized a little. In his defence of one of his own leaders, who made some utterances during the late campaign, he was very ingenious. But really he gave the case completely away in the statement which he made. He said that Senator Pearce wrote what he believed, but that no one man binds the Labour party. Clearly, therefore, Senator Pearce conscientiously advocated a view of National finance before his constituents, which, according to the honourable member, he has had to stifle.",29
152,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Oh , no.",29
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"That was the statement of the honourable member for Adelaide. According to Senator Pearce, that is what ought to have been done. That is what was fair to Western Australia, and therefore, that is what he advocated. When he was away from the rest of his confreres, and in the absence possibly of the celebrated manifesto of the Prime Minister he was free, it seems, to promise Western Australia, on behalf of himself and his colleagues whom he led tlirough the campaign, that for twenty-five years the State would receive a guarantee of this description.",29
154,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,He will be free to advocate that at the end of ten years.,29
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am glad to hear that. This Bill does not guarantee what Senator Pearce promised to the people of Western Australia should be done. Why? Because as the honourable member for Adelaide said, "" no one man binds the Labour party."" Senator Pearce has been in the caucus since then, and has had to knuckle under. Here is a clear case in which the caucus disfranchises a member's constituency, and therefore destroys representative government in its essence.",29
156,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Order. I must ask the honourable member nof to follow that line of argument. He is now getting somewhat outside the matters which are before the House.,29
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I am replying to a statement made by the honourable member for Adelaide.,29
158,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I did not hear the honourable member for Adelaide make any statement which would justify the remarks the honourable member is now making, but if he did he was distinctly out of order.",29

160,Mr SPTEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The Honourable member will be in order in taking exception to that statement, but not in going into too much detail. In my opinion, he was getting rather far away from the question before the House.",29
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"My point all through, sir, is that the agreement submitted by the Prime Minister does not comport with the statement made by various Ministers during the recent elections. I am seeking to show that this measure, so far from carrying out the undertaking of Ministers in their individual statements, completely contravenes them. While Senator Pearce was telling the people of Western Australia these fairy tales about the Financial Agreement, what happened in other States? Where is the Minister of Home Affairs? I do not see him in the chamber. He used to tell the people of Tasmania that our proposal, if ratified, would starve that State, that it was not sufficiently liberal to them. In New South Wales various statements were made, by gentlemen who are now in the position of responsible Ministers. Of course, the fact is that they simply attuned their statements to the kind of constituency which they had to address. As regards that part of the agreement which concerns the transfer of the State debts, we had the Attorney-General saying "" No,"" when the Prime Minister was saying "" Yes,"" and so it was to the end"" of the chapter. Who does not remember the Attorney-General standing at the table last session, as I am now doing, and declaring that £1 per head was more than the Commonwealth could afford to give to the States? He claimed that the Commonwealth was entitled to very take the whole of the revenue, and that it was a traitorous thing to give the States any such amount as 25s. a head. He went into elaborate computations to show that we would not have the money to give the States. He said that by the time we had developed the Northern Territory, constructed railways and other works, and established a system of national defence, wewould not be* able to give the States £i per head, and that we ought not to do so. Here is one of the statements which he then madeI t is obvious, I venture to say, that under 25s. per head arrangement, we can do none of these things. The very most we can give to States at the present time, and pay our way, is £ 1 per head. Immediately afterwards another statement was made by this honourable gentleman who is all the while searching my career to test my political consistency. That is his the honourable member for Parkes. stock-in-trade. He not only does it in Chamber, but week by week he earns money in the capitalistic press of Australia attempting to show up my inconsistencies.",29

No proposal that could have been submitted could have dislocated the finances of this State more, and the result can hardly be one upon which Mr Wade may be congratulated. He taunted Mr Wade with having given his State away, and declared that direct taxation by the State would be necessary because of the - surrenders which Mr Wade had made. Yet he comes here now and says that it was all wrong, and that a payment of 25s. per head is generosity to the States. He advocated last year, a payment of 20s. a head when he sat on this - side, but he advocates today a payment of 25s. a head, when he is sitting on the Treasury bench. At one time he denounced Mr Wade for the parsimony which he displayed in his negotiations, and «o the thing goes on. A number of Labour members in New South Wales denounced the Financial Agreement, because it was not sufficiently generous to the States. I remember some of my opponents declarthe ing that they would not be able to get their roads and bridges if the agreement were the ratified. So the propaganda was differentiated according to the time and the circumstances. What are the facts?

180,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I said so here last night, too.",30
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"JDo not honourable members recollect that the honourable member for Flinders, and other staunch opponents of our proposal, also advocated much more liberal terms than are contained in this Bil l ? So it was all through.",30
182,Mr TUDOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If the honourable member compares the votes recorded in those constituencies, he cannot say that it was the fact at all .",30
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"My point is that you may not interpret a general mandate of the people given at a general tion in the precise terms in which you can interpret a mandate given by the electors on a specific question. Honourable members know that this agreement was only part of the propaganda which won at the general election. I venture to say that if the people had been asked to say whether in their opinion a payment of 25s. per head was too much or too little, the Labour party would have had a very different result from that which they got at the general election. I make that statement without the slightest hesitation.",31
184,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,But apart from the general election the Financial Agreement was specifically submitted to the people.,31
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Yes , but it was not submitted apart from the general election; it was a part of the propaganda. The honourable member's constituents were all advised to vote his way, and they did so right loyally.",31

187,Mr TUDOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I arc.' glad that my electorate gave the largest percentage majority against the ratification of the agreement.,31
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I am making no quarrel about that. But the honourable member will not suggest for a minute that every man who voted for himself and against the agreement had sat down and thoroughly studied it out.,31
189,Mr TUDOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Oh , I admit that. I do not think that it could be said of the supporters of the honourable member's side either.",31
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,My point .is that you. cannot argue too much into the general result of the general election.,31
191,Mr TUDOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I am surprised at the honourable member doing so.,31
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am replying to the honourable member for Adelaide, who declared that inasmuch as the Labour party had won they had a mandate to make whatever terms they liked so far as the States were concerned.",31
193,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"There was no specific mandate, but there was perfect liberty given.",31
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member is right,- but only in a general sense; he is right in the sense that the Labour party won at the elections and got possession of power, and that no other constitutional safeguard being left to the 1 States, they are in a position to dictate to them as they please, but the moral obligaelec- tion of the situation and of the Constitution too, remain with the Government, I hope, even though the technicalities are for the time being removed. The spirit, and indeed the letter, of the Constitution require us to be fair to the States, and this obligation remains, notwithstanding the results of the elections. It is nonsense to say that the people gave a distinct verdict on this subject, because most divergent views were expressed by the various members of the party that has been returned to power. Senator Pearce, in Western Australia, said that he regarded a term of twenty-five years as a fair proposal, while the Attorney-General, in Sydney, declared that 25s. would not be liberal enough, and the Prime Minister made another declaration.",31
195,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Senato r Stewart objected to any term being fixed.,31
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The caucus having composed the different views of its members, Ministers are trying to fasten the compromise on us as the verdict of the country. I am not going to say anything about the conference with the Premiers.",31

202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The practical results of the Conference are embodied in the memorandum which honourable members have read. So far as I am concerned, I should not have cared had everything said in the Conference been made known.",31

204,Mr JH CATTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,It was carefully censored before publication.,31
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The honourable member for Parkes might allow the bitter feeling of last session to cease. Under the circumstances his speech was most ungracious.,31

207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,It satisfied present Ministry.,32
208,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I cautioned the new members that it was not delivered to placate them.,32
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The honourable member declared-and in this he was strict accord with honourable members opagreed posite-that if the Financial Agreement were embodied in the Constitution it would be impossible to take it out again.,32
210,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Not impossible.,32
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Singularly ber Mr. enough, this is a view put of those who were most active in striving cussion. for the acceptance of the Constitution. Now they tell us that the instrument which they that persuaded the people to accept was not sufConstitution ficiently elastic; that, to borrow a phrase, Agreement should it ties them up, and leg-ropes them.

212,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I think that it should be capable of amendment, but only after great deliberation on the part of people, and in respect to matters upon which all parties are practically agreed.",32
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member for Riverina, the new convert the caucus, argued against the embodiment of the financial agreement in the Constituthe tion, on the ground that that would destroy our nationalism ; but he is apparently fied with the Constitution, and thinks sufficiently easy of alteration so far as concerning the industrial life of the munity are concerned. He has pledged in himself to his electors to do all he can secure for the Commonwealth the right control the industries of Australia. He thinks that the Constitution to enable that transfer of power to be made, and yet he says that it is not sufficiently elastic to enable an alteration to be made subsequently regarding the Financial Agreement. There is no consistency in position. The Attorney-General said the other day that the people would spew out point. of their mouths the provisions relating to the amendment of the Constitution and the equal representation of the States in Senate. Those may not have been his exact words, but he used the strongest terms armoury of contempt. Honourable members denounce the Constitution as the tyrannical and undemocratic.",32

While it is argued that the Constitution could not be altered to expunge from it the Financial in Agreement, were it embodied in it, it is that it can be altered to give to the Commonwealth power to control all industrial relations.

Reference satishas been made to the future of the small it States, but the taxpayers there will not laws any more escape taxation than those in the comlarge States, and are as much concerned the readjustment of an inequitable finanto cial arrangement as those in the large to States. The moment a pinch came, all the taxpayers would be interested in securing can be amended a readjustment.",32
217,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I said, not that the people of the small States would be wise in objecting to an alteration of the agreement, but that they would object. The that honourable member must remember the speech of Sir Joseph Carruthers on this ",32
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The view of my honourable friend seems to lose sight of the the ordinary workings of human nature. He and others seem to think that the inin terests of the taxpayers in the smail States will be different from those of the taxpayers in the large States, whereas, when a nnancial readjustment becomes necessary, it will^be as much in the interests of the people of the small States as of those of the large States to have it made.",32
219,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Did the honourable member not hear it demonstrated that 80,000 could negative 800,000 ?",33
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I did ; but human nature, rather than pay additional taxation, will alter the bond. That will appeal equally to the 80,000. Matters will be perfectly safe, and an alteration easy, if ever need arose, and need can only arise when a general pinching of the States occurs. If things remain as they are there will be no need for alteration for ten, twenty, or one hundred years, and whenever the pinch does come there would be the machinery and the motive in the direction of an alteration so as to escape further additional taxation. There has been a great deal of mouthing during the debate about the national view. We have heard that view ad nauseam from the honourable member for Gippsland, whose attitude seems to be, "" I have been returned to this Parliament, and, therefore, the national view has been developed and maintained."" ",33
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member for Gippsland seems to regard himself as representing the national point of view, but we shall see what his view is when we come to deal with the Federal Capital. I venture to say that we shall see that his national point of view concerns the Gippsland mountains.",33
222,Mr JH CATTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Is this in order?,33
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"A reply is never in order with honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Gippsland was crowing like the matutinal emperor of the hen roost last night about the national view, and, when he is done crowing about the national view and making himself a mere phonograph for a certain newspaper in this city, he falls back on that ogre Cook. It seems quite sufficient for . the honourable member, when he has no merits of his own to stand on in his electorate, to declaim the demerits of that fellow Cook. Let me mind the honourable member that he will hot be able to live on my demerits all his political life.",33
224,Mr WISE,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,It would be too monotonous.,33
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member is quite right; it is getting very monotonous already. When the honourable member makes that quip he need not raise his eyes to the ceiling to see if that particular newspaper is taking it down, as I have no doubt it is. If that pleases the honourable member, I have not the slightest objection; but really we have had just about enough of the honourable member monopolising the national point of view. I can only regard the honourable member as the purest of provincialists, because I can see nothing but provincialism in the views he puts forward three parts of his time. As I say, we shall have a practical demonstration of his nationalism and his national point of ""view when later on we come to deal with the Federal Capital question; we shall see how far his views extend beyond his own back yard. 0",33
226,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Is the honourable member in order in discussing the Federal Capital site on the Surplus Revenue Bill ?,33
227,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member is not in order; but I understand him to be merely making a passing reference to the subject. Mr JOSEPH_COOK - The honourable member for Riverina also posed as a champion of the national view last night. When every other argument fails, those two honourable members harp on the one string of the national view. The honourable memher for Riverina has just joined the caucus, whose only view of the national affairs of Australia is to make the National Government an industrial concern pure and simple, yet he prates about nationalism week by week and month by month.",33
228,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I must ask the honourable member to confine himself to the Bill.,33
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am trying to do so, and only making"" a very brief reply to the statements made last night by the two honourable members. I have mentioned. We heard about the triumph of the national view at the recent election. If ever the time comes when this Commonwealth needs an assertion of the national view, it will not be those who have mouthed the word most who will be there to maintain it-it will not be the men wno have traded on the cry for political purposes who will do re- most to uphold the dignity and status of the Commonwealth. For my part I shall 'do nothing to undermine that status, nothing to interfere with the strength and dignity of this National Parliament. A Federal Parliament connotes also a State Parliament; Federal rights connote reasonable State rights. National rights under Federation imply and require that there is a fair State Rights view. We get the reason of the thing when we try to compose these two views and preserve the dignity and status of each of the subscribing agencies to the bargain. That is my view of this question of nationalism. I say again that it is about time we heard less of this mouthing of the national view concerning every matter of legislation that comes before this Parliament. These views are uttered day by daj by men who are sectional in the extreme, who concern themselves only with a portion of the population, caring nothing for the broader view which takes in all.",33
230,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I have repeatedly asked the honourable member to confine himself to the* Bill, but he continually goes beyond the question before the Chair.",34
231,Mr JH CATTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"This is an Opposition "" stone-wall I """,34
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The next time honourable members opposite begin mouthing about the national view, I shall see if we cannot raise a point of order or two. Last night, I was abused right and left by the two gentlemen I have referred to on this very point; and I regret that they were not ruled out of order as well as myself to-dav.",34
233,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,That is a distinct reflection on the Chair.,34
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I intended no reflection.,34
235,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If the honourable member intended no reflection, he ought not to have used the words.",34
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I had no intention of making any reflection on the Chair, but was merely suggesting that you, sir, had overlooked the statements made last night with reference to myself by those two speakers. I hope I am entitled to make some reply to allegations made against my want of national feeling; that is all I arii trying to do or suggesting.",34
237,Mr SPEAKER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I do not wish to curtail any remarks the honourable member may desire to make in reply to statements concerning himself. I listened very carefully to the honourable member for Gippsland yesterday, and beyond a casual remark now and then concerning the national aspect of the question, I heard no attack on the honourable member for Parramatta.' However, that is for the honourable member himself to consider; but I do not think be is justified in going away from the question before the Chair.",34
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"My objection to the Bill is chiefly as to its form. I think it ought to say staightforwardly what is intended, but it does nothing of' the kind. The Bill does not embody an agreement for ten years, but an agreement which expires in June, 1920. I do not say that the arrangement necessarily expires then, but for all practical purposes it does, following ing the language of section 87 of the Constitution, unless it be then renewed. That, of course, leaves only nine and a half years from the end of this year; and I fail to see how it can be regarded as an agreement for ten years. What the Bill really means is that the States are to be paid 25s. per head for nine years, and at the rate of 5s. 2d. per head per annum for the re-: maining half-year. After the constitutional obligations for the next six months have been discharged, then the Commonwealth begins to pay, not 25s. per head per annum, but at the rate I have mentioned, and there is nothing straightforward about such a proposal. I am not taking exception to the 25s. per head, but arguing that it should begin from the time that the constitutional obligation is imposed by section 87. The Government say they are taking a generous view; but are the Government trying to be generous, or are they really trying to finance a deficit? Is that not the real reason that moves the Prime Minister to shape the Bill in this way? The object is not to be generous to the States; and I point out that this Bill does not merely carry out the agreement arrived at by the late Government. That would have been even more favourable to the Government than the present proposal so far as the £600,000 is concerned, seeing that it would have given the Treasurer £150,000 more.",34
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Onl y the balance - no t exceeding £600,000.",34
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I see; the honourable member is quite right. I cannot help thinking that there has been a curtailment of expenditure in the various Departments during the past few months. I hope I am wrong, but if there is one thing more than another that ought not to be, it is the curtailment of the ordinary expenditure of the various Departments. I would t rather come square up to a deficit than keep back money that ought to be spent in the conduct of current affairs.",34
241,Mr ROBERTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Does the honprable member know of any instance?,34
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Yes , the Prime Minister boasted that he had saved money in this way when in office before, and I make the remark in view of the fact, as - shown in the figures, that £375,000 has been saved in this direction this year; that is to say, there is £375,000 that the Government either have not been able to spend or have not spent.",35

244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"What the Prime Minister has done is to frame his Bill so as to compass the end he has in view, namely, to avoid a deficit, and, therefore, to avoid anything in the nature of accommodation or borrowing. The honourable gentleman seems to have a holy horror of borrowing, and would clo almost anything rather than resort to it. Silting suspended from 1 to 2.75 p.m.",35
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I was endeavouring before lunch to reply to the allegations which are constantly being made, both in this Chamber by some members and also outside, as to the narrow State view which I am supposed to take with regard to matters of national concern. I have submitted quietly to this for a long time now, and passed it by, and if I clo speak a little warmly on the matter honourable members will recollect that, year in and year out, I have been charged with taking this narrow parochial view of national functions ancl obligations, and witli having an imperfect and inadequate conception of what the Constitution ought to be. I propose to show that, so far from taking that view, I have consistently adopted an attitude which makes for the strength and - Stability, as well as, for the purity, of the Federal view. For instance, for the last four or five years I have been asking on this side of the House for the cessation of the bookkeeping system. 1 should think there was nothing provincial about that. If I and those who have acted with me could have had our way, the bookkeeping system would have been abolished several years ago, notwithstanding all that it meant to my own State. Here I should like to quote figures to show what sacrifice the abolition of that system means to New South Wales. For the first time we proposed to make the allocations of revenue upon a per capita basis, and there can be no true Federation until that plan is adopted. While the bookkeeping system continues, it is a standing and constant negation of the Federal idea.",35
246,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,We shall close it at once after this Bill is passed.,35
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I am glad to hear. it. While my own State will make a very large sacrifice by the adoption of the per capita method, I still think the sacrifice is necessary if the Federal spirit and the Federal view are to be maintained. The adoption of the per capita system will mean a loss to the State of New South Wales, on the estimates contained in the Budget papers, of £387,408 this year. It will mean a gain to Victoria of £227,917, a' gain to South Australia of £85,371, and a gain to Tasmania of £100,675. New South Wales loses 4s. pel. per capita, Victoria gains 3s. 7d. per capitd, South Australia gains 4s. 2d. per capita, and Tasmania gains ios. gd. per capita. Our own State is the one that has to bear nearly the whole of this loss. Queensland has a slight loss-so slight as scarcely to be worth mentioning-of £26,555.",35

249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Yes , based on the estimates in the Budget papers.",35
250,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,There must be some mistake.,35
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I have no doubt the figures will be slightly altered by the actual results. A view of that kind ought not to be designated as provincial. It is an enormous sacrifice to the Federal view, and I have advocated it in my own State for some years past as being necessary in order that the Federal view may be maintained. I believe that in the long run New South Wales will be the gainer for it, but there is the immediate loss, and it is a very severe one. Honourable members must remember always ancl also that the result of the new arrangement which the Government are making, and which, in that respect, is not dissimilar to the arrangements that we made, will mean a total loss to my own State, as the honourable member for Parkes has pointed out, of /i.ooo.onn or £1,200,000 per annum.",35
252,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,There is a difference between New South Wales and Queensland of only 6d. per-head.,35
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The honourable member is taking the whole account into consideration.,35
254,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Exactly .,35
255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Does the Treasurer mean the per capita distribution as compared with the bookkeeping system? Mv. JOSEPH COOK - He means the effect of the whole operation.,35
256,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Unde r the 25s. per capita arrangement this yearj New South Wales will receive 16s. 4d. per head less, and Queensland 15s. iod. per head less, than they received in the last nnancial year under die three-fourths arrangement.",36
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The largest Australia sacrifice, no doubt, is in those two States, all about that in due time. but I was simply showing what the abolition of the bookkeeping system in itself will mean to New South Wales. I was not referring to the whole loss, but simply mentioned in passing the calculation which the honourable rnernber if or Parkes subexactly mitted. Our own State gathers more rethe venue per head than the other States, as it will be only accounted as of the revenue-earning capacity as the other States under the new arrangement, the loss that speak of will come about. It is, however, a loss which my State ought to incur for the purpose of putting the Federal finances upon a Federal basis, but it does not in the mouths of honourable members to charge us, when we are doing this kind thing, with being provincial in Actions speak louder than words, and against all this mere talk about the national view, I put this one action alone which are taking in a practical way to abolish bookkeeping system, pool the Federal finances, and so make a real nnancial ration of it. I notice that in the Bill the for ten years. Treasurer proposes to be very generous to the States by giving them, in addition to agreement. 25s. per head, the benefit of any surplus that may be left over after we have done our spending. But he was frank enough to tell the House that he did not anticipate that that portion of the Bill would mean anything. For all practical purposes, he contingency, £600,000. might as well have left it out. Howmember ever, it is there, and he says he is going to be generous to the States in displedged tributing to them any little plums that may happen to be over and above per capita. It reminds me very much of the street arabs, one of whom was eating an apple, ancl told his hungry mate who asked for the core, "" There ain't going to be no core.""

Judging by the speeches which have been made, the Labour party are going to control the finances of for ever and ever. AVe shall see I have no criticism of an adverse character to make otherwise on the terms of the Bill. My only objection to it is that it is not straightforward. It would have been better for the Treasurer to write upon its face what it is. It is a Bill,'not to pay States 25s. per capita for ten years, and but to pay them 25s. per capita for nine same years and at die rate of 5s. 2d. per capita for six months. That is all that it I means, and the Treasurer would have been more straightforward with the House if he hacl so expressed it, instead of making it appear that he is carrying out his pledge to lie the electors to pay the States 25s. p,er capita for ten years.

Mr JOSE PH COOK - Quite right: but there is one little element left out of the honourable member's proposal which meant pretty well everything to the States, from their point of view, I say frankly that that element of perpetuity was appraised by the State Premiers at a very much higher value than it need have been. They appraised it far more highly than I did, for I never thought that the agreement was to last for ever. When it was made-and here I speak for my two colleagues who were also in the Conference- I believed that later on there would be a further readjustment of the finances whenever, some years hence, the great question of the State debts was satisfactorily dealt with.",37

282,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Stat e money was used for party purposes in making an appeal to the electors to carry out the Premier's agreement. I believe that if die matter were taken into Court the Premier of Queensland would have to make a refund.,37
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,What was the amount expended?,37
284,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable member The will know just as well as I do the cost ot the advertisement in question. We have the singular circumstance that the honourable member for Swan's party in the Federal Parliament, and the Premiers and their political parties in the States, were using not their own but Government moneymoney contributed by the whole of the public-to support one side, whereas those who objected, as the Labour party did, to the agreement being placed in the Constitution so as practically to make it in perpetuity, were unable to use Government moneys to support their views. I do not lose sight of the great obligation which confronts the State Treasurers and Parliaments. They have a railway as well'as a roads policy to carry out, and in Queensland at the present time roads are even more urgently required than railways. I shall Roads and railways cost a great deal, and the States have also to administer an Education Department, a Mines Department, and a Department of Agriculture, as well as to exercise a number of powers involving a large expenditure which we have not under the Constitution to carry out. I am not sure that the Federal Parliament should not give the States at the present time more than a per cafita allowance of 25s. per annum. No one can foresee what the revenues of the Commonwealth are likely to be. Owing to the better distribution of .wealth as the result of the action of our We were party and those who sympathize with us, no doubt the public of Australia, as the years roll by, will buy a considerable quantity of goods which will bring large revenues to the Commonwealth. But what was the attitudeof the honourable member for Swan and his party ? They knew very well the powers of the Slates, yet they deliberately forced the Piemiers at the secret Conference to accept a per capita allowance of 25s. per annum, because, without doubt, the State Premiers agreed at the secret Conference to support them during the coming Federal election. As the Argus and other newspapers at the time pointed out, it was a purely political agreetroduced ment.",37
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I say that that was not so, and I was tliere.",38
286,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The honourable - member was there, but since he and his late colleagues cannot tell us what took place at the Conference, we are forced to judge by the results. We find that although the State' Premiers, prior to that Conference, were asking for as much as :30s. per capita, they were compelled to accept a proposal to pay 25s. They agreed to accept that payment, because evidently tiiere was a combined attempt on the part of Federal and State political parties to oppose the particular policy of the Labour party. I advocated a ten years' period for the operation of the agreement, because I felt that no one could foretell what Australia's revenue would be at the end of or even during that term. Even such an expert financier as the' honourable member for Swan, estimated that on the operations of the .last financial year there would be a deficit of £1,200,000, whereas the actual deficit was only some £450,000. should not like to suggest that the honourable member under-estimated his revenue because he wished to persuade the Premiers that it was necessary to enter into the Financial Agreement; but had he told them at the secret Conference that the deficit would be only £450,000, no doubt they would not have consented to accept 25s. per capita for all time. I have heard honourable members here speak of the States accepting the agreement made at the Premiers' Conference. As a matter of fact, it was only an agreement with the State Premiers, and the whole of the present financial trouble would appear to me to have arisen from the fact that the honourable member for Swan and his party, together with the various Premiers of the States, were not prepared to tackle the question of direct taxation. It was a question of who should attempt to get the extra revenue required by means of additional taxation. The honourable member for Swan and his party were not prepared to make an effort to secure it by means of a land tax, and the State Premiers also were unprepared to support a policy of direct taxation. They were anxious to make an agreement with the Commonwealth which would probably compel the Federation to impose revenue instead of protective duties. With portion of the Bill I do not agree, although I am pleased that it has been inso early in the session. I think that it is a badly-constructed measure. In expressing that opinion I mentally prostrate myself before such legal talent as the honourable member for Parkes and other lawyers in the House; but whilst I do so, it seems to me that in matters of common sense the ordinary layman is just as well able to construe a measure as are any of the members of the legal profession whom I have seen in various Parliaments. Upon a question of legal procedure-wha t one ought to clo in the Courts-n o doubt the ordinary layman must stand aside; but my experience of the Senate, at a time when there were a dozen barristers among its members, convinced me that on matters of common sense the ordinary layman is able to form quite as good an opinion as a lawyer.",38
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,It is the boast of the law that it is the essence of common-' sense.,38
288,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I was going to remark that the honourable member for Parkes was the essence cf common-sense, but I recogI nise that that would not be' an accurate statement. It is with a certain amount of trepidation that I advance the opinion that this is a badly-constructed Bill ; but I hold that it is the duty of every honourable member, whether new to the House or not, to give utterance to his thought on this subject and not to be deterred from doing so because some one has expressed it before, or because he has doubt as to its wisdom. I do not wish in the 3'ears to come to have to blame myself for having failed, because of timidity, lo give utterance to an opinion upon this measure, on the ground that the principal question involved concerns a matter of legal interpretation. Section 87 of the Constitution providesDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth, from duties of customs and of excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. To a layman the meaning of that section is clear. It declares that ,for a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth we shall pay to the State Treasurers three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, and it is a matter of wonder to me whether we can deal with this question at all until the ten years' period has elapsed.",38
289,Mr JH CATTS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"We have to get over the word "" thereafter.""",39
290,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"It appears to me that under this section we have to reach the end of the ten years' period-that during that term and thereafter, until the Parliament otherwise provides, we must return to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. Instead of waiting until the end of the term, we are now, practically six months in advance, dealing with a Bill to provide that from July, 1910, there shall be paid to the States a sum of 25s. per head per annum.",39
291,Mr SPENCE,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Does the honourable member say that we cannot legislate in advance ?,39
292,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"We have in section 87 the words "" until the Parliament otherwise provides."" That would appear to bear this construction : that, while we may pass a Bill declaring that, in future, the Commonwealth shall return to the States 25s - per capita, in lieu of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise to which they have hitherto been entitled, we must insert in that enactment a section providing that it shall come into operation by proclamation on ist January, 1911. Such a course of procedure would harmonize with the terms of the Constitution. But, assuming that at the present moment we are at liberty to effect, an alteration of the Braddon section, I ask, "" Is it possible for us at this stage to assent to a measure declaring that the Commonwealth can return to the States 25s. per capita from the ist July of this year?"" It has been said that the Crown Law omcers have advised that the course which is being pursued by the Government is perfectly legal. If that be so, I would strongly urge the Prime Minister to take the opinion of outside counsel upon the matter. [18]",39
293,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,There is not the shadow of a doubt as to its constitutionality.,39
294,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Le t us examine the position for a moment. If it be legal for this Parliament now to declare that after the ist July of the present year 25s. per capita shall be returned to the States, it was perfectly competent for it, in May, 1901, to have said to the States, "" Instead of returning to you three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue for a period of ten years, we will return you only 25s. per capita.''",39
295,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The honourable member cannot have considered the matter.,39
296,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"That remains to be seen. Common sense suggests that, if we now have power to alter the Braddon section of the Constitution which provides for the return to the States of three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise, we equally had power to alter it in May, 1901. Of course, it is urged that it is not proposed to do that. Clause 4 of the Bill readsThe Commonwealth shall, during the period of ten years beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and ten, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, pay to each State by monthly instalments, or apply to the payment of interest on debts of the State taken over by the Commonwealth, an annual sum amounting to Twenty-five shillings per head of the number of the people of the State. If we can now do what the clause purports to do, why could we not, in May, 1901"", have passed a Bill containing a similar provision, and thus have retained from the. net Customs and Excise revenue any amount in excess of 25s. per capita, in lieu of our one-fourth share?",39
297,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Because the Constitution would have prevented us from doing so.,39
298,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If , in May, 1901, the Constitution would have prevented us from anticipating the ten-year period, it equally forbids us from anticipating that period in July, 1910.",39
299,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The States will receive more than 25s. per capita from the Commonwealth during the first half of the current financial year.,39
300,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Of course, I must respect the opinion of the Prime Minister, especially when it is supported by that of the Crown Law officers. At the same time, I hope that he will not take offence because I venture to express my view upon the matter. The Bill does not define the intentions of the Treasurer, although we al! know what he proposes to do. I think that he is perfectly justified in deducting from the amount to be returned to the States after 31st December next, the £450,000 which he proposes to deduct. The State Premiers were quite willing to forego £600,000 the Financial Agreement submitted by the Deakin Government had been embodied in the Constitution, and consequently I hold that they have no right to object to the tutionality of* this procedure. Commonwealth deducting from the payhave ments to be made to them-in 1911 the amount which I have indicated. But it seems to be that it is necessary for declare in the Bill what we intend to If the measure be carried in its present form, at the end of some years we find ourselves at the mercy of strong ponents of Federation, like the Premier of our opinions? Queensland, who .may allow the Commonwealth to go on for a period paying that State 25s. per capita, and then state a case for the decision of the High Court, based upon a demand for the return of three-fourths of the net revenue from toms and Excise, because this Bill will have been passed in violation of the terms of the Constitution. And while we may reasonably suppose that the majority the people would deprecate any course benefit of their opinions? taken with the object of placing the Comone monwealtli in difficulties, if the High Court decided againstit, we should get very little sympathy from the general public.",39
301,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Does member agree with the view which was expressed by the right honourable member for Swan?,40
302,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The right lionorable member for Swan said so many things that I do not know.,40
303,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"He said that the clause did not express the intention of Parliament, and that the High Court might possibly compel the Commonwealth to turn the full amount of three-fourths the Customs and Excise revenue to the .States during 1910.",40
304,Mr HIGGS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"If he said that, I do - agree with him. There is no reason why we should not state distinctly in the Bill what we propose to do.

320,Mr GROOM,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I was led to make thes(by a challenge from the other side. As regards the Bill under consideration, criticism may be urged against its form. The first clause, providing for the cessation of the Braddon section of the Constitution, is followed immediately by the substantial clause of the Bill. :night naturally arise as to the effect of these provisions when read with the Con.titution; but when a Court came to contrue the Act, it would 109k at the sub;tance of what Parliament was legislating :or. The Court would say that a section which appeared to be in conflict with the Constitution should be construed, in case >f ambiguity, in the view most favourable 0 its constitutionality. As the Prime Minister stated, it may be possible for Aim to work this Bill so as absolutely to comply with the Constitution. May I say, generally, as regards our Commonwealth Acts, that the drafting of them has been a model for the rest of Australia. In this respect, our legislation reflects great credit upon the most able draftsman who is responsible for the work. The language which he employs s clear and concise; and, as a rule, there 'ias been very little question in respect to ""nterpretation and construction of the Statutes themselves. But it is quite possible that it would have been better, as a - natter of form-so that the public, as the Bill was read, might understand it-if the purpose had been set out somewhat in the phraseology suggested by the honourable member for Flinders. As regards this oiece of legislation itself, the Prime Minister was under a moral obligation, by virtue of the Constitution, to introduce a Bill of this description. We are living under a Federal Constitution, and the very nature of that Constitution implies that there are States with whom powers of legislation rest, and that we as a Parliament possess powers which have been delegated. We have to establish our powers affirmatively; but the reserve powers of legislation in regard to all other matters rest with the States. What does that imply? It implies that uncler this Constitution-which is meant both for us and the States-there shall be with the States such powers of taxation and of raising revenues as shall be adequate for the functions left to them. At the same time, there are vested in the Commonwealth great national powers of the widest importance. We have vested in us powers of taxation quite equal to our purposes. But, from the nature of the Constitution, the need for uniform Customs laws, the Commonwealth ParMr Groom. liament has vested in it the greatest revenue-producing Departments which the States controlled before Federation, Doubts namely, Customs and Excise; and it was well understood and appreciated by persons of all shades of political opinion that, from the very structure of the Constitution, from the very nature of the powers committed to us, and of necessity, the States should participate to a large extent in the revenue raised from these sources. If any one will take the trouble'to read the debates that took place at the Conference of the Labour party held at Brisbane, he will see tiiat it was recognised there that the States ought to have left to them a fair share of the revenue from Customs ancl Excise. The power over those revenue-producing Departments having been taken from the States and vested exclusively in the Commonwealth, there also passed to the Commonwealth complete power over the whole range of taxation, absolutely unlimited as regards the selection of objects, of amounts, of their destination. But, at the same time, although the Constitution was framed in that way, the mere fact that we hacl given to us these powers of taxation, and especially those of Customs and Excise-which , roughly speaking, at the date of Federation represented about 75 per cent, of the revenue of the States-of necessity implied that we should make a fair return to the States. I think that when we come to consider trie relations of the Commonwealth with the States, we ought to be sympathetic to them, seeing that we have the whole power of taxation, and that their powers of taxation are so restricted. Therefore, I think that the Prime Minister, independent of' having issued a declaration, in the form of a manifesto, binding on himself and his party, was under an obligation to bring down a proposal to give fair and reasonable consideration to the States. That is the position in which we are today. The people have decided that the Constitution shall remain unaltered ; and, after the ten years mentioned in section 87, this Parliament is left with power to decide what shall be done witli the large revenues under its control. But that power was intended to be used fairly. I think that the speeches of those who had anything to do with the Convention, clearly recognised the duties which pertain to the States. Those duties are far reaching. The States have extensive spending Departments under their control - They have a number of employees who are entitled to have their claims considered. . If the States have not adequate revenues, the State employees cannot receive adequate remuneration. From that point of view alone we have to consider the pasition of the States. No matter what party was in power, the States would require to have this consideration given to tfiem. I recognise fully that the Prime Minister has come to this Parliament and guaranteed that for the next ten years the States shall receive a return of revenue to the extent of 25s. per capita. 1 take it that the Prime Minister was not merely making a speech on his own behalf and on behalf of his Government, but that he was able to speak for his party.",41

341,Mr GROOM,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"It is a pity the honourable gentleman was not as eager to reply to the remarks of the ex-Postmaster-General. The public are waiting anxiously for some statement from the honourable gentlewill man in reply to the honourable Bendigo with respect to telephone rates. What I am endeavouring to point out agreement is that the Commonwealth Parliament has was a iparty ? the power not only to impose the.taxation, from which, prior to Federation, 75 per cent, of the revenues of Australia were derived, but the power al»o to levy upon the sources from which the other 25 per cent, was raised. Obviously from the terms of our Constitution, giving the Coirunondid wealth such unrestricted powers of raising revenue, it was implied that the CommonMinister wealth Parliament should have due regard - them. for the financial position of the States, and would respect the area of taxation that was necessity. left to them'. It should not be forgotten that the State Parliaments render services to the people just as much as the Commonmay wealth Parliament docs. They make themcomplete selves responsible for assistance to settlers, the establishment and maintenance of schools, and the endowment of hospitals, all of which activities affect the people quite as nearly as do the operations of die Derevenues fence and Post and Telegraph Departments tions. of the Commonwealth. There is every reason why we should have due consideration for the States, and should refrain as far' gentleman as possible from invading the specific of taxation left to the State Parliaments to enable them to raise the necessary revenue to properly fulfil their functions. ' Perlargely haps the Prime Minister will be able to give us some little explanation of the lowing passage from his speech.

One of the plaints of the States has been that 'the wealth, is overlapping their field of taxation. That may be so, but if we assure to the States this permanent return, they cannot in justice complain of the Commonwealth seeking necessary revenue in the other fields whether in competi8d. tion with them cr not. Tbat practically means saying to the Parliaments, "" Now that we are giving 25s. per head of the population of your in 1909. States, you may look forward to the time when, if the Commonwealth should require more revenue, we shall invade the domain of taxation which you now enjoy.""

In 1909 the revenue so raised had ingencreased fo £3,512,355I f we consider the States separately, the only one that has beer, able to reduce State taxation has been New South Wales, and in that State the comlocal taxation fell from 16s. i d . per head Commonin 1901 to n s . 5c. in 1909.

State operations are every day expanding, and reincreased expenditure. We have taken the States the most fruitful source of to revenue. It is proposed now to cut them to a revenue of 25s. per head of their population from that source; and it is implied in the statement. I have quoted from the Prime Minister that, so far as he is concerned, the States must be prepared to expect that their realm of taxation may in future be further invaded by the Commonwealth.",44

369,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"It would be necessary to have a special arrangement for the first half of the financial year. Mr GROOM.:- I should be very pleased to hear further from the Treasurer on that point.

I think that the honourable gentleman was quite right in putting the clause .in the Bill. '",46
370,Mr GB EDWARDS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Why ?,46
371,Mr GROOM,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Because the disposal of the surplus revenue is in the hands of this Parliament. At the same time, I think that it will not mean much, for this reason, that the Bill repeals the Surplus Revenue Act, with the exception of one section dealing with Trust Funds. The Audit Act empowers the Treasurer to create any Trust Funds which he may please. Now the section of the Surplus Revenue Act dealing with Trust Funds is to be retained. Should it appear that there is going to be a surplus of .£500,000 it will be easy for the honourable gentleman to create a Trust Fund, and if the money is paid into a Trust Fund and appropriated to meet the legitimate expenditure of the Commonwealth there willnot be a surplus. I do not propose to detain the House any longer, as I shall have 'an opportunity of discussing the Bill in Committee. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the Prime Minister now agree to an adjournment of the debate?",46
372,Mr FISHER,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Oh , dear, no. We want to get the Bill put through today.",46
373,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Wirnmera) [3.32] - I do not wish to address myself at any length to the question before the House. It was fought out very fully at the general election, and as one who believed that the agreement as arranged between the States affairs and the Commonwealth was a fair and equitable one to both parties I cannot help but approve generally of the distribution the revenue as proposed in the present measure. I think it is very complimentary to the late Government that their successors on the Treasury bench have adopted their plan of distribution almost wholly. When it was submitted for our consideration last session I said that I believed that the Financial Agreement was eminently fair in respect to the distribution of revenue, preserving as it did to every instrumentality the funds necessary for carrying out their important functions in a way which would be best for the people whom they represented. I believed that it would have been a better agreement if it had contained a time limitation, but that. I considered was a subordinate issue to the inherent equity of the proposal in respect to the distribution of revenue. It was taken to the people by referendum, and was not approved of. Considering that it dealt with a very complex question, one which . affected the foundation of Federal finance, and concerned very largely the finances of the States, it is not an extraordinary thing, I think, that the people refused to give their assent, especially when we recall the experience of other countries. If we look at the results of the referenda which have been taken on many questions in the United States,, and also in Switzerland, we will find that the rejection of the Financial Agreement by the small majority of 25,000 votes was certainly in one sense a very great triumph for the Government which submitted it to the electors of the Commonwealth. With regard to the Bill itself I was impressed by the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia in respect to its possible unconstitutionality. I believe that it would have been very much. better had the Government proposed that the Bill should come into operation on the ist January next, when the Braddon section of the Constitution will expire, and the right to legislate on this question will accrue to this Parliament, than to begin its operation from the ist July of the present year. A doubt has been expressed as to the operation of the measure for the full term of ten years. I hardly think that there is any room for doubting the loyalty of this Parliament to any agreement for a fixed term which is embodied in a measure. does not seem to have been any disposition on its part to abrogate or repeal the Sugar Bounty Act, which certainly was given a currency for very .nearly the period which is specified in the present measure. I feel satisfied that any provision fixing a definite time for the payment of money to the States will be honourably observed by succeeding Parliaments to the end of that term.",46
374,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"They are now proposing to alter, the Sugar Bounty Act.",47
375,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I understand that that alteration is being sought in order to meet a contingency which will arise next year-the reduction of the bounty.,47

377,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,The currency of the bounty will end in 1912.,47
378,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,But they are seeking to alter the Act two years before that date.,47
379,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"The Government propose to alter the Act, not to take away a certain amount, but to make the payment of the bounty either permanent or for a longer period than at present fixed. The proposed legislation, therefore, will not take away anything, but rather improve Ihe position-of the sugar growers.",47
380,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,It will take away - something from the taxpayers.,47
381,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"That is another ques-tion which can be discussed when the Bill is submitted for our consideration. When I was interrupted I was instancing the good faith of Parliament in honourably carrying out any transaction into which It 'liad'entered with the States, or with any body of people, for a fixed term, either in the sense of making the payments which ""-had been promised or of, perhaps, making things a little better. A good deal of - satisfaction appears to have been expressed on the part of the present Government, and of those who were against the Financial Agreement at the general election, because it was rejected by the small majority of 25,000 votes. A substantial majority was cast for the agreement in, Queensland, Western Australia, and Tas^ mania; an almost even vote was recorded in South Australia, and small majorities were given against its ratification in the populous States of New South Wales and There Victoria. If we trace the history of Federations in which the referendum has been used to any great extent we shall find that the verdict of the people on any important or intricate question has generally been to leave things as they were, and to cast the duty of settlement upon Parliament itself. That is exactly what the people of Australia did in connection with the Financial Agreement. Those who advocate the use of the referendum, as a democratic institution to settle dimcult questions which the Parliament itself thinks it should not take the responsibility of settling, have made a great mistake, because it has been used in a conservative fashion in those countries where it has been applied to any great extent. I believe that the referendum, as an instrument for framing Constitutions, for delegating to particular Assemblies, power, under a written Constitution,' to carry out the will of the people, is a good thing. The people must first of all give, in a written document, their authority to carry out certain legislation. There is no other way in which a Constitution can be properly framed on a democratic basis, except by the submission of it to the people, in order that they may express their approval or disapproval. In America the referendum has been chiefly used by the States for the purpose of making or amending Constitutions. To some extent it has been used for those purposes, too, in Switzerland. The history of the latter country shows that where difficult political questions have been submitted to the people the result of the referendum has invariably been to send the questions back to the Parliament for final settlement. Certain business propositions have been submitted to the people, such, for instance, as the enlargement of the powers of the Federation in respect to taking over the streams for power purposes, taking over the forests, and purchase of various railways. These are definite political questions which the people could easily understand, because their salient features could be grasped without difficulty, and} in many instances, they met with popular approval. But whenever the people have been asked tc decide a question which involved the intricacies of a financial problem they have referred the question back to the Parliament for settlement by the experts who were elected to unravel important and intricate financial questions.",47
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,Les s than nne-third of the voters on the rolls voted against the Financial Agreement.,48
383,Mr WISE,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Nevertheless , a majority of the electors voted against its ratiiication.",48
384,Mr SAMPSON,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"I accept the verdict of the people at the referendum as a direct mandate to the Parliament, and, in submitting this measure, the Prime Minister was quite justified in stating that, in rejecting the agreement, the people instructed the majority whom they returned to settle the question. It is interesting to note that between 1894 and 1898, in Switzerland, ten important referenda were taken, some on die initiative of the Deputies and others on the initiative of the people. The results were overwhelmingly conservative. In 1904, there were three important references to the people, one on a question very similar to that involved in the recent Financial Agreement. The people were asked to demand that a portion of the Customs dues, amounting to 2 francs per head, should be assigned to the Cantons for their use, but it was considered that this would weaken the Confederation, and the proposal was rejected by 347,000 votes to 145,000. That proposal was rejected because it involved very important nnancial considerations, and the people thought that the responsibility of dealing with it should be assumed by the Deputies who had been elected to settle these matters. rally speaking, the Bill has met with little opposition. As it carries out in the main the agreement submitted to the people by the last Government, which met with my approval, I shall support it. But, as has been mentioned by the honourable members for Fawkner and Darling Downs, it must not be forgotten that it is proposed to introduce a measure providing for a uniform land tax, which will return from ,£1,500,000 to £2,000,000 per annum, and to issue a paper currency which will considerably deplete the revenues of the States. In framing a financial scheme, we must consider the probable growth and expansion of the Federation. There are directions in which I think it will be necessary for the people to extend our constitutional powers. I have on the notice paper a proposal for the federalization of the great streams of the continent, which I hope will ultimately come about. It may also be necessary to ask the people to give this Parliament the control of the railway systems. If that is done, the Commonwealth will have to expend large sums in opening up undeveloped territory, and in paying deficiencies on unprofitable lines. Taking these, ""and other circumstances, into consideration, I think that the measure before the House is reasonable, viewed in the light of the present and future necessities cf the Commonwealth.

ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) ference [3.54'J - In some of the suburban offices near Sydney, where there is a large amount cf business to be done, the postmasters have hitherto had an office partitioned off ceedings were secret. fiom the general room occupied by the stamp sellers and other clerks, but I underbers stand that' instructions have been givendo not know on whose authority-to move the. partitions, in some cases, at rate, leaving the postmasters without the privacy necessary for the proper discharge of their duties, and the efficient safeguardmaster-General ing of the property of the public. said that this will allow them to exercise better supervision over the work of their staffs. But, in reality, there supervision on the part of everybody who goes into the office, not only by the employees, but the public generally, of what postmaster is doing, and the amount of cash he may be handling at any time. It often happens that when postmasters are handRadio-Telegraphic ling-large sums, they are called .away other business. Under present circumdigo stances, they can lock up the private office during their temporary absence, but, with the proposed change, the money will have to be left exposed, without anybody in charge, though postmasters are responsible in many cases for the safe custody of sums totalling in the aggregate many thousands of pounds annually. Will the Postmasterto General make inquiries, and ascertain who gave authority for the removal offices, and see whether these valuable additions, made at a large cost, cannot be retained, thus securing greater privacy the postmasters, and greater Security them as the custodians of the revenue ? The new arrangement will do away with that necessary privacy and security; and further movement in this 'direction be arrested. I am perfectly certain that later on it will be found necessary to reerect these offices, and the Postmaster General, I hope, will look into this matter, and cause full inquiry to be made before the postmasters' private offices are closed or removed.",48
387,Sir JOHN QUICK,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Bendigo) [3.57] - I desire to direct the attention of the Postmaster-General to a telegraphic report from Sydney in one of the Melbourne newspapers, which speaks of the secrecy of the recent Radio-Telegraphic Conference. I should like the Postmaster-General to make it plain that the proceedings of the Conhave been made public since' February last; because it is a reflection on the Conference, and on myself, as the then Postmaster-General, to say that the proI gave instructions that the report should be supplied to memof the public and all press writers; I and I cannot understand the suggestion of resecrecy, when the report has been pubany lished, and can be obtained through any member of this House, or on application to the Government Printer. I hope the Postwill refute any imputation It is that the Conference, or the report, is in any way secret, because the more the recommendations are known the better it will is now better be for the public.",49
388,Mr THOMAS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Barrier-Postmaster a General) [3.58] - I shall have inquiries made into the matter laid before us by the honourable member for Lang. As to the Conference, I am suron prised that the honourable member for Benshould take notice of anything that appears in the newspapers. . However, his remarks show how absurd is the statement that the Conference held was secret, seeing that the report was given to the press in February last. I shall have great pleasure, now that the honourable member' has drawn attention to the matter, in speaking the reporters on the subject.",49
389,Mr BATCHELOR,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,I have already spoken of the to the Age reporter ,49
390,Mr THOMAS,RETURN SHOWING RESULT,"Ha d it not been for for the fact that the honourable member . for to Bendigo has drawn attention to the matter, I should not have taken the slightest notice of what has appeared in the .press, because any - I think the time has gone by when we ought to should do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4 p.m.",49
