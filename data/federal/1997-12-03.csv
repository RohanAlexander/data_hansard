1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the government's 1997-98 budget and to a number of non-budget measures. One of the measures announced in the 1997-98 budget provided for the reform of the means test treatment of income streams under the Social Security Act 1991. The reforms will give greater incentives and provide greater choices for retired people investing in longer term income streams. These amendments complement other government policy initiatives aimed at encouraging the use of superannuation and other investments to provide income in retirement. The reforms will provide a more generous means test of long-term pensions and annuities meeting specified criteria. In addition, they will ensure that very wealthy people will no longer be able to use loopholes to access social security payments through the use of short fixed term financial investments. There will be no general savings provision, as this would generally benefit those utilising loopholes. However, people who have products purchased before the commencement of the reforms can request a ministerial exemption from the new regime where significant financial disadvantage may result. This government has always ensured that the community is widely consulted when measures are being developed. Consistent with this approach, and following on from the extensive consultation with industry and community groups in the policy development process, an exposure draft of the income streams measure was circulated to the financial industry and other interested parties for comment. Responses to the exposure draft have generally been quite favourable. This bill also includes measures that will help carers build on the extra assistance offered in last year's budget, demonstrating the government's determination to offer a better deal to those often unsung Australians looking after friends and relatives. The government recognises the stresses that a caring role can place on carers. In recognition of these stresses, this bill provides for an increase in the number of days a year that a carer can have a break from caring and still remain eligible for the carer payment. While a carer may currently have a break for 52 calendar days per year, this measure will provide that the carer may take a break for 63 days. In addition, qualification for carer payment will be extended to those looking after a profoundly disabled child who is aged under 16. The government has always made it clear it believes the vast majority of social security recipients are genuinely in need of assistance. This is why it is determined to protect the integrity of the social security system so that the limited welfare dollar goes only to those who need it most. To this end, reforms in this bill will ensure a better targeting of the welfare dollar by preventing high income seasonal, intermittent or contract workers and their partners from being able to go straight on to a social security benefit during the offseason or between contracts. It will also exclude higher paid casual or contract workers and their partners who have their leave entitlements cashed out in their salary payments from receiving social security benefit over short lay-offs like Christmas shutdowns. There will be an exemption in cases of severe financial hardship. This bill also includes measures that aim to make the social security system easier for people to access and understand. Simplification has been a key priority of this government and we are committed to further reducing complexity in the future. In line with such an approach, this bill introduces a fairer more consistent income and assets test treatment of lump sum amounts for pensions and allowances. This is done by aligning the allowance means test arrangements for lump sums with the pensions means test. Finally, this bill includes a number of amendments that are consequential on various other measures. These include amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to take account of the change of name of family payment to family allowance. In addition, the bill includes minor amendments to the debt recovery provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 to take account of the introduction in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 of the new 'exceptional circumstances relief payment' and the 'restart income support'. Lastly, the bill makes a number of minor amendments consequential on the establishment of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr TRUSS,ENERGY LEGISLATION,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (9.36 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. There are a number of statutory marketing authorities, research and development corporations and other authorities within the primary industries and energy portfolio. This bill amend relevant acts to remove the legislative requirement for the portfolio minister to approve the terms and conditions of employment, including remuneration, of the principal employee, placing the responsibility for this process entirely with the individual organisations. Amendments to the Agricultural and Vetand erinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will provide a wider scope from which applicants with experience in occupational health and safety can be considered for appointment as a director of the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals-NRA. It is also proposed to add an additional director of the NRA with experience in the development or administration of Commonwealth government policy. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 specifies that the Australian Horticultural Corporation Selection Committee consists of a chairperson and seven other members. The proposed amendments will reduce the number of 'other members' on the corporation from seven to three, four or five. The number of members required for a quorum will be reduced from five to a majority of the members of the selection committee. Other amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 will repeal the corporation's export trading powers. The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 will correct a drafting error by inserting regulation making powers into the sections detailing the meaning of false or misleading description and presentation of wine. Currently, the regulations refer to an inappropriate section of the act and could be subject to challenge. The amendments will permit the regulations to be soundly based in the act, after which the regulations will be amended to refer to the correct head of power. The bill will repeal clauses in the Dairy Produce Act 1986 which exclude people aged 65 and over from holding membership on the board of the Australian Dairy Corporation. As a part of the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package, the government announced that it would not seek repayment of loans will incurred under the farm household support scheme. The decision to terminate the PHS scheme was announced in the 1996-97 budget. The PHS scheme provided income support to farmers to meet day-today living expenses who were unable to borrow commercial finance. It was paid as a loan that could be converted to a grant under certain circumstances specified in the FRS Act. Over the life of the FRS scheme-which commenced in March 1993-there were approximately 700 FRS recipients. Of these, approximately 115 recipients had all their FRS payments converted to a grant as a result of meeting the legislative requirements. Approximately $5 million in FRS debt is owed to the Commonwealth. Two former FRS recipients have repaid their FRS loans and these people will be reimbursed. The annulment of FRS debts is by legislative amendment, rather than by write-off or waiver, to ensure this change applies in .all cases without exception. Because FRS was initially paid as a loan, it was not considered to be income for taxation purposes. When other income support payments are made-for instance, the drought relief payment-the Australian Taxation Office applies a rebate so there is zero income tax payable on their income support. Consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Acts 1936 and 1997 will ensure that FRS payments, whenever converted to grants, will not be considered as taxable income, and the beneficiary rebate will be applied to the' small numbers of people continuing on FRS payments-no longer as loans---consistent with the treatment of other income support payments. The bill will amend the descriptions of the adjacent areas defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 in respect of Western Australia and the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands respectively to make the northern boundaries consistent with the seabed boundaries agreed in the Treaty between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia Establishing an Exclusive Economic Zone Boundary and Certain Seabed Boundaries, which was signed on 14 March 1997. The amendments are necessary to enable ratification of the treaty. With regard to the amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the government proposes to reduce Commonwealth funding to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation in the 1997-98 financial year by $3.612 million. Of the money saved, $1.5 million is to go to the adjustment program for the South-East Fishery and the balance towards helping to pull back the budget deficit. The purpose of the amendment under the Primary Industry Councils Act 1991 is to formally abolish the Australian Pig Industry Council.

4,Mr TRUSS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Wide Bay-Minister for. Customs and Consumer Affairs) (9.42 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 has three main purposes: firstly, to amend the Customs Act 1901 to clarify that the Customs Act does not extend to the Australian external territories; secondly, to amend the Customs Amendment Act (No.1) 1997 to defer by six months the commencement of the reduced entry threshold for goods imported by the post; and, thirdly,' to amend the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to correct an anomaly in the exercise of Customs' powers of examination of mail arriving into Australia from theextemal territories. 1. Amendments to the Customs Act The present definition of Australia in the Customs Act provides that Australia does not include the territory of Christmas Island or the territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The definition of Australia in section 17 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that Australia excludes all external territories except Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The combined effect of these two definitions is that, for the purposes of the Customs Act, Australia does not include any of the external territories. The purpose of the new definition of Australia in section 4 of the Customs Act is to state this position with greater clarity than at present. This definition will provide that Australia does not include the external territories. The Ashmore and Cartier Islands are a group of islands and reefs 500 nautical miles west of Darwin and 80 nautical miles south of Timor. They are uninhabited islands but are an external territory of Australia administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Development. In recent times there has been an increase in the number of landings by illegal immigrants on Ashmore and Cartier Islands. Previously, there were very limited legislative powers to deal with these landings under customs, immigration and quarantine regimes. Amendments were recently made to the Customs Act, the Migration Act 1958 and the Quarantine Act 1908 by the Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Act 1997 to enable certain powers under these regimes to be extended to these islands. The Customs Act presently states that, subject to subsection 6(2), the Customs Act does not extend to the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands. Subsection 6(2) provides that regulations can be made to extend the whole or a part of the Customs Act to these islands. The present wording of subsection 6(1), however, does not make it clear that the Customs Act also does not extend to all the other external territories. It is therefore proterritories posed to amend subsection 6(1) to state that the Customs Act does not extend to the external territories. In combination with the new definition of Australia, these two amendments will make it clear that the Customs Act does not apply in, or in relation to, the external territories. 2. Amendments to the Customs Amendment Act. ' The Customs Amendment Act (No.1) 1997 was one of three acts which introduced the cost recovery regime for the provision of certain import related services. Under the regime, an amendment was made to the Customs Act to reduce the value limit of goods imported through the post which require an import entry and which therefore attract an import entry processing charge. This value was reduced from $1,000 to $250, and this amendment is due to commence on 1 April 1998. It is proposed to amend this commencement date to 1 October 1998. A significant number of representations have been received by government concerning the impact that the decrease in the threshold will have on small to medium business. In response to this, the Australian Customs Service is examining options to simplify the entry procedures for the goods imported by post which will become subject to the entry requirements. The deferral of the commencement date by six months will allow this exercise to continue and be implemented before the threshold is changed. 3. Amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Under the Customs Act, officers of Customs have the right to examine goods imported into Australia by post. However, a restriction is placed upon Customs' power to examine mail by section 90S of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989-the Postal Corporation Act. The effect of section 90S is that certain conditions must be satisfied before Customs can examine an article of mail which is in the post between Australia and a place outside Australia. A difficulty has arisen in the application of this provision to mail from the external due to the definition of Australia in the Postal Corporation Act. Under the Postal Corporation Act, 'Australia' includes the external territories except Norfolk Island. Under the Customs Act, 'Australia' does not include the external territories. The effect of this difference in the definition of Australia is that mail that is in the course of the post between any external territory and Australia cannot be examined by Customs. Section 90S does not apply to this mail because the external territories are not a place outside Australia under the Postal Corporation Act. It is proposed to introduce the new subsection 90S(lA) into the Postal Corporation Act which states that in section 90S Australia does not include the external territories. This will be the same as the definition of Australia in the Customs Act and will enable Customs to examine postal articles from any external territory where the conditions in section 90S have been satisfied. 4. Minor Amendments This bill will also make several minor technical amendments to the Customs Act and the Excise Act 1901. These are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 December, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Martin moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that the Government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled 'Finding a balance: Towards fair trading in Australia' does not reflect or recommendations of the Committee; (2) recommends the Bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the Committee; (3) considers the Government's response is inadequate and its rhetoric does not match either its election commitments or the committee's findings; and (4) calls on the Government members of the Committee, namely the honourable Members for Bendigo, MCEwen, Paterson, Cowan, Mallee, Petrie, Canning, Aston and Lowe to support the Opposition's amendments which reflect the recommendations in the Committee's report"".",15
5,Mr LIEBERMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I have been looking forward to speaking on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 for some time. It is the most significant piece of legislation that this parliament has seen since the federal election in 1996. With a background of small business-my father, mother and I have been in small business-I have had the pleasure of being categorised as a small business person. I hope that my sons, who are also involved in business, will continue to pursue that activity. In fact, one of my sons is in America conducting his own small business, which is rapidly growing into a middle size business and will one day be a large business. So it is with some pride that I pay tribute to the people who are involved in small business. They are special people in Australia. They have lots of guts and determination and have helped build this country. I remind members that there are 786,000 small businesses in Australia, according to the last official survey. In fact, 97 per cent of all businesses in Australia are small businesses. Small businesses employ nearly 50 per cent of the total non-agricultural private sector work force. They are at the forefront in employment, creating 65 per cent of new jobs in 1995-96, and are making a very solid contribution to the growth of manufacturing and services exports. Recently I had the pleasure of being briefed on Austrade. It was pleasing to note that most of their new activity-if I remember correctly, 70 per cent of their new activity-is for small and medium size business enterprises seeking the intent export trade for Australia. The legislation reflects the recommendations of our good colleague and friend, the committee chair, the member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid. He led the all-party House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which brought in very significant recommendations to give a new deal to small business. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, is to be commended for acting so promptly and announcing the government's response, which by and large reflects the spirit and recommendations of the Reid committee, but with some necessary adaptions which I think complement the recommendations. It is well known that the government's announcement, which is called New deal: fair deal-giving small business a fair go, has been widely acclaimed across the whole spectrum of Australia's business activity, particularly small business. Despite the progress being made in this legislation by this reformist government in tackling issues that small business has wanted tackled for many years, it is very frustrating for small business in Australia to see obstacles being put in the path of a reformist government like ours. I want to refer to the Wik debate, which I think has some relevance. I have just said that small business is making a major contribution to Australia's growth, particularly to employment growth. Yet we are seeing unfolding in the Senate a series of moves by Independents, the ALP, the Greens and the Democrats that will, undoubtedly, no matter how you view the debate, have a prejudicial and negative effect on business investment, business confidence and decision making in Australia. I would like to refer briefly to a comment by Robert Gottliebsen, the Editor of BRW. In his column of 1 December 1997 headed 'Nub of the Wik debate' he states: In all the debate over Wik, the nub of the problem is rarely stated. If Aboriginal communities have effective right of veto over the creation of major areas of wealth in Australia, almost certainly much less wealth will be created. Already, miners have switched some of their exploration activity overseas. If less wealth is created, there will be less available for social services, pensions and the other benefits that Australians expect from their Government. To those not directly involved, it would appear that there should be plenty of scope to satisfy the aspirations of Aborigines who want contact with the land without giving them power of veto over wealth creation. Unfortunately, a lot of other games are being played. Whichever side of politics you are on, you have to take notice of comments like that. Those comments are being offered by people who observe Australia and who have an intimate knowledge of what makes commercial activity, what generates confidence and what does not and what attracts investment and what does not. Throughout the whole of this nation that sort of attitude, that sort of reflection is coming through. How on earth can the opposition ask small business to continue to carry the brunt and the responsibility of expanding this economy, of tackling the investment opportunities that we know we all have and, above all, of creating new jobs, especially for our young people? How on earth can you expect small business people to do that when they are constantly being confronted by the ALP, the Greens, the Democrats and others putting forward notions and views on certain important issues, such as the Wik debate, that have a direct deleterious effect on investment and confidence? I think it is time that the Australian people took to task those members of parliament who do not take the responsibility and trouble to fully appreciate and understand the implications of the lO-point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and who use popUlist, emotional arguments and ignore the core. This legislation, to which I have the privilege of contributing something today, provides an opportunity to remind members of parliament just what it is all about. You have to take responsibility for your words and actions when you are a member of parliament, particularly at a time when Australia is coming out of the worse recession it has had for years-caused by the previous 13 years of Labor government. I want to briefly mention some wonderful things that have been happening under the money coalition government that have contributedas well as this legislation-to increased potential investment for small business in Australia. We all know that, when the new government was elected, it inherited a deficit of some $10 billion and record government debt which had risen at frightening levels. of those activities under 13 years of Labor had generated increased interest rates and higher inflation and had destroyed almost totally business confidence and willingness to make new investment and create new jobs. We remember, unfortunately, the very high interest rates paid on overdrafts by small businesses. I felt that pain in my own small business when I struggled to pay wages and keep up with double digit interest rates. It brought many businesses undone. I would like to place on record the comments of the Australian Bankers Association made on 27 November 1997, welcoming the recent Reserve Bank figures which confirm reduced margins on small business loans. Most small businesses operate on borrowed capital"" as well as their own hard won capital and equity. Without lowered interest rates for small business, you do not get the atmospherics that will attract new investment, confidence andagain, I emphasise-new jobs, especially for our young Australians. The Australian Bankers Association pointed out that figures released in the November issue of the Reserve Bank Bulletin show that small business is now receiving the benefits of intense competition between banks. That has been contributed to by this coalition government, this reformist government. The Australian Bankers Association said that the Reserve Bank has now clearly confirmed that there is a trend in the marketplace which is yielding better deals for small business. There has been a drop of 3.1 percentage points in the average interest received by banks for variable rate small business loans since rnid-1996. During that time the cash rate has come down only 2.5 percentage points. The indicator rate on new fixed rate loans has also come down 2.9 per cent, and the figure for residential secured overdrafts has dropped an impressive 4.7 per cent, which is almost double the fall in the cash rate. The Australian Bankers Association went on to say that in practical terms the small business with a loan of $100,000 would have benefited from a drop in annual interest rates of $3,100. This would have been partly because of the general drop in interest rates, All but $600 would have been from the banks' reduction in margins. That is due to the extra competition generated as a result of the coalition government's policies. The Australian Bankers Association said a small business with a residentially secured loan would have done even better, and many small businesses are now using the equity in their homes to assist them to negotiate better rates with banks for their working capital overdrafts. In the case of a small business taking out a residentially secured loan, there would be an average reduction in interest of $4,700 per annum, of which $2,200 would have been the result of reduced bank margins-in my words, I add-directly as a result of the coalition government's spirited policies to stimulate additional competition in the money market/banking area. The recent announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to increase activities and opportunities for credit unions and building societies provides another welcome entrant into the marketplace and also provides, it follows, additional access avenues for small business to get loan money that they can inject into their business and so service their old debtsreplace them in many cases-and regear so they can get on with the challenges of expanding their business. I would like to record, therefore, that it is time for the opposition, particularly, to take a close look at itself and its performance and to reflect on the damage it is doing by obstructing the reforms of this government. Can I just mention briefly another example of obstructionism by the opposition having a deleterious effect on small business. I bring members back to my opening remarks that small business is the heart and soul of Australia's commercial activity. More than 50 per cent of jobs come from small business. Most growth, investment and expansion is coming from small business. So everything that the opposition does to obstruct reforms by this government to help small business strikes a direct blow at that dynamic, which cannot be tolerated any longer and needs to be exposed very graphically to the Australian people over the next few months leading to the election, whenever it is. What about another example of the opposition's obstruction? Let us have a look at the efforts of the government to further reform the unfair dismissal laws of Australia. The recent efforts by the government to give exemptions from the unfair dismissal laws for those small businesses employing 50 people or less have been stopped dead in their tracks by the opposition in the Senate. What an extraordinary thing for them to do. They have stopped that legislation, which would have undoubtedly given further confidence and stimulated small business to offer more jobs, particularly for young people going into the 1998 post-school 1997 employment growth scenario. I remind members of the opposition, if they have forgotten, that young people in Australia are i now leaving school having completed their studies or are graduating from universities and T AFEs and are looking for work in 1998. This is the time for all members of parliament to remind the opposition that they have to take account of what they are doing to stop young people in Australia from getting employment opportunities. One of those very great obstructions is the acknowledged message coming from small business: 'We are scared out of our mind to take on new people for a number of factors. One of them is the problem of unfair dismissal for new employees, particularly in the first year of employment.' So the government responded to that by saying it would offer legislation to give an exemption from the unfair dismissal law for a small business employing up to 15. You would have thought that the opposition, recognising the number of young people unemployed in Australia due to their 13 years of neglect, would have given every comfort to the government to get that legislation through so we could be job ready and business ready in 1998 to increase young Australians' chances of getting a job. But, no, the opposition have obstructed and stopped that bill dead in the Senate. I say: bring them to account because it is time that the Australian people were given an opportunity to mark the dismal performance and deliberate, obstructive activities of the opposition, particuis larly in the area of small business. Can I return to the legislation and New deal: fair deal-giving small business a fair go and remind members of some of the components of the legislation. It introduces a new small business section in the Trade Practices Act prohibiting unconscionable conduct-a welcome initiative giving small business the same access in a way to trade practices law that consumers have had. Strangely, as Peter Reith pointed out, the trade practices law in Australia has been developed largely to give consumer protection. Now this new, reformist government is offering trade practices protection for small business as well as the consumer. This provision does that. It is a very exciting development in the business of trade law in Australia. Also the legislation and the initiative of the government provides new protection for small business franchisees through a mandatory and stronger franchising code of conduct. Coalition members in regional areas of Australia have been working very hard to tackle the hydra-headed monster of petroleum industry reform that previous governments have not tackled, notwithstanding the reports of 30 inquiries gathering dust. Regional members of the coalition have already taken a number of steps, such as opening up terminals-so that there is no longer that obstruction-and increasing transparency. Prices are now being monitored by the ACCC and the motoring organisations, so accountability and opportunity for whistleblowing is opening up and the consumer has the chance to judge and to comment more freely and to put pressure on those in the industry to make them more consumer friendly. We also have new independents coming in and new dynamics in the retail industry as a result of our policies. New players such as Safeway and other smaller people in the retail industry are providing fuel as an adjunct to their business at a lower price, thus driving down the prices of the other people in the industries. There is a lot more to come in the area of fuel reform-watch this space. We are also introducing a minimum legislative standard to protect retail tenants, and it good to see that most of the states are now responding favourably, in their way, to this initiative of the federal government. We are giving stronger enforcement rights to the ACCC in respect of small business fair trading rights, including the ability to take representative legal action on behalf of small business. We are supporting alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies-a very welcome. move. We are supporting the extension of the Banking Industry Ombudsman, enabling the ombudsman to deal with issues raised by small business and not just consumers-a very important initiative. I call on the banking association to move quickly with respect to that. (Time expired) .",17
6,Mrs BAILEY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"As a former small business woman, I am particularly pleased and proud to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill, which was introduced into the House on 30 September this year. This legislation marks a new vision and attitude for Australian small business. The role of small business in this country has been vital, accounting for the majority of all businesses in Australia. In addition, small businesses in all areaswhether they be small regional townships like Healesville or larger urban communities such as Diamond Creek or Craigieburn in my electorate of MCEwen-will get from this legislation fair and adequate representation in business transactions, better representation in conflict resolution, education, and self-regulatbehaviour ing codes of practice underpinned by legislation. This is long overdue because, unfortunately, the previous government not only ignored the impact of the small business sector on our economy but also through deliberate policy decisions threatened the viability of small business and caused loss of employment. It has taken the initiative of this government to introduce measures to redress the problems and to recognise small business as a vital part of our nation. We will achieve that by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to not only protect the interests and viability of small business but also allow business in all its forms to work within a framework to settle disputes fairly and on an equal footing. In 13 years the opposition never made any progress in reforming the environment in which small business operates. They lacked any commitment to small business and refused to listen to the needs of the small business community. The opposition held a total of 17 inquiries during their 13 years in office but produced no action to assist small business. Their 13 years represents a complete failure to the Australian small business sector. It is only with the ini.tiatives contained in this legislation that the majority of small businesses around Australia have been able to breathe a sigh of relief that at long last they have a government which has been prepared to listen to their concerns and act on their behalf to ensure that they are treated as equal partners with big business in business transactions. This legislation arises out of the government's response to the fair trading inquiry, of which I was a member. Submissions from over 200 business groups and organisations were received and over 50 organisations gave evidence directly to the committee in public hearings. These investigations identified several areas of concern that needed urgent action: the lack of transparency of information where prospective small business owners did not receive the required information on a venture before entering into an agreement; the problems of complex or unfamiliar documentation; the inflexibility of terms and conditions within an agreement; harsh or harmful within business relationships; and an ineffective access to justice. In fact, the government has acted on seven major areas of concern: unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance and access to justice and education. This is the first time that a government has provided small businesses with legislation that addresses fair trading issues and problems in business transactions. This will provide new levels of protection for small business through either a voluntary or a mandatory code of conduct underpinned by the Trade Practices Agreement. These voluntary and mandatory codes are good news for all small businesses as each industry will be able to focus regulations to suit the specific conditions of each industry and provide the sector with a prescribed set of regulations to potentially suit members. I would argue that self-regulation, where plausible, does address the needs of businesses but that in areas such as franchising the mandatory prescribed codes put forward in this bill are necessary and will ensure that safeguards that have been so obviously lacking in the past are binding on all participants in that sector. Such specific industry codes of practice will give an opportunity for industry involvement and secure appropriately targeted dispute resolution. Where possible the government will allow sectors that are able to manage and regulate their own industry to do so within the legislative boundaries. This bill has provided that a franchising code of practice will be supported as a mandatory code with full legislative underpinning. I wholeheartedly support this action by the government. In addition, a new industry body, to be known as the Franchising Industry Council, will be set up to monitor and review the franchising code of practice and will provide government with advice and specific industry based information. This new council will include industry members and will have an independent chair to ensure its balance. The fair trading report titled Finding a balance has identified many examples of small business failures and of financial ruin and breakdown of marriages and families caused because business decisions were often made under pressure and without full or accurate information. The government accepts that this environment is not conducive to operating small businesses successfully and that, because of the unequal power that exists in the marketplace, small business is particularly at risk and frequently disadvantaged, and at times has suffered financial ruin because of this inequality. The government is committed to ensuring that small business owners are able to confront problems without the inherent tension and inequality that has been present in past years. This legislation will redress this iniquitous situation and reduce the incidence of physical stress and breakdown of relationships experienced by small business owners and managers-conditions against which the all opposition refused to act and could only offer a string of inquiries without any prospect for change or improvement. Franchising is an essential part of Australia's business and financial community. With an annual growth rate of 14 per cent in 1993, with a total turnover for 1993-94 of $42.7 billion and with twice as many franchising systems per head in Australia as in the United States, it is essential that we give these businesses the chance that they deserve, ensuring that all businesses are treated equitably and fairly in all business transactions so that they will thrive and create more jobs. Franchises are able to provide small business men and women with a strong base in training and support, a recognised product and the benefits of playing a part in a team of similar businesses. But franchisees must be allowed to operate in a fair environment and be fully informed in order to succeed. During the committee's investigations, many concerns were raised by franchisees, and it is solely due to the effort of this government that we are now able to provide the opportunity for a balanced relationship between franchisers and franchisees through the provisions of this bill, which will provide support and a means to dispute resolution without substantial expense and within an environment that encourages competition and growth in franchises. Certainly there has been a history of unfair dealings within the small business community, as identified within the report Finding a balance, where there have been numerous examples of lack of information, misinformation given to prospective small business owners or inadequate disclosure of relevant and important commercial information prior to contractual agreement causing business failure. Some examples are: an inflated account of business profits or value; an inability to negotiate terms of contracts; an inability of the prospective owner to match the size and strength of the other party during negotiations as well as a lack of understanding of complex documentation; where a business relationship may be characterised with a difficulty in communication; and where, through a lack of knowledge or lack of transparency, a small business owner may not know or understand the processes to access justice or dispute resolution. Included in this bill is a section focused on unconscionable conduct and its effects on small business. One of the most important sections of this proposed new section of the Trade Practices Act dealing specifically with small business relations is that it is just that an entire section, 51AC, devoted entirely to the needs of the small business owner or manager. This is a first for small business, because this is the first time a government has had the will or commitment to stand up for small business and be prepared to legislate on their behalf. In the past, unconscionable conduct has been difficult to .prove in practice, as precedents have accepted that commercial transactions are often unequal and that this is the simple nature of business conduct. In addition, to prove an action as unconscionable under a breach of the current trade practices law, conventionally the aggrieved party must establish that it was in the position of a special disability through suffering ignorance in material facts known to the other party: for example, illiteracy, age, physical disabilities or emotional dependence. In order to establish proof of unconscionable conduct in the past, the aggrieved, and usually less powerful, parties had to prove that they were in a position of disadvantage which the other party knew about and took unfair advantage of the situation to the disadvantage of that party. This has proved to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for small businesses, who have usually neither the financial means nor the ability to take time out of running their businesses to face long court battles trying to prove that their grievances fall within the prescribed guidelines. Legal representation, either in informal discussions or in the courts, has placed a huge burden on small business, a position from which many of them have not recovered. I support the new proposals in this bill designed to determine whether unconscionable conduct has been used in a commercial transaction. Both listed public companies and transactions exceeding $1 million are excluded from the remedies proposed under section 5lAC regarding unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions. These provisions will ensure that these conditions are limited to disputes involving small businesses. Alternative dispute resolution services in the business arena through mediation and conflict resolution offer the possibility of providing a service which is more flexible in its outcomes, providing th- means for negotiation and a better prospect for both parties to settle disputes. Outcomes can be kept private so that the confidential dealings of a business are not broadcast to the greater community. This has the advantage over court proceedings, where disputes are often drawn out, causing further emotional and financial strain to small businesses. This bill establishes the position of dispute resolution adviser to assist in individual inquiries and concerns. This arrangement aims to provide an essential service. The adviser will act as an additional information point and advise inexperienced franchisees about what options are available. The adviser will be able to assist in the selection of a suitable mediator and reduce the likelihood of lengthy legal battles. The opposition's belated call for the inclusion of 'unfair conduct' within the legislation is not appropriate, I believe. While the Reid committee-and I add, as I have previously, that I was a member of that committee-made recommendations referring to 'unfair conduct' , it should be noted that not one of us on that committee had any legal qualifications. After detailed analysis of this, the government's response is better, and it is workable, and it has captured the intent of the committee's recommendation. The move by the opposition to include 'unfair conduct' within the legislation would open a Pandora's box for both lawyers and the courts throughout Australia. This 'unfair conduct' terminology has had no opportunity to be subject to the interpretation of the courts. If included within this legislation, it could have disastrous effects for small business. As a member of the committee, I accept the government's decision, which has received widespread support from small business people and from economic and legal analysts. In Greek mythology, Pandora, in opening the forbidden box, let loose all the ravages of the modem world and, in so doing, changed life for all time. In attempting to retrieve the situation, Pandora, unfortunately, denied forever the promise of hope. Just as Pandora acted without respect or concern for others, so too does the opposition in calling for the words 'unfair conduct' to replace 'unconscionable conduct' in the bill. The opposition is trying to open a veritable Pandora's box of legislative and judicial problems. In doing so, it denies small businesses any hope of a speedy and fair resolution to disputes. The government is committed to supporting the small business sector. Through this bill, it will extend the voluntary codes of practice and alternative dispute resolution services to include incorporated small businesses. In addition to the measures for alternative conflict resolution services mentioned previously, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is to playa greater role in the representation of small business in actions against unfair business conduct, with an increase in their resources to allow for a more active role where complaints are able to be resolved. Such an increase is to include the immediate appointment of a small business commissioner to directly represent the interests of small business. Correspondingly, the government will ensure that the Competition and Consumer Commission in each state and territory throughout Australia has access to a small business case officer who will be able to assist with specific problems through a close association with both the ACCC and the stateor territory-wide business community. In the previous government, the small business sector was unable to access either the Banking Industry Ombudsman or the code of banking practice. This bill changes that by insisting that these schemes should apply to all small businesses indiscriminately. In the past small business, if incorporated, could never gain access to these services. It is to government's credit that this is yet another Reid report recommendation which the government has recognised and acted upon. The reforms contained within the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill include a section devoted entirely to the availability of information and education for small business. In my electorate office I have received an overwhelming number of requests for information on small business issues. It is this thirst for information that frequently determines the future success of a small business. This bill recognises and addresses this matter. One of the main problems small business owners have faced over the past years has been lack of information in relation to the hazards and financial merit of either franchising or retail tenancies. Such information is vital to prospective franchisees and tenants. The Reid report acknowledged that a great percentage-75 per cent-of small business owners have little or no experience beyond school based education. It is, therefore, understandable that only a small percentage have experience in training, budget planning or marketing, although they may have an outstanding product or service as the basis of their small business. While sections of the bill are specifically targeted at the management practices and relationships between businesses, the area specifying the education of small business owners in relation to changes to practice management, avenues available for specific forms of assistance and how to access these areas is very important and long overdue. Information will be readily accessible through training providers, specific industry based associations and on electronic services such as the Internet. Most importantly, this bill seeks to restore the balance between small business and big business, illustrating the nature in which this government is prepared to stand up for the small business person. I join the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in believing that this bill seeks to encourage Australian businesses to deal with each other fairly and reasonably. I support the the aims of the legislation to redress the imbalance of power between small business and big business. I applaud this government for taking on board the recommendations of the Reid report. I strongly support this bill for the benefits it promises to deliver for small businesses in MCEwen and around Australia. This legislation proposes a new deal for business men and women. Most importantly, it provides them with a fair deal. I commend the bill to the House.",21
7,Mrs JOHNSTON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Canning) (10.29 a.m.)In rising to speak today on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, I would like to say from the outset that the measures brought down in this bill are equitable, effective, fair and indeed long overdue. These measures aim to provide relief to small business-the relief that small business owners did not experience under Labor. These measures are not rhetoric, as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) would have had us believe when he spoke on this bill. Rather, they deliver landmark reforms to sections of the retail industry which had been screaming out in vain for a fair deal under the Keating administration. However, I do concur with the member for Cunningham on one particular point. He referred to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Finding a Balance: towards fair trading in Australia, and said the report was 'one of the better parliamentary committee reports that has been generated for quite some time'. I thank him for those kind words. As a member of the committee, I, along with the chair of the committee, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), and my other colleagues, can take particular pride in the kind words of the member for Cunningham when he acknowledged: I think hereferring to the member for Bendigoand his committee members showed compassion and interest. They actually showed that they were prepared to bring down some recommendations in this parliament to delve into those great concerns that the small business community in this country had for their future. However, in recognising this report for the quality product it is, and the members for their concerted effort, the member for Cunningham has become a dangerously loose cannon for the ALP. He had the gall to stand on the other side of this House and quote from the draft platform speech of the Australian Labor Party, given by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), and try to draw an extremely long bow in relating this worthless piece of populist policy making to some sort of commitment the Labor Party has to small business. Let me aga-n quote the member for Cunningham: A key part of Labor's agenda for industry must also be to harness the energy, drive and flexibility of small business to provide opportunities for as many Australians as possible. He goes on further with his hollow promises when he says: We believe in strategic intervention for small business to guarantee a fair and competitive economic environment, and address the obstacles the small business community faces including their market power disadvantage, compliance costs and access to finance and justice. And he accuses us of espousing rhetoric! This is the same party that, despite 17 reports on fair trading in their 13 years of government, failed to provide any real protection for those small businesses for which they profess to guarantee a fair and equitable economic environment. This just proves that the Labor Party's draft platform reeks of a tired, old Labor Party. Indeed, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) admitted in an interview on Radio National only the other week: Sure, there are all sorts of elements of continuity, between the kind of government that we were for the last thirteen years and the kind of government that we will be in the future. We'd be utterly implausible if we tried to present ourselves as a different kind of outfit. I am sure that the majority of small business owners would find little comfort in that remark. But they can draw comfort from the knowledge that this government has broken Labor's cycle of inaction and has delivered a fair trading package that is a big win for small business. Amendments to the Trade. Practices Act 1974-in respect of section 51AD, relating to the introduction of mandatory and voluntary industry codes, and section 51AC, relating to the prevention of unconscionable conduct by corporations against individuals-provide meaningful protection for those small businesses that have been struggling under Labor's unworkable regime. We in the coalition, since coming into office, have actively demonstrated our determination to make things easier for small business, which we consider rightly to be the engine room of our economy. This commitment has been delivered in the form of the coalition's small business policy statement, released in response to the committee's report, entitled A New Deal for Small Business, and the government's response to the report of the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, More time for business. The response to the committee's report is considered to be the most extensive program of reforms on business conduct undertaken by any government in more than two decades. In light of my previous comments in relation to the poor performance of the Labor Party in responding to the pleas of small businesses, this is all surprising. It was encouraging to read an article in the Australian recently reporting on the promising signs of an emerging economic recovery. The article noted improvements in general business conditions and expectations, lending even further weight to the onset of an extended expansionary phase. This is welcome news for all Australians. Moreover, a recent Yellow Pages survey indicated that there is growing confidence in the small business sector, a confidence level that is the highest for 2Yz years. Thirty-four per cent of those surveyed expect the economy to be better a year from now, and there can be no doubt that legislation such as we are debating today will go some way to achieving this goal. During my frequent visits to businesses in my electorate of Canning, both recently and throughout my many years of campaigning, I have been continually struck by the fact that small business has been adversely affected in a number of areas, particularly in matters concerning franchising, retail tenancy and justice. As a member of the committee, I heard many stories of anger, frustration-at times-and complete despondency with the ridiculous circumstances some small businesses were expected to accommodate. The report into fair trading was imperative, just as action to ensure that acceptable and fair business conduct is practised in Australia is now critically important for the success of our nation. Small business holds the key to the revival of our economy. Small business needs to be given the opportunity not only to survive but also to prosper. But it needs to be able to do so free from the predatory practices and standover tactics that proprietors have been experiencing for such a long time. Predatory practices of big business are just not acceptable. Unconscionable practices serve only to stifle entrepreneurial activity. In order to monitor this, each state and territory will, under our legislation, have two small business associate commissioners and a small business case officer. Combined with education campaigns, these two aspects will serve as very useful tools in dispute resolunot at tion-something which sadly has been missing for quite some time. Clearly, therefore, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 will assist in providing existing as well as budding small business owners with the confidence and the certainty that they need to expand their businesses. In the recent half-hour of rhetoric from the member for Cunningham, he stated that Labor is leading from the front with respect to introducing a uniform retail tenancy code. That certainly would be something new. Let's be real: since when has the Labor Party been leading the way in introducing any measures to help small business? Small plans, small intentions, small deeds and a small record: small is all that those opposite have in common with small business. Labor were too scared to take decisive action when they were in government, but now we witness them attempting to masquerade as everybody's best friend whilst in the wilderness of opposition. An effective opposition is vital to a democratic system of government, and I think that it is high time that the Labor Party began fulfilling their role with some degree of integrity and sincerity, if that is at all possible. In the amendment bill before us, we have a useful, practical and ultimately desirable amendment bill that I think will go a long way to making a fairer deal for small businesses. Certainly there may be other measures that can be given further consideration to complement those being discussed today. However, on the whole, this bill faithfully reflects the primary sentiments of small business. The term 'unconscionable conduct' has been given preference over introducing a broader prohibition on unfair conduct. This aspect of the legislation has been contentiousbecome ly debated by those opposite. This government considers it appropriate to weigh up factors of equity and justice in the preparation of public policy making. In the case of fair trading, the notion of unfair conduct-given the fact that it is not recognised by current common law-carries with it the probability of further uncertainty and disruption. The purpose of this legislation is to enable small businesses to enter into fair and equitable arrangements. Whilst creating a more conducive environment in which small business can thrive, it does not seek, however, to sustain those who should not be in business. I will finish on the same note on which I began, by reasserting the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 as being decidedly based upon factors of equity, effectiveness and fairness. To say that these measures are long overdue would again be stating the obvious as well as being a gross understatement. This amendment bill is a tangible indication of the coalition's represenstandards tation of small business. Helping small business, a vital generator of economic wealthcreating 65 per cent of new jobs in the 199596 year-was what we on this side campaigned on in the lead-up to the last election, the election which saw an overwhelmingly majority of the Australian people vote in favour of the coalition government. This bill is proof of this government's following through on their promises which, as has been indicated, is a great deal more than those opposite have been able to achieve with their hollow promises. I commend this bill to the House.",25
8,Mr NEVILLE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak in the House today on the issue of fair trading and in particular the needs of franchisees to have some form of protection against unscrupulous franchisor companies. I have met several franchisees who have lost everything-their capital, their stores, their capacity to earn and even their dignity as individuals, sometimes being tossed out of their homes. I was pleased to be part of the government which introduced the Reid report on small business, the fair trading report as it has known. I know the problems with franchising have been uni versal and not restricted to my electorate. My constituents have phoned me to thank me for the work I did for them, but more particularly to congratulate the government on the small business package, New deal: fair deal. They are not the only ones. The business sector has almost universally commended the package not just in respect of franchises but also in respect of other matters of the package which I will deal with later in my address. The Australian Business Chamber has said that the New deal: fair deal package would address the difference between small business and big' business. The Australian Small Business Association said that the government had recognised the principle of unconscionability and lack of bargaining parity between small and big businesses. The Franchise Council of Australia has welcomed the code, saying that minimum of disclosure are necessary in franchise operations, and stock dumping and churning have no part in ethical franchising. This is something I have encountered in my examination of various franchises in my electorate. The Australian Retailers Association said that it wholeheartedly supports the overseeing by government of proposals to review retail tenancy legislation, saying that it provides small business with the ability to take action against shopping centre landlords for unconscionable conduct. There have been a whole range of peak bodies that have come out and commended this legislation. All small business peak industry groups have been supportive of the legislation and they want to see it implemented. The Reid committee was commissioned to look at six areas of concern to small business: retail tenancy, franchising, the misuse of market power, unfair conduct, finance, and access to justice and education. It dealt with five key points: to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to improve the legislative protection for small business against the unconscionable conduct of big business and landlords, and to provide the same protections to them as to consumers; to provide legal recognition for codes of conduct under the Trade Practices Act and an avenue for legal redress; to tighten up on franchising rorts-in particular churning, rent loading and stock dumping-and allow franchisees to pursue legal action under the Trade Practices Act without needing to prove misleading and deceptive conduct, and introducing unconscionable conduct as part of the regime for seeking redress; to improve the lot of small business when dealing with property owners by facilitating national negotiations between peak representatives of both retailers and property owners; and to extend to small business the powers of the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman and the new banking code of practice to ensure that small businesses have the right of redress. One of the things I do find in the electorate in relation to small business as I move around is that we often have circumstances' in which small businesses have been treated in very cavalier fashion, even in unconscionable fashion, by some of the banks, generally at a time when those small businesses are hardpressed to expand the businesses or hardpressed for capital. At those times they are not in a position to take on the big banks. So it is a very important time in the life of a small business when capital dries up and the banks are either pressing for higher rates of interest for default or making unreasonable demands on the business and there is nowhere to go; there is no money to fight legal action. I find that a particularly important aspect of the legislation. I think it would be fair to say that the coalition believes small business is vital to Australian economy. We have had national unemployment of around 8.6 per cent. In my electorate of Hinkler the rate has varied between 14 and 15 per cent. These high unemployment rates were caused partially by the recession and partially by a lack of infrastructure. But I think one of the other factors has been the closure and contraction of many small businesses during the recessionary period. I think that has, in a way, contributed to the unemployment malaise in my area. But why haven't the small businesses managed to be restored? Why can't small business get a fair go in the market? What is wrong with the economic and legislative climate that small business has to operate in? The Australian economy is vastly different today from a decade ago and is becoming increasingly more open and competitive. Ten years ago it was only big businesses, law firms, scientists and academics who were right into the newer avenues of electronic data collection and things such as the Internet. Today almost everybody has access to the Internet. They can use it for all sorts of things. They can use it to enhance their business or even for shopping. So the strains on small business are increasing all the time and small businesses do not have the benefit of the economies of scale or the backup that exists in medium and large business. But the one thing that has not helped them is that legislation has remained substantially the same. There is not enough protection for small businesses. The Trade Practices Act currently does not have mechanisms to provide protection for small business from unconscionable conduct. Clearly the mechanisms set up in the past-such as the franchising code of practice, which was voluntary-were not sufficient. When some unscrupulous franchising companies flouted the law, it was unlikely that they would adhere to the voluntary code of practice. A provision under the Trade Practices Act, section 51AC, will build on well understood consumer protections previously not afforded to small business to protect business from this unconscionable conduct. The coalition believes business should be the left to do business. The regulatory environment should not be such that businesses are constricted in the way that they do business. The new provisions to protect small business from unconscionable conduct builds on well established legal doctrines. There is already a body of case law on the protection available to consumers under unconscionable conduct. The small business provision of the Trade Practices Act is designed to induce behavioural change in dealings between large and small business and to ensure that commercial dealings are carried out equitably. It recognises the relationship between small business and big business, and works to address the differences. The unfair advantage that big business has over small business-not due to legislation but due to the simple rules of economies of scale-needs also to be taken into account. The amendment provides for a court to consider the relative bargaining power of the business; whether the business had to comply with unreasonable conditions; whether the business understood the nature of the supply agreement; whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on the business operator; the price of goods and what their equals were in the market; any requirements that might be applicable to an industry code; the extent to which the supplier failed to disclose the nature of the business and the supply relationship; any risks associated through the business; and the extent to which the supplier was willing to negotiate the terms and conditions of any contract for supply and the extent to which the supplier and business acted in good faith. These are all matters of great concern to small business. In fact, these matters are at deserved. the heart of the terms of reference of the Reid inquiry. The provision of protection to small business which is already available to consumers needs to be extended and enhanced. The new provisions will ensure that the Trade Practices Act covers areas where there has been a history of exploited or unconscionable conduct. It provides some mechanisms for protection in retail tenancy agreements, financing and security transactions, and franchising transactions. It is distinct and separate from the provisions for consumers because the needs of small business are quite different from those of consumers. The process we are witnessing here today stands in stark contrast to 13 years of Labor in action. It is hard to comprehend that over 13 years Labor considered 17 different reports. One report, introduced by the then minister, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), and commented on in the House, took 12 months to receive an official response. After the previous government had gone through this tortured process it rejected all the recommendations of that report bar about 15 per cent. The member for Rankin expressed his frustration in a radio interview on one occasion, calling himself ' Mr 15 Per Cent'. It is a terrible indictment of the previous government to have had 17 reports in 13 years and to have acted on virtually none of them. To take a full year to respond to one of them in the parliament and then to implement only 15 per cent of it shows that the government had no will to help small business. Finally, in November 1995, with speculation rife that an election was in the air, in the second last week of the sittings the previous government introduced a bill. It was inadequate, it was a masterpiece of windowdressing and it was the ultimate in cynicism because the government had not the least intention of implementing it before the parliament rose. It was just something to pin some sort of small business credentials to as the government went towards the election. Far from evoking a warm response from small business, it was treated with the contempt it I would like to compliment the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for his action, which stands in contrast to the dithering that went on during the 13 years of Labor and, in particular, compliment the whole Reid report process. It is certainly one of the most impressive timetables that I have seen enacted in my time in the parliament. The Reid report was tabled on 27 May. Minister Reith took up the portfolio of small business in the reshuffle of 11 July. He responded in full detail with the government's intentions in respect of the Reid report-and quite comprehensive they were too-at 4 p.m. on 30 September. Now here we are in early December of the same year debating the final stages, in the House of Representatives at least, of that legislation. One business commentator, whom I loosely paraphrase, said: 'It was like a 400 metre race with the government 200 metres down the track before the big players got out of the starting blocks.' When the minister made his response I was amazed at the response of the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I think he was taken by surprise. I do not think he expected that so many of the things small business had been asking for would be dealt with. I found the second reading amendment he signalled to the House on that occasion absolutely extraordinary. It recommends: . . . the bill be amended to incorporate the mendations of the Committee . . . For heaven's sake, the recommendations of the committee were agreed to by all the Labor members with the exception of one small dissent by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). In other words, it was almost unanimous. There was almost complete agreement to the Reid report. So to move an amendment that recommends 'the bill be amended to incorporate the recommendations of the committee' is nonsense. It also says that the House: . . . considers the Government's response is inadequate and its rhetoric does not match either its election commitments or the Committee's findings Again, that is nonsense. Fancy having the gall to say that, after 17 reports of your own over 13 years. In other parts of the speech of the member for Cunningham he is quite generous with the findings of the report. His amendments are totally out of kilter with the report itself and quite out of kilter with the response of his own Labor members who were part of the Reid committee. And, what is even worse, his amendments do not go any way to addressing the real problems which Minister Reith himself has addressed in his response and has brought into legislation. The member for Cunningham also quoted from an address by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in which he said: A key part of Labor's agenda for industry must be to harness the energy, drive and flexibility of small business to provide opportunities for as many Australians as possible. Again, what an extraordinary thing to say after having ducked the issue for 13 years and disregarded 17 reports. The address goes on to say: - abor recognises the enormous job creating potential of Australian small business. We believe in strategic intervention for small business to guarantee a fair and competitive economic environment and address the obstacles the small business community faces, including their market power advantage, compliance costs and access to finance and justice. Not one of those things was addressed over 13 years. I suspect too that, in moving those amendments, the member for Cunningham recommight be using a bit of the technique he used with the unfair dismissal legislation to manufacture a clash between the government and the Senate and, by so doing, blunt or slow down this new legislation on fair trading. I suspect that there might be more to what he said than a considered response to the government's initiatives. In the few minutes that are left, I would like to talk about franchising. This is a prime concern of mine. I have had a lot of constituents come to me with problems in franchising. They all follow a pattern: a glorious picture is painted'by the franchisor; every encouragement is made for the franchisee to sign up; all sorts of promises are given about assisting them with the running of the operation-these are generally not fulfilled-and great marketing programs, most of which do not occur; figures are shown to the potential franchisee that do not match reality; and then, when the franchisee gets into trouble, unreal demands are made of them. After those unfair demands are made, they are generally removed from the business. I for one commend this legislation because, if anything, that sort of unconscionable practice, which has gone on for far too long in the franchising business, needs to stop. If this legislation did nothing else but that, it would be a marvellous success. (Time expired)",27
9,Mr ENTSCH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise today to lend my strong support to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. This legislation holds many benefits for a very wide range of small businesses in Australia. I intend to focus my remarks on those couple of specific areas which I believe will give a far better and fairer deal for small business operators in my electorate-and I am talking here about retail tenancy work and, in particular, fuel distributors and service station operators which have been very much at the mercy of the multinationals for far too many years. It is good to see that at last we are in a position to give some of these people a decent set of teeth so that they can protect their rights. Under the retail tenancy reform that we are proposing, there are a number of very positive initiatives. A stronger Trade Practices Act will, at long last, start to work for small retail businesses rather than benefiting the larger operators. There will be a new law against unconscionable business conduct,! taking into account the differing bargaining powers between small retailers and retail landlords. This is something that has emerged in my electorate, particularly in Cairns. In recent times, there has been an absolute proliferation of retail space. Certainly, overservicing has been suggested, and we have sufficient shopping centres in Cairns now to be able to service a population something in excess of 2Y2. to three times our current population. So really we have two choices: either we have to start encouraging larger families, very quickly, with a significant migration program to Cairns or, alternatively, we have to start looking at possibly reducing our retail space by half. It is a very serious problem that we have there. There does not seem to be any quick fix solution in the short term. Sadly, what happens is that people get locked into retail tenancies in these large centres and they really have no choice. They get locked in and cannot get out as new centres start to open and, of course, business starts to drop off, irrespective of their ability to service their particular business just by sheer numbers. They are locked into all sorts of deals which really cause them major problems and, sadly, we see a lot of them going broke and ending up in our social security queues, which is something that we need to avoid. We also have a problem when some of the larger retail landlords, particularly, lock these people in and, for their own commercial reasons, they are not prepared to offer any compromise. Basically, they will keep them there until they are well and truly destroyed in a business sense. So it is good to see that we are actually bringing in some practical measures now that will give some protection to these small retail tenants to give them the opportunity of at least surviving in a very difficult time. There are also measures leading to specialised state and territory retail tenancy legislation and a nationally negotiated safety net for principles of retail tenancy legislation. All of these things are certainly going to help a lot of the small retailers in my electorate. I have to say that when we released this package we were applauded in that area. There was a massive sigh of relief. It is something that has been desperately needed for a long time. But up until very recently-and I commend the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for the speed with which he dealt with this-there was no commitment, prior to Minister Reith, to deal with this matter. It is certainly going to assist our businesses. The other area that I think is even more important-the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), touched on it-is the issue of franchising reform. As he said, there are a number of franchises around. We see them springing up everywhere. Anybody who gets half a good idea these days puts some catchy name to it and sells it off as a franchise. Sadly, they drag in a lot of people who think that there is a business opportunity which they can make a dollar out of. Unfortunately, they pay an absolute fortune to get into it. The great marketing initiatives that are sold to these people as part of the cost are usually only reflected in the glossy brochures that are given to them. Those initiatives are about as shallow as the brochures. They are given figures that are at best very inaccurate. As a consequence, we see a lot of people and families who go into these franchises expecting to do well out of it. At the end of the day, they are broke. The franchisor continues to sell his wares and makes a very comfortable living out of it. It is good to see that we have new legislation that will give legal protection to franchisees against exploitative business contact. There is certainly a new and stronger franchising code of practice, mandatory crossfranchise systems, which are also very important, and legal recognition of the new franchising code under the Trade Practices Act. At least that will give them some protection by bringing them under the umbrella of the Trade Practices Act. One of the other areas that is absolutely critical is the stronger and mandatory oil code being underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. This will protect our oil industry franchisees. Under the amendments in the House today, the oil code, the voluntary code of practice for the oil industry, will certainly be strengthconsiderable ened and given legal backing under the Trade Practices Act. The amendments will provide a legal underpinning to approved codes of practice. I am really pleased that the government is prescribing the oil code as a mandatory code under the act. I think this is absolutely crucial. It will ensure that complainants will have access to remedies and sanctions contained in the act. A facilitator will be appointed to aid negotiations between relevant parties to draft a strengthening oil code. It is expected that the negotiations will be completed by the end of this year, with the legal underpinning effective in 1998. Strengthening the oil code will mean that family operated fuel distribution businesses will not have to suffer the same treatment as was suffered by Bill, Russell and Greg Boundy of Airvision Pty Ltd based in Cairns, a family with a 48-year association with Mobil which turned sour in very recent times. Airvision, of which Bill, Russell and Greg Boundy are the directors and owners, were agents and contractors for Mobil at Cairns airport for 26 years-father and sons, with the father being associated with Mobil and its predecessor, Vacuum, for 48 years as an employee, agent, distributor and contractor. The Boundys were given long-term assurances and promises by Mobil, which were discussed in great detail, about their future at the Cairns airport and the probability of managing for Mobil that company's interests in other local Queensland general aviation airports. They were given clear statements, plans and specific details about the probability of running Mobil's and the joint user's interests at the Sydney airport, to the extent of being told to buy a unit close to Sydney airport due to the frequency and length of visits to the airport. They were provided with extensive-and expensive-training to achieve the ability to manage all of the above mentioned projects. This was paid for entirely by Mobil. In view of the need to prepare for the expansion in an environment where Mobil informed them that contractors were the way to go, in Mobil's view, and that they would be responsible for everything, they made investment in working capital on the basis of promises given to enable them to establish themselves as major contractors. A contract of $2 million per annum was thoroughly discussed and proposed to enable the full contract running of the Cairns airport, which helped the ANZ Bank approve the aforementioned increase in working capital. An annual budget was prepared and agreed by Mobil' and the Boundys, with the full contents being understood by both sides. This is an important fact because later on Mobil said that they did not have any idea how much the Boundys were going to be paid. An enterprise bargaining agreement negotiation was begun at Mobil's insistence, being the precursor for a new arrangement reflected in the new contract and comments made about the changed nature of the management process planned after it was completed. Extensive enterprise bargaining agreement guidance was given by Mobil itself and there was evidence, the Boundys believed, of Mobil's long-term aims, contrary to declared statements that followed after that. Mobil's involvement is unusual as normally enterprise agreements are negotiated between those parties affected, the employees and the owner/ managers. The completed enterprise bargaining agreement led to a significant increase in costs but this was followed by a reduction in remuneration within weeks. Subsequent to the reduction in remuneration, financial pressure was felt by the Boundys through delays in payments by Mobil, which forced the Boundys into a very difficult financial position. In November 1996, the Boundys were given the option of accepting 90 days' notice, as Mobil alleged it was able to do under the signed agreement, or walking away with $100,000-a pro rata of this 90-day amount to broadly recognise Mobil's view of the profit being earned. The changed attitude appears to have developed in late 1996, when a different section of Mobil seemed to realise the long-term potential of Cairns and Sydney in the Olympics context, and the opportunity to cut out the middleman was seen. After giving the 90-day termination notice, Mobil was forced into oil code unwillingly. It required a letter to Mobil's managing director from the distributor's association, APADA, and pressure from the oil code conciliator to do so. It took several weeks to achieve. In addition to the termination of the joint user hydrant installation business, Mobil have failed to pay outstanding invoices of around $800,000 to Airvision and made a payment of some $35,000 as a full and final settlement. Astonishingly, there was no reconciliation advice accompanying the payment. The offer made by the oil company was a minute fraction of the value of the business taken from the Boundys. The oil code conciliator recommended a significantly higher amount than the $100,000 Mobil offered, but it was still far short of the aforementioned value. However, on the production of additional diary note evidence, which it had not been expected would be needed at the time, and a submission of this evidence to the conciliator, the conciliator suspended the recommendation pending Mobil's response to the diary notes. The evidence of three named individuals in the diary notes was critical in view of the promises and statements recorded, but Mobil refused to allow them to participate in the conciliation before or after the submission of the diary notes. Mobil refused to agree to or reject a direct request for further talks and subsequently ignored the conciliator's direction to attend further talks and respond to the diary notes. An offer equivalent to the conciliator's suspended recommendation was made by Mobil. The offer expired as the distributor and his association requested further conciliation meetings and were unable, in the absence of the revised conciliator's recommendation, to agree or reject the offer. It was subsequently reinstated for a fortnight at the time of Mobil's withdrawal from the conciliation process. By withdrawing in the manner that it did, Mobil ignored the conciliator's directions. Any reasonable person would consider that this action of Mobil had the potential to significantly damage the alternative dispute resolution process. Comments were received from Mobil staff at the joint user hydrant installation that Mobil expected to pay nothing to the Boundys and that the matter would go to court, taking several years. This had been said several times in recent months. The conciliator has· since written to Mobil stating that Mobil's failure to comply with the directions prevented him from forming a final view as to a fair and reasonable offer and suggested that, depending on Mobil's response to additional information provided, he might have found that a higher value was justified. He said: Mobil's tennination could reasonably be seen as an attempt to prevent such a possibility. In addition to the joint user hydrant installation side of the Cairns airport, the Boundys ran an. agency for Mobil in the general aviation market and have done so for 26 years. This was also terminated approximately three to four weeks after the second conciliation meeting. The grounds, I am advised, were spurious and were denied. It is interesting that Queensland consumer affairs records show that another Mobil distributor based in Coolangatta registered a business name for the refuelling agency in Cairns three days before the second conciliation meeting, and the Boundys were terminated a month after the meeting when Mobil took over the site and locked the Boundys out. Before and during the conciliation, Mobil had stated several times that they were content for the Boundys to continue as Mobil's general aviation agent. Following a statement in the other place, Mobil recently have indicated that they will consider reinstating the twice lapsed offer if Airvision will consider their position. But they have not indicated any intention to abide by the oil code conciliator's directions. This whole episode involving Mobil amply demonstrates the risks of relying on voluntary conciliation when dealing with big multinational businesses that can willingly disregard the process when it suits them. Quite frankly, the thought of deregulating such organisations is frightening. The slap in the face to the alternative dispute resolution process also shows how it is a waste of time to rely on voluntary codes of conduct when the chips are really down. When I spoke to Greg Boundy recently, he told me that they were absolutely distraught over what had eventuated because Mobil was a company that the family quite frankly had loved so much, as was demonstrated clearly by the length of time that the family had been associated with Mobil and their diligence in working for that company. Basically they are now unemployed and are trying to get their lives back together. It is a very sad indictment of Mobil that the Boundys have been treated this way by Mobil. It is absolute appalling. I hope that what we are doing now will certainly bring these multinationals back into line. After 48 years of association with Mobil, the Boundys have walked away with absolutely nothing but broken dreams. Since 27 October, Mobil has actually ceased communications with the family. On learning of the content of this bill, the APADA, the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, congratulated the government for producing such a well balanced and focused initiative. APADA's media release on 1 October states that they are particularly pleased that the decision has been taken to have the petroleum industry's alternative dispute resolution process strengthened and prescribed as a mandatory code under the amendments in this bin. APADA's release states: APADA's recent experience suggests that the strengthening and prescription are urgent, and APADA will co-operate fully with the negotiation foreshadowed by the Government.

10,Mrs WEST,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak in support of the amendments to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. When we established the fair trading inquiry last year we were serious about addressing the fair trading issues head on. We knew that tough decisions-decisions squibbed by previous governments-had to be made. Our package of amendments will strengthen the Trade Practices Act so it can work for small business. Our package of measures includes: new protection for small business franchisees through a stronger and mandatory franchising code of conduct, underpinned by the Trade Practices Act; a safety net of minimum legislative standards for protection of retail tenants to be negotiated through state and territory legislation; stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, including representative legal actions on behalf of small business; small business commissioners; a code of conduct enforcement unit; funding for test cases; support for alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies than traditional litigation; and support for the - xtension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme. These amendments complement the work being done by the government in workplace relations, unfair dismissal laws, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and the future with taxation reform. The combined impact of these measures supports this government's commitment to small business to assist them in getting on with business. I think all of us agree that small firms need greater protection against unfair business conduct by larger firms. Small business has long held the view that the legal and administrative barriers to bringing an action under existing laws have left them little protection. A new unconscionable conduct provision has been included with these amendments. This new provision will provide meaningful legislative protection for small business against exploitative business conduct and inadequate disclosure of information in business dealings. All members here would know of an example where small business operators have experienced unfair conduct by other big business. In my own electorate, where we have excessive retail space per head of the population, the actions of landlords in major shopping complexes have had a serious impact on the small business owners and managers. This legislation will go a long way to addressing the types of behaviour that can be considered unconscionable conduct. The proposed new section 51AC will prohibit this behaviour for corporations against persons, other than listed public companies, or unconscionable conduct by persons against corporations. Whether the conduct is unconscionable is to be determined by examining all the circumstances of the case. The new section will list a number of factors to which the Federal Court of Australia may have regard in determining whether there has been a contravention of the section. Small business will have the same type of strong legal protection that is given to consumers when dealing with big business. For example, a court will be required to consider the differences in bargaining power between big and small business when deciding whether the conduct by big business is unconscionable. Industry codes of conduct can offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice. The government remains committed to voluntary codes of conduct and industry developed regulation. When voluntary codes of conduct fail and there are significant levels of undesirable behaviour in a sector, the government may prescribe a code to increase the effectiveness. The government is amending the Trade Practices Act to allow the prescription of a code or relevant provisions of a code as either mandatory or voluntary. A code of conduct enforcement unit will be established in the ACCC to enforce prescribed codes and to provide information on the operation of codes. This unit will be responsible for administration of the codes, providing advice on the codes and taking enforcement action. The codes will also be enforceable by private action under the Trade Practices Act. Codes will be subject to ongoing and searching evaluation. All regulations under certain circumstances will have a mandatory five-year sunset. In the case of the franchising code of practice, for example, the government response to the fair trading inquiry will include review after three years. The federal government recognises that there is an unacceptable degree of undesirable conduct in the retail tenancy sector. The imbalance of power in tenancy relationships often gives rise to harsh outcomes for small firms. There is a disparity in the levels of protection for small tenants between, and in some cases within, state and territory jurisdictions. There is support for a new approach in this area and for the first time in over a decade we have retailers, landlords, and state, territory and federal governments all willing to work together to build a strong regulatory regime that protects legitimate interests. The federal government will support and encourage the development of further key principles that will provide additional minimum standards for retail tenancy legislation. The government intends that a new franchising code of practice will be prescribed as a mandatory code under the Trade Practices Act, making it binding on all franchisors. An industry advisory body, the Franchising Policy Council, will be established to monitor and review the franchising code of practice and provide advice to the government on trends within the industry. The first task of the FPC will be to conduct a public review of the existing franchising code of practice with a view to strengthening its provisions, including disclosure provisions and alternative dispute resolutions. A dispute resolution adviser will be appointed to assist franchise parties to avoid disputes and to quickly resolve disputes that arise. The government will immediately appoint two small business associate commissioners dedicated to small business issues. At the next vacancy, a full-time small business commissioner will be appointed. The ACCC will employ a small business case officer in each state and territory to act as a liaison point between the ACCC and the small business community. The government will promote the inclusion of alternative dispute resolution systems in codes and make available better information on ADR for small business. The objective is to reduce the costs and time of litigation. The government supports the banking sector extending voluntary codes of practice and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to include incorporated small businesses. A reexamination of the interest rate premiums charged on all small business loans will occur. The government will support the extension of the industry operated banking ombudsman scheme, the banking code of practice and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to small business. All these measures go a long way in actively addressing the concerns and difficulties experienced by small business in the day-today operations of their work. Every electorate in Australia has examples of the kinds of problems identified in the Reid report. What has been identified is extreme. behaviour, and the consequences, by all players in this game. In over 200 submissions from business groups, individuals and over 50 organisations the evidence was clear and consistent. The disadvantage that small business experiences daily in going about its business in terms of market power, pricing policies and access to justice needs to be resolved. The changes to be implemented by this government affirm its belief that the problems suffered by small business can be overcome and resolved by fair and appropriate legislation. I commend this bill to the House.",34
11,Mr HARDGRAVE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 certainly provides this place and all of Australia with one of the great contrasts with the previous government. The actions of this government in taking this bill through this House and the other place without any amendments being passed will send a very strong signal to the small business sector that there is now a government in this country which not only listens but also acts on their concerns. We have a contrast with the previous government, which had a big government, big union, big business bent. Now we have a government which recognises, quite rightly, that small business is definitely the engine room of our economy. After all, it accounts for over 90 per cent of all businesses in this country and for 46 per cent of the business work force. In fact, in 1995-96 small business accounted for 65 per cent of new job creation. In my electorate of Moreton there is plenty of evidence to be seen that confidence is returning to the small business sector. It is showing the lead in the creation of new jobs, giving opportunities to younger Australians and also older Australians who have been out of the work force for some time. It is quite right that government, especially at the federal level, should support small business-the mums, the dads and the individuals who are prepared to put absolutely everything on the line to give it a go, to try to achieve something for themselves and, in the process, for their community and for their country. Success of the individual does transfer down the line. We find plenty of examples where successful small business operators want to expand their business and the first thing they do is hire more people. So at the heart of this legislation today is the government's ongoing commitment to the creation of real jobs-not mickey mouse jobs, not jobs - hat are all about hiding people off the unemployment list-by giving a strong signal to the small business sector that we are fair dinkum about their concerns and want to address those concerns in the way in which we are doing through this bill. I see the Labor Party have proposed a number of amendments-the typical sort of stunt that we expect from the previous government, the sort of thing they want us to discuss rather than talk about their record. Here we have an opposition proposing amendments that suggest that the government's response to the report Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia of the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology-the so-called Reid report-is not adequate. The response is certainly about a million miles more than they ever did: 27 inquiries in 13 years-zip results, absolutely nothing. In fact, this bill also shows very clearly that in the battle, big business versus small business, the Howard government is very clearly on the side of small business. We have in the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) a minister who has a can-do reputation, a reputation for getting on with the sensible jobs that have to be done, and this bill certainly spells that out very clearly. I have to say that people in small business in my electorate want that certainty, and for the past 18 months they have slowly but surely been gaining a greater deal of certainty than they had before. I have looked back over some notes and I know that small business operators in the electorate of Moreton were feeling very down in the mouth 18 months ago. They had been promised so many starts by the previous government and got nothing; they were shown absolutely nothing as a result of all the promises of the previous government. Is it any wonder that, while they were full of great expectations from the election of the Howard government, they were still waiting to see some tangible signs? The passing of this legislation today will be the beacon on the hill for so many people in small business. Let us look at some of the major benefits that this government has brought in for the small business sector. The changes to the Trade Practices Act, which are before us today, will prohibit unconscionable conduct. They will stop, in particular, landlords screwing into the ground the aspirations of small business operators. They will prevent a situation where landlords essentially say, 'There are plenty more in the queue. If particular small business operators can't keep up with our changing terms and conditions, that is okay. We don't mind if they collapse and they lose all of their possessions, their house or whatever. We don't mind. That is their problem. It is not ours. We'll put extra strong conditions on the leases despite what our previous agreements have been. So what if there is a cost to society of a bankruptcy? So what if there is a cost of a family destroyed and their aspirations dashed? So what if jobs aren't being created as a result of these aspirations being dashed? That's okay. We'll find somebody else who will come on and be mug enough to put their house on the line and go into small business.' Those sorts of practices are going to stop as a result of the legislation before us today. We are offering new protection for small business franchisees through a mandatory and stronger franchising code of conduct and oil code, a safety net 'of minimum legislative standards to protect retail tenants and a stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, including representative legal actions on behalf of small business. We are going to give small businesses a role in the process and a say that they have not had before. This is very good news. I must say that, when one looks at all the various provisions of the bill, it makes one feel pleased to have played a small part in it. Whilst I was not a member of the committee which drafted the report which the minister so quickly responded to, as a private member in this place one of my first actions as the member for Moreton was to start a small business advisory group in my electorate. I have several very good chambers of commerce which operate in my electorate. The current president of the South-West Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, Scott Charlton, and the former president, Peter Janssen, are strong supporters. The former president of the Southside Chamber of Commerce, Geoff Curtis, and the current president, Ted Heslin, are strong supporters of what this government is doing as far as small business reforms are concerned. The Archerfield Airport Chamber of Commerce is also a strong supporter of what this government is doing. They know from their own experiences and from talking to members of their chamber what a failure the previous government was as far as small business was concerned. As in so many things, the Labor Party tested their particular interest in a sector by how much money they threw at the problem. If throwing money at problems solved those problems, then maybe we would not still have half the problems we inherited from the previous government. The Labor Party used the approach: 'We'll give you this money if you tell us this.' In other words, strings were attached to anything the Labor Party did for small business. There was an invasion of a business's privacy; there was a complete disclosure of transactions. All of these things had to be listed on complicated forms which small business had to fill in if they were to get any assistance from government. Small businesses do not need extra money in direct grants from government; small businesses need government out of the way. And that is what this government is all about. It is a major contrast with Labor exposed by this particular bill. One particular example I can offer is the way quality assurance is being used as a means of restricting small business. Quality assurance is very costly for many small businesses to undertake. It is all very well a bureaucracy to impose quality assurance as a means to determine whether or not government departments may purchase something from a small business, but at the end of the day the cost of getting that quality assurance is a cost that many small businesses find difficult to bear. A business would probably be better off measured by whether or not it was capable of providing goods and services rather than whether or not it had the paperwork set out right. That is one of the things that concerns my small business advisory group, the Moreton Electorate Small Business Advisory Group, MESBAG. This group has become very well known throughout the electorate of Moreton. I must praise the honorary secretary, Geoff Wilson, for his role in ensuring that the message is spread far and wide and that the opportunities are there for small businesses in my electorate to play a role in what we have before us today. After the so-called Reid report was tabled in this place,we convened a number of public meetings in our electorate. One on 28 July particularly springs to mind. The member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) came to the electorate of Moreton to address 100 or so small business people from the south side of Brisbane about the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The meeting passed a resolution calling on the government to implement the thrust of the recommendations of the Reid report on small business without delay. You can imagine that when you are challenged by your electorate to make sure that the executive of the government you support gets on with the job the pressure is on you. As a private member in this place, I was very pleased with the response of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. His approach in this matter, the consultation he undertook with people like me and the fact that he listened to our views and our demands that we not delay any longer the implementation of the thrust of the recommendations of the Reid report was appreciated. What we have before us, in almost world record time, is a bill which essentially captures the aspirations of the Reid report, a bill for which puts out very fairly and squarely some straightforward and easy to understand amendments to the Trade Practices Act to ensure small business are given the right signals. I am stiIl amazed at how quickly the minister was able to get all of this together. I think that it proves wrong the assertion we often hear that government moves very slowly. If you contrast the fact that in 13 years of the previous government there were 27 inquiries and nothing happened, is it any wonder that people were awfully cynical about whether anything was actually going to occur as a result of the Reid report? On the day of the luncheon meeting, 28 July, many people in my electorate believed that this would just be another report, like the Schacht report or the Beddall report, that would lie buried under dust, lost forever, sunk without trace. That was the previous government's style. Why wouldn't it be the style of this government? So, when small business in my electorate get together and pass a motion demanding action and get it, they are delighted to think that this government is getting on with the job and providing them with the sort of lead that they want. It is very important for all members in this place to note the viability of having a direct consultative link, such as the advisory group that I established, with small business. The Moreton Electorate Small Business Advisory Group meets every six to eight weeks. They give me some pretty blunt feedback from time to time, feedback which I pass on in blunt fashion to the ministers responsible. Those ministers to their great credit offer me answers to the concerns expressed by small business in my electorate. A couple of those concerns and issues that were raised last year and earlier this year included the abuse of market power by large businesses. Guess what? We are doing something about it in this bill. They were very concerned that, for instance, the Democrats and the minor parties .in the Senate were going to delay the passing of the industrial relations legislation. Small business will not accept excuses from the government about these sorts of things. Well, the government got on with that and we are getting on with other amendments that will make life easier for small business operators. They were also very concerned about the way that monopolies, particularly government based monopolies such as the Queensland Electricity Board, treat small business customers from time to time. Those sorts of matters are also dealt with in this bill. One of the main things they were very concerned about was confidence. They want the government to act. They want to know that there is a lead there for them to follow. More importantly, they do not need comments from those opposite who are putting down the economy, putting down the efforts of the government and trying to talk Australia down. We all need in each of our electorates a small business sector willing to invest in itself, willing to show up-not begrudgingly but enthusiastically-every day to encourage more customers through the door. Customers themselves need some sort of certainty and confidence before they go and spend. This government, through its actions, not just in this bill but in other pieces of legislaa tion, has provided the signs and the signals and the policy responses to ensure that people should feel confident about investing in themselves. Be it superannuation, be it lower interest rates, be it lower inflation, there are many good signals in our communities now. The good news is that we are starting to see signs of a very strong recovery across Australia. I must admit that in south-east Queensland it has probably been toughest of all, but in recent months again there is bright light shining on the horizon. I find, from keeping in constant touch with small business operators, that people are starting to hire. I remember that back in August one chap said to me, 'I do not know what has happened, but people are starting to come in, people are starting to spend money.' Five weeks later he rang me and said, 'You know that trend of people spending more money? It has continued, and I have just hired another staff memb-r.' He had three people on his books and now he has four. That is a massive percentage increase in employment numbers. If that were to be repeated across Australia, there would be no unemployment. That is why small business is vital, and that is why this government has acted. We have had a two-pronged approach to running Australia. Before the election we talked about it. One was to encourage and nurture the role of the family, whatever form that takes. The other one was to inspire a small business led recovery of our ailing economy. This government had kept faith with both of those tenets, both of those basic approaches to running this country. What is good is that we are now starting to see small business in this country respond to the leads we have offered and respond to the encouragement that we have given and are giving as a result of this legislation today.· I am pleased to think that the cabinet, in view of all the pressures which can be brought to bear on the deliberations and all the considerations that cabinet have to soak up before they make decisions on matters, chose sides on the battle of small business versus big business. They say very clearly to those at the bigger end of town that those little blokes need to be encouraged-the mums, the dads, the individuals who give it go, who are willing to put it all on the line to construct a business operation-to not only involve themselves and provide themselves with personal viability but also time hire others and put other people who are currently out of work into jobs. I think it is great that the cabinet have taken the side of small business, because it is a vital side to take. In my own electorate, we now have a further challenge ahead of us, and it is in keeping with provisions of the New deal: fair deal announcement from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, a month or so ago. That is the convening of a business incubator; an incubator that is all about businesses helping other businesses helping other businesses-everybody working together. One thing that is for certain is that businesses often fail as a result of education, as a result of poor understanding of their circumstances and obligations or as a result of poor information or uncertain access to information. These are all matters contained within this bill. The business incubator concept being spearheaded by Peter Weightman and by Geoff Wilson in the Mount Gravatt Central area, which in fact fonns the border between my electorate and that of the honourable member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), will give a strong lead to small businesses in my area and will give them strong assistance. We can do something as a practical local measure encompassing the provisions of this bill and encompassing the provisions of other legislative means this government has brought forward to this place to ensure that small businesses are not just created and then die some months later, with all the personal losses that result. If we can give small businesses the wherewithal, the encouragement, the backup, the facilities, the supporthowever you wish to describe it-then I think we are going to do something strong about stopping small business failure before it happens. This bill certainly does deal with the preventive side of small business failure, and that is one of the many reasons why it should be supported today. I must say in closing that I was pleased to have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), visit my electorate recently to talk to small business people about just these matters. I know, from what the member for Mitchell has said to me since, that he was greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm that small business operators, the chamber of commerce and my small business advisory group in the Moreton electorate are showing. That great enthusiasm is backed up by the fact that they know they have a government in Canberra that is tuned into them, that has mechanisms in place to listen and legislation to prove that they have listened. I should also thank the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, who also poor visited my electorate the other week to talk directly to small business people. Some of them are very impressive operators. Some of them have dozens of people on their books and tum over millions of dollars a year. Others are simply mums and dads who are sustaining themselves and their families and maybe one or two others. I hope that early next year we get the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, into the electorate to see how his department can marry into this business incubator concept, which I think will take the spirit of the bill which is before us today and actually apply it in a practical, local way. For so many reasons the bill we have before us today is the beacon on the hill that small business has wanted. It is yet another positive sign from this government that we are fair dinkum about small business and we are fair dinkum about the creation of real jobs in this country. I commend the bill to the House.",36
12,Mr MCGAURAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Like all other government members, it is with a great deal of personal and collective pride that I stand to make a contribution to the debate on the bill before the House, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. It has been a long time coming and it confers a great deal of credit on all those who played a part in ensuring it has been presented to the parliament in the fonn that it is in. I should make the point that there is a stark contrast in tenns of numbers between the contributors to the debate from the government side and those from the opposition side. You have, over the several days of debate on this legislation, but a handful of Labor Party members contributing but dozens of government members contributing to this very important debate. It is a bill which sets a new framework for security and fair trading for small business into the future. It would be a sense of shame that deters many members of the opposition from participating in the debate, given that over their l3 years in government there were, believe it or not, some 17 reports on fair trading, with nothing to show for them. As we have so often interpreted from the opposition's policy bleatings, everything was going to be done in their 14th year in power. The budget deficit was to be eradicated. New legislation ensuring fair trading was to be brought about. Every time we ask a question as to why they never acted at any time during their 13 years in government in regard to one aspect of government administration or another, we are told, 'It was on the agenda.' It was never on the agenda that small businesses be given powers under the Trade Practices Act against the predatory behaviour of larger businesses. It took a Liberal-National Party government to bring about, very quickly, introduction of legislation of this kind. After all, but weeks after coming into government we established, in May 1996, the fair trading inquiry under the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It delivered its report 12 months later in May 1997, and now, in early December you have legislation before the House. Normally a government delays its response to parliamentary reports on controversial, difficult or complex areas of policy for a year or longer. Within a few months we have responded, drafted legislation and introduced it into the parliament. I should say that it is well acknowledged around the parliament that the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), deserves great credit for the role he played in conjunction with his colleagues on that committee. It was a very balanced and creditable report that was handed down and one upon which the government could act. The member for Bendigo did not regard his responsibilities as ending with the delivery of the report. Instead, he followed it through the various processes of government decision making so that, when the cabinet finally decided the matter to bring forward to the joint parties of the government, the member for Bendigo had been very intimately involved. Indeed, it is true to say that there are very few of us who have an opportunity to stamp a major area of government administration or policy as the member for Bendigo has this one. Also those on the committee with him can share in the deep satisfaction of having radically changed the law for the better. It was not, though, as if the government were waiting for the delivery of this report to act on its pre-election commitments to small business. Rather, on coming into government in March 1996, we hit the ground running, to the benefit of small business. Above all else, small business tells me that the five cuts in interest rates over the last 20 months have been of enormous benefit to them. Most small businesses have heavy borrowings-so much so that, for a $100,000 loan, the interest rate cuts will put $2,000 into the pocket of a small business person by way of interest savings. That is very significant. Interest rates are the lowest since the early 1970s. We did not just stop there, though. The purpose of reducing the government deficit to the point where we will be in surplus next financial year was to benefit homebuyers, individuals taking out personal loans, small businesses, farmers, big businesses, whatever. Small businesses have benefited enormously. We also did a great deal more. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a major statement on small business in March this year, we were able to announce a whole range of measures, particularly in regard to cutting red tape. We delivered in concrete terms. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics paperwork has been cut by 20 per cent for small business, with simpler forms to fill out. The tax office is reducing the paperwork burden on small business, and this is going to be done in conjunction and consultation with accounting bodies and small business groups, so as to make sure that those reforms are practical and based on the needs of small businesses themselves. The tax office has already delivered in this regard, although there is still a fair way to go. Those 300 small businesses that have an annual withholding obligation of $25,000 or less under the pay-as-you-earn system, prescribed payments and reportable payments systems will have the choice to remit these payments on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. By July next year, a single registration process will be in place for the initial registraSenate. tion requirements of the tax office, the Australian Securities Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. That is terribly important because it is not just the expense that is lumped onto small business in satisfying the statutory or regulatory requirements of government but the time that they simply do not have. What time is made available almost invariably eats into a small business person's personal time over weekends or late at night. That is what drives us-an easing of the cost and time burdens of complying with government regulations. The tax office goes further. Small businesses can now make voluntary tax payments at any time by using the payment in advance system, which is going to help the cash flow management. The number of tax compliance statements are going to be reduced, creating, for instance, a single form for all indirect tax obligations. Under us, small companies and small instalment taxpayers will have more time to lodge their returns and pay liabilities. We have done even more. Again before the handing down of the fair trading report in May 1997, we cut fringe benefits tax. As of 1 April 1997 fringe benefits tax was made fairer. Taxi fares and employee car parking provided by small businesses on their premises were both exempted. Small businesses which had less than $5,000 in taxable fringe benefits in the previous year can now pay the same tax in the following year, without having to keep any records. We cut capital gains tax, a major reform which is of enormous benefit to small businesses and to farmers. Under us small businesses are able to gain relief from capital gains tax when they sell a business to buy another business. Up to $500,000 from the sale of a business to fund retirement will be exempt from capital gains tax. We reformed Labor's unfair dismissal law, which was an enormous disincentive to small business employing people. We would have gone even further by giving all small businesses employing fewer than 15 people a total exemption, but it was blocked by Labor in the May they be held accountable for that discriminatory act against small business. Many on their own side have acknowledged that Labor's unfair dismissal law was a disincentive to employment, so we acted on that. We have also ensured that there are fairer procedures to obtain government business, because we do not want small and medium sized businesses discriminated against when they tender for government contracts. We are developing procedures that are not too complex or that unfairly benefit big business with all of their inherent resources to gain an unfair advantage in tendering. We are committed to contracting out many government services to the private sector, which obviously provides extra opportunities for small business. We have also looked at reforms for small business finance. We have changed the prudential requirements to let banks invest five per cent of their core capital in small to medium sized businesses. There are also exemptions to fundraising provisions of the Corporations Law to help small business raise capital. We are committed-almost maniacally so---to small business and believe that you must provide incentive and give reward to those who put their capital and the security of their families on the line. These are people who take a risk, and the community at large benefits because they employ people and pay tax. It is, after all, principally small business which will be the solution to the unemployment problem in this country. Turning to the specific legislation before the House, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of codes of practice and, more specifically, on the oil code. Under the legislation, there is a new provision which allows industry designed codes of practice, in whole or in part, to be legally underpinned and to be made mandatory under the Trade Practices Act and enforced, in the event of a breach, as a breach of the act itself. This new reform provides small business with dual advantages: the benefit of participating in the design and formation of industry regulations addressing unfair conduct and the security of knowing that mandated codes or provisions of codes can be directly enforced under the Trade Practices Act. The government remains committed to codes of conduct and industry developed regulation, but where voluntary codes failed and there was continuing unfair behaviour we believed it necessary to give legal recognition to a code. Therefore, the Trade Practices Act will now allow prescription of industry and consumer developed codes of practice as mandatory codes or voluntary codes with enforceable provisions. These new codes will remain flexible, efficient and appropriately designed regulations so as to meet the changes that occur in any industry sector. Breach of a prescribed code will give complainants access to the remedies and sanctions contained in the Trade Practices Act without-it is important that I stress this-the need to prove a breach of another section of the act. Small business will then have the capacity to influence the substance of industry regulation by participation in code development as well as the security of the legal recognition of those codes. This is very important in regard to the oil code, the dispute resolution mechanism previously entered into voluntarily by participants in the oil industry, companies, the petrol distributors association and the Service Station Association under the banner of the MTAA, the Motor Trades Association of Australia. Unfortunately, the oil code has had deficiencies in the past and did not enjoy the full confidence of all of the participants; so much so that it has not been operating since the middle of last year. However, given the new security and fairness inherent in the government's Trade Practices Act reforms, the parties are now coming together again with the aid of a facilitator to draft a strengthened oil code. As announced by the government, should a facilitator be unable to complete the task, or where there are still outstanding matters not agreed upon or resolved, an arbitrator will be appointed. It is very important that the oil code be completed as expeditiously as possible because there are enormous changes under way in the petrol industry. It is commonly agreed that of the 9,000 service stations, several thousand-I have heard the figure 3,000 but I have also heard the figure 5,000-must exit the industry so that the remaining service stations can attract a higher volume and therefore a greater profit margin, which will allow the passing o- of lower petrol prices to consumers. That necessarily involves a fair bit of pain for a great many individuals and family businesses, and it has to be handled sensitively and with full regard to the rapidly changing nature of the industry. That is why the oil code, which introduces a legislated fairness, comes into play. Given the goodwill and openness that the parties are pledging themselves to, I believe that oil code can be completed satisfactorily, and it is very important that it is. I believe that the parties to the oil code should have the confidence to rely on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to administer and enforce the new system for prescribed codes, given that a code of conduct enforcement unit will be created within the ACCC. So it is not as if the government is leaving anything to chance; quite the opposite. We believe that any prescribed code needs that enforcement namely, the oil capability. In drawing to a conclusion, I would again like to congratulate the large numbers of government members who have been involved in bringing us to this point. I have already spoken of the chairman of the industry committee of the parliament, the member for Bendigo, and his colleagues on that committee. Also, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) deserves our thanks and congratulations. He was assisted in that task by his predecessor, the  Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, who laid the groundwork for a very successful resolution of this whole issue of fair trading. I am proud to have been part of a government that has introduced such landmark legislation for the benefit of small business. It follows a line of reforms that we have undertaken since coming to government which have flowed on to small business. Whether you are a medium sized small business or whether you are a micro-small business operating only with family members, in one way or another the government's actions over the last 20 months have significantly boosted your business. Not that there is always a guarantee that all small businesses can succeed or flourish. We know that the marketplace is the final arbitrator or determinant of a small business's survivability. But what we can do as a government is to lower the taxation, minimise the paperwork and offer protection against unfair conduct by larger companies or suppliers. We are delivering on those very important prerequisites to small business operating in an environment that is open and profitable.",40
13,Mr GEORGIOU,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is a simple fact that small business is the backbone of the Australian economy and a vital generator of economic growth. Small business employs around 3.5 million people, 45 per cent of Australia's work force, and its success is imperative to Australia's economic future. The Howard government was elected on a platform of providing real assistance to small business, reversing the years of neglect by Labor and stimulating growth in employment in the sector. The government's efforts are fundamentally focused on getting the economic fundamentals right, bringing interest rates down, providing direct assistance through capital gains tax relief and reducing the paperwork and compliance burden. We have made advances, but more needs to be done to revitalise the small business sector. One of small business's major areas of concern for many years has been the issue of unfair business conduct, particularly by big business towards small business. Through its New deal: fair deal package for small business, which was released at the end of September, the government is tackling this problem head on, replacing the interminable procrastination so characteristic of Labor's term in office with a realistic and positive program of action. The government's fair trading package was developed in response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. I join other members in complimenting the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) on the superb job he did in this report. The report was commissioned by the government as one of its first acts, and as a first step towards delivering on our election commitments to address a range of business conduct issues of concern to small business. After a detailed investigation by the committee, the report concluded the concern about unfair business conduct towards small business not only was justified but has the potential to impact heavily on the health of the small business sector and on the Australian economy and society more generally. The government's New deal: fair deal package is designed to address these problems through a range of important measures, some of which are dealt with in the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, currently before the House. I do think it is worth stressing that the proposals for reform contained in this bill make up only part of a much broader package of reform which is, of itself, only part of the coalition's platform of assistance for small business. This is a fact which the opposition, in seeking to diminish the significance of the bill, seems determined to overlook. The bill is about correcting a fairly clear-cut example of market failure, about dealing with a situation where the free market delivers a sub-optimal outcome. In the economic utopia beloved by economists, under conditions of perfect competition, all players in the market have full and equal knowledge of market conditions, they all fully understand the terms and conditions of a contract and its implications, they can readily assess the benefits to them of any contract they enter into, they are aware of the full run of prices in the market and they know what alternatives are available to any individual contract. It is, of course, a fact that the Australian marketplace does not resemble the economist's utopia. Its economic actors are individuals and businesses with limited capacities and limited knowledge. Moreover, it is in the very nature of these things that the limits experienced by some, particularly smaller economic actors, are much greater than the limits experienced by others, particularly larger ones. The result, identified so starkly by the fair trading report, is a market in which small firms frequently experience difficulty in their dealings with more powerful firms, including: having little or no ability to negotiate terms of the contract (often pro-forma ... contracts are used) inadequate disclosure of relevant and important commercial information which the weaker party should be aware of before entering the transaction inadequate and unclear disclosure of important terms of the contract particularly those which are weighted against the weaker party. This can occur through: · the technical wording of the document · the theatre of the negotiations whereby the small business person is under-represented, lacks the legal fire power brought to the table by the other party, and is discouraged (or not given the opportunity) to consider the details of the contract; and · the fact that the terms which can operate against the interests of the weaker party are not brought to the attention of that party, or their full import spelt out ... · when smaller parties have committed themselves to a long term relationship ego through a lease or franchise, the dominant parties seek to vary the nature of the relationship so that it is more favourable to the dominant player and conversely, affects the viability of the weaker party; · when disputes do arise there is often no quick, cheap and market sensitive way of dealing with them and even where they do exist, there is a reluctance by small business to access any remedial action through fear of reprisal. The economic and social costs of these difficulties in terms of business failure, lost employment, wasted resources, stress, marriage breakdown and poor health are beyond accurate measurement; but they are certainly SUb-optimal. In response to these very real and very serious problems, the government is seeking to make changes to the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide greater protection to small business against unfair business conduct. Specifically, the act will be amended to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business transactions and to provide for industry codes of practice to be prescribed and enforced. I think it is worthwhile looking at each of these provisions in tum. The notion of unconscionable conduct is not a new one. Indeed, it has a long history as an important element of common law doctrines of equity. In the Australian context, through judgments such as Blomley V. Ryan and the Commercial Bank of Australia v. Amadio, it has come to be applied to situations where one party to a contract has a special disadvantage, the other party knows or ought to know of that special disadvantage and the stronger party takes advantage of the weaker party's special disadvantage. The meaning of special disadvantage has in tum been interpreted as including, amongst other things, circumstances as diverse as poverty, sickness, age, lack of education, infirmity, illiteracy and drunkenness. The fact is that, while such a doctrine may appear very broad in its potential application, it is in fact quite limited and deals only with the process by which a contract is negotiated, is not not with the substance of any contract actually entered into. The result has been that common law unconscionability has been difficult to establish, particularly in the context of commercial transactions. Over time, parliaments at both state and federal levels have legislatively codified and extended doctrines dealing with unconscionable conduct, made available legislatively specified remedies for affected parties and provided for government bodies to take on representative actions. At the federal level, the first step in this process was the inclusion in the Trade Practices Act in 1986 of significantly broader unconscionable conduct provisions for the protection of consumers. These new provisions prohibited unconscionable conduct and outlined, but did not limit, the range of considerations which could be taken into account by a court when considering whether a transaction between a corporation and a consumer was unconscionable. Under the provisions, in determining unconscionability a court was now enabled to take into account a variety of factors, including the relative bargaining positions of the corporation and the consumer, whether conditions which the consumer was required to comply with were necessary, whether the consumer was able to understand any documents relating to the deal, whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on the consumer, and the amount for which and the circumstances under which the consumer could have acquired identical goods elsewhere. The second step in the process of codifying and extending the common law doctrine of unconscionability into Commonwealth law came in 1992 with the attempt to build into the Trade Practices Act, as well as specific consumer protections, a general catch-all unconscionability provision applicable to other transactions. This provision granted no more protection in real terms than does the common law. However, it did open up the possibility of seeking, in circumstances where unconscionable conduct was established, the remedies prescribed in the Trade Practices Act. Further, it enabled the then Trade Practices Commission-now the ACCC-to take representative actions on behalf of business, which until this time had no option but to pursue cases of unconscionable conduct through the legal system themselves. This latter aspect of the reform was particularly important to business, given the relative disparity between their ability to litigate and that of the larger corporations against which they would be front. likely to mount an action claiming unconscionable conduct. While this move was probably well intensumer tioned, the provision was never really likely to provide the kind of protection from unfair business conduct that businesses, particularly small business, were seeking. As one expert commentator noted at the time: Small business can take little comfort from introduction of the new s.51AA of the Trade Practices Act . . . . s. 51AA may afford the basis for relief provided the facts are such as to constitute the equitable doctrine of unconscionability. If this is the case there may be scope for the Commission to intervene, . but while ever ""special disability"" and ""special disadvantage"" are seen as factors likely to arise only in extraordinary circumstances . then the new Part has added little. Such criticism should not really have surprised the then Labor government, as its own committee of inquiry-the Beddall committee-had recommended in 1990: Provisions of the Trade Practices Act concerning unconscionable conduct which currently apply to transactions involving consumers be extended to include small business transactions including retail/commercial tenancy agreements, where small business is disadvantaged in the same way as a consumer in its dealings with other parties. Just as the Labor Party should not have been surprised by the expert criticisms of their amendments to the Trade Practices Act, they would not really have been surprised by their failure to address the problems to which they were directed. Small business continued to report difficulties in terms of harsh and unconscionable conduct in their business dealings, and the Labor Party satisfied themselves by looking on. Any number of the Labor Party speakers in this debate have tried to show that when in government they were active in the area of providing protection for small business from harsh business conduct. I think it is important to note that activity is no substitute for effecsmall tiveness, and the number and tone of the submissions received by the Reid committee show that they were far from effective on this It is a stark contrast to Labor's half-hearted legislative changes that the coalition government has extended in full the existing conprotection provisions to small business, providing real protection for the sector and ensuring the rules under which they operate are fair and that there will be proper redress available to those when the rules are broken. Moreover, I think it is significantly to the the government's credit that it has managed to effectively and simply limit the application of its new measures to small business conducting normal small business transactions. Anybody who has had any experience with the attempts to generate policies for small business will attest that it is often very difficult to limit application of small business initiatives to small business itself, and the cost implications of a failure to do so can be great. The second function of the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 is to set a framework within the Trade Practices Act for the development of specific industry codes of practice, adherence to which can be made mandatory and compliance with which will be enforceable. Like the doctrine of unconscionability, industry codes are not a new concept. They have been in operation for years, most notably the franchising code of practice. Unfortunately, however, like the doctrine of unconscionability, in their present voluntary and unbinding form they have often failed to provide adequate protection for small business. In relation to the franchising code, which the Reid committee looked at in some detail, the committee was informed by the former chairman of the Franchising Council, Mr Gardini, that the code suffered from a number of serious weaknesses: coverage of the code was approximately 65 per cent; the council was unable to inform the marketplace of those who were removed from the register of compliance; the council was prevented by the code itself from removing franchisors from the register of compliance when they breached the standard of conduct provisions in the code, and section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act did not effectively underpin the same standard of conduct provisions contained in the code. Mr Gardini further informed the committee that a recent survey had shown that some 25 per cent of franchisees were currently in litigation or even major disputation with their franchisees, while 50 per cent of the franchisors surveyed did not have any formal processes for dispute handling and resolution. These sorts of facts are indicative of a system which is not working. Industry self-regulation is a noble objective. When it works properly it can provide for very effective mechanisms for maintaining standards of conduct in an industry. However, when self-regulation leads to substantial nonthe compliance, other avenues do need to be investigated. The Reid committee recommended that the Commonwealth enact specific franchising legislation. The government has elected not to go down this path, but rather to create a framework within the Trade Practices Act whereby industry codes of practice could be made compulsory and compliance with them made mandatory. In my mind this represents a stronger solution even than that recommended by the committee as it provides for a compulsory and binding franchising code and will also enable other industry codes to be incorporated without the need to pass specific legislation some time in the future. Further, because it will involve various industries in the drafting of the codes of practice it will capture many of the benefits of self-regulatory systems, which would be largely lost if legislation had to be enacted each time a code was to be made mandatory. The legislative amendments provided in the bill are important and positive changes which will help to address the problems identified by the Reid committee's fair trading report. As I have already mentioned, however, they are only part-albeit a very important one--of the government's New deal: fair deal package. The package also includes a safety net of minimum legislative standards for protection of retail tenants to be negotiated through state and territory legislation, stronger enforcement by the ACCC of small business fair trading rights, support for alternative dispute resolution to provide small business with quicker, less costly and more efficient remedies than traditional court litigation and support for the extension of the banking industry ombudsman scheme to small business. I believe that this comprehensive package will constitute a landmark for small business. It stands in stark contrast to the inaction and ineffectiveness of the former Labor government. Together with the government's broader economic policies and our reforms aimed at freeing the small business sector from the burden of excessive regulation, it will help to ensure that small business is given a fair go and the confidence to grow and to create jobs. It is good for the small business sector and it is good for Australia. I would like to congratulate the member for Bendigo for his vital part in bringing the package forward and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for acting so speedily in introducing it to the House. I commend the bill to the House.",44
14,Mr MCMULLAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill and, in particular, to the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is handling the issue of small business on behalf the opposition extremely well. We all appreciate the role that he is playing and the activity that he is undertaking. Today, because of the time pressures for other business around the parliament, I want to focus on only one aspect of the current circumstances confronting small business that needs to be addressed. It is not a particularly partisan point. It is not directly related to a criticism of this bill or the amendment. It relates to the legal framework in general and to some matters that we all, as members, need to consider. It arises from issues raised with me, not in my capacity as shadow minister but as member for Canberra, by some local citizens in the ACT community. The background to it is an issue that would be very familiar to anyone who has spoken in this debate. Big companies and governments enter into complex contractual arrangements which tend to have the effect of making it very difficult for small business, for consumers, for individual citizens and for employees to get effective redress for their problems. Often the contracts are entered into for other reasons. It is not always a deliberate contract to make the redress difficult, but it has that practical effect. The particular constituency examples I want to refer to relate to people in their status as employees of these corporations, but it illustrates a wider problem that relates not only to employees but also to small business doing business with the larger corporations and with government and to individual citizens. We have here the case of individuals who have legal rights of redress established in the law denied the opportunity to give effect to those rights by an series of artificial devices and contractual relationships established. The capacity to establish these contracts and devices is not particularly the responsibility of this government, nor are the arrangements necessarily ones that, on their face, have anything wrong with them, but their impact for the citizen, for the employee, for the small business customer of the larger corporation or the government creates the potential for unfair consequences to arise. Ironically, in other debates in this chamber, on which I will not transgress, the particular example I have relates to a problem with unfair dismissal. But it has nothing to do with the complex question of small business exemption or any of those matters about which we have contention in this place and which is the subject of another bill. The circumstance is that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs here in the ACT contracted Telstra to provide telephone reception services. Telstra contracted Western Staff Service to provide the employees to operate that function. What occurred is that Telstra acted in a way, with regard to those employees, that is clearly open to challenge under the unfair dismissal laws, including the unfair dismissal laws of this government. It is not an issue about the nature of the unfair dismissal laws, and I do not prejudge how the commission would have found in the matter if it had properly got before them. But what happened is that these people were denied access to any tribunal to hear their matter-and for all the representations I have made, they are still being denied access to any form of redress. The Industrial Relations Commission has found-and, in my view, correctly foundthat these women, these constituents, are not employees of Telstra, that they are still on the books of Western Staff Service; it is just that they have no work. The work they did for Western Staff Service was conducted on behalf of Telstra. But Telstra said that they no longer wanted those people, for reasons which are challengeable. If Telstra had done it directly, they would clearly have had a case. They may not have won, but that is another issue for another day. But the nature of the contractual arrangements entered into, firstly, by the department but, in this instance, most fundamentally by Telstra, has denied these. people access to the forums of justice in this country. In this instance, as I said, it is not a cism of the law relating to unfair dismissals established by this government-of course, we all know I have some disagreements with that-because this law would have been adequate to deal with their case if they had got access, but the contractual arrangement denies them access. I have tried, behind the scenes, to get a review, without success. I want to say here today that Telstra should review this case and the case of these two women and they shO.uld look at their practices overall in this regard. What I want to draw to the attention of the House is the way in which these sorts of arrangements-and they are not unique to that department or to Telstra-can undermine the capacity of individuals to have fair access to their legal rights. You might argue that the government has undermined its capacity to resolve this matter because, with its one-third sale of Telstra, it no longer has the same capacity to deal with employee type circumstances in the way it once did. But, whatever you say about that, Telstra now has certain obligations to minority shareholders that constrain its capacity to act in some of these matters. But Telstra still has its civic responsibility as a corporation-and it has people who I know are honourable people as senior executives, including the chief executive, Frank Blountand I want to ask them to look at this matter and to consider their civic responsibilities as a corporation to these two individuals and overall. It is important also that the government look overall at the potential for these overlapping contractual arrangements to create problems for not only employees and citizens but also small business. The Ombudsman has raised a not dissimilar matter in her concern with regard to contracting out and accountability and its impact on citizens and small business entering into those contracts. There are a range of issues here; many of them go to questions of fair trading and trade practices but they go to other matters as well. As I have said, I have sought to resolve this matter outside the parliament, without success. Therefore, I raise it here today in the critihope that this debate will be a catalyst to Telstra and others to act in the way that reasonably they should in resolving this important question.",48
15,Mr BOB BALDWIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, which will amend the 1974 Trade Practices Act to allow for industry codes of practice to be prescribed and enforced to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain small business transactions. We have heard plenty of rhetoric in this place over the years about the problems of small business and of the bid by governments to support small businesses-and not to be too disparaging about it, that is a good thing. As a former small businessman myself, let me say that it is encouraging to know that politicians from all sides of the fence are showing realistic concern about this sector's performance. After all, they express realistic knowledge that nine out of 10 new jobs in Australia are now generated by small business. We have to face the fact that the former Hawke and Keating governments had at times an appalling track record when it came to their support for small businesses. Members on the other side from the Labor Party are attempting to skip, trip and stumble to try to hide the fact that their 17 inquiries into fair trading and unfair business practices against small business-yes, 17 inquiries in 13 years-flowed under the bridge without legislative action. That is a fact verified very well by people such as the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) on many occasions both within this House and during the debate generally over fair trading matters. Of course, it was the member for Bendigo who provided the excellent chairmanship for the report entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Being a member of that inquiry myself, I must reflect for a moment on another member of that inquiry, the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), and some of his direct commentary on this bill and in the Hunter media. The member for Newcastle seems to have taken a real shine to me in the House recently, presumably in an effort to keep me on my toes. But for him to have the hide to try to point the bone over small business policy and the strategic direction of this government in dealing with the affairs of small business takes a lot of cheek. Clearly, he needs something of a reality check, when instead he should be showing real concern and giving a voice to many small businesses and enterprises. Let us not forget the many small businesses that struggled throughout the greater Hunter for a lion's share of the 1980s and then had to cope with the recession we apparently had to have in the early 1990s. In that time in the Hunter a few things happened to enterprise. The member for Newcastle did not kick and scream hard enough against the government of the day to try to nut out a better deal-a better series of outcomes for businesses and jobs. He was not alone. The members for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), Charlton (Mr Robert  of recent times, the former member for Paterson, all stood in silence while the last post was played for those who were buried under the burden of red tape, high interest rates, unfair dismissal claims, high inflation and a lack of political leadership in the Hunter. These members stood by the graveside of small and medium businesses and watched without a word. Their silence was not just restricted to smallto medium-sized businesses; there was a stone wall of silence when BHP reduced its numbers from over 13,000 to under 3,000. This very action was in part responsible for the Hunter having a three to four per cent higher unemployment figure than the New South Wales or national average, something I am sure they are very proud of! I also point out to this House the following: the state dockyards shutdown; the collapse of Carrington Slipways; textile manufacturers Rundles all but hit the wall, as many other textile companies did; we lost any hope of getting the frigates; and new exciting industries such as defence industry and tourism did not meet the opportunities that are now being presented. All of this occurred despite the presence of the member for Newcastle doing his apparent bit for enterprise in the seat of Newcastle-not to forget his cohorts. The Hunter has suffered both physically within the region, and perhaps just as poignant in the eyes of the rest of Australia is that enterprise, large and small, was not the goer in the Hunter that it could be in many other places. That is not entirely true, of course; many good private and public infrastructure projects have been fostered, as has development, when not hampered at times by the ludicrous decisions by some local government authorities. I must say that Newcastle Council comes quickly to mind. Add to that scenario the record commercial interest rates-as high as 24 per cent at their peak; the introduction of capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax legislation, directly affecting small businesses; unfair levels for the provisional tax uplift factor; reaffirmation of the anachronistic 19th century style industrial relations laws and the unfair dismissals provided therein; the implementation of the incredulous unfair dismissals legislation, which was about as anti-small business in its intent as you can get; and, of course, no substantive fair trading reform relief-and we can see that small business has had it particularly tough in the Hunter, perhaps more so than in many other regions around Australia. Things had to change. Delivering a new deal-a fair deal-on fair trading is but one part of the government's greater plan for small business, which includes: delivering substantive capital gains tax rollover relief, major reform on the industrial relations front, a bid to have Commonwealth red tape on business inside its first term in office, new flexible arrangements and big cash incentives to take on apprentices, and sustaining rock bottom low interest rates. Fair trading law reform has become an increasingly important issue for local retail traders across the Hunter. The demand has come-following the string of inquiries of the former Labor government and the excellent expose provided by the Finding a balance report-from local retail traders that they want action now, not later. Just the other day on local Hunter radio, Hunter Small Business Persons spokesman, Graham Henderson, put it all in perspective. He did not want the Senate or, more to the point, the Labor Party, Greens and Democrats to open up on this bill, to put through amendment after amendment or, more critically, send it off to a committee with the only intention of stopping this legislation passing before the next election. I would also like take this opportunity to extend my congratulaup tions to Graham Henderson on being elected as the president of the Service Stations AssoLaborParty ciation. He has been a tireless worker not for service stations but also for small business in general. It appears that the Hunter Small Business Persons group simply wanted the government to be able to meet their electoral commitment to address the issue of fair trading-and they want it addressed now. Clearly, what they do not want is to revisit the lack of action of the Labor government over the past 13 years. After speaking last week and again today Hunter Small Business Persons Hunter Presitation dent, Peter Frost, he too expressed concern that the bill would not get through. However, in today's Newcastle Herald apparently the government and the Minister for Workfostering place Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) are 'going to jelly over fair trading reforms' and 'we need someone who will stand up for the multinationals'. The member for Newcastle's rent a quote for the article was a 'weak at the knees' approach. I just not cop that. On 30 September this year the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business spoke introduced the crux of the government's intentions towards genuine Commonwealth One trading reform with the proposed insertion of ness a new section 51AC in part 4A of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The bill utilises concept of unconscionable conduct and includes a set of criteria to assist the court determining when unconscionable conduct is present in a commercial transaction. The provision is essentially confined to dealings involving small businesses, and listed public companies are excluded from this new proposed section 51AC. The provision is also limited to transactions which do not exceed $1 million, whilst an industry code will become vogue. Effectively, a breach in the industry code is a matter which may give rise to a finding of unconscionable conduct. Further reforms in the fair trading package to are codes of conduct to offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice, with, amongst other things, to a code of conduct enforcement unit to be set in the ACCC; and a retail tenancies safety net, which is, despite the protestations of the and Democrats, a solid, constitujust tionally upstanding Commonwealth measure to get the federal government to work with the states to achieve national reform of retail tenancy laws, including a stronger legislative safety net, along with support for additional minimum standards for retail tenancy. Further reforms include: franchising refonn which encompasses a new mandatory franchising code of practice binding all franchisors; a new monitoring body-the to Franchising Policy Council; the implemenof a dispute resolution adviser to assist franchise parties to avoid and resolve disputes between franchisors and franchisees more now quickly and cheaply; and developing and support amongst the banks to adopt better methods of risk assessment when lending for small business, along with better public education and information packages to assist small businesses. Small businesses want a fair go, a new deal on fair trading. Unquesdo tionably, swift passage of this bill will improve their case. When the member for Bendigo, Mr Reid, on this bill earlier this week he said: thing about this inquiry was that small busidid not ask the fair trading inquiry for protection. What they wanted was a fair go and a fair deal and what they have received from the govern the ment is a new deal and a fair deal. in I have to agree with that. The evidence is there for the need for these reforms to definitely shake up the foundations, despite the protestations of sectors of the opposition or even the business lobbyists. I refer to the area of the new arrangements for service station operators. I will reflect in a moment on the shocking case of Ned and Pauline Cox, owners of the Caltex service station at Rutherford. I was informed this morning that petrol companies are pushing franchisees out of service stations before 1 July so that the new acts cannot take effect. Ned and Pauline have been at the Rutherford Caltex for over 20 years. Their franchise is renewed on the basis of a three-year lease option at $50,000 for the last franchise fee. You do not make a lot of money out of petrol stations. Indeed, they quoted that the average rate of return-a good rate of return-was 2.9c per litre. They have built up the business. The wages in that business have tripled in the last eight years. They would be one of the busiest sites in the Maitland area. They sell around 350,000 to 400,000 litres per month. They have been restricted by council in operating hours, from 4.30 in the morning to midnight, but still manage to achieve business success. On 14 November, they received a letter from Australian Petroleum which says: As you are aware, your franchise agreement commencing on 1/9/95 (the 'Agreement') expires on 31/8/98 ... We are writing to advise you that Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd CAmpoI') will not be offering you a fresh franchise agreement subsequent to the Expiry Date which is the date when the total statutory nine year franchise entitlement ... expires, or, in the case of head leased sites where we aren't renewing the head lease, which is the date of expiry of the head lease. To show how committed they are to the people who have sold their product for over 20 years and have built the biggest business in Maitland in petrol sales, there was no personal visitation. This letter just turned up in the mail. It continues: To facilitate the vacation of the premises, after reconciliation of all amounts due or owing, Ampol will at the Expiry Date:1. buy back all underground petroleum products (purchased from Ampol) at the wholesale price on the Expiry Date; 2. buy back all saleable Ampol lubricants at the wholesale price paid by you; 3. trythat is the key wordto put you in contact with a third party who may be interested in purchasing your merchantable shop stock (Ampol will not be purchasing any shop stock); and 4 make a payment of the lesser of $5,000 or one months rent, to assist you in vacating the premises and closing the business. Again we see the heartless action of big business-big business that was never brought to order by the former government, which ignored the situation. These pleas and cries have not occurred only in the last couple of months or the last 18 months since we have come to power; they have been there for years and years. The former government-in particular the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who likes to stand up and beat his hairy chest, which I suppose is dark these days, not grey, about support for small business in his government's term of office-did absolutely nothing. But I suppose they were going to do it next time. As to the 'new deal, fair deal' policies, we hear squawks that the deal is not a tough deal. Prescribing the oil code under the Trade Practices Act means that complainants will have access to remedies and sanctions in the act along with a host of other measures. Something needed to be done. Something will be done. Sitting on the fence and watching the world go by by just producing another report without action is not the style of this government. Again today it was put to me that major shopping centre managers are going through the shopping centres and driving the tenants into signing new lease agreements, making sure they have got everything stitched up before 1 July. Why? So there is no remedy under the new act, if and when it gets final passed-with the assistance of the opposition. Why? Because the reforms will work. Fair trading is but one part of the total plan for small business reform. It is an important issue but not the primary driving issue. In August, the Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey found that the economy, employment, general consumer confidence, taxation reform issues and industrial relations ranked well higher than red tape and bureaucratic measures which could be related to fair trading matters. In their 19 October survey, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants' quarterly small business health index found most small businesses had not suffered at the hands of big business and that unfair conduct was not a major issue with small firms. They are not my words but theirs. That is logical because not all businesses are in big shopping centres. Within the Lower Hunter, 6,500 small businesses-only a minority of businessesare in profile shopping centres. Most retail outlets are along street shop strips and the like. As one member of the Hunter Small Business Persons put it to me-and I think it puts it into perspective: Going into a shopping centre, into a lease arrangement in a shopping precinct, is all about two things. Firstly, it's a business decision. Is the move, or staying in that centre, worth the investment? Secondly, businesses are a livelihood, they are not a location. You have the option to move that operation to a new location. As I said, those are his words, not mine. The issue at the end of the day is a commercial one. Minister Reith is correct to point out that the Labor Party's proposals, when it comes to the regulation of retail tenancies, of using the Corporations Law are unworkable unless small businesses and landlords incorporate. According to independent legal advice from Dennis Rose QC of Blake Dawson Waldron for the Motor Trades Association, if lessors were not incorporated under part of Labor's so-called fair deal on fair trading reform, then these small finns would be open to the Commonwealth imposing higher rates of income tax, let alone land tax from a state level. Small business would effectively be burdened with more red tape and there would be two sets of tenancy laws, one state and the other federal. It would mean two layers of industrial relations law. This is despite the fact that the government is detennined to work with the states for an across-the-board, national approach to retail tenancies. As I said before, constitutionally the measures proposed are the solid and practical way to go. At the end of the day, we do have to be practical. The success of a small business is all about getting more dollars through the cash register and keeping your input costs under control. When I look at this issue I only have to cast my mind back to 5 August and a public debate hosted by the Hunter Small Business People where the respective members of the inquiry addressed Hunter businesses on their desire for a fair go in relation to fair trading. I was there with my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the member for Newcastle, the member for Cunningham, who is Labor's spokesman for small business, and the Democrats' business spokesperson, Senator Andrew Murray. You might call that a star-studded cast, but there was plenty of pUlpit thumping and hairy-chest beating. All took up the fight for a better business deal. Sadly, as I pointed out then, a fair go for small business for Labor and the Democrats does not extend to relief from unfair dismissal provisions. Their fair go for small business did not include a balanced budget that drove down the interest rates. These are things that affect every small business. Senator Murray, the next leader of the Democrats, the member for Newcastle and the member for Cunningham apparently want the fish and chip outlet, the clothes shop in a shopping centre and the fruito next door to a supermarket to get a fair go on fair trading but, it seems, nowhere else in the business community. Those fighting words do not carry through to providing valid relief from unfair dismissal provisions for these very same businesses, supporting them in actually employing people. I would not call that support for Hunter businesses. I would not call getting tangled up in more red tape, adding to the already imposing cost to a small business on average eight hours a week specifically for mandatory government and regulatory paperwork, delivering a fair deal for small business. The Newcastle Herald hasn't got the full story by overdramatising the situation, but we are used to that. We also have a new name for the member for Newcastle. We used to call him the Grim Reaper; we now call him Anti-enterprise Allan, the member for Newcastle. (Time expired)  p.m.)-I support the amendment that has been moved to the legislation now before the House. The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who is a recent arrival in the Hunter, is very good at picking out phrases and words and repeating other people's words. He is very good at pronouncing on the actions of others. I would say to him and to his colleagues that there is one achievement to which they can fully lay claim. Your major contribution to our region has been to savagely decrease federal employment in the area: closure of the immigration office; a reduction of Customs staff; the abolition of the area office of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; the destruction of the Commonwealth Employment Service; a reduction in the number of offices in the Department of Social Security; the closure of the Belmont Commonwealth Employment Service; and the coming closure of the Belmont Medicare office. Honourable member for Paterson, you and your colleagues can truly lay claim to that. That is the sole achievement to which this government can put its signature on in our region. On the other hand",49
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT," . Order! I am failing to see the relevance of member for Shortland's contribution.  er, I am responding to the accusation from the previous speaker, of whom you did not make any criticism when he adverted to the performance of me in the region I represent. Let me just further enlighten the honourable gentleman-if I may dare to use that term in respect of him-that in relation to the airport in which he is so interested, the Newcastle Airport, the only work that was ever done there was by the Whitlam government, until the next Labor government came along. Again, the conservative parties have a steadfast record. Not one dollar have they ever expended on the airport. Similarly, the naval repair work, including the minehunters and ADI, was a Labor government achievement. Who put the first regional Taxation Office, with 750 jobs, in Newcastle-against the wishes of the former Treasurer, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard)? The Labor government. Mr Abbott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am most reluctant to interrupt the member speaking, but we are debating a small business package. It really is not relevant to make all of these accusations about regional policy.",54
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I would encourage the honourable member for Shortland to contain his remarks to the amendment and legislation before the chamber. He has had his opportunity to respond to the member for Paterson. I would now encourage him to address the amendment and legislation.  Deputy Speaker, but I have been responding to accusations made by the previous speaker. I want to say to the previous speaker also that if it is worth crossing the floor on chicken meat, why does he not cross the floor for the small business people of our region? The only reason the current Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) is in the position he is in is that the previous minister for small business steadfastly refused to seriously address the unanimous report of the committee that produced the Finding a balance report on small business. the That is why the current minister is there-not because the government gave priority but because the government steadfastly refused to seriously address the interests and needs of small business. It was only because of pressure from this opposition and from the multitude of small business people around Australia that, ultimately, the first minister for small business under the Howard government resigned and was replaced by the current minister. The current minister is much more astute politically-I do not want him to smile at me while I am saying this to him-and he recognised it is a large part of what they claim is their constituency. They had to show interest in this very serious report. It is an all-party, unanimous report. There are not many reports that come forward on major issues like this. He realised that something had to be done or, rather, that they had to be seen to be doing something. I recognise the astuteness of the minister. He is well able to put together words that seem to convey one meaning but in practice achieve something different altogether. So, in this report, one of the key recommendations is about the uniform national tenancy code. Recommendation 2.2 of the report says: The Committee recommends that the Minister request the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve the uniform retail tenancy code for underpinning the Trade Practices Act 1974 I do not accept for one moment-nor do small business people in this country-the government's alibi for not proceeding with that recommendation. This government is a government that has always been in bed with big businessalways. This government and its coalition predecessors have always been about the big end of town. The growth of change and the decimation of small retailers was a process that was steadfastly ignored by conservatives opposite. For the whole 23 years of government they had one consideration of small government. After many years they got their report and, when they got it, they made sure it never hit the tables of parliament. It was never reported; it was never tabled. Their interest was a perfunctory interest and, again, we see the same kind of thing. What is happening under this government again will see a handful of giant retailers controlling, through discriminatory pricing, the prices that consumers will pay. If you go to Charlestown in my electorate, you will find there a giant retailer which has a totally different set of prices from what that same chain in another part of my electorate hasdepending on what the market will bear. That retailer determines what the consumer pays and what the producer pays. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would understand that very well. We have a handful of firms in this country deciding what the consumer pays and what the producer is paid. That is a very dangerous and unhealthy situation for this country. When you see who are on those firms, you will find they are the people who are appointed to do a task by this government. Have a look at the casino in Melbourne. It is not run by small business people. The government does not appoint small business people to any of the task forces or jobs it wants carried out. This government looks after the big end of town. What we have from this government is Clayton's support for shopping centre tenants. It pays lip service to small business. Chanting 'small business' and 'we're for small business' does not expand business; it does not provide net income for small business people. As I said, historically, Liberal-National Party governments have been solid supporters of big business, and that is no more evident than in the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which stands ever ready to issue a press statement on the houralmost on the minute-to back up whatever announcement the government has made. That is as it always was; it is not new. It expresses political views that masquerade as industry views. But small business problems are industry problems that demand industry solutions, not political rhetoric. The purpose of this Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to certain' small business is really a case of small business versus big business. The report talks about the difficulty in defining 'unconscionable conduct' and comes up with a special term-after full deliberation which the member for Paterson, an occasional attendee at that committee, put his name to-that it should be based on a definition of 'fair trading'. That is the guts of this issue, and, again, is the triumph of big business-the Property Council of Australia, the giant retailers. Ask yourselves who influences this government. It is not the small business people, the retail tenants in Charlestown Square in my electorate or Lake Macquarie Fair or Belmont City Centre, who have all been exploited; it is the Property Council of Australia and the giant retailers of this country. But I will come to that a little later on. The legislation provides for the industry codes of practice to be prescribed and to be mandatory. Why not make them mandatory? Rather, why not adopt the recommendation of the committee? The member for Paterson subscribed his name to a unanimous report from all of the members of that committee. Those who sit opposite ignored the plight of small retailers. It was not until pressure came from us and small business that they started to give some sort of consideration to it. But let me go to the plight of small business retailers in my electorate. I first raised this back in February 1996, before the last election, because I found over months beforehand that small business people in large retail centres are totally scared and intimidated. They come to you and talk to you and ask for help but ask that you do not mention their name. So I had to make statements that adverted to the problem without any reference to the firms, Jor fear of retribution from centre management. What I said to them in that statement of February 1996 was that anybody contemplating going into business in a large shopping centre must seek independent financial advice and get independent legal advice, otherwise they will be cannibalised. I see a succession of people in large shopping centres destroyed by the Property Council of Australia. The Property Council of Australia presents as a wonderful, almost do-gooder, association, with glossy booklets and great statements and funds conferences and dinners all about business. Mr Martin-Prosser was a member.  minister was a member. That fits. But there would not have been any linkage between him and the decisions of government, would there? Mr Martin-How could you think that?  about it. The first one I spoke to was Gerhardts Foods in Charlestown Square. They were summarily told at the end of their five year lease, 'Out. We want your space in the food hall for MCDonald's.' I can mention his name because he is now out of business. They got him out. He was pushed out and then the other food hall proprietors said, 'Well, what about us? We build up the business, we make our investment in capital, we have built up the goodwill, and now you say to us that you want to take up a large section of the area to bring in MCDonald's!' A brawl went on about that for some time, and MCDonald's have not made it yet. Then I can talk about the supplier Fresh Fruit, a major business which built up a very good reputation for good quality fresh product. When the business got large enough, Coles went over to fresh foods and duplicated their business. He got moved and down went the level of business. He has now gone. We do not have Cut Price Deli there, but a number of other food establishments come in, make their investments-$1A million-buy into a five-year lease, build up goodwill, advertise and promote; and then they wake up one morning and they find that their business has been duplicated just a bit further down the concourse within the centre. These small people pay extortionate rents compared with the rents the major retailers pay. They pay only nominal rent. The argument was that the nominal rent that was collected from the giant retailer was to enable them to be the drawcard. We all know v-ry well that there has to be a range of products and services in shopping centres, and the small people in those shopping centres are as important as the giant retailers. I found through experience-going through shop after shop and having meeting after meeting with these people-that they were treated with arrogance and abuse. Women who were managing their businesses and made complaints to m-nagement got a ,stream of abuse--expletlves. That was the arrogance of the management of that organisation. From abuse and arrogance came deceit: 'Yes, there is a promotion levy. Yes, we'll have an input. Yes, we'll do that,' and nothing was done. Assurances were given that no other competitors would be brought in after they had built the business up, and those assurances were broken. Then the next thing that comes along is extended hours. They know full well that the smaller business people cannot work seven days a week, 14 hours a day. They have to sleep and have a rest and see their families some time. That was done to run down those small retail people. I came upon a case in Belmont City Centre-again, I cannot reveal the name because the people are too afraid-where the tenant was nearing the end of their five-year lease. There was no right of renewal, no compensation for goodwill and nothing could be sold'Just take your gear and go'. That tenant was told, 'Your rent is going up effectively 1,000 per cent.' The rent was going up; they had another tenant all lined up to come in. They drove out that tenant to bring in another tenant. They destroyed their business and destroyed their investment. Now we find that not only is there this disgraceful conduct coming from organisations like that running Charlestown Squareand I mention that particularly-but also nothing has improved. Since this first came to me in 1995, the Property Council of Australia has had the ear of this government. The key issue, Minister, about which you smile, is a uniform tenancy code. That key issue has been swept aside by the government on the old fall-back, 'Look, it is really state law. can't do anything about it. We'll have a look at it and see whether we can work out some sort of code of behaviour or something.' There is a multitude of law and services which involve federal and state and overlap, and the government's decision is to say to small business people in shopping centres, 'Look, you aren't a sufficient priority. The Property Council of Australia is a major supporter of this government and we are giving them priority.' In those large shopping centres the people are virtually being crushed to death-their health collapses and they go out. The people who go in borrow or take their redundancy packages and their borrowings and lose the lot-lose their redundancy package, lose the business and lose the family home as well. That is why it is so important for anybody even just contemplating going into a large shopping centre to get independent financial and legal advice. Don't even think about going into a shopping centre because it is the constant supply of centre fodder that these managements use to say, 'Well, we've got somebody else who wants your premises,' and as long as there are unwitting, innocent people who do not know the dangers they are going into then the pressure can be kept up by the centre management to push out people they do not want. There is another side to this: the stock exchange. If you look at Lend Lease, you will see that Lend Lease prides itself upon being able to increase its profits year after year. It does that by extracting blood-literally blood-from small business people in large shopping centres. I have seen those people. I have seen the agony they go through, and I have seen the results of that. I have talked to centre managements and I have seen the arrogance and the dishonesty that comes from them. I say to Lend Lease and the Property Council of Australia: don't walk tall. The behaviour of members of your council and the behaviour of firms like Lend Lease is despicable and it is time that the public of this country knew a little more about the way you behave, the dishonesty, the lack of integrity and the sheer bloody-minded exploitation of We decent, honest Australians who believe you. There sit Lend Lease and GPT Property with all of their lawyers and accountants and along comes somebody out of the steelworks or maybe out of one of the other industries with a redundancy package and, bang, it all goes. They are foolish enough to believe them. But there is one more side to this. I ask the minister to take particular note of this. There are national franchise firms who target groups of people taking redundancy packages. They see them as the people who are flush with money. They have a large sum-maybe $200,000 or $250,000-and they need to do something. These poor unwitting people think that they can buy themselves a job, and they are targeted by these national franchisors. Mr Reith-You did nothing about it for years.  it in the last 12 months. The people were intimidated. Where were you? You never raised it in the House. When did you ever raise this matter in the House? All the years you were in opposition you never said one word. I ask the minister, I appeal to the minister, to pay particular regard to that situation and to the practice of national franchisors ing people taking redundancy packages. Overall, I strongly support the amendment. I hope for the interests of small business people in this country that it will be adopted and that something will be done to more effectively protect them and give them fair trading and a fair go. That is all we ask for them. I commend the amendment to the House.",54
18,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Firstly, I thank the many members who have spoken in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill. We have had a good debate in the national parliament on issues of national importance, and I thank all members for their interest. I encourage those members who have made a contribution and who have yet to do so to read the bill and to fully understand the various propositions which the government has advanced in this. The legislation and the ensuing debate demonstrate that there has been a pent-up demand, a real need here, for legislative action, to which the government has responded. It is correct, as the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) pointed out, that many members have had a direct involvement in these issues because small businesses have come to members in desperation, as the last point of ence, seeking a strong policy response from the national parliament. I also acknowledge the strong endorsement of the government's package from government members and, in particular, the contribution of members who were members of the Reid committee, most of whom were able to make a contribution in this debate. I acknowledge that, even in the case of opposition members, there was an underlying recognition that the time had come for this reform and I think a quiet appreciation, even from members of the opposition, that the government had seized the moment and community sentiment in the small business community. I acknowledge the contributions of members from urban, regional and rural electorates, indicative that the problems we are addressing come from all sectors of the small business community-rural, regional and urban. I also target- acknowledge the examples of problems encountered by many people in small business which have been referred to their local members who have stood in this place and given us and the parliament· a better understanding of the practical problems that small business has faced. In fact, the Reid committee, which was a result of a promise the government had made prior to the last election and whose report was so influential in bringing forward the legislation-and we are today completing its second reading debate-went round Australia to give small business the platform and opportunity to be heard on these issues. There have been some misrepresentations and some misinterpretations of the. government's statutory intentions both from the opposition and in some submissions or comments from larger organisations. So, as I sum up, I want to take the opportunity to expand upon the remarks I made in my second reading speech about our statutory intention, and then I want to take the opportunity to make some general remarks about some of the comments from the opposition and the key aspects of those. Since the introduction of this bill into the House on 30 September, the government has received a considerable number of submissions from industry and from advisers to referindustry on the policy underpinning this legislation and on matters of a technical or drafting nature. To those who have sought to reargue the merits of the policy decisions which the government has taken, I take this opportunity to indicate that we have no intention of altering the policy framework which gave rise to this bill, and which I outlined in my ministerial statement to the House on 30 September. As I said at that time, the government consulted widely and meaningfully over a four-month period following the thorough work of the parliamentary committee and the tabling of its report. Our reforms, as announced, have been widely supported across industry and almost unanimously within the small business community. They represent good public policy. They are overdue. They will be delivered. Those who may have been surprised at the strength of the government's response ought not to have assumed that the coalition would do what the previous government did when it failed to act on 17 similar reports and reviews in its 13 years of office. Submissions to this government which seek to reopen the policy balance· of this bill, or which would have the effect of unravelling key elements of the multi-dimensional New deal: fair deal package, will fall on deaf ears. I am, however, sensitive to submissions which relate to technical drafting or definitional matters and which would enhance our policy objectives or improve the implementation of these measures. Such submissions will be reviewed by the government in the period intervening between the debating of this measure in this House and its consideration in the Senate. I also take this opportunity to clarify a number of matters relating to the statutory intent of the legislation. It is clear from submissions and from some public commentary that a number of misconceptions have already arisen. The primary purpose of this bill is not to drive large or small business a more litigious environment, nor is it intended that the courts undermine the basic principles of contracts or trample on property rights. The bill does not force parties to enter into contractual relations against their will, nor does it compel any particular form of contract or style of contractual negotiations. Rather, as I said in both the ministerial statement and my second reading speech on 30 September, the primary purpose of the bill is to induce a behavioural change on the part of larger business towards smaller business and to provide to small businesses that are mistreated adequate means of redress. I also repeat that the government would expect the vast majority of commercial transactions to not be challenged under either proposed section 51AC or 51AD. Challenges would arise only where commercial dealings breached the standards of behaviour set for industry sectors in codes or where the conduct was found to be unconscionable. Already it is apparent from submissions received that large businesses are taking advice on the potential impact of these laws and reviewing business conduct and contracts to assess compliance. That is a good thing, particularly if it leads to the replacement of existing unconscionable conduct or the introduction of contracts with a higher standard of behaviour. I encourage industry to review business conduct in this manner from this early stage of this bill's passage. Similarly, it is not consistent with the spirit of this measure for a party to commercial dealings to knowingly engage in business practices which would be unconscionable from the proposed date of operation, simply in reliance of the lack of existing legislative protection for business consumers against such conduct. The prescription of industry codes and the prohibition on unconscionable conduct aim to provide a framework for commercial dealings that provides a greater degree of certainty for small business when entering into commercial transactions with big business. These initiatives are not intended to protect those who, through poor management, fail to succeed in business ventures, nor to compromise cominto mercial risk taking and its consequences. The proposed section 51AC dealing with unconscionable conduct has already attracted much comment. This provision is, as the explanatory memorandum to this bill outlines, an extension of the equitable doctrine of unconscionable conduct. It is extended by the nonexclusive list of factors in subclauses (3)(a) to (k) to which a court may have regard. Some have argued that uncertainty exists with the retention of section 51AA in the principal act. This is not so. Section 51AA is retained as a remedy against unconscionability, albeit narrower in scope, for those aggrieved parties which do not fall within the definition of 'business consumer' for the purposes of the new provision. That remedy currently exists and it would be perverse for the government, through this bill, to eliminate existing rights under the act. Others have argued that the scope of the proposed section 51AC is too broad because the list of enumerated factors is nonexhaustive. The government rejects that argument. Unconscionability involves such conduct as taking advantage of a weaker commercial party through undue influence, the pernicious exercise of bargaining power, trickery, deception, conduct against all conscience and economic duress. Conduct of this type cannot be quarantined to a limited set of facts. By its nature, those who engage in unconscionable conduct devise new ways and means of doing so. To limit the discretion of a court to the enumerated factors only would create a fertile ground for evasion of the statutory intent. Such an approach would also compromise the intent to induce behavioural change. For example, it would be quite proper for a court, when considering a claim of unconscionability, to also consider the conduct of the business consumer, including the steps which the business consumer mayor may not have reasonably taken to protect their own commercial interests. Evidence of such matters would almost certainly be admissible in proceedings, and it would be quite wrong to have a statutory bar to a court taking these relevant matters into consideration. As I said in the second reading speech on this bill, the adage of prevention being better than cure remains true--especially for small business with limited financial resources. This law is not intended to allow small business to avoid its responsibilities in commercial relations. Small business has not argued that this legislation should do so, and it does not. It has also been speculated that conduct which falls within just one of the enumerated categories in subsection (3)(a) to (k) automaticredit. cally means that a case of unconscionability has been established. This is not so. The provision is intended to operate as a whole, with a court being given a discretion to have regard to these factors. Whether one factor alone establishes a case of unconscionability ought to depend on the gravity of the conduct complained of in a particular case. Indeed, what may be conduct giving rise to unconscionability between parties with greatly disparate bargaining power may not be unconscionable where the parties have an equivalence of bargaining power. This statutory scheme is no different to the approach adopted in section SlAB of the principal act dealing with consumer protection against unconscionable conduct. The policy balance in this bill is sound. Our statutory intent is clear. The legislation creates new rights and causes of action, but carries with it concomitant responsibilities for both large and small business. Let me now make some brief comments on the contributions of the opposition. I would start by saying that I am disappointed that the opposition have decided to play politics with this issue. It is hard to believe that, after they did so little for small business and did so much against its interests in the 13 years that they were in office, they should now seek to frustrate the government's intentions. The opposition amendments foreshadowed are born of political envy and political opportunism. The opposition spokesman· spoke in terms which endorsed the government's response when I made the response on 30 September. But since then they have decided that they should play catch-up politics to try to claw back some ground from their own discredited record. They got into a negative spin. If they think such clearly and transparently opportunistic moves will gather them any support in the small business community, I think they are mistaken. I say to the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) that ringing up representatives of small business and asking them, 'What is it that's wrong with the package that the government has brought down?' as a means of gathering opposition to it does you no You have been trying to manufacture opposition to it. In fact, in politics there is a simple lesson, and that is that many people will value oppositions that are, from time to time, prepared to be constructive when it is in the interests, in this case, of the small business community. You have seen virtually unanimous endorsement from small business of the government's package. Now that you know you are out in the cold, you are trying to do what you can to claw your way back. You are a reactionary voice, a lone voice, against what is a very good package. And, incredibly, you are on the public record as advocating amendments to this package which have been put to you-not by small business, but by certain big business interests. You are on the public record as saying that you are proposing to limit the benefits of this package for small business because you have been told by certain big businesses that it would be in the interests small business for you to do so. I must say, it is a quite extraordinary proposition that the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) should accuse us of listening too closely to the interests of big business; and yet the shadow minister for small business and customs is on the public record as saying that he is proposing an amendment to limit the rights of small business because it has been put to him by big business. You are on the public record. Mr Martin-It is expanding their rights.",58
19,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It is not. You ought to be able to understand and value and assess these issues on their merits, instead of just taking holus-bolus that which has been put to you by people-and yes, they are people who are entitled to lobby you. But the idea is that should be smart enough to understand what is in the interests of small business. It is no wonder that when you were in government you never did anything for the small business community. Mr Allan Morris interjecting",61
20,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,As the member for-what's your seat? Mr Allan Morris-What's yours?,61
21,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"As the non-entity sitting on the back bench once said, one of Labor's problems was that their directives, when sent to the bureaucracy to provide some assistance for small business, were lost in bureauspace. That, unfortunately, is your record. We have heard no defence of your record because, quite frankly, you do not have one. The truth is that the three propositions have proposed would not advance the interests of small business at all. In fact, those propositions are politically inspired to undermeasures; mine the very sensible reforms that we have proposed. For example, you want to take the word 'unconscionable' and replace it with the word 'unfair.' That is your proposition. You say that because it is a term used in Finding a balance. You say that because 'unconscionable' has no case law and because 'unfair' is a simpler test. You have not done your homework. If you had listened to what the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) said, you of would know that when he used the word 'unfair' he did not go out and seek technical legal advice. Mr Martin-You ought to read it.",61
22,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I have read it. You ought to read it. You should stop trying to undermine the fantastic efforts done by everybody on that committee, including some of your own people. Mr Martin-We just want to help.",61
23,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"You do not want to help; you want to undermine this because you are embarrassed that you never did it. They said that recommendation was a statement of the principle. That is what they said. It is quite obvious. It was a statement of the principle. Our job as the government in responding to you it was to put together in a practical way a means of implementing that proposal. That is what we have done. You have said, 'You don't use ""unconscionable"" because it does not have case law.' Where do you people come from? Unconscionable does have jurisprudence. That is the reason for using it. What you do not understand is that the reason a lot of these propositions have been knocked off in the past and have never been able to be proceeded with was that, firstly, when you were in government you were not supportive of small business and, secondly, there was a legal argumentagainst the proposal; namely, that it was uncertain in its meaning. When we put together a package, I was absolutely intent on ensuring that we would have a full answer to that proposition. We you have gone for a proposition which is based in the jurisprudence and which, therefore, is a fair response to the usual criticism of such namely, that they are uncertain. When you say that there is no case law on unconscionability, you are just plain wrong. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) cited the criteria which the courts have established for the concept of special disadvantage, such as illiteracy and the like. On this basis they argue that the word 'unconscionability' is too narrow. That is totally wrong and misleading. It is in total ignorance tions. of the amendment. The opposition speakers, almost without exception, have missed the most basic point of this bill: the bill is an extension of the common law court determined concept of unconscionability. Section 51AA-Labor's failed amendment in 1992-is codification of the common law and has been of limited use only. That is why we are amending the law to go beyond 51AA, beyond what the courts have said. The opposition just has to read the the House. explanatory memorandum to the bill. The top of page 23 makes this very clear. As many government members have pointed out, in proposed section 51AC we use much broader language, including references to unfair tactics. The word 'unfair' is there, and it is there in the context of a more certain and reasonable proposition based on jurisprudence. That is why it is a good idea. That is why it has had so much support. Those opposite also propose that we change the definition of small business to the ABS definition and remove the $1 million threshold. Why? Because they have had discussions with some of the major corporations which have said that this would benefit small business. The shadow minister acknowledged that Lend Lease and Westfield think that use of the ABS definition is not such a bad idea. You continue to ask big business about what is good for small business. No wonder you did nothing for them for 13 years. You were asking the wrong people. Lastly, you say that we should have a national uniform retail tenancy code of conduct. You never argued for that when you were in government, and in the whole time that you have been in opposition you have been opposed to it. The Leader of the Opposi- Kelly, D. M. tion (Mr Beazley) has expressed his opposition to it on the public record, as has the former minister. There is no way of achieving it, except for Dennis Rose's proposition to introduce a tax. Mr Martin-That's not true.",61
24,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,It is not true! You were in the House endorsing the Rose recommendaMr Martin interjecting,62
25,Mr REITH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"L-a-w; there will be no tax. That was what you promised. After the election, if you were elected, to implement the proposal would mean a new tax. Mr Martin-Come to us and we'll explain it.",62

In light of the summing up by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), in respect of the opposition's position regarding the fair trading inquiry report and the government's response, I think a number of issues need to be pointed out. First and foremost, he was absolutely correct when he said that the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and a number of other honourable members of this place worked long and hard to bring down a report, entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, which made recommendations concerning the plight of small business. He is absolutely correct that that is the case. In tabling that particular report the member for Bendigo said in part that the committee has 'felt compelled to make strong recommendations to set some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in Australia'. As the minister and others spoke in this debate they did just that: they clearly pointed out that the government's intention of the was to put in place a set of changes to the law which they believed would reflect what small business had said. That would have been fine, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - and I am sure you have an intimate knowledge about thissave for the fact that the Reid committee made recommendations which are not reflected in the legislation before us today. That is why the Labor Party has moved these amendments which more faithfully reflect each and everyone of those recommendations put forward by the Reid committee. The minister said in his response to the comments made in this place that the Reid committee report was only a statement of principle and that the government always would reserve the right to change that statement of principle. We had a series of very clear recommendations, whether in terms of retail tenancy, some form of assistance for small business as defined by the ABS or the other amendments on unfair or unconscionable conduct. As a consequence, we on this side of the place took to heart those recommendations in that committee's report. The Leader of the House and, I think, the member for Bendigo tried to portray in their comments that there is some division on this sidebetween the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley),.me and other members of the Labor Party-about whether or not we adopted this report and whether we stood for unconscionable or unfair conduct. Let me leave the House in no doubt: the shadow ministry, at a meeting in an outer Melbourne suburb earlier this year after the report by the honourable for Bendigo and his colleagues was tabled in this place, adopted unanimously, 100 per cent, that committee report as part of what Labor would try to implement and assist the government in doing. Mr Reith-What date was that?",63
28,Mr MARTIN,AYES,"It was 22 June 1997. The press release that I put out at the time, headed 'Labor formally agrees to fair trading recommendations', said: At a meeting of the Shadow Ministry in the City of Casey, on the outskirts of Melbourne, the Labor Opposition fonnally agreed to the recommendations of the Fair Trading inquiry ... Shadow Minister for Small Business, Stephen Martin, said today. We did do that. As a consequence, we have come to this place today with a series of amendments-and I will speak to those amendments in some detail this afternoon as we go to each and every one of them. I think it is also important to understand that not only did the Labor Party come forward and support the Reid committee's recommendations when they were brought down but so, too, did many other people, including many small organisations that the minister referred to. For example, Mr Robert Gardini, who is well known to people because he has made submissions to many inquiries in respect of commercial operations and small business and was also involved with the Franchising Code Council before the former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs starved it of its funds and it collapsed in a heap, said that he applauded the 'recommendations of the fair trading inquiry which has delivered bipartisan political support' . He said: The recommendation that the unconscionable conduct provision of the Trade Practices Act be amended to include conduct which is unfair(Time expired)",64
29,Mr REITH,AYES," Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Mr Allan Morris- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am seeking clarification from you as to how we are going to handle the amendments. Should I speak on the amendments before or after the minister?",65
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Mr Forrest)You may speak later; we are considering the bill in detail.,65
31,Mr REITH,AYES,"It is amazing that we have these Labor backbenchers who do not even understand the forms of the House and when they get an opportunity to speak--even after the many years the member for Newcastle has been here and has sat mute on the back bench, disinterested in these issues. Mr Adams interjecting",65
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,"Order! The member for Lyons will not use that language in the chamber. I ask him to withdraw that expletive and caution the member. Mr Adams- Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what expletive I used",65
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES,Perhaps you use the expletive far too often to be aware of it.,65
34,Mr REITH,AYES,"The sad thing about these amendments is that this is an excellent bill. We have done more for the small business community than has been proposed by anyone for the benefit of the small business community in 20 years. I do not say that-that has been said by small business organisation representatives across Australia from the moment we introduced our package. I remember hearing Marcus Kollington, from the Service Station Association, saying on the radio the next day words to the effect that small business can thank its lucky stars that the government has announced what it has. We had a very strong report from the Reid committee. We went around in a bona fide way looking at how we could implement the spirit of those recommendations. That is what we have done in a totally open, transparent and bona fide way. The shadow minister, when we brought down the package, said it was a good package. He is quoted in the Financial Review as saying, 'We said Peter Reith, the Minister for Small Business, has done well.' I thank him for that. That was a fair comment. Oppositions do not often give credit to governments. It has to be a pretty good package before they do. To do him justice, at the time he said it because he knew that it was important that we gather support for this package and get it through the parliament. Our intention is to move quickly on this. I made the statement mid-afternoon and one of the best phone calls afterwards said, 'When are you going to introduce the amendments to the Trade Practices Act to implement the policy you have just announced?' I was able to say, 'I've got good news for you because I'll be back in parliament later this afternoon actually introducing the bill.' It is unheard of for the government to make a major policy statement and, the same day, walk back into the parliament with the amendments to the legislation to make things happen. When you have waited 20 years for a decent policy it must be pretty refreshing and encouraging for the small business community that the government is so determined to make this happen that we should actually walk in with it on that day. As a government we are unashamedly prosmall business. We think the small business community in this country is fantastic. We think they have tremendous potential and it is very important for the small business community that they appreciate that this government is on their side. You could say that this is a political pitch, but the question of confidence in the small business community is very important in itself. If people feel confident that the government is on their side, then they are going to be confident about the future and it will have practical benefits for people running small businesses. They will give somebody a job and really make things happen. The sad thing is that the Labor Party, knowing that this is a good package for small business and having said it publicly, is now basically nit-picking and trying to do all it can to prevent these reforms going through. As I have demonstrated, you can show where they are factually wrong. They are plainly absolutely wrong and ignorant of the facts and have the hide to come in here and say, 'We are proposing this amendment because big business has told us it is a good amendment.' I have never heard such a proposition. (Time expired)",65
35,Mr MARTIN,AYES,"Cunningham) (1.55 p.m.)The simple fact is that the Labor Party adopted the Reid committee report in full as a result of the committee doing a tremendous job and bringing down a report which said that there should be changes to legislation dealing with small business and picking up the issue of unfair trading. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) at the meeting that the minister referred to earlier on 17 December 1997 at the Camberwell centre in Melbourne said: I also state clearly on behalf of Labor that we support all the recommendations of the fair trading report. As I was saying earlier, that support came from other areas. It came from Mr Robert Gardini, someone who has been intimately involved with issues like this for quite a period of time. When the Reid committee report came down, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia also called for a full implementation of the report-not this adoption of principles that the minister talks about, but the full adoption of the report. That is the report that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) chaired and voted down just a moment ago. Also, Mr Michael Delaney of the MTAA said that he expected the government to adopt the report in its entirety. Does that sound like it is a statement of principles that they would like to have adopted? Not to me, not to the Labor Party; it was that these people, who represented small business interests and had given evidence to Mr Reid, wanted the member for Bendigo and his committee to go about that task and mean what they said. If they brought in a report that said, 'We want to see unfair changes made to unconscionable conduct' - that is, 'unfair' instead of 'unconscionable' - that is what would happen. Now we find the member for Bendigo leading the charge by his own side to say, 'Hang on, forget what we said in the report. Mr Reith's come along as the minister and said that we can't wear that. We're going to have unconscionable conduct, and if he says that's what we have to do, like good backbenchers we're not going to kick on this particular occasion. We will not have unfair trading. We will not adhere to what the report said.' Why did you waste your time? I ask the member for Bendigo: why did you spend 12 months of your time getting all the wraps around Australia talking to the cherished constituency of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), that is, small business, listening to all their complaints, coming into this place and bringing down a report called Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia? Then you tum around and when the minister puts up legislation that walks away from your recommendations, you say, 'Okay minister, we got it wrong, after 12 months.' It is only a statement of principles.' It did not stop with that sort of praise for what the member for Bendigo had done in calling for the adoption of this report in its entirety. We had the Australian Retailers Association say: The association is concerned that if the whole of the committee's recommendations, in particular a shotgun approach of attempting to cover all corporation and small business relationships by general amendment of section 51 AA of the TPA consider the key issues of demonstratable concern then those which occupy the vast majority of the committee's report, that is, tenancy and franchising are be lost. It went on to say: Quick and focused attention on retail tenancy will have an immediate effect and will earn the gratitude of thousands of specialty and small retailers. As we will come to a little later this afternoon, they walked away from retail tenancy as well, saying it is not constitutionally possible to do it. But the member for Bendigo said it was. The member for Bendigo and the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), copycat over there, and the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), up the back, all came to an agreement in this report saying, 'Yes, you can actually have federal laws in respect of retail tenancy.' But now that is only a statement of principle. That report is going to be consigned to the dustbin of history. It does not mean a thing because it is a statement of principle. The minister just came here a minute ago and told us when he said, 'It's a statement of principle and the government has chosen not to deal with it.' As well as the Australian Retailers Association",66

What is the story? And on it goes.

Can I take the opportunity of reminding the House of the state of the Australian economy in a number of important respects when we came to power-the fact that we inherited a $10.5 billion deficit, and we will have eliminated that deficit in just three years; that inherited interest rates that were something like 2Y2 to three per cent higher than what they are now, and we have delivered cuts in housing interest rates that are worth between $200 and $260 a month to the average mortgagor in Australia; that we inherited an economy that had very high levels of indebtedness of national debt, and we have worked to reduce that national debt; that we inherited an archaic industrial relations system, and we have made significant improvements to that industrial relations system. We have embarked upon the most imaginative and successful privatisation program in Australia's economic history. The very successful float of Telstra was far beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic on the government side and it was achieved in the teeth of virulent opposition from both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. I take the opportunity of remarking for a moment on the alternative economic strategy that is on offer. The alternative economic strategy is really a retreat by the Labor Party back to a policy of high intervention in the economic affairs of Australia. Given what has happened in a number of the economies in our region in recent weeks, I find it very surprising that any party that seeks to be the government of this country would move towards policies which have so demonstrably failed in other parts of the world. One of the take-outs that one can have from what has occurred in our region is that high interventionist economic strategies do not work. Yet increasingly the Labor Party is moving towards the embrace of high economic strategy as policy by policy, issue by issue the Labor Party abandons any pretence that it once had to embracing policies that placed any kind of serious reliance on the operation of the open As time goes by, I think it will increasingly be seen to be the case that the Labor Party are retreating to old-fashioned, 1950s economic policy. They are turning their eyes against the idea of embracing any kind of optimism about the future of this country. They are the party that is against taxation reform; they are the party that is against industrial relations rewe form; they are the party which, given an opportunity, would burden this country once again with a high budget deficit; they are the party that is against privatisation; they are the party that is against imaginative, micro-economic reform. So I would say to the honourable member for Kooyong that the government's economic policies have been highly successful. The alternatives on offer would take Australia backwards and not forward because t-e Australian Labor Party have no economic vision at all for the 21st century. Waterfront",68
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My. question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware that the first contingent of a substantial force of up to 70 men, recruited through advertisements in the Army publication Army, is scheduled today to fly out to Dubai for three months training, operating stevedoring equipment in order to be deployed on the Australian waterfront early in 1998? What knowledge do you have of this covert operation to recruit a force of industrial mercenaries from the ranks of the military? When did you first become aware of it?",68

47,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Can the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the effects of the right to negotiate for Australia's mineral export industry? Will the government's proposed amendments to the right to negotiate under the Native Title Amendment Bill create greater certainty for the mining industry, jobs and rural communities?",69
48,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Menzies for his very relevant question. The short answer is yes, they will. What we are now about is focusing this Wik debate on real outcomes-the real outcomes provided for by our legislation. I notice that Brisbane's 4BC ran a 24-hour poll to 7 a.m. today with the question: 'Do you believe the federal government's Wik legislation is fair to all Australians?' The result of that poll, which members on both sides might be interested in-sure, it is one poll and you should not read too much into radio station polls",69
49,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your telephone bill for the last 24 hours?,69
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Banks.,69
51,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not know about the poll until it was completed. The result of that poll is that 77.6 per cent are in favour of the federal government's Wik legislation; 22.4 per cent are against it. If my memory serves me right, 4BC is in Brisbane area only and on the edge of Brisbane and does not have a string of country stations attaching. It would even include the leafy suburbs of parts of the city of Brisbane. This is a very serious matter and it is made more serious by the events attaching to the Ernest Henry mine. The Leader of the Opposition contends that the Labor amendments will resolve this matter. I need to bring him up to date in relation to that. Michael Pinnock, the Queensland Minerals Council Executive Officer, has made it very clear that that is not the case. He has said in a statement---excuse me, one tickMr Crean-Come on, Tim; get your act together.",69
52,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Calm down, Simon; it is not time to go back to Bordeaux just yet. Michael Pinnock said that Labor's amendments did not go far enough with regard to validation. He pointed out that there is an immediate extent of sovereign risk. Mr Pinnock further pointed out that it is a chilling message for Australia to be sending to international exploration investors. He said that the coalition government's amendments do provide for what is required in respect of Ernest Henry. Are we wiping out native title across mainland Australia? We are not. We are providing a fair and due process which will allow the determination of these matters and will allow compensation, but, in the meantime, will allow the Ernest Henrys and every other new mine to go ahead-giving a little bit of excitement to the export effort of rural and regional Australia and jobs to Aboriginal people, including the 100 Aboriginal people who are involved in the construction of the Ernest Henry mine, and giving them a bit of hope. That is why we need our amendments, and we need them to come through the Senate sooner rather than later. The matter is not over by any stretch of the imagination until you get to the conclusion of the Senate deliberations, either first time around or, for that matter, second time around. There is an additional point. This is not just a matter relating to the security of one particular mine. For example, there are 500 Queensland mining leases which could be in jeopardy if the injunction to stop Ernest Henry is successful. The Queensland Mines Department has figures for 522 similar leases which have been issued between January 1994 and December 1996. One of them is the very important Duchess phosphate project just south of Cloncurry, which has a lot of jobs attaching. It involves the connection of a gas pipeline, and sulfuric acid from Mount Isa. It is a very strategic development which will lead to import replacement and create even more jobs in Far North Queensland. That, too, is one of the leases which would fall into this particular envelope. We are about a fair dinkum and fair approach to the process on native title and to developing the most practical paradigm arising from the Wik 4-3 decision of the High Court. Sadly, the Labor Party is, at this level, about a very haphazard approach-a set of amendments which will create stalemate and gridlock. I just remind them of one other thing. They like to go back and look up the publications of the previous Goss Labor government-Goss is a possible candidate for them at the next election. If they do, they find advertised material which says that leasehold is affirmed and confirmed with regard to the Queensland Goss government. That was stated in Queensland government advertising. Albeit, the Wik decision has since come along. We have had to respond to that. We have done so in a fair and practical way which helps guarantee jobs. Waterfront",69
53,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Have you or any member of your staff or department or any consultant advising the government on waterfront matters had any discussions with Michael Wells, Peter Kilfoyle or any representatives of Fynwest Pty Ltd or International Port Services Training Group Pty Ltd regarding the deployment of an alternative labour force on the Australian waterfront? If so, what was discussed and with whom?",70
54,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know any of those names-either of the companies or of the individuals-that the member has asked me about, so the answer is no. National Accounts",70
55,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the state of the economy as revealed by the September quarter of the national accounts? What do the figures say about the prospects for strong sustainable growth?,70
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Today's national accounts for the September quarter show that the Australian economy grew in the quarter by 1.5 per cent. That is one of the strongest quarterly growths we have had for several years and would put Australia as possibly the highest growing economy in the developed world. Plainly, the government's budget forecast of 3% per cent growth is right on track. The outcome of 1.5 per cent, particularly taken with a revision to the June quarter of 1.4 per cent, puts growth over the last two quarters alone at around 2.9 per cent. The Australian economy is now a low inflation, high growth will economy. We now have an inflation rate which is the lowest we have seen in Australia since the 1960s. Standard variable mortgage rates in Australia are the lowest since 1969, having come down nearly four per cent since this government was elected. We now have a budget which, from a position of over $10,000 million in deficit when the Labor Party left office, could well be in surplus next year-after one term of coalition government. We also have a program to retire debt which, on current estimations, will take Labor's build-up of debt of nearly $100 billion and have the debt to GDP ratio by the tum of the century. Let us make no mistake about it: this government believes that Australia has the potential to be a strong growth economy and we want to see it be a strong growth economy. We also know that, in relation to getting up growth and sustaining it, it is important to undertake the struct-ral changes that will give us the opportunity to continue growth into the future. Those structural changes included lowering Australia's inflation rate. When we set out to do that by a new agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia, notwithstanding the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, we were able to put in place a strong, low inflation framework between the government and the Reserve Bank. Part of our inflation strategy was also to fix up the Australian budget, to take it from being in deficit and to put it into surplus. In addition to that, this government is intent on addressing Australia's perennial problem over the last couple of decades, our current account deficit; our current account deficit which is mainly fuelled by the build-up of foreign debt and our current account deficit which must be attacked by building government savings. Building government savings is part of this government's proposal. In this year the Australian government will borrow not one dollar. This year we will be repaying Keating Labor debt, next year we will repay Keating Labor debt and the year after we will repay Keating Labor debt. We cannot undo all the damage of 13 Keating Labor years in one term, but what we can do is make a start, and this government is making a start in relation to this. It would be of assistance to the Australian economy if the opposition would support this government's efforts to turn around the Australian economy. What do we hear? No economic issueMr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on the question it relevant for the Treasurer to answer the particular question he was asked without mentioning the fact that the last quarter's figures show a decline in wage and salary earners by just on one per cent; 0.8 per cent? Is it relevant for him to answer that question without answering that?",70
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat. We have had a large number of questions to me on relevance this week. I am quite capable of ruling on relevance, and I intend to do so without a great deal of interruption or potentially frivolous points of order on the question of relevance. Mr Gareth Evans-An 0.8 per cent fall in wage and salary earners, and you reckon that is frivolous!",71
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have ruled your point of order out of order.,71
59,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no reason for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to get up and ask you questions, Mr Speaker. He could always ask me one. You could always get up and ask me about the national accounts, couldn't you? But you will not get a question out of the Labor Party on the national accounts. You will not get a question out of the Labor Party on any good news in Australia. You will not get any interest from the Australian Labor Party when things are going well for the Australian public, because this a negative and vicious operation. That is all it is; a negative and vicious operation which takes great delight in bad news for the Australian public. What economic idea has the Australian Labor Party put forward in the last two years? They have only got one: drive the budget back into deficit and put up interest rates. They are a group of people who are returning to the scene of the crime. It was not bad enough to do it; you want to go right back there. This government has taken hold of the Labor failings and we have worked, against their opposition, to tum it around. The Australian economy is now in a stronger position as a result and all Australians, with the possible exception of the opposition, will welcome very strong, very solid growth in the of relevance.

61,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I draw the minister's attention to the fact that the company employing the Dubai industrial mercenaries who are flying out this evening, Fynwest Pty Ltd, is a $20 shelf company purchased in late October this year from Thrifty Shelf Companies. I draw his attention to the fact that these 70 industrial mercenaries are each to be paid between $46,000 and $60,000 per annum for three years in accordance with this Australian workplace agreement. Does the minister have any knowledge as to how a company with a is fully paid-up share capital of $20 proposes to pay a monthly payroll of $250,000 along with air fares of about $100,000, not to mention the cost of accommodation for the next three months in Dubai?",71
62,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to that is no, but I would have to say that an annual wage of, what did you say, $46,000 to $60,000 is less than what most wharfies are getting. I would have to say to the honourable member, as to whether people have left Australia or are about to leave Australia for some training exercise, that it is, quite frankly, news I am very interested, obviously, because I have portfolio responsibility for improving Australia's performance on the waterfront. But, as to the basic facts which you put to me, they are new to me. Work for the Dole Program",72
63,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, young people and communities in my electorate have welcomed the government's work for the dole initiative. What has been the wider response to the work for the dole initiative and how will this initiative benefit Australian communities?",72
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to inform the House that t9day the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs launched the work for the dole initiative at the Bankstown Aviation Museum. I think it is very appropriate that it was released in Bankstown, because it is in electorates like Blaxland that there is the strongest support in Australia for projects like work for the dole. The reason why the Labor Party did such a definite back-flip on work for the dole is that they realise that work for the dole makes a lot of sense to working Australians. Work for the dole implements the government's commitment to the principle of mutual obligation, a principle that says that you ought to provide a social security safety net but in return it reasonable to ask people to make some contribution back to society. That is a principle that we have unflinchingly advocated. It is a principle that not only underlies our approach to work for the dole but also underlies our approach to other policies. In announcing the program today, the minister announced 22 projects, comprising some 314 participants. Of the 314 participants, 192 are volunteers and 122, in accordance with the amended legislation which was ultimately let through by the Australian Labor Party, have been compulsorily referred. There will in total be 179 pilot programs, with 10,000 participants in total. I am told that up to 40 projects could be under way by Christmas time. This is a very important initiative. It fulfils to me. a commitment I made on behalf of the government earlier this year. It has been marked in its introduction by a monumental backflip by the Labor Party when they realised that the Australian public actually supported the idea. They originally came out and said they would oppose it, and then, when they realised that the mail was running in the opposite direction, they did a monumental backflip, just as they have done monumental backflips on so many other elements of policy when they have thought the mail is running against the original position that they have taken. I would like to congratulate the minister for his stewardship of this particular program. I imagine that he will have more to say about it today and in the days and the weeks ahead, because work for the dole is a very desirable approach to the problem of unemployment. Work for the dole is fulfilling the principle of mutual obligation. Work for the dole will deliver to many young people a greater sense of self-worth. It will put them on the pathway to greater employment opportunities, and I think it is an approach which has very wide community support, particularly in areas like the western suburbs of Sydney.

Quite frankly, I am not in a position to answer a question in respect of a matter about which I have no information. It is as simple as that. I can conclude by saying that what is needed on the waterfront is pretty obvious, and it is pretty obvious that we have not had it for a very long time. We ought to be able to do better than New Zealand. That is what we ought to be able to do. And we ought to be able to do better than Manila. And we ought to be able to do a lot better than a lot of the third world countries which have a better crane rate than we have in Australia. The fact is that for 13 years you left this issue as 'one which still requires attention'. That is the reason I got John Coombs in the other day and said that it was about time we saw a significant improvement in the crane rates on the Australian waterfront, for a lot reasons, including this one: that is, if we had better employee relations and better productivity, it would also be a consequence of that that we would have a better safety record for the people who work on the waterfront.",73

75,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, and I know that he has been a great supporter of work for the dole in his electorate. The government, in launching nationally the first work for the dole projects today, has delivered on its promise to thousands of young Australians and to hundreds of Australian communities to provide the opportunity to lift the confidence of young people by bringing together those young people and their communities on worthwhile community projects. These projects will provide practical work experience and work skills and will help break the soul destroying cycle of despair that many longer term unemployed young people have drifted into. I was very proud today to be able to launch at Bankstown airport a project in which over 40 young people will participate to restore historic fighter planes-historic Vampire planes and other historic planes. Opposition members-Vampire! Vampire!",73
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left.,73
77,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These young people were delighted with the association. They also will have an opportunity to restore the 1932 historic Charles Kingsford Smith Airport. Not only is work for the dole itself a significant of step in Australian history, but these young people will themselves be participants in restoring some of the key artefacts of Australia's civil and military aviation history. I was very impressed with the enthusiasm of the young people I spoke to on this project. Members of the House may be interested that I had the opportunity to speak to a number of young participants who were referred by Centrelink to the project. It is a misconception that I think is very widespread on the other side of the House that young people who are referred are somehow or other unwilling participants. What I found was that these young people had welcomed the approach from Centrelink. In many cases they had lost the self-confidence that would have induced them to put themselves forward but, given the opportunity, they were delighted to be able to work on this project. They saw it as something very positive in their lives and they believed that this project would help secure them the job they were looking for in the future. There were also present this morning a number of young people from St George, who will be working on a project to interview elderly migrants about their experiences in Australia, as part of an oral history. They will be taking this project right through to the publication of a book on the experiences of these migrants. In the course of it, they will be learning vital interviewing and communication techniques which so many employers are looking for when they seek a young person to fill a job. Other projects that are currently getting under way include: beautifying Goode Beach in Western Australia, improving facilities for elderly disabled people in Brisbane, helping to run a community radi,o station in Tasmania and working to improve Victoria's famous Puffing Billy railway tourist attraction, which I understand is largely within the member for La Trobe's electorate. The principle of work for the dole, as the Prime Minister said, is mutual obligation. The community believes that, when so many breadwinners in families and others are working hard to provide support for unemployed people, it is fair that unemployed people put something back into the community. There will be some 314 young people participating in these 22 projects. In the course of seeking participants, Centrelink has, I regret to say, already breached some 17 young people out of the vast number willing to take part. These were young people who did not want to put back into their community. Let us make no mistake that this is a fundamental point of difference between the Labor Party and the coalition. We believe that this principle of mutual obligation is fair. It is appropriate that young people put something back into their community and, where they refuse to do so or choose not to do so, they will have their dole reduced. That will be a consequence. I hope that there will not be many young people in this category. Those who have been breached will have their dole reduced by 18 per cent for 26 weeks. I urge these young people, and other young people who are volunteering, thinking of volunteering or may be approached by Centrelink to take part in work for the dole projects, to realise the wonderful opportunity that these projects are offering them to contribute something to their community, to be part of Australian history and to build work experience that will look very good when they approach an employer and that will certainly help them get a job at a future time. Disallowed Question",73
78,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Leader of the Opposition. As you will be supporting amendments relating to the Native Title Bill when it returns to the House, can you explain why you keep referring to native title as property rights when the High Court has not said what native title is and it may be no more than the right to hunt and gather? On what authority have you decided that it is property rights? If it is, does this not give us a hereditary race based property law? Do you believe that it is desirable or tenable and do you not accept that it would have the potential to undermine the Torrens land title, which is one of the great egalitarian reforms of this nation?",74
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie raises a very interesting question. As members would know, understanding order 143 it is possible for a question to be directed at a private member who has charge of a motion or a bill.

I think the thrust of your question today is not reflecpart tive of a motion or a notice that the Leader of the Opposition has under his charge. The question is therefore out of order. Finance Ministers Meeting: Korea",74
80,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the outcome of the regional finance ministers meeting in Kuala Lumpur? Can the Treasurer comment on developments in the region, particularly in relation to Korea?",75
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. Over the last two days in Kuala Lumpur, there has been a meeting of the ASEAN finance ministers and ASEAN plus six finance ministers. The ASEAN plus six finance ministers include Hong Kong, China, the United States, Japan, Korea and Australia. I was pleased to be present during the discussions, which naturally focused on currency instability in the region, the reform of financial institutions and economic prospects. IMP programs are already in place in relation to Indonesia and Thailand, and an emergency funding facility is also in place in relation to the Philippines. Korea is now engaged in active negotiations with the International Monetary Fund concerning its own problems, and it is expected that an agreement will be arrived at between the International Monetary Fund and Korea as early as today. Australia has contributed to those packages for both Thailand and Indonesia-in Indonesia, as part of a second tier of financing to be drawn down in the event that the IMF and multilateral institutions provision does not prove to be sufficient, although the managing director of the IMF stated in Kuala Lumpur that the object would be to ensure that the second tier is not drawn down and that the first tier of financing is sufficient to see Indonesia through those restructuring difficulties. Plainly, there are now severe problems in Korea. A number of merchant banks have been closed in the last 24 hours. It is clear that there are severe problems in the Korean financial system and it will be necessary, as of an IMP program, to rationalise those financial institutions, secure those that can be secured and deal with those that have difficult problems. Australia has had a request for assistance in relation to Korea but, as I have made clear to the House before, the policy of the Australian government is that the IMF should announce the package; the package should be seen as a temporary facility to allow restructuring of an economy so that the restructuring secures the economy in the long term; Australia's involvement would be at the behest of the IMP and would be determined on the basis of regional and national interests from Australia's point of view; and Australia's involvement would be only by way of a loan. It is in Australia's interests for strong growth to return to the Asian region. A downturn in the fast-growing Asian region will have an effect on Australia. It will affect our exports, and a downturn in Korea will affect Australian exports more than will the ASEAN four which have already experienced the full brunt of financial instability. Just as a downturn in Asia will affect Australia adversely, so too an upturn has benefits for Australia. This is the important point: an upturn and a return to growth in Asia is in Australia's interests. This government is determined as a good neighbour in the region not only to consider the interests of other countries but also to consider Australia's national interest in securing growth in this region. Over the last decade, Asia has led the world in terms of economic growth, and that has been good for Australia. It is very much in our interests that we secure the possibilities in the region. That is why we have been part of those packages. That is why this government encourages the Manila framework for enhanced transparency and surveillance in relation to financial institutions, and that is why this government has determined that Australia will play its part in these very difficult and troubled days in relation to our immediate region.

82,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister give a guarantee to the House that no currently serving members of the Australian armed forces or Department of Defence officials are involved in the Dubai industrial mercenaries operation? What knowledge do you have of the covert Dubai industrial mercenaries operations, and when did you first become aware of it?",76
83,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You certainly telegraph your punches! I very much doubt whether there are any ADF personnel involved in Dubai. Mr Leo MCLeay-Only doubt.,76
84,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not actually been over there in the last 10 minutes to check up, but we will make sure that there is none there. I first became aware of the matter when it was raised here a few minutes ago. I have seen the advertisements because a copy was sent down from my office about 10 minutes ago, once it was raised by your side. We have a commitment of about four personnel to UNSCOM which, as you know, supervises Iraq-and I very much doubt whether any of them are involved in waterfront reform. Coal Industry",76
85,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware that yearly membership dues for the CFMEU are approximately $1,200 per year? In this light, has the minister seen reports in today's media regarding an industrial fylations breakthrough at the Curragh coalmine in Queensland and reports relating to international coal prices? What do these reports mean for the Australian coal industry?",76
86,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly have seen those reports. There have been a number of reports today looking at the coal industry and its immediate prospects. For example, the ABN Amro coal analyst, Mr Kerry Heywood, is quoted in reports this morning as saying that the word out of Tokyo is that there will be a five per cent cut to hard coking coal prices. We have had forecasts of drops in prices from Merrill Lynch. Their analyst, David Errington, other side. is quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald today as saying: The downside risk is primarily for thennal coal, where market conditions remain very weak. And we have had some comments from BHP coal chief, Bob Kirkby, reported in today's Australian newspaper as confirming that coal prices would not rise next year. I think all that means is that there is a lot of market pressure on the coal industry. It is Australia's single largest export earner-$8 billion a year. We really need to be encouraging in the coal industry better efficiencies in the management of those coalrnines if we are to hang on to the jobs we have got, hang on to the mines we have got and, in a more confident frame of mind, look to expand the operations of that industry and create more jobs and more export income. The member mentions the Curragh coalmine in his question, and I am aware of developments in respect of the Curragh mine, in particular a decision of the full bench of the commission yesterday to refuse the application by the CFMEU for an interim award, the other being a serious erosion of the CFMEU and ACTU push basically to stymie reform in the coal industry. It is a very welcome decision by the commission, headed up by the new president, Mr Justice Giudice. They made a very clear finding in regard to this application. The the effort by the CFMEU to seek an interim award whilst proceedings in respect of an arbitration under section 170MX were afoot was thrown out on the merits, and that is without the jurisdictional argument being addressed. It is a welcome decision because it clears the way for a more sensible agreement which can lead to better work practices and, therefore, better efficiencies. It is also welcome because the AMWU was involved in these proceedings-and I think the honourable member was a former vice-president at a branch level of the AMWU. What we saw from the AMWU was a break out in common sense-and he has got his ticket there. I compliment the member. We have real union members on our side; not the phoney union elites that they have on the Rather than having an ideological battle, AMWU in this particular instance actually wants an agreement that will look after its members-a shock to the ex-ACTU presidents sitting on the other side who have only ever been interested in looking after themselves. The reform process in the coal industry is a long and hard one, but it is very important for the future of this country. We welcome the excellent decision from the Industrial Relations Commission.

87,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. What background checks on individuals or companies are made to ensure that advertisements that are placed in the official army publication Army and other Defence publications are not used to recruit members of the ADF as mercenaries or to engage in other covert activitiesadvertisements like the one which you just recently passed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and which your office so conveniently had on hand half an hour ago?,77
88,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Exactly the same checking arrangements that you have had in place for the last 10 years. Youth Suicide,77
89,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. I refer minister to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs on aspects of youth suicide. Has the government yet considered the recommendations in the report? If so, what plans does the minister have for their implementation?",77
90,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The government, first, would want to acknowledge all the work of those on the House of Representatives standing committee for the report and the consultations that they undertook. It is an issue that was important for the committee and indeed is important for all members in the parliament. I particularly thank the member for Fisher, Mr Slipper, who was the chairman during part of the considerations, and also the the current chair, the member for Mallee, Mr Forrest, for their work. The government certainly is concerned about the high rates of suicide, particularly among young males, in this country. Our commitment to addressing this serious issue is well acknowledged. The rates of suicide amongst young Australians is certainly unacceptable to all of us here. We all have a responsibility to address the situation and to provide appropriate services and support to young people at risk. I am pleased to say that the majority of concerns and recommendations outlined in the report are already being addressed by the government under the existing national youth suicide prevention strategy. The strategy was given an $18 million boost in the 1996-97 budget and is now funded to $31 million till July 1999.",77
91,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is entirely inappropriate for the minister, before making the formal response to the report, to be now giving us part of the formal response. This is not an appropriate procedure at all in response to a question in the House.",77
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Calwell. I would encourage the minister to address the thrust of the question without foreshadowing other information.,77
93,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr the Speaker. The funds have been allocated to attempt to address the issue of those who attempt suicide and those who are marginalised or disaffected, particularly those from rural and remote areas, and also to develop projects with GPs in hospitals and health service protocols for young people admitted for treatment of injuries from self harm. The funds are spread between a variety of different areas, but will include $3 million to provide programs for parents, who obviously bear the brunt of some of the tragedies that so many of us know about. There will also be specifically a million dollars for research into childhood and mental health arrangements. You would be aware",77
94,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is now outlining what obviously is going to be a section of the formal response to the report. He cannot do this before he has made the formal response.",77
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,78
96,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicate that the development of the program and the code that has been going on for some time with the media in Australia on the reporting arrangements with regard to suicide has indeed been progressing well. In relation to the report, which will be formally tabled following question time, I am pleased to indicate that we are accepting the fundamental recommendation of the committee-that is, that there will be the development of a national council for youth suicide prevention. This will build on the work that has been done in the states in a coordinated approach to these arrangements. I believe it is timely and it is what committee recommended, and the government is certainly pleased to endorse those recommendations. A full and detailed response to all of those recommendations will be tabled at the end of question time. Waterfront",78
97,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. What representations has the government or Australian officials made to representatives of the UAB on behalf of or in support of Mr  Pty Ltd or International Port Services Training Group Pty Ltd? What, if any, role has your department or the director of passport operations, Mr Graeme Middleweek, played in facilitating passport and visa arrangements for waterfront mercenary travel to Dubai?",78
98,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,None that I am aware of. Payment of Veterans' Entitlements,78
99,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Veterans in my electorate of Longman have told me of their preference for dealing with fewer government bureaucracies in relation to th-ir entitlements. Is the government aware of thIS? Is there any means by which veterans can streamline the payment of their entitlements through just one government department?,78
100,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman. I can also advise the member for Longman that the government is aware that veterans do prefer less bureaucracy when receiving their payments. This government is firmly committed to that goal. It is not only that veterans deserve less bureaucracy and a streamlined approach to the receipt of their entitlements, but also the debt that this nation owes to our veteran community. I am well aware of the fact that veterans prefer to do their dealings through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The department is solely focused on the needs and the welfare of our veteran community. Currently thousands of veterans receive a disability pension through my department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and an age pension through the Centrelink. The Liberal and National Party government have taken the view that two payments through two departments amount to duplication for veterans, which is simply not necessary. Veterans now will have the choice of receiving both entitlements as one payment through one department-the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is a common sense approach of this government. We are already seeing the veterans of our community supporting this approach. Already, 9,700 veterans have elected to have their Centrelink payment made through the Department of Veterans Affairs as part of their entitlement with their disability pension. The new system comes into being in March of next year. Unfortunately for our veteran community, that would have been possible in July of this year had it not been for the obstructionist approach the opposition took in the upper house when it joined with the Democrats in putting forward an unrelated amendment to the bill. The bill as it stood would have facilitated this approach much sooner than March of next year. Quite clearly, the opposition did not have the interests of the veteran community at heart when it took that approach in the upper house. This government is about delivering a streamlined service to our veteran community. We all owe a great debt of gratitude to our veteran community. We are making it happen. Waterfront",78
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, can you guarantee that no government money or undertakings are being committed or made to financially support the Dubai industrial mercenaries, either directly or indirectly, through intermediaries such as consultants or by way of promise of future award or preferment? Prime Minister, do you approve of industrial mercenaries being used in waterfront industrial disputes?",79
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is something I can guarantee-and that is that we will do more to fix up the waterfront than you did. Road Funding,79
103,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Minister, would you advise the House how the coalition government's transport reforms have benefited the people in my state of New South Wales and, in particular, the electorate of Paterson in the Hunter, an area long forgotten by the Labor Party?",79
104,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. I will run through some of the reforms. It is interesting to note that this government has allocated more than the Keating Labor government in road funding to New South Wales. We have allocated $338 million in the last budget compared with the last Labor Party budget of $311 million. We have also increased the categories of roads that we are funding in New South Wales, particularly in the area of the member for Paterson, where the Pacific Highway originates-the area of Hexham. Mr Fitzgibbon-At the expense of the New England highway.",79
105,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that the member for Hunter would not argue against some of the reforms that have taken place in that area or with the reforms to the national highway system in the electorates of the member for Paterson and the member for Hunter. We have reached an historic agreement with New South Wales and Queensland to spend $3.1 billion over 10 years upgrading the Pacific Highway under the roads of national importance program. Upgrading the highway under this reconstruction program will save 600 lives in 10 years. That is more Australians than were killed in the conflict in Vietnam. It is all about improved safety, efficiency and performance. Also under that category of roads of national importance with the Pacific Highway is the Summerland Way and the Kidman Way. This government has broadened its views on major economic roads and the support that the Commonwealth can provide in that area. We have also reinstituted the black spots program. It was highlighted by the member for Brisbane yesterday that the Labor Party had this program a number of years ago. But the Labor Party also axed the black spots program. They cut it out. The member for Charlton started it and it was a very good program. Mr Bevis-That was our program. We set it up.",79
106,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. Why did you cut the program? This government has reinstituted the black spots program. We have allocated $12 million a year to New South Wales, the state just of the member who asked the question. We are seeing 100 sites per year being assisted in New South Wales. I am sure there are some in the electorate of the member for Hunter. If he doesn't want them funded, we will put the funding somewhere else. Just as importantly as far as transport reform is concerned, unlike the previous government, we have addressed the issues surrounding the Sydney airport. As I outlined in an answer yesterday, this government went to the last election with a couple of key commitments with regard to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The first one was that we were going to re-open the east-west runway. We have done that. The east-west runway has been re-opened. We are also committed to redistributing aircraft noise. As of tomorrow we will see 55 per cent of movements over water, 17 to the north, 15 per cent to the west, and 13 per cent to the easta great reform as far as that very important element of transport infrastructure is concerned in Sydney, New South Wales-and Australia, because that airport is worth $8 billion per annum to the economy. Unlike the previous government-the Labor government-we are committed to a thorough, objective and transparent parent EIS process for the development of the second Sydney airport. We are pursuing that. Along with the 1995 Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney for the first time ever an independent auditor has been appointed to provide independent reports on the EIS and to provide the community with another source of information to allow them to respond to the issues raised in the draft EIS. This government is making transport reforms in a very positive way. It is doing that in consultation with the community. So in other words, in answer to the member's question, New South Wales has done far better from the coalition than from Labor.",79
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Disallowed Question",80
108,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, in relation to question that you ruled out of order-a question which I went to a lot of trouble to make sure was in order-it says in the standing and sessional orders that a question may be addressed to people other than the minister provided the matter is 'connected with the business of the House of which the member has charge'. I accept the fact that the Leader of the Opposition probably has no control over legislation, but in theory would he not responsible for the position of the opposition with respect to legislation of this House?",80
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I certainly reaffirm my earlier advice to you regarding the question, which was out of order, and I would continue to rule it out of order. But House of Representatives Practice has considered this question historically, and so too has the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure. If I recall it accurately, if a ber addresses a question to another member regarding a comment he has made outside the parliament then the question, historically, been ruled out of order. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, in a report I think dated 1996, reaffirmed the direction and the thrust of those original decisions by Speakers, and I have no intention of breaking that well established precedent. NA",80
110,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Might I seek indulgence, before I present the papers, to deal with the business of the House. Members are obviously concerned about the arrangements of the sitting in the next 24 to 48 hours. In respect of tomorrow, Thursday, the proposal is that the valedictories will be on after the matter of public importance. We may also then introduce some bills, but we do not expect that that would take much time, and we would expect to try to provide the usual half-hour adjournment so that we would hopefully, therefore, conclude at a civilised hour-if people are making dinner arrangements. As far as Friday is concerned, the proposal is that at the conclusion tomorrow the House would then suspend the sitting until Friday. Mr Crean-No question time!",80
111,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"In exactly the normal and conventional way, Friday would be, in theory, an extension of Thursday, and we will deal with House business only. At this stage we would expect the sitting to resume on Friday at 10 a.m., and the House would sit for as long as necessary to complete any outstanding items of government busine-s-for example, the appropriation bills-and, in particular, to deal with the Senate amendments to the be Native Title Amendment Bill when these are received.

114,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, could I ask the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to take on board-and if he is in a position to advise the House now, if not later-what the circumstance will be in terms of our sitting on the Friday if the Senate is still considering its position on the Native Title Amendment Bill such that we do not have the bill, in amended form, back here for our consideration. Is it the intention to still proceed on Friday? If so, what will we be dealing with? If it is not the intention to proceed on Friday until we have the material from the Senate, can he give some indication as to the likelihood of us continuing to sit into the weekend? This is something that all members would desire to know. Can I also say to him that we are very disappointed that in sitting on Friday they have chosen to squib another question time. But, after their disgraceful inability to answer these questions, we can understand why.",81
115,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,The Leader of the House may wish to respond.,81
116,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"You always know with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) that, in the end, he is barely a serious character when he talks about people squibbing question time. Friday will be an extension of Thursday. So when you are here on Friday it will actually, parliamentary time, be Thursday. We will deal with the matters then outstanding before us. As to all other matters and the various scenarios, I have to say that the Labor Party does actually have some responsibility for the responsible management of the Senate. I would ask him to use his influence with his colleagues in the Senate to Developensure a timely dealing of the issues. . MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE Transport Reform",81
117,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government's transport reform agenda. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places. Mr TANNER (Melbourne) (3.05 p.m.}-As I speak, upwards of 30 men are filing into the Burke Room at the Travelodge at Tullamarine airport to receive an initial briefing with respectto a trip to Dubai where they will be for roughly three months to train as stevedoring workers to be deployed on the Australian waterfront in lieu of existing waterfront workers. They will fly out tonight at 8.45 on Emirates flight EK69. The remainder of this force will be flying out on December 7, and some from Perth will be flying out on 10 December. These men are industrial mercenaries who have been recruited through the Australian defence forces, and they will be trained in a variety of stevedoring activities to be deployed as an alternative labour force, as a strike breaking labour force, as a scab labour force on the waterfront to attack the Maritime Union of Australia and the members of that union. The two key players in this are a Mr  are both directors of two companies that were formed in October this year-Fynwest Pty Ltd and the International Port Services Training Group Pty Ltd. It is worth noting that Fynwest Pty Ltd, which is the employer of the industrial mercenaries, is a $20 shelf company that was bought in October from Thrifty Shelf Company. The as that we have seen bandied around today by the Minister for Defence, Mr MCLachlan, were placed in the Army magazine on 30 October and 13 November this year. This advertisement called for trade specialists in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane-which happen to be the four main container ports in Australia. It claimed to provide an excellent career opportunity and competitive salary and the job entailed the licensed use of various heavy equipment, electricaVelectronic diagnostics and a range other activities that are clearly stevedoring related. We have the Australian workplace agreement that these people will be working to. That agreement provides for three classifications in clause 6-mobile plant, straddle fork driver",81
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl)Order! I am loath to interrupt the honourable member, but he has been speaking now for over two minutes and I am failing yet to see how he is going to tie this in with the failure of the transport reform agenda.",82
119,Mr TANNER,BUSINESS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am dealing with the failure of the government's transport reform agenda with respect to waterfront reform, which is part of the transport system. This is clearly a serious manifesorder, tation of the failure of the government's agenda without any shadow of a doubt. There are some very serious questions that the government has to answer about this and has failed to answer today. It is provided that these industrial mercenaries can be deployedMr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Waterfront reform is an industrial relations issue and is unrelated to the matter of public importance before the House. I ask you to bring him back to",82
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I thank the honourable member for North Sydney. I have already questioned the honourable member for Melbourne, who has indicated that he is going to relate this to the transport reform agenda. I invite the honourable member to continue.",82
121,Mr T ANNER,BUSINESS,"The industrial mercenaries will be paid between $46,000 and $60,000 per annum over three years. While they are in Dubai, they will stay at the Arenco Golden Sands Resort. They will be there for three months. They will return on 28 February next year when they will be engaged in three weeks training in New South Wales and then train between 120 and 180 other people who are also intended to be deployed on the waterfront. They have been told to describe themselves as emergency reservists, if there is any public examination of what they are of doing. They are going to be paid in lump sums-first on 28 February and then in June-into bank accounts. It is worth noting that Dubai and the United Arab Emirates, of which it is part, are recorded in recent US State Department literature as having no unions, no strikes and no labour rights of any equivalence to Australia. Let us look at Mr Wells and Mr Kilfoyle. Mr Wells is a former commando and Vietnam veteran who was a captain in the army. He runs an organisation called Multi-placement Recruiting which advertises 'excellent discipline, not Rambo/Secret Service image.'",82
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! I call the honourable member for North Sydney on what I hope is not a trivial point of order. Mr Hockey-No, it is not a trivial point of Mr Deputy Speaker. He is talking about matters relating to individuals who mayor may not be employed in defence forces, which is absolutely unrelated to the matter of public importance before the House. I ask you to bring him back to-",82
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I thank the honourable member for North Sydney. I do invite the honourable member for Melbourne to come specifically to the point about transport reform.,82
124,Mr TANNER,BUSINESS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this is about reform of the Australian waterfront, which is part of our transport system, and a scam that is being undertaken on the waterfront that is getting under way today, which is directly relevant to Australia's transport system. Mr Wells advertises services that indicate that he and his company can maintain up-todate training and contact regarding overseas methods employed by kidnappers and terrorists, first-class weapons handling of numerous types, use of concealed batons and unarmed combat techniques. Mr Kilfoyle, who is a recently discharged bankrupt and former ex-SAS commando, has skills advertised on his behalf, including electronic surveillance, private investigation, training in small arms, close quarters personal control, including unarmed combat techniques, restraints, holds and blocks, use of a baton, use of handcuffs and various methods of searching offenders. This is reminiscent of the 'New Guard' and the 'White Army' in the 1920s and 1930s in Australia. This is reminiscent of the Sandline mercenaries in Bougainville. Are these the skillsthat are needed to improve the productivity on Australia's waterfront? Is this the government's approach to industrial relations-bring in the heavies, bring in the spies and bring in the military types to boot the crap out of all the people the waterfront? Is this how they will sort out the wharfies-electronic surveillance and people who are obviously trained in violence? The question that this government has to answer is: who is behind Peter Kilfoyle and Michael Wells? Where are the millions of dollars necessary to fly people to Dubai and to pay them salaries for three years coming from? What government involvement is there? Is there any government money in this? Is there any money being laundered through other parties-for example, consultants? Is the Defence Department or the military involved and, if so, in what way? Are any serving officers involved? Why was this advertisement run twice in the official army publication? What involvement and what knowledge do the ministers, including the Prime Minister, have? What deals or arrangements have been made with the government of the United Arab Emirates, which, it is worth pointing out, owns the port of Dubai. The ruling family of the United Arab Emirates happens to own the company that supplies the labour. So it would be very surprising if there has been no connection at all between the government of the United Arab Emirates and the Australian government on these matters. What private companies have been involved and what commitments have been made to those companies and who drafted a very thorough and very professionally presented Australian workplace agreement-all from a $20 company with two ex-military people not of obviously substantial means? If the government, as it has said today, denies any role in all of this, why is the advertisement published in an official army newspaper and how likely is it that private companies are going to invest millions of dollars in an escapade of this nature with no indication from the government of support or willingness to facilitate the entry of this industrial mercenary labour force onto the docks? How likely is it that the United Arab Emirates government is going to agree to this sort of approach and to this sort of escapade iti its own backyard without discussing the matter with representatives of the Australian on government? How likely is it that we have fast-tracked passports and visas for up to 70 men who are answering an ad that was in the paper two weeks ago? Mr Andrew-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not easily provoked but I do believe that the member for Melbourne is currently abusing your ruling. We have now sat through this debate for over half the time allocated to the first speaker on the MPI without direct reference to the matter related to the MPI.",83
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"I thank the Chief Government Whip. I. do say to the honourable member for Melbourne that I have been listening very carefully. I have noted on about three or four occasions that you have thrown away the line of waterfront you have mainly been talking about terrorism, weapons and the United Arab Emirates. Mr Bevis-And his remarks are relevant.",83
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I don't need your assistance. I am yet to hear you relate your argument to the transport reform agenda in Australia.,84
127,Mr TANNER,BUSINESS,"Let us talk about the twice-in consultancies that this government has had about waterfront reform: $1.3 million, most of it to Liberal Party mates and $685,000 ACIL and to David Trebeck, formerly of National Farmers Federation. They have refused to provide to the parliament any details about what is in that report and the other reports of Liberal Party mates and about what sort of material and activities those people have been involved in. Stephen Webster and John Davies are former staffers of the Premier of Tasmania, Robin Gray. Stephen Webster is a former staffer of Andrew Peacock. Mark Textor-the nose? infamous Mark Textor of push-polling fameis paid $42,000. What for? What is his experabout tise on waterfront reform? You have a situaget. tion where the government is providing millions of dollars and refusing to say where that money is being spent, on what sorts activities, in spite of the Senate passing return to order motion. The Minister for Workplace Relations Small Business (Mr Reith) is all the time unctuously saying, 'I am consulting. I am being frank with the Maritime Union. I am being reasonable. We will have another being meeting.' He has met twice with them. He said that he is just being frank and construcrid tive. He says he has no knowledge of escapade that is under way today, yet it was advertised in the army newspaper twice. Industrial productivity on the waterfront is istered improving-something that the government refuses to acknowledge. It needs to improve a bit more, but it is improving. It has gone substantially in the last quarter. We have a massive misinformation campaign from this government about productivity on the waterthe front. We have had outrageous statementsto outrageous lies-about the level of pay of reform but many waterside workers. We have had implications, including a press release from the former minister saying that a teenage prank of blowing up the letterbox of his former adviser on maritime affairs was in some way the work of the Maritime Union. The Prime Minister has stood in here saying that perishables have been left rotting on the waterfront by the MUA. When he is askedquestions on notice to give examples, he refuses to. John Sharp is parading around the country talking about the nickto John Sharp, the expert on the nick; the man the who invented the nick. Today we have the exposure of an outrageous scam, an outrageous escapade. It is gradually coming to light. This government has to answer a variety of questions about what is going on in waterfront reform in this country. If, as the government claims, it does not know-in spite of the whole thing being advertised in one of the army's own publications-why on earth does it not know about what is going on under its This is about industrial mercenaries. It is as outrageous and improper as it can This is Australia's Sandline. It is deceit and duplicity on a grand scale. You have people connected with the defence forcesof ex-SAS people, ex-commandos-being used a to attack workers on the waterfront. They are workers who have committed no offence; and workers who are complying with the industrial relations laws of this country; workers who are not even on strike; workers who are just doing their daily work. But people are sent across Dubai to be trained to take their places and to get in there and help get of them. This parliament needs to know the what role the government or any of the government ministers, staff of the government ministers or people in the departments adminby those ministers have in this entire outrageous escapade. This is a brutal assault on the perceived up enemies of this government-the waterside had workers. It is a bad game, a dangerous game, involving people in the military and people in defence department. It is a clear attempt provoke not just war on the waterfront but outright nuclear war on the waterfront. The government should immediately take stock of what is going on in its waterfront reform program and what it is actually doing. It should find out precisely what it does not know-if we can take the minister at face value today. It should repudiate these mercenaries-the Prime Minister had the opportunity to do that and he refused to do it-and it should withdraw any support that is going to this project. It should provide all details to this parliament of its involvement in this outrageous scheme, and it should convene an independent inquiry to determine precisely what sort of involvement it and any of its officers, its ministers or staffers in the offices of those ministers have in this whole business. The episode is a deeply embarrassing scandal for this .government. It is reminiscent of the sorts of things that go on in military dictatorships. If people are being taken out of the military and leaving the country in response to an advertisement in the army's official newspaper so they can be trained to be deployed as strike breakers, as job stealers and as people on the waterfront who are going to get rid of the Maritime Union of Australia, then we have on our hands a very serious situation indeed. It is something that this government has to be called to account for. This parliament should be able to know what arrangements have been made, who is involved and who is behind Michael Wells, Peter Kilfoyle, Fynwest Pty Ltd and International Port Services Training Group Pty Ltd. It should be able to know who is putting up the money: who is paying the air fares for the travel to Dubai, who is paying the bills for the Arenco resort, and who is paying the $10 million worth of wages for three years? Who is paying all this? What is going on with waterfront reform? What involvement does the government have in this outrageous episode?",84
128,Mr VAILE,BUSINESS,"It is a pity that the shadow minister, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) did not talk about transport reform. All he spoke about was more jaunts overseas to Dubai. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall the last time the member for Melbourne proposed a matter of public importance-I understand it was back on 13 February 1997. At least today he remembered to stay in the House to move it. Back in February he moved a matter of public importance regarding 'the failure of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to ensure proper arrangements for guaranteeing aviation safety in this nation'. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you were in the chair, that you called for at least eight members of the opposition to stand in support of the motion, and then you said, 'The honourable member for Melbourne is not here. The discussion lapses in the absence of the honourable member for Melbourne.' Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: This has got nothing to do with transport or waterfront reform.

So the member for Melbourne's last effort and this effort are on a paralleL It is important that we take the opportunity today to put the government's record on transport reform on the record. It goes right across all transport sectors. I note that the shadow minister has made a speech in recent times about intermodal interfaces. He concentrated 15 minutes on one mode of transport in the MPI this afternoon and ignored some of the most important problem areas of transport in Australia that this government has attacked. They are in the areas of rail reform, aviation and airport sales-as far as the national transport planning task force is concerned, when the former minister tabled that report, in the dying days of the previous Labor government, he buried the recommendations within it-not to mention the reforms that this government has undertaken in the last 18 months on roads. It seems we started this debate on waterfront reform. Let us just have a look at a couple of the critical issues that hang around the neck of the Labor Party like an albatross as far as waterfront reform is concerned. Under its failed waterfront industry reform program, the WIRA program, the Labor Party was prepared to see over $400 million spent basically to payout wharfies who were no longer needed to do the work on the Australian waterfront. It was a frank acknowledgment that the waterfront was grossly overmanned and that the community needed and deserved a more efficient stevedoring industry. Earlier this year, the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne, acknowledged the failure of the WIRA program, saying: Unfortunately the process of reform stalled some time. That was at a cost of $400 million to the taxpayer. A lot of those wharfies who were paid out came back in through the side door, working as casual operators on the waterfront. The other exercise that was of great embarrassment to the Labor Party was their failed attempt to sell ANL. When the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) was the minister, he said you could not give it away. The then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said, 'Look, Laurie, you had better get the cleaners into fix this problem up at ANL.' He took him seriously and he did get the cleaners in. He brought in Malcolm Turnbull and Neville Wran and paid them nearly a million dollars, but that failed as well. It has taken this government to get ANL up to a point where it is in a saleable form. This government, as one of its substantial transport reforms, will go ahead and sell ANL in a profitable manner, not give it away and not waste any more money on ANL the way the Labor Party did. Neither will it waste any more money on the waterfront the way the Labor Party did when they were in government. I would like to outline, in my response to the shadow minister for transport, a number of the very positive reforms that this government has undertaken and implemented in its first term in a little over 18 months. The Labor Party did not even attempt to tackle a lot of these issues over 14 years but, in the scant comments in their platform, they now say they are going to do it. They were going to do it in the 14th year. They had 13 years to do it but they just did not quite get it done. We will start with rail reform. The record of the opposition was one of total failure as far as rail was concerned. In 13 years in government and after 18 months in opposition, their draft platform for rail reform is an embarrassment. They have promised to do things that this government is already doing and they have promised to do things they either opposed or failed to do in 13 years. During their 13 years in government, we saw the Labor Party absolutely gut Australian National. They cost 7,000 rail jobs through for their neglect and incompetence, and that was confirmed in a speech that Senator Schacht made in the Senate recently. They gutted AN, they lost 7,000 rail jobs and, in their last seven years, 16 rail lines in South Australia were closed. They closed the Adelaide to Victor Harbor line, they closed the Adelaide to Peterborough line, they closed the Adelaide to Broken Hill line, they closed the Adelaide to Why alIa line and they closed the Adelaide to Mount Gambier line. That was their policy of transport reform-to close it down. They gutted AN to try to prop up National Rail and all they did was cost 7,000 rail jobs. The Australian taxpayer subsidised AN by $750 million in the last five years of Labor alone, and this government has had to spend $2 billion to fix Labor's neglect. The sale of AN to the private sector has resulted in three new rail operators in Australia with local and international experience. Transrail, the private rail operator in New Zealand, was 50 per cent more efficient than AN in only two years of private sector operation. It is now carrying 15 per cent more freight and is expanding into new markets and into new services. The new rail owners in South Australia and Tasmania are contractually committed to investing nearly $100 million in rail over the next four to five years. Some have already announced plans to invest more and already old rail lines closed under Labor are being reopened or examined for reopening. That is positive transport reform, not the negative stuff that we have seen in their platform, not the negative stuff we saw from Labor over 13 years and not the negative rubbish we heard in the shadow minister's address here this afternoon. As far as national rail is concerned, Labor's bungled efforts to reform interstate rail simply resulted in the death of AN and the loss of 7,000 jobs in South Australia-all under the tutelage of the Labor Party. That is absolutely outrageous. There is no doubt that a lot of people who would normally support the Labor Party in the union movement have supported the rail reform program undertaken by the government as well as the privatisation of AN, which has seen the maintenance of rail operations in South Australia and in Tasmania. In addition, many hundreds of jobs have been maintained. The Labor Party would have seen the loss of not only those 7,000 jobs but also the loss of the rest of the jobs that were associated with AN. This privatisation has breathed new life into those rail operations. Tasmania they are going to expand, with a commitment to investment and a commitment to creating more jobs. In another very important area of transport reform, I want to mention some of the changes that have been made at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I have alluded to them in a couple of questions this week, which is an important week as far as the operations at KSA are concerned. This airport injects $8 billion into the local economy. It is a very important piece of transport infrastructure that, again, was neglected under Labor. We have recognised the importance of the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport not only to Sydney but also to the broader community. On being elected last year, we committed this government to reopening the east-west runway. That was done in a very short time and, as I said yesterday, in 'sharp' fashion by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). We also committed to equitably distribute airport noise. The long-term operating plan that has been developed in conjunction with the Sydney Airport Forum, chaired by the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey), is going to be implemented tomorrow. It will see 55 per cent of movements over water and 17 per cent of movements to the north over the suburb of Sydenham, which is represented by the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), as well as over the suburbs represented by the Prime Minister, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Ten per cent of those movements will be inbound aircraft landings. The former minister for transport, when he reformed the flight paths around Sydney, ended up with one per cent of movements over his electorate. The member for Bennelong is going to have 17 per cent, and there will be 13 per cent to the east and 15 per cent to the west: That is equity and that is about maintaining that most important piece of transport infrastructure in Sydney-the Kingsford Smith airport-which generates $8 billion. We have expanded the operations and activities of airlines into Sydney. We are opening up capacity into Australia. Each extra jumbo jet that we allow to travel into AustralIn is is worth in excess of $22 million a year to the local economy and 640 jobs. That is transport reform, not the nonsense that the opposition was going on with in this debate on the MPI this afternoon. This government is absolutely committed to transport reform. It is committed to transport reform that is going to deliver jobs to Australians. It is committed to transport reform that is going fo deliver a better bottom line to the Australian economy. We heard today from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that in the last quarter the GDP increased 1.5 per cent and that we were on target with our budget estimates. That is what the reforms that this government is implementing are going to achieve. That is what they are going to deliver to Australia. As .far as airport reform and transport reform in regard to aviation is concerned, we have moved on from where the Labor Party stalled over the sale of airports. We have gone on with the sale of long-term leases for Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports, receiving almost $3.5 billion for them. The most the former government had expected from the sale of the 22 airports-not just those three-was $2 billion. We have got the other 15 airports to g-they are in the process of that privatisation at the moment. So the coalition government is achieving in transport reform, particularly in the aviation sector. I come to the area of road transport, which is absolutely vital to the transport economy Australia. There are somewhere in the vicinity of 17,000 road transport operators in Australia who generate $60 billion worth of economic activity. These are the people whom the member for Melbourne completely ignored in his address during the MPI debate this afternoon. He spoke about a trip to Dubai, allegedly by a group of people for some form of training, but he completely ignored the people employed in the transport sector who are doing the job in Australia to bolster our economy; and we need to get on the record this afternoon what this government has done in that regard. We have broadened the horizons of the involvement of the government in road transport. We are funding the national highway system. Mr Fitzgibbon interJecting",85
131,Mr V AILE,BUSINESS,"I just want to respond to some of the interjections by the member for Hunter. In the last 12 months the member for Hunter has received $66 million for the Belford Bends in his electorate. Under the national highway system, the government has just agreed to complete Leneghan's Drive at the intersection of the New England Highway and the Pacific Highway, which is at the bottom end of his electorate. That work is going to help the flow of traffic through his electorate. We have put in $5 million to duplicate the Raymond Terrace bypass, which was started by the Greiner government in New South Wales. The former Labor government here in Canberra refused to assist the Greiner government with that bypass. So we are going to go on and complete that. In regard to road transport reform and the funding that this government is applying to the broader area of roads, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the all important Pacific Highway is included in the category we have created of roads of national importance. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would venture to say that you have argued for that every minute of your time in this place-and you have been the member for Cowper for a very long time-and it took the HowardFischer government to deliver on that. The Labor Party spoke about it for 13 years. They signed an agreement at the end of their 13th of year and now they are saying, 'We were going to do it in the 14th year.' That is another one of the promises that they were going to deliver on in their 14th year. We are committed to that agreement with the New South Wales government for $3.1 billion to be spent over 10 years on the Pacific Highway. Just in closing and most importantly and to the embarrassment of the Labor Party, when we spoke about black spots yesterday the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) was interjecting, 'We started it'. They started it but the Keating government also cut the funds for that program. We have reintroduced them and, as I said today, there have been 100 projects around New South Wales funded under black spots. They are part of the positive reforms that this government has implemented in the last 18 months. (Time expired)",88
132,Mr MCMULLAN,BUSINESS,"Canberra) (3.35 p.m.)The very important matter of public importance that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has raised today-the failure of the government's transport reform agenda--opens up, as he did in his remarks, a very important analysis about the consequences of that failure. It will lead Australians who hear this story to ask, 'What are you doing to our country?' We are seeing in this country developments we have not seen in Australia before, or at least that we have not seen since the days of the New Guard in the 1930s. As a consequence of the failure of other initiatives, to which I will come in a moment, where attempts were made to smash their way through to achieve change on the waterfront, we now have for the first time in the recollection of anybody in this chamber-perhaps the first time in our history-covert operations involving industrial mercenaries. What are the grounds for suspecting that the government might be involved in this, apart from the comprehensive way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) ducked the last question? He decided that he did not want to give a guarantee that there was no government money involved. He did not even want to condemn the idea. We gave him the invitation by saying, 'All right, if you don't know anything about it, condemn the idea of industrial mercenaries being introduced like this.' Not one word. Not a moment's hesitation to say, 'Well, I want to find out a bit more detail.' He said nothing about condemnation-no guarantees of no government funds. None of us would be surprised he did not give that guarantee because it feeds exactly into everybody's assessment of why it is likely-apart from the evidence to which I will refer-that this measure is in the knowledge of at least some ministers in this government, of their advisers or of consultants they have hired, because they have an absolute obsession with industrial relations on the waterfront. It was extraordinary that, when the member for Melbourne started his discussion about the situation on the waterfront, we had a point of order from the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) saying that the waterfront is not an issue about transport but an issue about industrial relations. There is a very profound industrial relations question here but it is a transport issue. This is very important to the nature of the transport operations in this country. If these industrial mercenaries come onto the wharf it will have consequences for Australia's transport that will not be good. This government have an obsession with the waterfront. When waterfront industrial relations issues come before them, they lose what judgment they have; they do things they would not otherwise do. Whatever the evidence is that points to the connection-and it is beginning to emerge and there will be more-at the very least we know one thing: this government have made it possible. First and foremost they have created the climate in which individuals might wish to do thisMr Robert Brown-Absolutely.",88
133,Mr MCMULLAN,BUSINESS,"Absolutely. They have advocated it; they have created the climate for it; they have made it possible. Every time the most radical employers have taken the most extreme actions anywhere in Australia they have had the cheer squad led by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). They have created the climate and what the member for Melbourne proved beyond doubt is that they have created the legal framework within which it can occur. There is no doubt about that. That evidence was displayed here today. There are plenty of suggestions and indications, for example, in the question from the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) about the way in which the government have facilitated this. We suspect that with their mates in Victoria they have done even more than that. What do we know? We know that the last attempt at waterfront reform failed. In Cairns the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business thought he. was in it up to his armpits. The truth is that he was in it just above his nose. And that failed. When did it fail? It failed in the middle of September. When did this project begin to emerge? October. Within weeks of the failure of the Cairns stunt we get the industrial mercenary stunt. The next bit of this desperate attempt to change the waterfront system is being taken not because there is any law being broken on the waterfront, not because people are not working in accordance with their awards and conditions and the laws of the country, but because these are taxpayer Australians who just annoy the government-they will not do what the government tells them to do. We know we had a failure in Cairns, and three weeks later we have this new trick. We know the nature of these $20 companies entering into contracts. What do we know? There is no agreement for them to be able to put this labour on any wharf in Australia. They have no approval to operate on any wharf in Australia, yet they have made hundredsof thousands of dollars of commitments to employ these people to do what? They train them. Where are they going to work? Where is the approval for them to operate? Who is going to employ these people? Why have they made this commitment without any government in Australia knowing about it, giving approval. for it, guaranteeing some work or coming to, at least, some nod and wink arrangement, guarantee or underwriting? We now begin to think we know what the Prime Minister meant in September when he said, 'Watch this space.' It may have been a cover up for being vacant; but we think it was that he knew this operation was under way and he wanted to make some little cunning reference to it-like he did not want to deny it today. When given the opportunity to deny it he chose not to. We begin to know that there are some Department of Defence connections in this. The first evidence of that is beginning to emerge even today. There are still many questions left unanswered about this, some of which we will pursue tomorrow and if the government were to change its mind and have question time on Friday we would pursue some more. If we are here on Saturday-more is the pity-we will still be ready to pursue some more. But we do not mind if we do not sit on Saturday-it is quite all right. What is the essence of this issue that is emerging as a consequence of profound failure on the waterfront-failure to achieve either the legitimate public policy purpose of improved productivity or the real hidden political agenda of smashing the MUA and trying, through that way, to smash the trade union movement in this country? The essence of it is this: it is not a good thing for Australthe is. We do not need, we do not want and there is no place in Australia for these covert paramilitary style industrial mercenaries to take on Australians going about their lawful business. These Australians are not the enemy. They are Australians. Why are you fighting them? Why are we going to all this trouble? Why is a $20 company able to do all this? Who are these two people whose expertise until now has been advertised as unarmed combat, security and surveillance? But, of course, they are not Rambos. How do these people with those personal characteristics, no background on the waterfront and no money set up two companies? This very much goes to the question of the funding of an operation that has dire consequences for the waterfront in this country, for the harmony of this society, for the health and well-being of our country in its operations. And why? Because the government's other attempts to achieve this have failed. We saw it most starkly in Cairns when the minister for industrial relations was ringing Jimbo in the middle of the night. Do you remember the phone calls to Jimbo? I bet Jimbo remembers them. He thought it was a nightmare. But it was just the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I wonder if he still believes it was true or whether he thinks he dreamt it? How do we have a circumstance where all this could happen with no guarantees, no undertakings, no contracts and no offers of support? 'We will just go and commit ourselves to $500,000 a month with $100,000 of air fares alone-an agreement with the government of the. UAB to operate training on their wharf. But we will just take a punt. No worries; we will get the money and maybe someone will let us operate on the wharf.' The way this government is going about reform of the waterfront is un-Australian and has no place in this country. As it becomes clearer, it will be rejected by this country. (Time expired)",89
134,Mr HARDGRAVE,BUSINESS,"I am very pleased to join this matter of public importance discussion today. I think the matter of public importance proposed by shadow minister for 'not' transport is quite an interesting and worthwhile contribution to the debate that should be taking place in this place. It seems to me that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has joined the tactics committee of those opposite. I thought she may have had the exclusive franchise on fantasy, but it seems pretty obvious to me that the very best that the opposition party in this place can come up with is a cross between Frederick Forsyth, Robert Ludlum, Mills and Boon and perhaps DC Comics. Mr Andrew-Not Mills and Boon.",90
135,Mr HARDGRAVE,BUSINESS,"I am sorry to pick on Mills and Boon. They have a far more reputable and believable story line than some of the nonsense we have had peddled here today. Every time. I hear the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) talk about ordinary Australians, I am left wondering if he has actually ever met one. It seems to me that, if he was concerned about the lot of the ordinary people of Australia, as he put it, the people who aspire to work, the people who in small business in my electorate and in so many others around this country want to grow their businesses and generate some real jobs, he would in fact be talking to the Maritime Union of Australia about getting real about being part of waterfront reform. He would not be simply making some sort of vain attempt to justify his next preselection. As those on this side appreciate, those opposite are very beholden to the MUA. It is, after all, the jewel in the crown of the union movement in this country. I see that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is here. We both participated in a similar debate about the MUA a few months ago. We dealt with the issue of how important the MUA is to the whole business of the union movement in this country. I remember saying at the time that I do not believe the MUA represent workers. They in fact represent the glitterati; they represent the absolute upper crust of the employed people in this country. If they truly represented workers, they would also get behind the idea of proper waterfront reform. There is no way ordinary Australians can get access to jobs on the waterfront in this country because of the MUA and their like. Grandfathers have locked up the jobs for their grandsons. In fact, those who are currently on the wharves are living off the hard work of their grandfathers more often than not. I find the matter of public importance before us today a very important one. I think it is vital that we get reform back on track. I would certainly like to debate transport and transport reform and the way that the various modes of transport should link together in this country. I think the matter of public importance before us is very clear, and it is important that we recognise that this government has in its mind an absolute dedication to the notion of reforming all the various modes of transport in this country. It has total dedication to the concept of making all those linkages that are necessary. After all, it is a basic role of government in this country, and has been since 1788, that government should be the vehicle for infrastructure. We have a very large country and a sparse population. If one of the basic tenets of government in this country is not providing proper infrastructure, the means by which we can support those who aspire to run their own business and grow jobs, if we do not support those sorts of people by providing proper and reliable infrastructure and means of transport, we are letting down the whole country. In the final analysis, that sums up the lot of the opposition in today's debate. After all, they have turned their back on the reality of the matter of public importance that they themselves proposed. Instead of talking about means of reforming transport, instead of talking about a dedication to the creation of real jobs and the growing of business in this country to generate those real jobs, they have talked about anything else but. It is all about trying to prop up the MUA and make members of the MUA executive feel well disposed towards them in time for the preselections, which we all know are taking place in the ranks of those opposi teo Oh boy, that 14th year would have been a beauty if the Keating regime had been able to hold on on 2 March last year. I cannot fully account for the number of times we have heard in this place all of the things they were going to do if only they had had a 14th year. There is no doubt in my mind that it would have been an absolute beauty, if they had only had that 14th year. Given the record of the 13 years preceding it, we would probably have had a $15 billion black hole, a $15 billion debt to tidy up. The work we have had to do to repair some of the basic institutions in this country would have been a bigger job. Talking about repairs, this government has taken upon itself as its first job to repair some of the basic transport infrastructure problems in this country. Our next job is to rebuild and to reinvigorate-to send the right signal to the people of Australia to get on with the job of growing their business and creating more jobs. As far as infrastructure is concerned, be it roads, rail, wharves or airports, the story is in a lot of ways much the same. When we came to government, there was without a doubt a lack of certainty for people who were interested in road construction. We have managed to bring about a number of reforms which provide greater certainty. I think the reconstruction of the Pacific Highway over 10 years is a fine step forward. I think it is a good example of just how committed this government is to getting on with the practical things that government should do. Let us talk about rail infrastructure. The infrastructure of rail in this country is down to an abysmal mess. There is urgent need for reform to try to ensure that people have access to the publicly funded infrastrucBrisbane ture, the tracks, to try to bring about some competition between competing providers means of getting along that infrastructure. These are reforms this government is bringing in, and this is a good thing. We also have the question of airports. We have already heard about the success of the sale of the Brisbane airport. That will bring private capital and private determination what was a publicly owned piece of infrastructure to ensure that we are going to see good results as far as transport in and out of Brisbane airport is concerned. In my own electorate of Moreton, Archerfield Airport is part of the second string of sales which is being overseen so effectively by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who I see is in the chamber right now. I am very confident, talking to people at Archerbenefit field Airport, that they are looking forward the regime which will come, which will bring them the opportunity to expand their businesMUA, ses through this particular piece of infrastrucwhich ture. While the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) has very effectively chaired matters in relation to aircraft movements around Sydney airport, Brisbane airport, as I and member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall), the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) and the member for Bowman (Mrs West) certainly realise, suffered because of the Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). He had one of those cosy deals which flicked all the loud aircraft out of Sydney when it got a little hot for him a couple of years ago and based them out of Brisbane. So each day we were getting six or eight very noisy old 727s taking off on a Brisbane to Melbourne or a Brisbane to Cairns leg over the top of our electorates. Already, in the space of 20 months, our reforms as far as transport is concernedMr Bevis-What?",90
136,Mr HARDGRA VE,BUSINESS,"The member for Brisbane does not even realise there were loud aircraft over his electorate. Perhaps he should spend a bit more time in his electorate. run One of the things I and those other three members have managed to do is get those noisy aircraft moved, and the member for is an absolute beneficiary out of this, as are the people of the electorate of Brisof bane. We have managed to bring about some changes to the approaches and departure routes. We have managed to bring about some good, straightforward, sensible reforms as far as transport is concerned. Let us tum to the waterfront. After all the in waterfront seems to have figured strongly into the contribution of those opposite. Mr Andrew-That's a bit generous.",92
137,Mr HARDGRA VE,BUSINESS,"l agree, it is a bit generous. Perhaps, being generous, the question of the waterfront was implied in the contribution from those opposite today. Mr Andrew-It's a bit tenuous.",92
138,Mr HARDGRAVE,BUSINESS,"It might be a bit tenuous, but nevertheless I will give them the of so many doubts. While we saw to those opposite spend $400 million, basically to payout their mates, the wharfies in the we really saw no benefit as a result, is something those opposite fail to realise. It was an absolute failure for the taxpayer. It really was a frank acknowledgment from those opposite of the gross overmanning of the waterfront and of the gross the inefficiencies there. As we saw the shadow minister for transport, the proposer of this matter of public importance, acknowledge a little while ago, the process of reform itself member for was stalled for some time. It is certainly obvious to me that those opposite, by the tone of the debate they have too carried on with today, want to see the status quo remain. They want to see waterfront reform fall down a big hole. They want to make sure none of the reforms which should be brought about in the general transport sector occur. They want to avoid results. How typical of the 13 years they were in power. The nonsense of their argument today absolutely proves the point: they do not know what they are doing in transport reform. They are embarrassed by it. They have concocted a wonderful yam today, and do not let the facts get in the way of a good story.",92
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Mr Nehl)Order! This discussion has concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",93
140,Mr FAHEY,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997 contains a number of technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. This bill contains the majority of the provisions introduced into the 37th parliament as the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1995, which received, in the main, support from all parties. These amendments were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 1993 federal election, tabled on 16 November 1994. In addition to those amendments, there are further amendments included in this bill, which result from recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report entitled Electoral redistributions, which was tabled on 19 December 1995. The government's response to that report was tabled in the last few days. Further, the bill also contains technical amendments arising from some of the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the conduct of the 1996 federal election, which was tabled on 16 June 1997. Other recommendations of that report relating to matters of electoral reform are currently being considered. Some of the amendments arising from the 1993 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters include: enabling the Australian Electoral Commission to delegate to staff its powers to supply and charge for goods and services and provide that such goods and services may be supplementary or an alternative to those already supplied under joint roll arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states; improving the enrolment objection process, by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection deposit; allowing canvassing in and around hospitals that are polling places other than on polling day and in special hospitals other than during the five days before and including polling day. Currently, canvassing is prohibited from the issue of the writ until the close of polling; allowing the AEC to use state-of-the-art security printing methods in the printing of ballot papers rather than relying on watermarked ballot paper. This will result in savings estimated at $800,000 in ballot paper storage and production costs, as the AEC is currently required to store enough watermarked paper for two electoral events; extending the two-candidate preferred count conducted in polling places on polling night to the fresh scrutiny and declaration vote scrutinies conducted by the divisional returning .officers in the week following polling day; allowing for the provision of gender information to members, senators and registered political parties and for use in approved medical research and public health screening surveys; providing state and territory electoral administrations with access to electoral roll information, including gender, date of birth and occupation information, of all other states and territories. This will assist in the maintenance of the joint electoral rolls as well as improving the service to electors for both state/territory and federal elections. The amendments recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its Electoral redistributions report are also technical and of a non-controversial nature. These include: providing for the advertisement calling for suggestions and comments relating to a redistribution to be placed by the Electoral Commissioner rather than the redistribution committee so as to allow interested parties to prepare suggestions while the appointment of the redistribution committee is being arranged; providing for the determination of state and territory representation entitlements to fall due in the 13th month of the first meeting of the House of Representatives rather than the 10th month. The effect of this amendment is to enable the population figures to be one calendar quarter closer to those applying at the time of the next election than is currently the case; providing that comments and suggestions relating to redistributions be available for public scrutiny in a manner similar to suggestions; removing the requirement that persons or organisations must object to a redistribution committee proposal to be able to lodge an objection to an augmented Electoral Commission's proposed redistribution; bringing the membership of a redistribution committee for the Australian Capital Territory into line with the equivalent body for a state; and allowing for the redistribution midpoint equality of enrolments to be within a range of 3.5 per cent above or below the average, rather than the current two per cent. This, together with the amendment requiring redistribution committees to give existing boundaries less weight than other criteria such as community of interest, will allow redistribution committees greater flexibility in determining boundaries, especially with respect to very large rural divisions. The bill also contains a number of technical amendments arising from recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters 1996 federal election report. These amendments include: allowing Australians resident overseas for career and employment reasons to remain enrolled, or to enrol and obtain eligible overseas elector status, up to two years after departure from Australia under similar criteria as that currently in place for itinerant electors. It will also provide that eligible overseas elector status may be granted for a period of six years rather than the current three years; reducing the nomination period by one day, with the declaration of nominations taking place 24 hours after the close of nominations. Very often, there are last minute nominations which, like all others, must be carefully checked. This amendment will allow the ABC more time for checking nominations and seeking any necessary legal advice without having to indefinitely delay the declaration process. This will prevent inconvenience to candidates and the media, who currently are required to wait some hours during a particularly busy period at the beginning of the election campaign for the declaration and ballot paper draw to commence; increasing the nomination deposits from $250 to $350 in the House of Representatives and from $500 to $750 in the Senate. Currently, nomination fees are too modest to dissuade candidates who can only acquire a handful of votes. Nomination fees have not been altered since 1983 and the increase is well below the rate of inflation since 1983; increasing the number of signatures required in support of a nomination from a candidate not endorsed by a registered political party from six to 50. A registered political party nominating a candidate is required to have at least 500 members. Accordingly, potential candidates should be required to demonstrate a modest level of support at the time of nomination; allowing electors to vote outside, but in close proximity to, a polling place if the presiding officer is satisfied that, through illness or disability, the elector is unable to enter the polling place. Scrutineers will be invited to observe the process; allowing for the declaration of the poll proceed for a House of Representatives ballot papers. election based on the result of the two candidate preferred count where, on the basis of first preferences, the exclusion all but two candidates is inevitable. This will allow the official declaration to ceed in some divisions earlier rently the case; removing the infamous section 329A and related provisions. This is the provision which ultimately led to the Albert Langer during the 1996 federal election. The related amendments will remove the provision which effectively provided for optional preferential voting in House of Representatives elections; and removing the requirement that registered first time. political parties submit returns of electoral expenditure, and including that they may submit audited accounts in a form approved by the ABC in place of annual returns provided that they contain the required level move: of detail. The bill will greatly assist the AEC's efficiency in conducting the next election allowing for the conduct of Senate scrutinies by a computer process.

The Superannuation Legislation (Commonby wealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1997 is one of a package of three bills, the other bills being the Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1997 and the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment-Saving and Transitional ProviBill 1997. The main purpose of the bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth's civilian can participate in our choice of funds policy announced in the 1997 budget. This will give them greater flexibility and control over their superannuation arrangeAt present, many Commonwealth employ"" ees are tied to membership of the public of sector superannuation scheme, PSS, or the closed Commonwealth superannuation scheme, CSS. The bill will close the PSS to members from 1 July 1998 and new the employees will be able to choose from superMatannuation arrangements made available by the their employers. From 1 July 2000, CSS and of PSS members will, if they wish, be able to eleccease active membership and choose the alternative superannuation arrangements made time available by their employers. The bill will provide for the entitlements of CSS members who exercise choice to be based on the resignation deferred benefit, but adjusted to ensure no windfall gains for members or increase in unfunded liabilities. The bill will make a number of other amendments to various superannuation acts covering civilian employees. For example, it includes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow CSS members to transfer amounts held in the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust or other funds to the CSS fund. It will also amend that act so that reversionary benefits may be paid to a CSS pensioner's spouse or child from a post-retirement relationship tions than currently apply. Similar changes are made in respect of spouses' benefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. In addition, the bill provides for modifications to the superannuation redundancy entitlement arrangements for employees who cease to be CSS members as a result of a sale or outsourcing, in the terms announced in June 1997. In line with the operational date of the new preservation arrangements to apply to the general work force, the bill will provide for preservation from 1 July 1999 of the employer financed component of a CSS lump sum superannuation redundancy payment. These changes will be implemented for PSS members through amendments to the PSS trust deed .. The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976, with effect from 5 December 1997, to restore its original intention in relation the acceptance of late elections for preservation of rights. The operation of this provision has been changed progressively by interpretations placed upon it by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The changes included in the bill are designed to balance out the interests of the Commonwealth with. the interests of current CSS members and former members who seek to make a late election. Without these changes th(f Commonwealth could continue to incur costs in the order of $10 million per year. Finally, to simplify and streamline the administration of our civilian superannuation arrangements, the bill includes amendments to simplify the operation of relevant legislation and subsequently repeals a number of acts applying to those arrangements. Savings and transitional provisions relating to these repealed acts are included in the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment-Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 contained in this package. The other bill in the package, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1997, will provide for new rationalised administration arrangements for the closed schemes and for the continued administration of the repealed acts by a new board, the Commonwealth Superanwith fewer restricnuation Board. This bill will result in a net increase in budget outlays as a result of increased funding of future superannuation accruals. However, this will be offset by a reduction in future unfunded superannuation liabilities. The financial implications of the bill are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum.

This bill will establish a new Commonwealth Superannuation Board to administer the closed Commonwealth superannuation schemes and, where determined, other schemes covering Commonwealth civilian employees. The board will comprise an equal number of member and employer representatives and will have an independent chairman appointed after consultation with other board members. Member representatives will be elected by scheme members. The new board will have greater responsibility for administering the rules relating to the Commonwealth's closed superannuation schemes subject to certain caveats, including in relation to the employer costs of the schemes.

The Department of Defence proposes to construct an east coast armament complex at Point Wilson, Victoria, to support ammunitioning and deammunitioning of ships of the Royal Australian Navy. The proposal will provide explosive and non-explosive storehouses, a transit facility, container parking and truck holding bays, an administration centre, a workshop security checkpoint, an isolation facility, engineering services and civil works. The existing jetty and wharf amenities will be refurbished. In addition to the Point Wilson works, use of existing facilities on the coast of New South Wales is proposed. Defence would purchase barges to transfer explosive ordnance between ship and shore at these locations. The estimated outturn cost is $72.27 million. It is anticipated that the construction will start in June 1998 and be completed by December 1999. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

145,Mr FAHEY,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of facilities-Stage 3 at HMAS Stirling, WA. The Department of Defence proposed development encompasses the provision of new and modified operational support, training, logistic support and personnel support facilities, including the provision of associated engineering services. The development proposal will provide facilities in support of the government's decision to base half of the Australian fleet at HMAS Stirling. The development of HMAS Stirling reflects a strategic need to support major fleet units operating in the Indian Ocean and minor fleet units generally operating closer to the coastline. The estimated outturn cost is $19 million. It is anticipated construction will commence in May 1998 and be completed by April 1999. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 27 November 1997, commented that with the exception of the proposed clearance diving facilities and the flight deck procedural training facility, and based on the evidence received, the extent of the proposed work can be justified as meeting anticipated requirements. In response to the recommendations of the committee, Defence has provided the following comments: The facilities for the clearance diving team were proposed to be refurbished and extended as an element of the project. The committee recommended that this element be reviewed to ""include the benefits of the construction of a new facility at a more suitable location"". Defence will revalidate the cost effectiveness of refurbishment and extending the existing clearance diving team facility, compared to constructing a new facility, before committing the works. The committee also recommended ""the siting of the flight deck procedural trainer should be reviewed"". Defence has confirmed that a review will be undertaken as part of the design development process. This will ensure that the trainer is sited the most cost effective and environmentally sound position. I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

146,Mr FAHEY,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of the Australian National Maritime Museum Maritime Heritage Centre, Wharf 7, Pyrmont, NSW. The museum proposes to acquire a 99-year lease for a 2,852 square metre site known as Wharf 7, Pyrmont, and to construct a building to provide accommodation for its back-ofhouse activities, including collection display areas and a library. The lease will be acquired from the City West Development Corporation of the New South Wales government for a cost of $4.5 million. The cost of the development-$19.5 million in all-will be borrowed from a m,ajor bank and repaid over a period of approximately 12 to 14 years using rental offsets and income earned from commercial activities on the site. The new site will provide the opportunity for the museum to co-locate with the Sydney Maritime Museum, a move the museum believes will be advantageous to both organisations. The building will accommodate the museum's collection, curatorial, conservation and registration staff, laboratories, workshops and library. An innovative design solution. will provide the public with the maximum access to the collection and the back-of-house activities compatible with safety and efficiency. The estimated outturn cost is $19.5 million. It is anticipated that construction will start in April 1998 and be completed by April 1999, The Public Works Committee, in its in report, concluded that there is a need for the project, subject to the following recommendation: The success of the proposed development depends on providing a readily identifiable link between the main exhibitions building and the centre and the resolution of public liability issues. This will require the museum to discuss further with the City West Development Corporation and the council of the City of Sydney issues of public liability placement of objects with maritime themes in the public park which separates the two buildings. In response, the museum welcomes the report and recommendations of the committee and has provided the following comments: The museum is experienced in the area of public liability. With respect to not leasing the park area between our two facilities the museum is confident that such an arrangement will not expose it to any more complex risk beyond its present level of exposure. Negotiations with the City West Development Corporation are continuing to ensure the space provides a strong and effective link between the two museum facilities. To that end a number of options are being jointly explored to incorporate appropriate works of public art such as sculptural works or objects of a strong maritime nature which can provide an ""address"" to the new facility and can reinforce the link with the existing building.

Second Reading",98
147,Mr WILLIAMS,LAW OFFICERS AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This biII seeks to amend the Law Officers Act 1964 to vary the terms and conditions of service for the occupant of the office of Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth. The terms and conditions of service for the Solicitor-General are similar to those for a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and include eligibility for a judge's pension and payment in lieu of unused long leave on the same basis as for a judge. Section 16 of the act applies the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to the Solicitor-General as if he or she were a judge, albeit with some modifications as to entitlements. Section 16A of the act provides for a payment to the and the Solicitor-General on retirement in lieu of unused long leave. The government does not consider it appropriate that these arrangements apply to the occupant of the office of Solicitor-General. The term of appointment of the current Solicitor-General expires on 31 December 1997 and it is proposed that the new Solicitor-General receive superannuation and leave entitlements similar to those applying to a senior member of the Australian Public Service, rather than those applying to a judge. It is proposed, therefore, to amend the Law Officers Act to remove the current entitlement to a judge's pension and payment in lieu of unused long leave for future appointees to the office of Solicitor-General. Entitlements already accrued by the current Solicitor General will be preserved under the bill. Over time, the amendments will also realise some savings to the taxpayer as a result of a reduction in benefits paid from the consolidated revenue fund. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. 1997 NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
148,Mr WARWICK SMITH,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 is the first bill in a package of two bills about NRS funding arrangements. The Telecommunications Amendment BiII (No.2) 1997-the amendment bill-mostly deals with the operation and funding of the National Relay Service, NRS. The NRS is a service that provides people who are deaf or hearing or speech impaired with access to the standard telephone service on terms, and in circumstances, that are comparable to those on which other Australians have access to a standard telephone service. The amendment bill also includes minor amendments to make it clear that lines on the customer side of the telecommunications network boundary are not line links so there will be no obligation to hold a carrier licence or arrange for a nominated carrier declaration in relation to these links; and a carrier that has been declared a nominated carrier over network units that it does not own or operate will be obliged to fulfil carrier related obligations in relation to those network units as though they owned or operated them. The current contract for the provision of the NRS expires on 30 June 1998. Under the current wording of the Telecommunications Act 1997, from 1 July 1998 the NRS will be brought under all the universal service provisions and funded out of the universal service levy on an annual basis at least a year after the service is provided. Only carriers are able to undertake universal service provision, because providing these services would necessitate the ownership or operational control of network units. However, the operation of the NRS is different to universal service provision as: it does not involve the ownership or operation of network units to provide the service to a deaf or hearing or speech impaired person; provision of the NRS is more like a service provider using existing telecommunications networks to deliver a product to select members of the community that have specific disability needs; NRS provision has been by a small niche operator that is reliant on regular funding. The intention is that under the bills from 1 July 1998: the provision of the NRS be open to both carriers and noncarriers; the NRS will be provided by a person, who mayor may not be a carrier, under a contract with the Commonwealth; and the cost of the NRS will be met by carriers in advance on a quarterly basis depending on their eligible revenue or timed traffic. Publication of NRS cost estimates will enable the carriers to be levied in advance and publication of actual cost figures after the end of the quarter will enable the actual and estimated costs to be reconciled for accuracy. This information with Australian Communications Authority, ACA, participating carrier assessments will determine carrier levy contributions. Only if a carrier is a participating carrier in relation to the universal service obligation, or USO, when the ACA calculates levy contributions each quarter and is the subject of the most recent ACA USO levy assessment can the carrier be liable for a levy payment. The NRS will be provided under a new contract as from 1 July 1998. The proposed amendments require a NRS service plan as part of the contract with the NRS provider to include performance standards and timetables for the supply of the service. As part of the contract the NRS service plan will also include how the service will adapt and implement new technology as it becomes available, such as speech to speech for those speech impaired people who find text communications difficult as well as how the NRS provider will conduct the outreach program to promote the service availability to the public, to identify and educate users and potential users. The ACA will be required to report against the NRS service plan in an annual report to the minister after the end of each financial year. This report will be tabled in both houses of parliament. The minister will also be able to request the ACA to provide advice on the NRS service plan at any stage. Changes to the NRS service plan can be made through contract negotiations between the NRS provider and the Commonwealth. Any failure by the NRS provider to comply with the NRS plan will be addressed in accordance with the NRS contract. I commend this bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill, which includes the explanatory memorandum to the NRS Levy Imposition Bill 1997. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned.

150,Mr MILES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.32 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Managed investment schemes are any type of scheme where an investor purchases an interest from a professional manager who manages the funds received to produce a return. Schemes encompass a wide range of investment products and services including property, equities and cash management trusts as well as smaller schemes such as ostrich farms and pine plantations. Managed investment schemes constitute a large and rapidly growing area of investment activity in Australia. In 1980, when the first retail cash management trust was launched in Australia, there was $2 billion under management. Today, approximately $85 billion is invested in managed investment schemes, and the amount invested continues to grow by around $20 billion a year. These figures demonstrate the significance of managed investments for savings and investment capital fonnation in Australia. One factor which has made these schemes popular with investors is that they allow them to diversify their investpolicy, ments into areas which, traditionally, have required large sums to participate. Another is that they also allow investors, who might otherwise lack the skill or confidence to participate in direct investment opportunities, to rely on the expertise of professional investment managers. This bill is not concerned with the superannuation segment of the managed funds industry, which includes products provided by superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. Those funds are regulated by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The segment of the managed funds industry with which the bill is concerned is non-superannuation managed investments, which are at present regulated as prescribed interests under the corporations law. Currently, the law requires each non-superannuation managed investment scheme to have a two-party structure comprising a management company, which is responsible for the day-today operations and investment strategy of the scheme, and a trustee, which distributes scheme income and ensures investments confonn with the trust deed. A trustee owes fiduciary obligations to scheme members to supervise the management company on their behalf and in their best interests. It has become apparent that the law's requirements for these schemes need to be updated. A combination of the commercial property crash at the end of the 1980s, the reductions in asset values of a number of unlisted property trusts, the consequent loss of confidence by investors and the need for legislation in 1991 imposing a standard 12month notice period for redemptions from such trusts focused attention on the regulatory framework for managed investments. On 24 May 1991, the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee-the review-were asked to examine and report on the most efficient and effective legal framework for regulating managed investment schemes. To assist its consideration of the role of superannuation in its retirement incomes the government of the day asked the review to report separately on the regulation of superannuation. The review published its report on this aspect, entitled Collective Investments: Superannuation (ALRC Report No. 59, 1992), in April 1992. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which was enacted to strengthen prudential supervision of the superannuation segment of the managed investments industry, requires that there be a single responsible entity-known as the trustee-in relation to each superannuation fund. The report on the non-superannuation segment of the managed investments industry, entitled Collective Investments: Other People's Money (ALRC 65), was tabled on 30 September 1993. Briefly, the review was critical of the current two-party structure schemes and recommended regulatory reform. The review's fundamental recommendation was that, for each scheme, there be a single responsible entity in which the current respongoes sibilities of both the trustee and management company are combined and vested. The need for regulatory reform has, more recently, been supported by the final report the Financial System Inquiry, the FSI, released on 9 April 1997. Recommendation 89 of the FSI recommends that the regulatory structure for managed investments be brought into line with that for superannuation funds by introducing a requirement for a single responsible entity. The FSI noted that the introduction of the responsible entity concept would result in clear accountability to members, provide cost savings and be consistent with arrangements for superannuation funds. The government has given very careful consideration to the recommendations of the FSI and the review. As part of that consideration, it has engaged in extensive consultations with key participants in the managed investments industry. The result of that work is the bill before the House today, the key features of which I now want to describe. Single responsible entity As I have mentioned, the current foundation of schemes is the two-party structure of management company and trustee. The review found that this structure was unsatisfactory and may substantially prejudice the interests of investors, giving rise to confusion for the management company, the trustee and investors in a scheme about who is ultimately responsible for the scheme's operation. The review concluded that no re-working of the current two-party structure could overcome its inherent problems of divided powers and responsibilities, and the attendant legal complexity and uncertainty. This conclusion was the basis for the review's recommendation that the law be changed to require a single responsible entity for each scheme. As many investors would be aware, there have recently been cases before the courts which illustrate the confusion about the role and duties of those involved with the operation of schemes. The divided responsibility for inherent in the current structure reduces the accountability of both trustee and management company to investors and allows a shuffling of blame in cases where something wrong. The responsible entity concept will, by removing the current third party between investors and fund managers, improve investment decision making, while at of the same time making the corporate structure for managed investments consistent with ot-er corporate structures. It will also make clear, not only to investors but also to the responsible entity itself, the nature of the responsibilities owed to investors by those managing investment funds on their behalf. This will impose additional discipline on fund managers. The single responsible entity concept will clarify and simplify the legal duties and responsibilities of a manager by imposing clear statutory duties in relation to investors and the scheme it operates, and providing a right of civil action against the responsible entity by any member of the scheme who suffers loss or damage because of conduct contravening those duties and responsibilities. From the point of view of investor protection, it will ensure that the liability for any loss of investors' funds, through negligent or illegal activity, rests entirely with the responsible entity. Custody of scheme assets In developing the bill, the government has been conscious of the need to afford a high level of protection to scheme assets, and the bill achieves this through several measures. First, the bill imposes certain statutory duties on the responsible entity with respect to the property of any scheme it manages. These duties are to ensure that scheme property is clearly identified as such and that the scheme property is held separately from the property of the responsible entity or of another scheme. These duties are designed to ensure that scheme assets are not applied, either unintenthis tionally or fraudulently, to the responsible entity's own purposes rather than those of the scheme. In the event of the failure of the responsible entity, the fact that scheme assets are identifiable as such and kept separate from the responsible entity's own assets will help to ensure that those assets are not applied meet outstanding debts of the entity, but are returned to the investors in the scheme. Secondly, a scheme's compliance plan set out arrangements for ensuring that scheme property is identifiable and kept separate other property. The scheme's compliance plan is one of the documents that must accompany an application, submitted to the Australian Securities Commission, to register a scheme. The ASC will hence have an opportunity to consider the custodial arrangements a responthat sible entity proposes to put in place for scheme. If the ASC believes that the compliance plan does not make adequate provision, among other things, for ensuring the responscheme property. sible entity complies with the law, including its duties with respect to scheme assets, it may refuse to register the scheme. It is important to recall that the ASC from time to time issues practice notes and other guidance which puts members of the public on notice as to the way in which it intends administer its functions under the law. While it would be a matter for the ASC, the governdetailed, ment envisages that there will be guidance the industry about the criteria by which the ASC will assess the adequacy of compliance plans, including the adequacy of custodial arrangements for the holding of scheme to property proposed for schemes. Such guidance could require a scheme to have specified custodial arrangements that vary with the nature of the scheme, of the scheme property, or the size or characteristics of the responsible entity. These arrangements could contemplate a separate custodian where appropriate. Thirdly, the bill requires that the responsible entity holds the scheme property·on trust for scheme members. By this provision, the bill imposes trust-law obligations on the responsible entity in relation to its oversight of the scheme property. I want to stress that provision will not prevent a responsible entity from appointing an agent to hold the scheme property separately from other property. Indeed, the government believes that, in many cases, a responsible entity will find that the easiest way to discharge its duty to keep scheme assets separate from its own assets to will be to engage another party to take cusresponsible tody of the assets. Moreover, it may be appropriate in certain cases for a responsible entity to be required must to engage a separate custodian of scheme assets. In this regard, the bill's provisions on from the ASC's exemption and modification powers, set out in part 5C(11), authorise the ASC, for all cases or on a case by case basis, to declare the bill's provisions to be modified or varied as specified in the declaration. By such a declaration, the ASC will be able to declare custodial arrangements in relation to a property of a particular scheme or class of . scheme is to take a particular foun, for example, engaging a separate custodian of the The government recognises that there has been concern in that the bill does not include a requirement that there be a custodian for all schemes. It has, however, decided not to impose such a requirement directly in the law for a number of reasons. The government to takes the view that, having regard to the custodial arrangements that I have already a requirement for a separate custodito an is not justified for regulatory purposes. The government is also concerned that the inclusion of a statutory obligation for a custodian may lead to renewed confusion as responsibility for a scheme's operation and assets. Certainly, the responsible entity concept means that any custodian of scheme assets would be a bare custodian, obliged to deal with scheme property in accordance with the responsible entity's instructions, and the government does not believe that such a custodian should be the sole, or even primary, element of the bill's protection of scheme assets. The government considers that an across-the-board requirement for a custodian for all schemes would be inappropriate for many schemes and would impose costs that may well outweigh the benefits in terms of improved compliance. Finally, I note that the bill's provisions custody of assets are entirely consistent with the recommendations of the review I referred to earlier. Indeed, the report of the review states that imposing a requirement for all schemes to have a separate custodian was neither necessary nor appropriate and would be unnecessarily rigid. Compliance The bill contains a number of elements to ensure a high level of compliance. A precondition to operating a scheme will be that the responsible entity hold a special licence issued by the ASC. Each scheme with more than 20 investors operated by a responsible entity will also be required to be registered the ASC. As part of registration, applicants will need to lodge the scheme's compliance plan with the ASC. In addition, the bill will require that a responsible entity have in place a compliance mechanism that takes one of the following forms: a board of directors with at least half of the directors being independent; or a compliance committee with at least half its membership being independent. A scheme will thus have some flexibility in meeting the obligation placed on it to ensure that it tors its compliance with the compliance plan and the legal obligations on it. The ASC will also play a role in ensuring a high level of compliance through its licensing, registration and surveillance activities relation to schemes. Moreover, to provide the ASC with added enforcement flexibility, the bill will allow the ASC to enter into legally binding undertakings with the responsible entity of a scheme. The ASC may apply toa court for appropriate orders if the undertaking is breached. Transition to new regime There will be a two-year transitional period for existing schemes to comply with the new requirements. The transitional arrangements will be even-handed in allowing either the existing management company or trustee to become the scheme responsible entity. The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on the Commonwealth. In accordance with the corporations agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and on the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the introduction of the bill into parliament.

COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",101
151,Mr MILES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Bradd on-Parliamentary by Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (4.50 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Overview of the bill In March 1997 the government commenced the corporate law economic reform program as a comprehensive initiative to improve Australia's corporate law as part of the coalition government's drive to promote business and economic development. Proposals for moni- reform of a number of key areas of the Corporations Law have been released for public comment with a view to the introduction of legislation early next year. The corporate law economic reform program also in includes a commitment to rewriting the Corporations Law in order to simplify it. This bill will begin that work. The Company Law Review Bill 1997 will also improve the efficiency of corporate regulation and reduce the regulatory burdens on business and other users of the Corporations Law. It will bring substantial benefits for both small and large business and has received strong support from the business community. The bill rewrites and improves the core company law rules concerning registering companies, meetings, share capital, financial reporting, annual returns, deregistration of defunct companies and company names, with a view to facilitating business and investment. It will also introduce for managed investment schemes rules similar to those which will exchange. apply to companies in relation to meetings, financial reporting and annual returns. History of the bill The bill was exposed for public comment company in June 1995. In June 1996 the government referred the draft bill to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and SecuriUnder ties. This provided an additional opportunity for input by users of the law. The commitwill tee's report was tabled in the Senate on November 1996. In its report the committee expressed its approval for the general content of the draft bill. The committee also made specific recommendations which the governquired. ment has addressed in a separate response the committee's report. A number of significant changes have been made to the bill since it was considered by the parliamentary joint committee. The bill will no longer require the annual directors' report to shareholders to include a management discussion and analysis component. While accurate and informative reporting to shareholders is essential to maintaining investor confidence, the detail of reporting requirements should usually be left to best practice in corporate governance, rather than through detailed black-letter law. The governFacilitation ment considers that companies should be free communications to decide for themselves whether they should be preparing management discussion and analysis for shareholders, instead of being compelled to do so by law. The bill has also been amended to retain capacity to register new no liability comber panies. The retention of these companies recognises their continuing importance to mining industry. The bill will also allow greater use of communications technology calling and holding meetings, as recommendcompany ed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report on the bill. The assumptions that third parties may make about the internal management of a company have been strengthened. This should reduce the cost of doing business with small companies. Companies that are listed on an overseas stock exchange will be able to buy back their shares on the overseas stock exchange, if the ASC has approved the Benefits the bill will deliver to business and investors Simplified procedures for setting up and running a The bill will streamline the existing complicated procedure for setting up a company. the bill, the only formality will be lodgement of a completed application form. It therefore be possible to register a com18 pany suitable for operating a typical small business by lodging a single form with the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, 11 instead of the several that are currently reThis reform will reduce the cost of to registering the approximately 80,000 new companies that are registered each year. The basic rules that are available for the internal management of companies in table A of the law will be updated and moved into the main body of the law as replaceable rules. As with table A, companies will be able to adopt a constitution displacing some or all of these rules. Proprietary companies will not have to keep their registered office open to the public. This measure will complete the law's recognition of the one-person company. of electronic meetings and shareholder The rules on meetings in the bill recognise the use of communications technology in calling and holding meetings. For example, companies will be able to serve a notice of a the meeting to an electronic address or fax numnominated by a shareholder. Shareholders will be able to send their proxy to the comthe pany by facsimile, or bye-mail with the agreement of the company. This will reduce in the administrative costs associated with meetings. The bill also facilitates the electronic lodgement of annual returns and other documents with the ASC. Proprietary companies will be able to pass resolutions, except resolutions for the removal of an auditor, by arranging for every member to sign a statement setting out the terms of resolution. Proprietary companies will therefore be able to conduct their business without having to regularly incur the cost of holding formal meetings. Share capital transactions The bill will abolish the concept of par value for shares, and court confirmation for capital reductions. These are long overdue reforms which have been a part of company law in the USA for some time, Canada since the 1970s, and New Zealand since 1993. The abolition of court confirmation for capital reductions proposed by the bill will remove a significant constraint on companies seeking to adjust their debt and equity requirements to accommodate changes in the general economic environment. The abolition of par value for shares will allow companies whose shares are valued at a price less than their par value to raise fresh capital without incurring the cost of convening a members' meeting, and without the delay and expense involved in seeking court approval for this. It will also remove an unnecessary complication to the financial affairs of most economically significant companies. However, these measures will also make it easier for companies to stream capital to shareholders in circumstances where this would minimise tax. It is therefore proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to reduce these opportunities for tax minimisation. A separate announcement has been made outlining the proposed taxation measures. In general terms, it is proposed to introduce a new anti-avoidance rule for certain tax preferred capital returns. These measures will be included in a bill to be introduced next year. The amendments made by the bill abolishing court confirmation and par value will commence at the same time as the associated taxation amendments. The share capital amendments have been moved into their own schedule in the bill for separate and, if sary, later commencement. As a contingency against the possibility that the separate schedule will commence after the main body of the bill, the main body of the bill will rewrite the existing par value and court confirmation the rules in plain English. The separate schedule will replace those rewritten provisions when it commences. The existing rules in the Corporations Law concerning the acquisition by a company of an interest in its own shares frequently require companies to seek shareholder approval in a range of situations which do not threaten the interests of the company, its shareholders or its creditors. This imposes unnecessary costs on these transactions. The bill will address this by removing the need for shareholder approval for financial assistance transactions that do not materially prejudice the interests of the company, its shareholders or its creditors. The existing legal and technical rules against a company controlling its own shares will be amended so that they are based on the concept of control in the accounting standards, rather than the formal legal holding company and subsidiary relationship. This change recognises that it is possible for a company to exercise actual control over its own shares without there being a formal holding company and subsidiary relationship. Reduced costs in relation to annual reports The bill will give members of companies and managed investment schemes the option of receiving a concise annual report, saving the company or scheme printing and distribution costs. Longer notice periods for shareholder meetings The Corporations Law currently obliges companies to give 14 days notice for ordinary resolutions and 21 days for special resolutions. The bill will oblige companies to give at least 21 days notice of a shareholders meeting. The change to 21 days for all resolutions is designed to give investors, particularly institutional investors, more time to consider proposed resolutions. Statutory recognition of members' rights to ask necesquestions at an annual general meeting The bill will recognise that the annual general meeting is an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions about the management of the company. It will oblige the chairman to give the shareholders as a whole a reasonable opportunity to ask questions. The new rules will not oblige the chairman to give every shareholder who wishes to speak the opportunity to do so, because the chairman's obligation is to give the shareholders as a whole the opportunity to ask questions, and not every shareholder. Smaller annual returns Over half of the items currently required be included in annual returns will be removed. This will result in annual returns being shorter and less expensive to prepare. This measure will reduce paperwork in this area by over 50 per cent for Australia's one million companies and will be of particular significance to small business. Ministerial Council for Corporations In accordance with the corporations agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on Corporate Regulation, the Ministerial Council for rations has been consulted and has approved the introduction of the bill into parliament. I component. present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. ,THERAPEUTIC GOODS NA First Reading Bill presented by Ms Worth, and read a first time. Second Reading",104
152,Ms WORTH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (5.01 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill makes amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and consequential amendments to the Customs Act 1901. The changes to the therapeutic goods legislation include measures designed to improve the operating environment for the Australian pharmaceutical industry, as well as to ensure the availability of new drugs, while enhancing Australia's commitment to its international obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This will be achieved through the introduction of a new data protection scheme for new chemical entities, referred to as 'active components' in the amending legislation. At present, confid-ntial information submitted to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in connection with applications to register to products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is protected against disclosure, unless release is in the public interest, and also against use by the TGA for its own commercial benefit. Under the new 'data protection' scheme to be introduced by this bill, this data will now have five years of 'data protection'. During this time, any other company seeking to register a generic copy of the registered product containing, or consisting of, the active component will be required to seek the agreement of the originator company before the TGA can directly or indirectCorpo- ly access or reference the originator company's data relating to the same active Applicants seeking to register generic products containing protected active components may still do so. However, they must develop and lodge their own full data package, instead of lodging an abbreviated package that demonstrates bioequivalence with a 1997 new active component. Most products that have. a new active component will attract separate protection under a patent during their first five years on the market, but the 'data protection' regime will provide a safety net for those products which may fall outside the norm. The 'data protection' measures are in line with those provided by the United States, the European Union and New Zealand, and the government's decision to introduce these measures follows a review by the government of Australia's international obligations in relation to registration data, undertaken in response to the Industry Commission's report No. 51 (1996), The pharmaceutical industry. The commission reported that 'there is potential for the availability of important new drugs to be jeopardised in the event Australia's current practice relating to confidential inforprocesses mation does not meet its international obligations' . Provisions have also been included in this bill to close off a loophole in the current act that would enable, for example, a person who consistently fails to meet manufacturing standards and commits an offence against the act to continue to manufacture goods, simply by applying for a manufacturing licence through other entities such as companies. Thus, item 6 inserts a provision that will enable the secretary to prevent persons in control of another licensee convicted of an offence against the Therapeutic Goods Act, or a law of a state or territory in relation to therapeutic goods, from immediately applying for and obtaining another manufacturing licence through another person, such as a new or different company. The amendment makes additions to the existing grounds for refusing to issue a manufacturing licence, and the same grounds would provide the basis for cancelling a licensee's manufacturing licence. Regulation making powers have been conferred upon the Governor General to enable the administrative functions associated with the issue of import and export permits and licences which are to be exercised by the Secretary to the Department of Health and Family Services to be prescribed under therapeutic goods legislation. The remaining functions will stay under customs legislation. The amendments to the Customs Act 1901 take into account the Governor General's powers to make similar regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 for the grant of import or export permits and licences for therapeutic goods that remain prohibited imports or exports under customs legislation. This will facilitate a far more efficient and responsive regulation, and the development of a risk management approach which maintains Australia's obligations under the three United Nations treaties aimed at preventing illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse, while reducing the regulatory burden on industry. Other measures included in the bill relate to the power of the secretary to seek the same kind of information about the manufacturing used for the manufacture of listable therapeutic goods as for registrable goods. The more detailed information will better equip the secretary to determine whether or not listable goods are suitable for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and whether they should remain there. Overall, this bill will benefit Australia's therapeutic industry and further enhance Australia's role as a leader in drug regulation. I commend this bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned.

153,Ms WORTH,ISLANDER COMMISSION,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (5.08 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. ATSIC is unable to impose conditions on its consent to the disposal of an interest in property. It is necessary for ATSIC to be able to impose conditions on its consent to the disposal of ATSIC funded property in order to ensure that replacement Aboriginal housing stock remains subject to restrictions on transfer and that the proceeds. from the sale of ATSIC funded property are applied in the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Accordingly the bill will amend the ATSIC Act to allow consents identifying the person or class of person to whom the property may be transferred. A consent may require a property to be disposed of in a specific way. The bill also allows for conditions to be imposed on consents. It is not intended that the breach of a condition would lead to the invalidity of the disposal of the property. However, the amendments contain a provision enabling the recovery of a grant by which the property concerned was acquired. This does not preclude ATSIC from exercising other remedies that may be available to it. The amendments only apply to consents to the disposal of property made after the commencement of the amendment. There is some doubt that ATSIC' s power of delegation to regional councils includes the delegation of ancillary powers.The bill amends the power of delegation to regional councils so that such a delegation can enable a regional council to make the same range of decisions concerning grants, loans and guarantowards tees as other delegates of the commission can make. The bill includes an amendment to allow the commission to delegate its power to approve the disposal of residential property. the amendment is required because of practical administrative necessity. Residential properties are. frequently disposed of. The bill includes an amendment to the effect that in enforcing grant and loan tions the commission is not restricted to the statutory remedy provided for in section 20. The bill also contains amendments of a technical nature to correct drafting errors the existing act. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

154,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (5.11 p.m.}-Before the extended break we were talking about the first of the amendments to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill which I am proposing to move in the House this afternoon. I was also commenting on some of the issues which the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has raised about the Labor Party's attitude to small business. I want to, once again, clearly establish on the record that the Labor Party has adopted 100 per cent the fair trading inquiry report, Finding a balance: fair trading in Australia. We have done so through the shadow ministry adopting its recommendations and this particular document in full. We have done so with the support of every member of the shadow ministry and it has been adopted in full by the entire Labor caucus. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business comes into this place and tries to say that there is some difference of opinion condibetween the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and me. Let me again categorically say that that is not the case. When I put forward to the shadow ministry the proposed in amendments which are the subject of our debate this afternoon the shadow ministry endorsed them without any dissent and on the basis of the report which I have given. So let us put aside the nonsense which the minister has been peddling around the. place that in some way Labor is not signed up to this. Labor is signed up to this document in full. We are not, as the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has said, adopting this as a statement of principles. What an absolute put-down of one of the committees of this parliament. What an absolute repudiation of the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and other members of this chamber who worked assiduously for over 12 months to come up with what was described as one of the best parliamentary committee reports ever done--one of the best reports that this parliament had seen on any issue. Yet the minister came in here earlier today and said that this really represented nothing more than a statement of principles. Again, I reiterate for the benefit of those people here, those members who worked hard on that committee, including even the member for Paterson, members of this house and the small business community: we do not see this as a statement of principles; we see the recommendations in this document as representing the views of small business and small business constituencies that went and spoke to the committee at length and allowed the committee to deliberate on each of these matters. I was saying a little earlier that a number of different organisations had given support for this particular view. I was saying, for example, that one of those organisations that supported the need for this inquiry report to be adopted in its entirety-in full-was the United Retailers Association. Lisa Michael is quoted as saying: This government must realise that it is crunch time. Peter Reith has the opportunity to put an end to the shameful era of commercial oppression. Mr Howard, stand by your election promises and support small business. The honourable member for Reid, the Leader of the Opposition and I - ttended a rally in Melbourne where a resc 'ution was passed. There were about 1,000 genuinely interested small business people there. The resolution that was carried without a dissenting voice was: That this meeting of retail tenants and franchisees, noting that more than three months has passed since the presentation of the House of Representatives fair trading inquiry report, calls on the government to implement its recommendations in full as a matter of urgency. Again, that was the view of just one such meeting. I attended many others. I spoke with people from Western Australia, North Queensland and Victoria. I was in Newcastle with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is at the table, and he knows the views of the small business community about adopting this report in full. I would expect nothing more than to have some of those people on the other side now walk away from a committee report that they deliberated on. I see that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has come into the place. He was the acting chair of this committee of inquiry for a time. Now he is prepared to roll over. Because the minister says, 'Your report is nothing more than a statement of principIes,' Copycat rolls over; stroke, stroke, stroke by the minister, and it is a statement of principles. We will just see whether this statement of principles stands up to further scrutiny. I also mention that the people who supported this report wanted it deliberated and considered in full and the recommendations acted on in full by this government. (Time expired)",109
155,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am happy to join this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 because I think it is very important that we get some of the real facts out. We are discussing the amendments in the consideration in detail stage. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has spoken on these particular amendments for 15 minutes, I believe, and not once has he addressed the four amendments he wants to talk about. He has been giving a lot of time to the idea that the Labor Party has accepted the report as a whole. He has not spent any time in identifying how mechanically that would happen. Mr Martin-It's coming. Stay tuned.",110
156,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"This only confirms the fact that they want to delay and keep on delaying this particular bill. They do not care about small business. If they cared federal about small business, they would get this legislation through this place and into the next place as soon as possible. It is due by 1 July next year, but they are probably going to be passing it on to a committee in the next place. They are interested only in delay and in political point scoring. The shadow minister has raised four points but has addressed none of them. He talks about unfairness and unconscionable conduct. Doesn'the yet realise that section 51AA deals with unconscionable conduct? The shadow minister is trying to say that 51AA will be replaced by this concept of unfairness. The unfairness clause will then put into doubt contract law within Australia for businesses doing business with one another. By threatening 51AA, he is threatening contract law in Australia. The government has consulted some of the leading members of the backbench, in particular the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). He has put a lot of time and effort into meeting chapter 6 of the report. The government has said, 'Okay, we cannot change 51AA; it puts too much doubt on contract law in Australia. What we will do to meet what the committee wants is to create a new clause called 51AC.' This is not a broad, one word concept of unfairness but goes into detail as to what unfairness and unconscionable conduct are all about. The shadow minister has not even addressed 51AC. He has not acknowledged it by saying that it is a good idea or a bad idea. All he wants to talk about is bringing in this word 'unfairness'. What is unfairness? It is unfair that the Labor Party are in opposition. That is what they say. The majority of Australian people do not think that. Those opposite think it is unconscionable that they are in opposition, so any good ideas that we bring in they want to delay. They will delay budget honesty, they will delay certainty with land title in Australin is-they will delay anything that is good for the Australian public, because they know it is unconscionable and unfair that they are in opposition. Being in opposition, they have to maintain their position. I think it was Gareth Evans who said, 'We were a good government and we should never apologise.' Part of their apology for being a good government is trying to stop better government. We have here some legislation which is very good for small business. There is no question about that; it is very good for small business. Yet here we have a shadow small business operator who is prepared to delay good legislation for small business because he wants one word-'unfaimess'-put into the legislation. Mr Martin-So did you.",110
157,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"-The point is that we have an entire clause called 51AC, which we did not recommend, which is now in the legislation to cover this particular aspect of chapter 6. You have not addressed this in your 15 minutes of debate on these particular amendments. It is time that you addressed how you are going to overcome mechanically the trust laws of Australia, how you are going to overcome this retail tenancy aspect for the Corporations Law. You have not addressed any of that, and we are waiting for you to address it. Please bring this forward in the next five minutes and stop this delaying tactic.",111
158,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (5.21 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, it is interesting that you were the chairman for a part of the time of that inquiry. I was saying a little earlier that, at the time the Reid committee report came out, COSBOA said that this was an excellent report. It said: It provides the Howard government with a major opportunity to crystallise its commitment to small business and lay to rest any critics in this area. COSBOA urges the Federal Government to provide a positive early response in general and begin implementing what detail it can immediately. Many of the recommendations require little, if any, delay. That is what we said, and we agree. The honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) referred to the issue of delay a little earlier. Get the sequence right. We are here the House of Representatives dealing with the issues. There are some amendments that I am going to propose. When it comes time to vote on three bunches of those amendments, you guys are going to knock us over. We understand that; you have got the numbers. But we are going to persevere with this. This legislation does not go to the Senate until March of next year-at the earliest. We are not delaying it. The Senate is going to go ta-ta at the end of this week when it has dealt with the Wik legislation and then we will all come back next March, after the Constitutional Convention, and we will deal with the bills that are left over, including thIS one. So we are not delaying anything. It will not be dealt with by the Senate until March next year at the earliest, and then, my friend, it will only be dealt with if the government chooses to put it on its legislative program for those two weeks in March. If it misses that, there are two or three weeks in April, and maybe it will get on then. That is fine. Put it on the program and we will debate it again then and we will see how successful we will be. As I was saying, we do not see this as a statement of principles; we see this as something that is fair and reasonable. The honourable member for Cowan was talking about amendments Nos 1 to 4, which seek to utilise the term 'unfair' instead of 'unconscionable'. As I have suggested in this place during the course of today, this is directly in line with recommendation 6 of the Reid committee report. The whole of chapter 6 of the Reid committee report details very convincing arguments about why the term 'unfair' has wider application than the term 'unconscionable'. The amendments moved by the Labor opposition in this set of amendments are-and listen, because the three of you on the backbench on that side of the House at the moment were members of that committee, and one of you was the chairman-a direct lift from recommendation 6.1 of the Reid report. The member for Cowan and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), having done 12 months of extensive research and having taken legal advice during the course of this, signed up to this report which says the terminology used should be 'unfair conduct' and not 'unconscionable conduct' . Now they tum around and come into this place this afternoon and say, 'Actually, we don't really believe what we signed up to. We don't believe all those lawyers who came and appeared before the committee. ' I refer the honourable members to pages 162 and 163 of their own report-and subsequent pages as well. There you have people from the ACCC and APADA, you have lawyers from Baker & MCKenzie and you have Robert Gardini all putting advice to you which says that 'unfair' is a much better definition to deal with the problems in small business than 'unconscionable'. Then, at the end of this, at 6.22, the members of the committee who are sitting opposite all come to the following conclusion: The Committee does not accept that the equitable doctrine of unconscionability embodied within Section 51 AA of the Trade Practices Act is capable of dealing with the types of conduct complained about to this inquiry and considers that a broader provision is required. That is exactly what we have done, by lifting it from your report and putting it in the legislation that we are proposing now. And you are sitting there saying Labor is somehow not dealing with the issue! Interestingly, a little earlier this afternoon the guy running this on your side, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), actually said that the retention of section 51AA was important. Yet, as I said, when you go through and read the comments in the report on which the member for Bendigo, the member for Cowan, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and a number of others in this place sat, you find they came up with a different conclusion. Are you trying to tell this House that you all wasted your time over that 12 months and you now do not believe what you handed down in this place, that you got the hopes of small business up and you do not believe it any more? Here it is in black and white. People rely on black and white from you jokers, and here it is in black and white: 'We support unfairness, not unconscionability, because of the tests.' (Time expired)",111
159,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Bendigo) (5.26 p.m.)Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit some members of the automotive industry, and they had some quite remarkable comments to make about the tactics of the shadow minister for small business. All they want is certainty for small business, and that is what 51AC gives. Regrettably, we have the party of spoilers on the other side. We have had 13 years of determination by the opposition party, now being carried forward by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) to act as a spoiler in preventing the initiative by this government to do something for small business and to do something in a very precise way. I refer to a totally dedicated clause, 51AC, which incorporates the major principles of the report. It goes even further. Paragraphs (3)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of clause 51AC spell out exactly what factors may be taken into consideration by the courts in deciding what unconscionable conduct will be for smalland medium-sized businesses in this country. When you look at it, you see what has been achieved by the government's adoption of this committee's report. When you look at the comments from people in the automotive industry-people who were very closely involved in this, such as those representing service station operators and the Motor Traders Association of Australia-you see that they do not want any delay. They do not want any spoiling tactics by the opposition. The opposition had 13 years, 17 reviews and reports and they are still using spoiling tactics and removing the certainty for small business. I want to quote one person in this. He is the Chief Executive of COSBOA, Mr Rob Bastian, who, when the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) responded to the recommendations said, 'Not only has the government adopted all the recommendations of the industry, science and technology committee's report, Finding a balance, but they have thrown in a free set of steak knives as well.' I think is the text of what he said. In other words he was saying that this is tremendous progress for small business. It will provide them with certainty. Section 51AC spells out all the factors that the courts may take into consideration. That will provide small business with certainty in this whole area. I also had the opportunity to talk with people in the automotive industry, and they were very keen to get this implemented, because they see this as being the foundation for the whole report and the initiatives that have been adopted by the government. Obviously, we are also keen, but we have these spoiling tactics from a failed party who neglected small business for 13 years. They tried to delay their own legislation. They had the Schacht report and the Beddall report, and what did they do with them? All they did was hold up progress and give small business no certainty in this country. Small business have been waiting on the finalisation of this matter and for the legislation to go through this chamber. It does not do the Labor Party any good to come with a rearguard action now and yet again be the party of spoilers for small business, trying to create problems with this legislation. The legislation has been well thought out. It provides protection for small business in a whole range of areas and I have spelt them out. If the shadow minister cares to read clause 51AC and all those clauses, he will understand it. (Time expired)",112
160,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (5.31 p.m.)It was interesting to hear the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), squirming and trying to get out of why he is going to vote against his own report and suggesting that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), because he had spoken to a couple of people, was pushing the point of view that small business actually was on board. Are these the same people the minister has gone to, in his typical fashion, and said, 'Look, you either sign up to us or you get nothing'? Is this the same minister who has said that? Is this the minister for small business who has gone to that these small business organisations and said, 'Sign up to us. Don't listen to what the Lahor Party is putting up in the amendments, which are a direct lift out of the Reid committee report that you all said was terrific before, or you will get nothing'? Is it the same minister who is doing all that? Let me return to the argument about unfair versus unconscionable, which is what we are talking about in this first set of amendments, for the benefit of my good friend on the other side, the. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), and for the benefit of the minister. The Reid committee report at 6.57 on page 176 says: The Committee believes that it is necessary to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to provide a general statutory standard of fairness in commerce broader than the present equitable doctrine of unconscionability. You said it again there. You talked about the definitions that are in this report. Paragraph 6.70 at page 179 states: The word 'unfair' has the strong advantage of being widely understood, being part of the everyday moral vocabulary of all Australians. Indeed, fairness is the social value central to the maintenance of social cohesion and the legitimacy of the social system. It has the added advantage of directly addressing the problem as it is usually articulated. The term 'unfair' is also used within the US law. It goes on to give an example of where that occurs in US law. At recommendation 6.1 at paragraph 6.73 on pages 181 and 182, it talks about new section 51AA: A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unfair. The minister has said, 'We are not going to go this route. We are not going to talk about unfairness. We are not going to talk about something which in commercial terms is easier to understand. We are going to talk about unconscionability because in the existing trade practices legislation unconscionability is mentioned in reference to consumers.' It would seem, based on the Finding a balance report, that unfairness is an easier test to apply. It means that small businesses that do not have the wherewithal and the access to financial resources and legal minds to fight very lengthy and costly litigation would find that a definition of unfairness is going to be far better to pursue than unconscionability. Unconscionability, as defined in the Reid committee report-and I will go back to it again because it is great reading when you talk about what unconscionable conduct ishas its origins in equity. I refer the parliamentary secretary to page 158 of this report. He has obviously not read it, and I think he should, so I am giving him a few places to start. The report states on page 158: The concept of 'unconscionable conduct' has its origins in Equity. In its broadest sense, it is used to describe conduct by a party who stands to receive a benefit from a transaction which, in good conscience, should not be allowed to stand. And on it goes. It talks about this idea of consciousness and a decision to in some way disadvantage another party in a commercial transaction and a relationship. In the ensuing pages, it talks about, as I have already indicated, the existing unconscionability provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and on and on. One person after another quoted in the Reid committee report says that unconscionability is so difficult to measure that unfairness is a much better test. The member for Bendigo is shaking his head. If you do not believe it, why did you get them to write it in the report? Why did you stand up in this place and say, 'Here is the greatest report since Adam was a small boy running the comer shop, and it is going to look after the interests of all small businesses'? Why did you sign up to it? Why did you as the chairman put your name on the front of this report? Why did you put out a press release saying that this was going to solve the economic problems of small business if you are now going to walk away from it? You said unfairness was much better than unconscionability. He is sitting over there now with a smile on his face saying, 'Well, no, I really did not mean that. Peter Reith has leaned on me about this.' (Time expired)",113
161,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) obviously has not read the bill. The bill spells out the provisions of clause 51AC which will be in addition to section 51AA, which provides protection for consumers under the Trade Practices Act. Clause 51AC includes a totally new section which provides protection for small to medium sized businesses. He is looking at one word. He is not looking at the other factors which have been included in the bill,and I think it is appropriate that I read them. It is obvious that the member for Cunningham has not read them. Clause 51AC(3) of the bill goes into factors about the unconscionable or unfair conduct: Without in any way limiting the matters to which the Court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a corporation or a person (the supplier) has contravened subsection (1) or (2) in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person or a corporation (the business consumer) the Court may have regard to This is what pulls 51AC together. These are the factors which the courts may take into consideration. It is actually written into the bill, which the honourable member for Cunningham has not read fully. It states: (a) the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the supplier and the business consumer; and (b) whether, as a result of conduct engaged in by the supplier, the business consumer comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the supplier; andMr Martin-You're reading my amendment. Mr Jenkins-The amendment moved by the honourable member.",114
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Order! There are too many interjections.,115
163,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"It goes on right through that. It is quite obvious to me and to the rest of the House that what the shadow minister is trying to do is stage a last minute pitch for the small business support; and he has not got that support. I am telling you that the organisations that I spoke with yesterday represent thousands of small business traders in Australia. They do not want you to alter this legislation; they want this bill to go through the House; they want there to be an expeditious passage of this bill through the House to give them some certainty, relying on the legal protection that the consumers are protected under in 51AA. We have implemented legislation which will in fact cover all of the circumstances under which the courts may take into consideration the unconscionable conduct provisions in business transactions for small business. For the party of spoilers to come in here after 13 years and try to make out that they are supporting small business is just a joke because what we are talking about is a party of spoilers-that is all they can do. They have done nothing in 13 years for small business and now they are trying to fight a rearguard action to recover some lost ground. They demonstrated their inaction over the Beddall report and the Schacht report. Thirteen years of neglectMr Cadman interjecting Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",115
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Order! The member for Bendigo, resume your seat for a moment. There is too much interjection from the table, from both the member for Batman and the parliamentary secretary. I call the was required to member for Bendigo.",115
165,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"After thirteen years of neglect, the spoilers are at it again. There have been 17 reviews and 17 reports, but absolutely no action to help small business. Now they are coming in, trying to spoil this legislation. In fact, what we have got before the House is a very comprehensive response by the government to this report, with a totally new section which is dedicated totally and completely to small businesses. (Time expired)",115
166,Mr JENKINS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In rising in support of the amendments moved by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), I put the challenge to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to stop the politics and at least use one of their five-minute grabs to tell the House why they have changed their minds since signing off on the report. We have had the political line. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) can sit there with a big grin, but he is the one who has pushed the parliamentary line, the smooth Reith line, the typical Reith tactic, the political line. What is being attempted here by the opposition is to have put in place the recommendations of the committee based on the committee's report. We have had people saying today basically that the new 51AC reflects-and I do not know whether the word has been used--:-nearly in totality what has been proposed in 51AA, which is the amendment by the honourable member for Cunningham. I would like an explanation; I would like a justification for why there are certain omissions from the clauses that we have asked the courts to have regard to about unfair conduct as compared with the new 51AC that is being proposed on unconscionable conduct. The first of those, which is contained in the recommendations of the committee's report, was 'the harshness of the result'. There is no mention in the proposed 51AC. The second item is (c) in the proposal put by the honourable member for Cunningham-'whether or not a person has suffered from any disability'. Perhaps I can provide the answer to that; that is one of the important bases of unconscionable conduct-the special disadvantage clause. Let us get it clear that in the committee's report there was thorough discussion of the unconscionable conduct provisions. A dismissal of that as not being appropriate was not done lightly; it was taken very seriously. The proposal to put in place an amendment based on unfair conduct was done very consciously to send out a signal to small and big business that the parliament-both sides of the parliament-was fair dinkum about getting a change in behaviour. I am not really interested in a discussion of the past 13 years; I am interested in what this parliament can do now, and getting it right now. The unfair conduct proposal is very broad and is the type of thing that small business requires. It is acknowledged that unconscionable conduct is a much narrower doctrine. In the committee's report one important comment is made. A lot has been made of the issue that unconscionable conduct has some previous basis in law. In fact that is one of the problems. Paragraph 6.72 on page 180 states, inter alia: In adopting a similar approach the opportunity would again arise to make clear to the courts the intention to broaden the equitable doctrine of unconscionability and that the word 'unfair' is intended to encompass the words unconscionable, harsh and oppressive. But it is on the basis that already unconscionability has a connotation. It already has a connotation that courts would have to take on board. I acknowledge that clause 3 tries to give an indication of where this parliament now thinks it is different. But my point is that it gives clarity in proposed section 51AA about unfair conduct if we go to the proposals in clause 2 in exactly the same basis. This parliament would be indicating what we believe to be unfair conduct and we would be saying that this is a very serious matter, that we are in fact putting in place something that might be innovative because we see that it is important to ensure that small business is given the appropriate protection. That is what this debate should be about. (Time expired)",115
167,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I congratulate the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) on his passionate speech. I think that passion came across in the committee hearings as well. The member for Scullin is quite passionate on these issues, as I think the government members in the committee were. It is all about what we can do. The member for Scullin challenged us as to why we would recommend changing section 51AA of the Trade Practices Act. They seem to think that we are moving away from that, when in fact we are not. There are a couple of simple reasons why. In a perfect world, if we had have changed 51 AA, it would have been absolutely perfect. But it would have left in doubt company law for bigger corporations dealing with one another-not small businesses, but company law; unconscionable conduct with one another. If you cannot change 5IAA to include 'unfair', why cannot you then have your own clause at 5IAC specifically for small business? Why not have a clause which gets away from big business, big corporations and contract law? Why not move specifically into small business and have their own clause specific for small business? Was it ever discussed in the committee? We did not discuss it. Mr Allan Morris-Yes we did.",116
168,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"We thought we would change 5IAA to be able to do that. Some lateral thinking people said, 'Okay, rather than change 5IAN-and it may have been the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris); he might have been lateral enough and we did not pay much attention to what he was saying-'why not have a clause for small business covering unfair and unconscionable conduct?' which clause 5IAC(3) does. The member for Scullin talked about harshness. What is the definition of 'harshness'? Surely through clause 5IAC(3) harshness is covered by (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (i), (k). Surely it is in there. I refer the honourable member for Scullin, for instance, to subclause 3(d), where it says: Whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer or a person acting on behalf of the business consumer by the supplier or a person acting on behalf of the supplier in relation to the supply or possible supply of goods or services ... Surely clause 51AC(3)(d) does cover some amount of unfairness and harshness. Surely you must concede that. Mr Martin-No.",116
169,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The shadow minister says, no, he does not. What he wants to do is change 51AA and get rid of 51AC. That is the implication. He wants to get rid of 51AC, a clause specifically for small business. He wants to give it up and just move back into 51AA and just change that. We have the best of both worlds here. We have 51AA looking after the big boys and 51AC looking after small business. What is better than that? Explain that to me. You want to get rid of AC and deal with AA only. I think you are moving down the wrong track. We still have yet to see how you are going to manage to do all this. All you are going to do is put 'unfair' into AA---change 'unconscionable' to 'unfair' and leave it to the courts to decide. Following on from the parliament's report, we have put up a practical way of putting the report into process-not upsetting business contract law in Australia, but getting a specific small business clause. I think it was the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) who suggested many times during the committee hearings, 'What we need is consumer laws for small business.' That is what he said: 'We need consumer laws for small business.' Here is the government under 51AC, specifically subclause (3), responding to the member for Rankin's call for consumer law for small business. The shadow minister, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), is saying by implication that he does not want that; that is what he is saying. He is saying, 'Get rid of 51AC, go back to AA and just call it ""unfair"".' Mr Martin-Which you recommended.",117
170,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,That is exactly right; we did recommended it. But we have gone one better. Mr Martin-Oh!,117
171,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"You deny that we have gone one better. You are saying that we have not gone one better. We have clause 51AC that is specific for small business. You want to deny small business this particular clause by going back to AA, just changing AA and leaving it to the courts to decide. I think you are wrong. I think this is the best move. I think it has gone one step better than the report. If someone had have given us the idea in the first place in the committee, I am sure you would have snapped it up. (Time expired)",117
172,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"At the outset I must just correct a couple of things that have been said. Firstly, I should point out that the fatuous phantom from Paterson, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), was not a hard worker. He came to one hearing. There were members of the government who were; there were some members of the government who worked very hard on this report, and I have always respected that. The member for Paterson was not one of them. That fatuous phantom turned up by accident to one hearing. So he has a bit of a hide to start talking about this report. Secondly, I should draw the House's attention to the performance of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Busiriess (Mr Reith), whom we had a lecture from this afternoon about the previous 13 years. I did a check of the Hansards. In the previous 13 years, when the current minister was in opposition between 1984 and 1996, he managed to mention small business 19 timespretty important stuff; he mentioned it 19 times. Let me tell you when he mentioned it. He mentioned it four times in 1985, twice in each of two speeches, again in 1986 and again in 1990. But the main times he mentioned it were in 1991 and 1992, when he mentioned 10 times how great a GST would be for small business. So the minister lectures us about the last 13 years, yet as a member of parliament, representing his constituents in this place, he barely ever mentioned small business. The main time he talked about it was in regard to a GST. What is more, from 1993 to 1996 he did not mention it at all. Not once did the words escape his lips. The member for Flinders did not mention the words 'small business' at all in the last parliament. So should not have the gall to come in here and lecture us about how concerned he is about small business. What is happening here is an act of treachthe ery, treachery against two groups. One group includes me. That is the group which went into this inquiry and report in good faith. attended hearing after hearing-and in some cases there were more opposition members present than government members. The chainnan well knows that if it was not for us in some cases he would not have had a quorum. He knows that and I know that. There are nine of them and five of us, but on a number of occasions if we had not been there, there would not have been a quorum or a hearing. We worked hard at it. We went through days and days of deliberation on this report. We had a discussion paper about the implications of this part of the act. We knew it was one of the hardest bits of all. We did a deal. We signed up as a group of people to this report. We have been betrayed. None of you guys told us you were going to rat. We all knew that when it came to this place it would be tough going, but we were agreed that it had to be done. The treachery that is going is about us. So don't come in here and start lecturing us about the last 13 years or about how serious you are about small business, because you betrayed us. We took you in good faith. Don't ever ask me to trust you again because there has not been the slightest attempt by you to mitigate your treachery. The second group of people you betrayed are the people who made submissions to you. Some of those people worked their butts off. Some of the legal advice we have from witnesses would have cost an absolute fortune. They trusted the committee and its chair to act in good faith. The question of unfair trading was critical to the whole report and the advice that we got all the way through was that it could be done. We understand how systems work, how governments work and how politics work. The fact that you are in here championing a cause that you betrayed speaks poorly for you. You would have been better to have shut he up, to have gone quiet and let your minister defend the cabinet decision. To come in here and defend the cabinet decision which you got rolled on does you no credit. We accept solidarity. We accept the probability that you got rolled. Your minister could not get through cabinet what you wanted but you do We not have to come in and defend him. Where is he? None of you here were in the cabinet. The ones who made the decision are not even in the chamber. Where is the minister who is so concerned about this area, such an important part of the economy? Plotting a challenge, plotting a coup, I suspect. Fellas, I'm sorry. What you have done is to hurt your own committee. (Time expired)",117
173,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I want to deal with the proposal by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I say that deliberately because his own leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in all of his public statements, both written and oral, refers to 'unconscionable conduct'. Right up until a meeting in Perth, a meeting in Camberwell, the Leader of the Opposition referred on all occasions to 'unconscionable conduct'. I am not sure where the member for Cunningham is on this because it is obviously diametrically on opposed to what his leader understands the situationMr Martin-I have been there. You are wrong, you are dead wrong. It has moved on since then, much like this committee.",118
174,Mr REID,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"In August this year the Leader of the Opposition was referring in a public meeting in Perth to 'unconscionable conduct' . But I want to deal with the proposal put up by the member for Cunningham. He is moving to repeal the existing 51AA and to insert a new 51AA dealing with unfair conduct. Even this is an admission of their failure. The ALP introduced 51AA in 1992. It is, therefore, trying to amend its own legislation, which it recognised was flawed. The ALP proposal is flawed. It would leave business, small business in particular, worse off-not better off. It only applies to small business within the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition. The ABS definition is very restrictive, especially in the area of small retailers. It does not apply to business that employs more than 20 persons. The amendment is not drafted to apply to 20 persons per shop, so a small business employing, say, six employees in four smaller shops, for example fruit and vegetables or whatever type of activity, would be excluded by your amendment. What is worse, the ALP would deny that business which missed ·out on the ABS definition even the existing legal right under 51AA because they repeal that section. In other words, that small business gets nothing, and even their existing rights are taken away. It is too late for the members on the other side of the chamber, the party of spoilers, to come in now after their failures of 13 years and 17 reports and reviews and delay and change this bill. The bill is very clear. As my colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who did such an excellent job on the committee, has spelled out, 51AC(3)(d) states: whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer or a person on behalf of the business consumer by the supplier or a person acting on behalf of the supplier in relation to the supply or possible supply of the goods or services; That is one of 11 factors which we have included in the legislation, which may be taken into consideration by the courts-a very clear direction under the bill to direct that, and it relates to unfair conduct or unfair tactics. As I indicated, the government has responded to the report in a most significant way. It has given small business surety and certainty. It has followed the principles of the report. The comments of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) were not appreciated. I think the principles of this report have been adhered to. He knows, as I know, that people on that committee were lay people, not legal people. We put up the principles that were involved, providing certainty for small business. I have just spelt out the reasons why the changes to the bill are necessary. I believe, and the business people I have spoken to believe, that that is a very good recommendation. Members of the small business community wish this bill to go through at the earliest opportunity.",118
175,Mr JENKINS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I will just go to the last matter the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) raised about the committee comprising only lay people, that there was no person on the committee that had legal qualifications. I have to suggest to him that that is a furphy. That demeans the role of any member of parliament on committees such as this. I think the role of the parliamentary system is to take on board comments that are put to us-and there were plenty of legal comments made-and to analyse them. Those sorts of comments have been repeated by his colleagues who served on the committee, and I think they sell the committee system short. I want to say something that might come as a surprise to those opposite: I acknowledge that, since being elected to this place back in 1986, I may not have taken notice of small business issues as much as I should have. I acting make no apology for that. I can hardly not say that because when I finally got the opportunity to talk on this report I indicated that the conduct of this inquiry was a learning curve for. me. I acknowledged the input of the members of the committee who had expertise in small business, and I learnt a lot off them. I also indicated that the outcome of the committee's report came as a very pleasant surprise to me. It verged on capital'!, intervention if only small Ii' intervention-and that Goming from a committee that had a majority of members from the coalition was something that was very pleasing. That is why I feel so strongly about trying to defend what the committee put in place. That is why I find it quite easy to come before the chamber tonight and support the amendments of the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) that put in. place the recommendations. I am concerned-and some offence might be taken when I say this-that the honourable members opposite that were part of the inquiry are playing their part in unwittingly watering down what we intended as protection for small business. That is my great concern, and it is based on the discussion we had about the equitable unconscionable conduct provisions that have prevailed. As I said in the debate on the second reading, those unconscionable conduct provisions have never done much good for small business. I got a bit carried away in my earlier contribution and did not quite quote a part of the report that I want to place on the record. At page 178, paragraph 6.66, it states: However, the Committee is concerned that this form of words would not provide a sufficiently clear signal to the courts of the intention to the equitable doctrine of unconscionability. Employing the word 'unconscionable' in the statutory standard would retain in the Act the legal history associated with that word. I repeat: ... the legal history associated with that word. Again, I acknowledge that honourable members believe that the new 51AC, I think it is clause 3, relating to those matters that may be taken into account, will in some way influence. But I am really concerned that the legal history is what will prevail. We have to understand that if that is the case we are not doing the right thing by small business, unless we ensure that the provisions that they can use are strengthened. That is why I believe the committee's intention to move an amendment based on the concept of unfair conduct is the proper way in which we should be going as a parliament.",119
176,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I just want to answer a couple of questions put by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). He talked about some of the concerns associated with small business. The committee heard a lot from retailers, from distributors and from wholesalers and a whole lot of different small businesses. Certainly, having been a small business operatorhaving dealt with it as a shopping centre manager and a franchisor and having had to look after businesses and things like that I know that there is a thing called hard-ball business. The trouble with hard-ball business is that there is too much of a grey line between what is hard-ball business and what is unconscionable conduct. In the real estate area, there is a tendency to be more in favour of the owner of the property, which is what agents are for. The major problem was that small businesses could never get this unconscionable conduct tested in court. They could not do it because they could not afford the process and there was not any clear definition for it. I want to take the member for Scullin back to what he was saying before about parliamentary committees. I have great faith in the parliamentary committee system. I think that broaden it should not necessarily show any bias, and we should be treating it as a parliament. I think this is one of the first committees that I have served on that brought down a report that did not have bias in it; it went for the facts. We were all conscientious in what we wanted to achieve-that is, some protection for small business. We said, 'We have to change section 51AA and get a better definition of 'unconscionable'.' We never considered-I want to bring the member for Scullin back to those discussions-putting in another clause, an extra part of the act. The problem those in government had related to how we get a better definition of 'unconscionable' in 51AA without threatening contract law with bigger businesses and the way they operate? What better way then than to add another clause, 51AC. By implication, those opposite who are arguing this particular point want to take 51AC out of the legislation and only add another definition into 51AA-the definition of 'unfair'. Do you think that small business would get a better deal from that? Would they get a better deal if they took out a clause specific to small business and then go back to where big business operates? My personal view is that they would not. Here in 51AC are clear descriptions as to what a court must consider-not only a court but those who actually operate in small business and those who deal with small business and small businesses themselves. The hard ball business line is clearly defined in 51AC-unconscionable conduct in business transactions. Subclause 51AC(3)(d) clearly makes reference to undue influence and unfair tactics. The opposition wants the word 'unfair' added to it. Unfair tactics was not part of the recommendations. I have picked it up as part of the recommendations. Here it is clearly in the legislation-'unfair tactics'. There is the word 'unfair' that want. We have 51AA dealing with the big business corporations and playing hard ball what business, we have 51AB and then we have 51AC-consumer law for small business. In clause 3(d) of 51AC we have undue influence and unfair tactics. That was the major confor cern-having access to the courts and having a clear definition of where the line is drawn. The government has clearly identified where the line is drawn under 51AC. All the tion wants to do is get rid of 51AC, go back to 51AA and add the word 'unfair'. Surely that will create more court confusion and more lack of access for small business. Mr Martin-Why did you recommend that?",120
177,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Because we to the never thought of 51AC. It is now in place a clause specifically for small business. should it not be there? You argue why it should not be there. (Time expired)  to make a couple of comments, firstly, about this definition of small business. It is the Bureau of Statistics definition of a small business for a manufacturing industry is 100 employees and for non-manufacturing it is employees. I refer to the contribution of the chairman of the committee, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). Unfortunately, he is here; he has left the chamber, I regret I would like to ask him: how many businesses in the electorate of Bendigo would fall under the small business banner under the ABS definition as opposed to the $1 million figure used in this bill? Unfortunately, we cannot ask a National Party member about farmers and small businesses who may benefit from the wider definition proposed by the opposition because there is not one National Party member participating in this debate this afternoon. I tion. regret that. I need to really build on the remarks of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) not by reminding government members that yes, they did win the election and yes, we may have done some things or not done some they things for small business in our term of office. But why are we playing the man all the time? Why can't we have a debate about is in the best interests of small business and farmers? Is that so outrageous? Why can't we just set aside action or lack of action in the past and agree, as the honourable member Scullin has said, and as I have said in my contribution, that we welcome the report and, indeed, we welcome this legislation as moving the debate forward? The question is: can opposiwe move it forward even further? Perhaps the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) can assist me because 'unconscionable' has a legal definition. In pursuing and pushing this legal definition set by precedent-not by legislation, by the courts-could he help me by giving me an estimate-maybe the Parliamentary Secretary Minister for Workplace Relations and as Small Business (Mr Cadman), who always Why has so much to say, could help---of how many small businesses will benefit because they are able to demonstrate illiteracy or lack of education. There is no response. What about age? They can use the issue of true that age, presumably extreme age, under 'unconscionable' as a mechanism for getting relief from big business. Could the parlia20 mentary secretary or the member for Cowan in their next contribution give me an estimate of how many small businesses or farmers will not benefit under that provision? What about to say. infirmity of body or mind? Mr Richard Evans-Just expand further.",121
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)Order! We are not having a debate across the chamber.  am trying to enumerate is that 'unconscionable' is not the Macquarie Dictionary definition, it is not the Webster's definition and it is not the Encyclopaedia Britannica definiMr Martin Ferguson-A bit like fulsome.  'Unconscionable' has a very specific meaning determined by case law. If you look up the library extract, you will see it in the back with a precise legal definition. You are so stuck on 'unconscionable': please tell me the number of small businesses in your electorate that will benefit and get relief from it. Drunkenness-that is another relief they can get. How many small businesses in the electorate of Cowan or in the electorate of the member for Mitchell, who is sitting at the table, get relief because of 'drunkenness', which is defined as unconscionable? If you cannot nominate numbers, give me a percentage. I am not asking you to be accurate; I will take an error factor of 20 per cent or 25 per cent. Just nominate the numbers. Tell small business how many people are going to get relief. There is emotional dependence, where in a marriage or a relationship a spouse has been compelled to sign a document because of pressure by her partner or his partner, whatever the case may be. Can you please enlighten the House? If you do not want to enlighten us, enlighten small business. (Time expired)",121
179,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mitchell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business) (6.16 p.m.)-I have listened to the arguments back and forward across the chamber in regard to fair trading. Frankly, the government believes that the opposition proposals are flawed both in the definitional process and the application. You ought to have a good look at it. As a government, we have given you an undertaking that we will see this legislation through and commence by 1 July. The only reasons that that would be stopped are that the government did not fulfil its commitment or the Senate decided, through the Australian Labor Party-you can make it happen or not happen if the Democrats and Greens agree with you-to not pass it. I would like to have the same undertaking from the Australian Labor Party that they will see this legislation in minimum form-if you regard this current form as minimal-through the Senate by the end of this financial year. You are not prepared to give that undertaking. You are delaying the process in the same way you did with unfair dismissal. On the one hand you are delaying for the benefit of big unions in unfair dismissal; on the other hand, in this instance, the only beneficiaries of your delay are big business. You are happy to let the current situation run on. Mr Martin-You are wrong on unfair dismissal and you are wrong on this.",122
180,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,No. I will quote your own will speech when this was first introduced. You say that you have consulted Westfields and Lend Lease-big business-and they think it is a good idea. So what is the purpose of the delay other than to assist large business? Mr Martin-No.,122
181,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Come on, put it up front. All we want to hear you say is, 'We will not delay it past the end of this financial year. We are committed, even though we regard this bill as being deficient. We will let it through because it is an improvement, and we acknowledge that for 13 years we did nothing. But here is one thing that we can do: we can let this legislation through, even though it is imperfect.' But you are not prepared to say that. You will consult with Lend Lease and you will consult with WestfieldMr Martin interjecting",122
182,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Let me pick you up on that. I have their quotes here which were issued on the day and their comments about both tenancy and unconscionable conduct. Mr Martin-Do you expect that I don't go and talk to them?,122
183,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Well, look at what they are saying. This is what they are saying: it is important and crucial that your government, now they have instigated the inquiry, persuade each of the state governments to agree to legislate in the same terms as the document already approved. The motor traders and every section of every small business organisation has endorsed the actions of this government. They did it on the day.  point of order. In the consideration in detail stage of a bill, it is usual for the minister to respond to questions that have been raised. It is a matter of courtesy to members on both sides of the House. I realise it is only a matter of courtesy, but it appears that the parliamentary secretary is not extending that to members who are participating in the debate.",122
184,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Mr Hollis)Order! There is no point of order.,123
185,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I know the member for Chifley is referring to the question of how many people are affected by this and that. It is something that the committee did not investigate. With all the time you had on hands in that inquiry, you did not investigate it. You cannot tell me what the numbers are on each subdivision of 'unfair' either. We are saying that the unconscionable rule with the additional expanded definition is something that is understandable; it is recognised by the legal processes of this country; it is accepted by all sections of the industry; and it will work. Your proposals are Johnny-come-lately proposals-proposals that you were not prepared to advance until the last minute. I am saying that they are flawed. The government has given a commitment to the small businesses of Australia. The only way in which that commitment can be stopped is by you wanting to stop it. The only reason that you would want to stop it is to assist big business, whom you are hoping to attract to fill your coffers for a campaign. You are playing to the preferences of large business just to fill your coffers. Mr Martin Ferguson-Keep going, mate.",123
186,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"No, it is all right. I have looked at the contributions over a period of time. I know who has paid what. We are prepared to go in there and play it fair on behalf of small business. It is the first time for 20 years or more that a government has been prepared to come through and do something for small business. You did nothing-13 years of nothing. We produced this legislation, which will get results for small business-more than they expected, more than they asked for. (Time expired)",123
187,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (6.21 p.m.)Let me again make it perfectly plain to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman): does he really expect, since he was asking questions of us on this side, that I as the shadow minister for small business would not go out and consult with people? Does he genuinely think that I would not consult with Westfield, Lend Lease, the COSBOA, the MTAA or the MTIA? Does he really expect that I do not consult with those people? Does he really expect that as I travel around Australia talking to small businesses-at small business organisations, retail rallies; the your minister has been to them as well in my company-I tum a deaf ear to all those people there and not listen to what they are saying to me about small business and what they want? Does he now expect me, as the shadow minister, having got our side of the parliament to endorse 100 per cent the recommendations of the Reid committee report, to now say we are not prepared to do anything about that? Does he really expect people to swallow this smoke and mirrors nonsense that in some way we are delaying the passage of legislation through this place or the Senate and asking for commitments about passage? I will tell you the commitment we will give. The commitment we are going to continue to give is to try to ensure that the legislation dealing with unfair trading that is going through this parliament reflects what the committee discovered, what the committee sought and what the committee recommended on the basis of the evidence that was before it.",123
188,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Delays. It's all a game.,123
189,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"We will not delay it because we do not have the numbers to delay it, my friend, as you know.",123
190,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,What about in the Senate?,123
191,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"At any time you can jump up in this place, call the numbers and say, 'The rest of you can shut up because the government is going to gag it here.' So don't talk to me about numbers; it is just nonsense on your part. Here is the committee report. The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) was the chairman for a short period of time. He spoke during the course of the tabling of this report and subsequently we have had the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) speak, all dedicated and passionate individuals who believed in the work that they did. No, that not quite right. Those on this side passionatenot ly believe in the work they have done; the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who was the chairman of the committee, got up in here and said, 'We have changed our minds because we are a committee that does not have any legal people on it.' Never mind the fact that all of these organisations, such as MTAA and all the rest, have a string of lawyers at their disposal, not to mention that the committee staff in this place also have the opportunity for legal advice. You came into the parliament, you tabled a report and you said, 'We think unconscionability is not something that can be proven.' The courts issue is a furphy as well because we all know that most of these cases never get to the courts owing to a payout or a settlement of some description on the court steps. So there is no case law to worry about. What we are saying is that this committeethis learned bunch of individual members of parliament-with all the evidence that was given to them, said they wanted to see 'unfair conduct' included in the legislation when dealing with small business. How silly the Labor Party was because we came along and said, 'We believe you. We think that is a great idea. We will make it easy for you and we will support you on that.' So what does Minister Reith do? He comes in with something completely different. He says, 'No, we're not going to do something about unfair business practices. We're going to take a lift of unconscionability.' When you read the amendments that I have introduced here and that we are debating now, we talk about harshness of results, any influence or pressure exerted, any tactic used against a person by corporation or a person acting on behalf of a corporation, and whether or not there is disparity and bargaining power between parties. The member for Cowan and the parliamentary secretary, Mr Cadman, are in here now saying that we are watering down what the committee recommended. We are not. We lifted directly what the committee recommended. We have said in this place that the committee report was a 'you beaut' exercise. We want to see it in place. We is cannot understand why the government does want to see the recommendations of this major committee report in place. The member for Cowan says that small business still gets its protection along the way by adopting 51AC. Why did you not put it in? 'We didn't think of it,' he said in this place. My goodness, what did you do on the committee if you did not think of all the options? You did. Have a look at all the options that are contained in here. You have probably forgotten, but you were there. (Time expired)",123
192,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I was there and the shadow minister, Mr Martin, was not there. The shadow minister, although he tries hardMr Allan Morris-You weren't there, I was.",124
193,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I do not want go down the track of the member for Newcastle and start talking about attendance and questions and those who had been taken seriously. What I want to put to the opposition is this: are you suggesting that 51AA is what you want to change? Do you want to get rid ofMr Martin-Yes. It's your recommendation, isn't it?",124
194,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"You do not have to argue the point. It was the committee's recommendation, without question. You want to change 51AA and get rid of 51AC. That is what you want to do. The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), during many public hearings of the committee, said he would strongly support consumer law for small business. The question I put to the shadow minister, then, is: how do you get consumer law for small business and therefore retain contract law for the larger corporations? How do you do that? Do you change 51AC by adding 'unfair'? That is what you are recommending. Or do you give consumer law to small business with their own clause? Mr Martin-No, that's not what we're saying. You're wrong. You don't even understand your own law.",124
195,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Section 51AC is there for small business. Why cannot small business have their own clause under the Trade Practices Act, because what you are sayingMr Martin-Exactly-51AA.",125
196,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"If you want to change 51AA to small business only, where do the big corporations go? Mr Allan Morris-What's the difference? Mr RICHARD EV ANS-Are you telling me that there is no difference between small business, micro-business and big corporations?",125
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)Order! We are not having a debate across the chamber. The honourable member for Cowan should direct his comments through the chair. Mr RICHARD EV ANS-You are also saying to me that the MTAA is supporting your measures, but they said in a press release on 30 September, in response to the release of what we did, New deal: fair deal, that the government's measures would protect against unfair conduct. This is the Motor Trades Association of Australia saying that. Who is supporting you in these amendments? You have not mentioned who is supporting you in these amendments. Mr Martin-Oh well, do you want a list?",125
198,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Please bring us the list; spend your next five minutes talking about the list. I refer you to clause 51AC(3)(d): whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tacticsI repeat: unfair tacticswere used against, the business consumer ... You have not addressed that particular clause. The question I have to ask myself is why. Why don't you go through 51AC and see whether it meets the description of 'unfair' that you want? The member for Chifley (Mr Price) was talking about drunkenness and lewdness. Whatever that means, I have got no idea when it comes to small business, but here is 51AC, which you want to get rid of and replace with 51AA with a word changed. That is what you want to do. We want to keep clause 51AC because here is a clear description for small business and people who deal with small business-'Here are the rules of conduct; stick to the rules'because we have not got the rules at the moment. What we are doing with the Trade Practices Act at the moment in clause 51AC is providing a set of rules for the people who deal with small business. I just do not understand why you would want to deny small business and micro-business in Australia the opportunity of having consumer law for them. Why are you denying small business and micro-business this opportunity? For some unknown reason, for some political point scoring-I do not know-you want to deny them that opportunity. You want to take away additional weight that the government has added to the committee report. That is what you want to do. The unfair aspects of what you are talking about are in fact included in clause 51AC. Clearly, they are there. You are in self-denial if you say that they are not. As for this treacherous thing you talk about, it is unbelievable that you cannot see this as a benefit for small business. Maybe it is because you do not understand small business. Maybe it is because you have never actually dealt with small business. Talking to them does not actually mean that you actually deal with them. Have you actually gone through start-up? Have you actually gone through 'unconscionable conduct' in the past? Have you? The answer is no, you have not.",125
199,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Firstly, in terms of those who agree with us, I refer the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to comments in today's Newcastle Herald regarding this legislation, the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997, to make him aware-which he may not be-that his colleague the Fatuous Phantom of Paterson has been requested by the Newcastle small business community to support these amendments. This is the same member who made a fatuous promise a few weeks ago to cross the floor on chicken meat. Chicken Meat Bob, the Fatuous Phantom, was going to cross the floor! Small business in Newcastle is asking him and his colleague Senator Tierney right now to cross the floor on this one. If he does, we will get it through very quickly and it will become law before April. It is dead simple. This can be adopted very quickly if those coalition members-the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), the member for Cowan, Senator Tierney and others who proclaim their support for small business-were to adopt the report. The member for Cowan's idea that these matters were not discussed is not just wrong but actually offensive. He is saying we did not think of them. What he is saying we did not think of is that we should have a special law only for a certain group of people and that we put that in the Trade Practices Act. The group of people those opposite are talking about is those where turnover is a million dollars. That might sound like an awful lot to many people, but for people selling petrol, for example, and for many farmers-as my colleague mentioned earliera million dollar turnover on very low margins is actually not that much at all. The fact is that we on that committee are very aware of the boundary between small business and non-small business. We are very aware of micro and medium sized enterprises and of all those different boundaries. Quite frankly, the last thing we wanted to do was to create yet another special bed of red tape, another special category applying only to certain people, which would encourage all people to break up their businesses into smaller and smaller sizes to fit within the special provisions. This clause 51AC is a recipe for disaster because it is going to encourage businesses to break themselves up into smaller parts to fit within the provisions. We did not want that. We on the committee were very aware that we could make recommendations for particular cases. We wanted to change the Trade Practices Act in a couple of ways. The first thing to keep in mind is that small businesses are consumers. They have no protection as consumers. Small businesses are inferior in bargaining and negotiation. We wanted them to have equality-not special laws, just equal laws. And the fact is that there were no laws that covered them because of unconscionability. It has been said over and over in this place this evening that the word 'unconscionable' does not come with clean hands; it has a lot of meaning established in precedent. The report goes to those meanings over and over again and says it must be broadened. We looked at adding words to it. We looked at adding 'harsh' and 'oppressive' and other words and we concluded that they would not improve the situation. The only way to broaden it was to have the act changed, to get rid of that word altogether and to bring in a new word that had its own connotations and also had something else a bit special: a touch of morality. Within Australia the word 'fairness' has a special meaning to us. We are, after all, a country of a fair go. We use the word daily. It is used with the idea of a handshake, of a deal and of people negotiating in good faith and in fairness. We wished to enshrine in our legislation what we see as being the Australian ethos of fairness, and we discussed that in detail for a long time over more than one day. So we knew what we were doing. The audacity of the member for Cowan to come in here and say we did not understand and we did not know what we were doing is not just treachery; it is disgraceful and a misrepresentation of both the committee's deliberations and its intent. As for what the government is doing, cabinet has rolled the committee members and these backbenchers are defending a cabinet decision which is indefensible. Small business wants a fair go. We called the report Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. We asked for a clause about unfair trading. The logic is inescapable. The symmetry is there. We knew what we were doing. (Time expired)",125
200,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (6.36 p.m.)Whilst my colleague was talking, and in response to a question that was addressed to me earlier by the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) about why we were pursuing this issue of unfairness compared with unconscionable, I took the opportunity to compare the 51AC proposals that the government is putting forward and the amendments that we are proposing at 51AA, 'Unfair conduct'. I say, to the honourable ""member for Cowan that there is absolutely nothing in legislation proposed either by the government or by us which is going to disadvantage small business. In fact, we will argue strongly, and we are arguing strongly, that in respect of conduct, for all the legitimate reasons that have already outlined stemming from the report on fair trading, in which the honourable member for Cowan was an active participant, we believe that the unfair conduct provisions are preferable because of the tests in law, because of the fact that it opens it up to many more small business enterprises and because they feel they can get a better deal. They are words that your government, member for Cowan, use quite regularly-'wanting a better deal, a fairer deal'. We are saying that the unfair conduct provisions are part of that because they go to those sorts of issues-they go to harshness. The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) raised the very point: the comments and the recommendations which you as a member of that committee made about those sorts of issues are omitted from the government's own proposals here. And you are now saying that you believe that it was because you had not thought of it before or that the committee is not a bunch of lawyers and could therefore not pursue it. Let me ask a question of the honourable member for Cowan or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) or, indeed, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who has now joined us. What is the difference between your proposals here on unconscionable conduct and what originally was proposed in 1995 by Chris Schacht, as the then minister for small business, on unconscionable conduct or in the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on better business conduct?",126
201,Mr CADMAN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Unconscionable.,127
202,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I presume in the case of the Leader of the Opposition it was because it was an opposition private member's bill and we all know the fate of those. So it really is a rhetorical question. I accept that from the parliamentary secretary. If you have now picked up the unconscionability issue, which Kim Beazley had before this place as a private member's bill in May 1996, why didn't you deal with it then? Why didn't the government pick it up at the time and deal unfair with it then? Why now hide behind this we smokescreen of unconscionability when what the committee recommended, having taken evidence, required unfair conduct? Why, when the opposition comes along and says, 'Having adopted that report, we are quite happy to facilitate this through the other House as quickly as we can because it reflects what we believe is going to give a better deal to small business on unconscionability,' are we still mucking around with this? Why is the government not accepting a report in which the majority of its own members came forward and said, 'Unfair conduct should be pursued; for all the reasons outlined in chapter 6 of the Reid committee report unconscionability is a difficult issue in a legal sense'? Why is the government still mucking around with this issue? Why is this the case? Mr Richard Evans-This is better.",127
203,Mr MARTIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The member for Cowan interjects, 'This is better' - 'this' meaning what the government is proposing with 51AC. The fundamental point that we stick by is that we do not believe that it is better. Having examined very closely what the committee, in which you participated as a member, put forward to this parliament after extensive research and discussion with the small business constituency, we believe that what you as a committee put forward was sound and reasonable. We do not believe-and this is the fundamental difference-that 51AC is a better proposition. We do not believe that that which you are suggesting on unconscionability in business transactions is a better proposition than that which you and the member for Paterson, as members of the committee, recommended on unfair conduct. We think that those parts that have been conveniently left out of clause 51AC being proposed by the government-harshness and soon which the member for Scullin referred to-need to be given appropriate airing. (Time expired)",127
204,Mr BOB BALDWIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I have been sitting and listening to this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997. I have heard the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), also known as Anti-enterprise Allan come out and say some rather incredible things. The first thing I would like to address is his comment about attendance at committee meetings. Mr Allan Morris-Tell us when you came to the meetings?",128
205,Mr BOB BALDWIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"One of the reasons why one does not go to meetings with Allan Morris, and perhaps you would know this yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your own position",128
206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,Mr Hollis)We will stick to the amendments that we are debating.,128
207,Mr BOB BALDWIN,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am talking about the amendments and the comments made by the member for Newcastle. He made comments about attendance at committee meetings. As I said, you would know yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your role at the meetings we had, that the member for Newcastle turned up late because not one of his own colleagues bothered to pick up the phone and get him, because they find him an absolute bore. Perhaps that is the reason why. But there are other reasons. I also heard the member for Newcastle talking· about the contribution of the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) on small business, so I did a little database search. Since entering parliament in 1983, Anti-enterprise Allan has spoken a total of six times on small business. The first time was on the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Amendment Bill in 1983, where he spoke a little bit about R&D-not much. On the Commonwealth Guarantees (Charges) Bill on 17 February 1987-only a four-year gap-he spoke a little bit about Australian industrial development interest rate subsidies. He spoke then on 24 May 1988 on the Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill-he has really picked up his tempo now; he had it down to once a year-on research and development. Then on 11 April 1989 he spoke on Appropriation Bill (No.3) about the steel plan. Finally, really winding up the tempo on 10 September 1992, he spoke about the Australian Taxation Office and how it did not have a small business unit. On 28 September 1993 there was again a great contribution to small business. He spoke about the NIES programs and how they would benefit people getting into business. He claims to have been on all these committees and to have been a great contributor to helping small business in its plight, but where was the argument, where was taking the point forward for his government of the day? By the same token, from 28 September 1993 until 1996 there was no comment at all about small business-not one word about the Beddall report or any contribution. This man is an absolute hypocrite. He goes around talking about his support for small business. He would not even know what a balance sheet is. He has absolutely no understanding. He claims to be an academic, has never been in small business, but here he is, the great saviour of small business. Going to the amendments, part of the debate seems to be about the difference between 'unconscionable' and 'unfair'. Wouldn't it be more realistic, to do what small business wants, to get something in place so that out in the community they can get on with their work, on with their business, and to stop the suffering delivered to them by the former Labor government? Unconscionable conduct and the problems with retail tenancy did not start on 2 March 1996. These have been around for years and years. I read out all the contributions of the member for Newcastle, known as Anti-enterprise Allan in another life, and before that he was the Grim Reaper because he gets such joy out of unemployment figures that he created. I think those opposite need to be brought to account for the fact that they did absolutely nothing in the 13 years they were in government, and they would continue to do nothing. This whole debate now is about a delaying process and putting at risk of bankruptcy even more businesses. The reality is that this legislation should be passed and then we should look at where we should go from there. Let us build a foundation stone we can go forward from.",128
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Mr Hollis)Order! I know that this debate has been rather vigorous and colourful, but I suggest that the House might be helped if members referred to other members by their electorate name and refrained from lowering the standard of debate by referring to members by various other names or derogatory names, which has happened on both sides of the House. I have given a general warning now. The next speaker who does not refer to someone by their electorate name will be pulled up. Having said that, and I know the honourable member for Scullin will take heed of that, I call the honourable member for Scullin.",129
209,Mr JENKINS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I am most wounded by suffering that general warning! However, I refer honourable members to the explanatory memorandum, because a furphy that has been put into this debate is that in some way the opposition's sponsorship of the amendment to section 51AA is on the basis that it is advantageous to big business or it is something that they want. In the impact statement aspect of the explanatory memorandum, option 4, the government's proposed action to insert a new section 51AC, under 'Costs' there is a dot point which reads: Larger finns view this approach as unduly trenching on their contractual and property rights. finns would also bear increased compliance costs from such an amendment. Option 5 is to adopt committee recommendation 6.1, which is the proposed amendment to 51 AA that the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has moved. What do we find under 'Costs'? There is a dot point that says: Larger finns view this approach as unduly trenching on their contractual and property rights. finns would also bear increased compliance costs from such an amendment. I score that as not a nil-all draw but a one-all draw. So let us not hear this furphy that in some way the proposal we are putting forward is done so on the basis that it helps big business or that it is being pushed by big business. The other aspect is the comments that are made in the explanatory memorandum when talking about option 5, that is, the adoption of the committee's recommendation 6.1, the amendment to 51AA. Under 'Benefits' it says: imposition of a broad duty of good faith in commercial transactions which would be likely to cover most of the issues raised during the Fair Trading inquiry; will meet small business expectations about the need for general protection against exploitation by larger finns; and the codified nature of the Committee's recommendation would assist compliance once initial legal action clarifies the meaning of key tenns. I am not worried about that proviso at the end-'once initial legal action clarifies the meaning of key terms'-because both the government and the opposition in discussing their proposals acknowledge that there will be an element of test cases surrounding these issues. Whilst the government is trying to say that, because the equitable doctrine of unconscionability has been tested in law, it has a basis, and on the other hand says it has beefed it up through its clause 3, there are elements there that have to be tested. All clause 3 says is that these are matters of which the courts may take regard-may. As I understand it, 'may' is a very important legal term because it does not in any way indicate that there is any definitiveness about Large matters. Likewise, under our proposal on 51AA, we ask that courts may take regard of certain items. I acknowledge that. This really boils down to not the argument about· whether or not small business should get special treatment. What small business wants is the ability to have access to an. element of the Trade Practices Act that will· give them some defence over behaviour that is seen to be unfair. That is why there was Large this discussion about whether, if they were actually consumers, they would have better protection. Again, they were not necessarily looking for anything special; they were looking for elements that were available· to others. That is why this amendment to 51AA fulfils the types of indications that small business wanted and the types of indications that were discussed by the committee as being required. That is why 51AA as proposed to be amended will give that type of protection to small business. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Martin's) be agreed Miles, C. G. to. The House divided.

210,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"Cunningham) (7.00 p.m.}--I move opposition amendment No.5: (5) Schedule 2, item 2, page 8 (lines 20-23), omit proposed subsection 51AC(7), substitute: (7) A reference in this section to the supply or possible supply of goods or services does not include a reference to the supply or possible supply of goods or services to: (a) a manufacturing business in which more than 100 persons are employed; or (b) any other business in which more than 20 persons are employed. The amendment we are proposing to the government's legislation replaces the $1 million transaction limit as foreshadowed in the government's bill to the definition of small business. We believe that this will ensure that small businesses such as service stations will be covered by the legislation and that it removes any uncertainty. It will also ensure that only small businesses can utilise the unfair provisions-it does not mean it is going to be the large businesses that my friend the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) raised earlier when we were talking about the unfair versus unconscionable provisions. The amendment has the support not only of the small business community but also of many organisations. I have had representations from service station owners, from APADA, Wren Oil, Gulf Petroleum and Mulhearn Waste Oil Removal Pty Ltd. I have letters from many of those organisations which say that they desperately want to see that change because they do not believe the $1 million is going to give adequate protection, particularly in the service station areas. Our view is that this minor amendment, in the broad scheme of things, will still enable the government's proposals to be picked up, but it does include the definition of small business from the ABS rather than the $1 million issue. I commend that particular amendment to the House.",130
211,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"The definition of small business and trying to target anything towards small business is a difficult issue. I cannot say that the committee was able to come up with any distinct ideas about this, but the report states in the introduction at 1.6 on page 2: This Committee has previously defined small business as: · being independently owned and managed; · being closely controlled by owner/managers who also contribute most, if not all of the operating capital; and · having the principal decision making functions resting with the owner/managers. A definition like that would not really do anything for this particular clause in the bill, and I accept that. But the committee went on to say that the definition of small business can be qualified by a size component and used the definition that is being proposed by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) in this amendment. In the second reading debate I raised one element about this $1 million figure, and I have not yet received an answer about the transactions; that is, whether a contract over five years at $200,001 or a lO-year contract at $100,001, which would go over the $1 million, would mean that people would not have the relief of this proposed amendment. I think that is something the government has to take on board and give a proper answer about. There are many businesses we would define as small business which would be in this category of having a fiveor lO-year contract that would take them over the $1 million mark. Amendment negatived.",131
212,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"Cunningham) (7.05 p.m.}-by leave-In view of the fact that the earlier decision went against the opposition, amendment No.6 standing in my name is no longer relevant. I will not therefore pursue that; I can count. I seek leave to move amendments Nos 7 and 8 circulated in my name together. Leave granted.",131

These amendments propose to introduce a uniform retail tenancy code utilising the Commonwealth's corporations power under section 51(xx) of the Australian constitution. Despite comments that were made by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the House yesterday, in answer to a dorothy dix question, we are not proposing under any circumstances to introduce any taxing powers, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman) should know better as well. The way our amendment has been drafted specifically precludes that particular issue. It was one part of the advice the MTAA received and they suggested that that might be one way for this to be put in place. We clearly ruled that out and it is not part of this proposal. In respect of this uniform retail tenancy code, we have looked at a number of those codes and we have also drawn on the recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report. In the amendment I have moved, under division 2-Uniform retail tenancy code-that is a direct lift of recommendation 2.2 of the Reid committee report. Minimum term of retail shop and service station leases is recommendation 2.4; lease renewals is also recommendation 2.4; lease assignment is recommendation 2.5; standard set of lease provisions is recommendation 2.9; precontract disclosure is recommendations 2.5 and 2.7; market rent review is recommendations 2.6 and 2.7; disturbance to trading is recommendation 2.11; retail tenancy mix is recommendation 2.10; merchants associations to be consulted is recommendation 2.8; statements of outgoings is recommendation 2.8; and dispute resolution provisions is recommendation 2.3. Under enforcement, retail lease tribunals to be established is recommendation 2.3; application of retail lease tribunal is recommendation 2.3; consideration of matters by retail lease tribunal is recommendation 2.3; and action where recourse to Retail Lease Tribunal has not resolved dispute is recommendation 2.3. I read through that because it does illustrate a point we made earlier in this debate; that is, the recommendations that the opposition is moving to strengthen the provisions of the Retail Act that we are dealing with tonight are direct lifts from the Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia report brought down under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), with the support of the honourable· member for Cowan, both of whom voted against that during the course of tonight'S discussions. The recommendations in section 2 on retail tenancy have been completely skirted by the government; not one piece of legislation has come forward from the government in respect of this. The government is claiming that constitutionally this is not possible. We vehemently disagree that this is not possible and we believe that a uniform retail tenancy code developed at the national level gets over many of the problems of inconsistencies at the state level. It is going to be there and we have said that it is a proposal which, in our view and in the view of the committee that reported-but we have seen tonight already that quite a number of those committee members have walked away from the recommendations that they signed up to before-will certainly help small business. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Cadman), who is at the table, is shaking his head. Think back to that meeting in Newcastle. Most of the people there were retail tenants. There are stories of misery contained in the fair trading inquiry report about retailers having to battle major shopping centre owners and operators to get a fair deal, a fair go that the government keeps talking about. We believe that is possible through the amendments that we are proposing tonight. Quite obviously, we find it extraordinary that the government cannot see that this is a possibility. Again, why is it that the Reid committee made recommendations about retail tenancy issues, about putting retail lease tribunals in place, giving good cheap access to justice, and now they are walking away from all of them? It is a real question that needs to be asked. I am sure those on the other side who served on this committee will probably be looking at themselves in the mirror tonight or tomorrow and asking themselves the same question. If they do not, when they get back to their constituencies I am sure the small business community will, by the time we get through telling them all about what you have voted on. This report, as I have said, we adopt in full. The government were supposed to do that and they have squibbed it. I would like to know why they squibbed this most important element of the committee report. (Time expired)",131
214,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,PAIRS,"I must first respond to the comments the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) made early this evening and I would point out to him just a couple of little things. The first thing is that I did not spend hours berating the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) about what he had done in the last 13 years; he did that to us. I think his record in that context does not stand scrutiny. Secondly, the member for Paterson failed to mention the fact that I was actually a member of the Beddall committee. I actually went to most of the hearings then, too, as on this one. He also failed to admit, accept or concede publicly that he attended one hearing, simply because it was a meeting in Canberra. He did not come to any of the hearings around Australia; he took very little evidence; he signed up to the report and is now walking away from it. The fact is that he has been asked by business people in Newcastle to cross the floor on this issue. He has chosen not to, and he should explain that to his community and to his business people because they expected better of him. The first dot point in the terms of reference in this inquiry states: the major business conduct issues arising out of commercial dealings between firms including, but not limited to, franchising and retail tenancy. Retail tenancy is up there in lights as part of this inquiry. It is without doubt the most difficult area in small business trading around the country and it was also the subject of the majority of submissions. As a local member, as I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the parliament are, I am getting constant concerns coming forward from people who are in difficulty in retail tenancies. A lot of our time was spent on this aspect of the report; we put a lot of effort into trying to work through what we should do. We ended up with a set of recommendations for a national tenancy code. The fact is that, if we cannot do this, why were we given the reference? Is the government so incompetent that it gave us a reference about retail tenancies, knowing that we could not legislate? Are we so badly advised by our secretariat and all those who made submissions to us that we spent an awful lot of our time and a lot of public resources on retail tenancies, with a recommendation for a national code enshrined within the Trade Practices Act, only to be told by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) that we cannot do that? What is going on here? We have suddenly got a concocted report from a lawyer who says-and I gather the minister is saying this-we can do this only if it is about taxes. So he is somehow trying to run this line that the committee recommendation was for a new tax. What these amendments are about is adopting the recommendations of the committee for a national tenancy code enshrined within the Trade Practices Act. That is what it is about. It is simple; it is not a complex concept. It is legal, it is constitutional and it is desirable. For too long we have had competing states with confusing and conflicting legislation. I will just touch on one small issue: the rights of existing tenants, which is probably the single most important issue in shopping centres. We recommended that sitting tenants have rights, a right to renewal-not the right to leave, which is what the landlords say. What they were saying to the committee was that, once the lease runs out, that is it. So people plan their lives for three or five years and somehow they are supposed to recover all their costs and investments in that short time. This has never been the case before because there was always a thing called goodwill. The landlords now say there is no goodwill, simply a lease; and when it is finished, you have to assume you are going to go. We said no, we should assume there is a right to renew-a logical, natural, moral position. The South Australian parliament is legislating now to in fact enshrine such a right. Nowhere else in Australia is. So what we are suggesting is that we do not want this state versus state, bit by bit practice; we want a uniform single code, not simply in theory but backed up by the Trade Practices Act. If we cannot do it, why the reference? If we cannot do it, why did the chairman of the committee and the government majority have us spend all this time on it and why on earth did we recommend it? It just does not make any sense. Either the government is stupid or it is wrong now. I support the amendments. (Time expired)",140
215,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"In supporting these amendments, I think we have to place on record that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology did indeed believe that the Commonwealth had powers to underpin a uniform retail tenancy code in the Trade Practices Act 1974. If we go to recommendati9n 2.2 on page 26, and I will read it for completeness, we see that it states: The Committee recommends that the Minister request the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code for underpinning in the Trade Practices Act 1974, thus providing for the courts to take into account provisions of the Uniform Retail Tenancy Code in determining whether or not business conduct in the area of retail tenancy has been 'unfair' and thus unlawful. I acknowledge that the context of that recommendation is slightly different from the proposal that has been put forward tonight. But we have to remember that, in the response to the committee's report, the weakest part of the government's response was in the area of retail tenancy matters. The committee made the important recommendation that these issues be taken to the ministerial council. Paragraph 2.41 at page 27 states: The Committee does not see such underpinning as a substitute for quick, low cost resolution of individual disputes through State and Territory retail tenancy dispute resolution processes. We acknowledge that state and territory jurisdictions have a lot to do in this. Even this amendment, clause 131, 'Saving of other laws and remedies', states: This Part is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law in force in a State or Territory. The simple matter is that in the government's response to the fair trading report the federal government's position is left up in the air as to what should be contained in a uniform retail tenancy code. This is an attempt to ensure that the matters that were highlighted by the committee are included in a uniform retail tenancy code. The amendment covers most of those matters that were highlighted by the committee. So that is the issue that we see tonight in the consideration of these amendments. Firstly, there is the furphy that this cannot be done. There is the furphy that it can only be done and it involves some form of taxing powers, which is just one of those throwaway lines to camouflage what is not a proper debate of the issues at hand. The other thing is that, regrettably, after all the work that done by the committee and all the matters that were highlighted by the committee, the government's response was mute about the federal government's position on all the matters that. were outlined. That is a disappointment, because the issues that were put to us by retail tenants were harrowing, andthey continue to occur. As I mentioned in my second reading contribution to this bill, they continue to occur, whether it be through changes of retail tenancy mix or whether it be through changes to disturbance of trading because of redevelopment and the like. These matters are real. They affect small businesses from one end of Australia to the other. Consistent in what the committee was exposed to was that, no matter where we went, the stories were siInlJar, the stories very distressing and the effect that it had had on the people that were involved in these small businesses was real. This is an attempt by the opposition to put this uniform retail tenancy code forward so that it can give direction to where the federal government sees these matters going.",141
216,Mr MARTIN,PAIRS,"Cunningham) (7.19 p.m.)In the final contribution tonight, regrettably, because of the time constraint that has been placed on us, I will just quickly reiterate what the purpose of these two amendments is. Firstly, Labor is attempting to introduce the uniform retail tenancy code utilising the Commonwealth's corporations power under section 51(xx) of the Australia constitution. Secondly, in relation to lease renewal or extension, the uniform retail tenancy code would require an independent market review jointly financed by both the leaser and the lessee. The code would include a pre-contract disclosure statement in line with recommendation 2.5 of the Reid report. Disclosures would include disturbance to trading, retail tenancy mix, consultation with merchant associations and a statement of outgoings. The code would be prospective and only apply to small businesses, not to anchor tenants. The code would provide for a step-by-step dispute resolution mechanism and also cover service stations. Again, the reasons we are doing this are that we maintain the Reid committee report was did set some standards. We believe the Commonwealth has the power to do this. We believe it is important for retail tenants to understand that they are going to get some protection; they are going to know that when they are entering into lease arrangements with shopping centre owners those arrangements are going to be done in an atmosphere of fairness and equity. At the present time in many cases that is not the case. We also believe that each of those proposals we have put forward here directly lifts from the Reid committee report and, therefore, I reiterate that we cannot understand why those members of the government that sat on this committee now have walked away from this and have let the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr were Reith) simply abrogate any responsibility in respect of the matter. The reason I say this is that I know he is meeting with small business ministers from the states on Friday. I know that at that meeting he is going to put to them some heavies, as he has done to many small business organisations, saying, 'Cop what we're putting up or you'll get nothing at all.' I find that extraordinary when, in the light of evidence that was given to the Senate estimates committee on 12 November this year, a representative of the Office of Small Business indicated that there was absolutely no chance of their getting a uniform agreement on uniform retail tenancy laws across the states, that there has not been in the past and there will not be in the future. That is why a uniform retail tenancy code is necessary from the national level-a top-down approach-and we are providing that opportunity again. Labor, as usual, is providing that opportunity. Finally, the minister and many others on the other side have talked about 'political smokescreens'. They have claimed that this is a stunt, and all the rest of it. I again say to those opposite that this is not a stunt. Labor is genuinely trying to ensure that the fair trading legislation we are dealing with gives small business a fair go. Labor is attempting to keep honest those recommendations which came from the fair trading inquiry report, which had the unanimous support of those committee members. Labor has adopted that report. We cannot for the life of us understand why the government has decided not to do so---a government which constantly berates Labor for what it is purported not to have done in its tenn in office, a government which says that it is, after all, the high priest looking after the interests of small business. I think small business will be the judge of this. When they find out that members of the committee and the government itself have chosen not to support the recommendations which they have been looking for in the small business community they will be stunned. I commend our amendments to the House. I regret that we do not have longer to debate each and every one of them in the fine detail that I would like, but we certainly will do when the Senate considers these matters next year. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Martin's) be agreed to. The House divided. [7.28 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr G.B. Nehl) Ayes ............... Noes ............... Majority .........

217,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"In this adjournment debate, I would like to talk about the work of United Way, an organisation which raises finances through voluntary payroll deductions to assist a number of charities in particular regions. Currently, there are nine separate United Way groups operating in Australia. I became interested in this organisation when, as president of the Labor Council of New South Wales, the then secretary, Michael Easson, invited me to take his place on the board of United Way in Sydney. The organisation distributes finances collected to over 20 charities on a twice-yearly basis in the Sydney metropolitan area. The charities that receive assistance for specific projects range from: community outreach ministries, which give practical help in housing and the teaching of living skills to homeless youth and young people suffering from mental disabilities; the Riding for the Disabled Association, which provides therapeutic and recreational horse riding and related activities, including harness driving and ing, to people with disabilities; the Children's Leukemia and Cancer Foundation, which provides quality care and support for affected children and families as well as world-class research to find cures and more effective treatments; the Infants Home at Ashfield, which provides early intervention programs for children aged six weeks to five years and their families-and the intervention programs include child abuse, crisis accommodation for mothers and children and a day stay program for issues relating to children under two years. These are just four worthy charities that are assisted. To give this parliament an idea of what United Way is about, I quote from a message from the chairman, Robert Sutton: I invite you to join the United Way team and urge you to support this wonderful concept of 'sharing and caring' in United Way's campaign to raise funds for a broad range of health and welfare agencies that operate in the Sydney region. The driving force of our organisation is volunteer effort and the success of fundraising campaigns have demonstrated how effective and worthwhile the United Way volunteer approach is in helping the less fortunate among us. United Way operates on a large scale in many countries and I have been involved with the organisation in the United States and in Asia, seeing first hand the important contribution it can make through having employers and employees working together in a co-operative and voluntary fashion towards the common goal of contributing to support local community needs. In Sydney we have made an important start with the support of a number of major organisations, and the many thousands of dollars distributed over the last five years to local human care groups is already making a difference. I am confident that United Way is destined to become one of the most important sources of funds to health and welfare agencies in the region. United Way of Sydney operates on the basis that, by March each year, charities are asked to submit applications for funding projects which focus on services in response to crises or a change in the circumstances for families, children or the aged, or a combination of these. Highest priority will be given to applications that are from an approved beneficiary; are for the funding of a project, not the entire organisation; have a budget which clearly vaultshows United Way funds supplementing other funds already being applied to the project; show that funding has a direct impact on the clients of the project; and are for a period of 12 months. Applications are then considered by a beneficiaries committee, which undertakes a formal review of each application and accompanying documentation that shows proof of compijance with United Way requirements. There are many calls on the generosity of our community due to the many problems facing our society-whether we are looking at drugs, homelessness, escalating crime, concerns for our safety, poverty and worries about the care of our children and the elderly, just to name a few. There are many national organisations such as the Smith Family, the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul, who are all staffed by volunteers, and many smaller organisations, such as the Tuesday night club in my electorate of Greenway, which assists intellectually handicapped people. All of these organisations are deserving of our generous support. However, United Way seeks to top up charities that have already proved their worth to society but are still in need of additional equipment. People who agree to contribute a small amount each week through payroll deduction, as far as United Way Sydney is concerned, are assisting 20 charities. (Time expired) Essay Competition",144
218,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Every year I run the Fisher electorate essay competition in two sections-a primary school section and a secondary school section. Over the last couple of days I have been privileged to host the winners in Canberra and would like to congratulate the winning primary student, Cohen Devereux, of Matthew Flinders Anglican College, Buderim, and Tracey Barnes, from Yarraman P-lO School, who won the secondary section. Both of these students reside in my electorate. 'The topic this year is 'How Australia, the best country in the world, can be made even better' . I would like to read the winning essays into Hansard. The essay by Cohen Devereux reads: Sandy beaches famous attractions such as the Sydney Opera House, Ayers Rock and many theme parks. These are just a few of the things that make Australia the best country in the world. With Australia being the sixth largest country in the world I think we have to set a good example to other smaller countries. I think the three main things we need to focus on are crime, tourism and pollution to certainly make Australia the best country in the world. These subjects will appear in the order that I have stated them in. NA Crime is a subject that I think we as a nation really need to crack down on. Did you know that four out of every 100,000 people are murdered in Australia. The situation is further complicated because more and more tourists are coming to Australia all the time which means that there is more people in Australia resulting in more murders. This shows why tourists are afraid to come to Australia because of these facts. Capital punishment should be returned to the penalty list for people who commit serious crimes. If this is done then eventually crime will be minimal and tourists won't be afraid to visit our wonderful country every now and then. NA Tourism is a big money earner to Australia so I think that Australia should invest a little more money into tourist's attractions and accommodation. If this is done there will be less unemployment because of new facilities being opened therefore leaving many vacancies in job positions. When these facilities are opened people from far and wide will hear about the wonderful activities and accommodation in Australia and will come to see for themselves. , POLLUTION Pollution is the bad side of our wonderful country. It destroys the country's natural physique and ruins its beauty. Another bad thing about pollution is that tourists hate it and return to their own countries with bad health reports. With the government investing money into the big businesses that cause the pollution and not investing much money into stopping pollution it makes bringing in more money for other things like tourism very hard. To conclude I would like to say that Australia is a beautiful place and the three things we need to focus on to make it even better are crime, tourism and pollution. So just keep these subjects in mind and maybe even carry them out and we can make our nation BEITER! The essay by Tracey Barnes reads: You hear about people complaining about our country's faults but they never come up with any real solutions that everyone agrees on. To m;lke Australia a better country than it already is, we've got to stop and think about where we want to be in the future. I understand that some people won't like my suggestions, but this is what I, myself believe, will make us a greater country than we already are. I think employment levels can be improved upon by not buying overseas products. Instead we could produce them here in Australia. That way we would not only create more jobs, but we would be saving money by not having to pay the fee for overseas imports. If this doesn't work and people are still on the dole, they can always work for their money, such as helping their local council, even if it is only once a week. That way, they'll not only feel better by doing something, but they will also have something written in their resume for when they do go for a job interview. Our health system could be improved upon by having more people immunized. I know that a small percentage of people are allergic to these, but isn't it a risk worth taking? Hundreds of crimes are being committed each year throughout Australia. To lessen this number harsher penalties are needed. This could include longer sentences and less luxurious prison cells. (This would cost less because money wouldn't be spent on comfort.) Even the death penalty could be reintroduced for cold hearted crimes such as murder and rape. Already over half of our forests have been destroyed over the past two hundred years. Where we will be in another two centuries if we keep on this way? We need timber to build houses. furniture and to make paper. just to name a few. but we also need forests for our wildlife, picnics and for future generations to enjoy. Recycling is a great idea. the more we recycle the less trees that have to be cut down. Another idea is to plant trees where forests once existed. This would need to be done each time a tree is cut down to be effective. I'm sure if all Australians worked together we could bring these suggestions into reality. That way, even though we are already the best country in the world, we would be even better. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate these students and to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for their courtesy in meeting these students. I would also like to thank the Chief Government Whip (Mr Andrew) for his courtesy to them. I know you, Mr Speaker, were keen to see them but your commitments meant that this was not able to occur. These are outstanding young people. We have every reason to be proud of them and I hope to see two more wonderful young students from Fisher in parliament next year. Stolen Children",145
219,Ms HANSON,TOURISM,"It saddens me to speak of the stolen children, but with the current division produced by the ridiculous notion that native title has validity it is a subject that must be raised. I speak of course of the thousands who, from the turn of the century until the 1960s, were taken from their parents and forced to travel great distances where they found themselves living in the company of strangers. Evidence shows that some suffered sadistic treatment and sexual abuse-horrors that can never be excused. Many of the records have been destroyed and very few of these innocent children were ever reunited with their relatives. Indeed, it was a dark period in our young nation's past. It may surprise the House to know that I do not speak of Aboriginal children but of the estimated 40,000 children transported to Australia by various British charities. The story of the stolen British children parallels that of the stolen Aboriginal children. It all happened around the same time and many of the reasons for separation from families were similar. The justification will always be a source of argument and, of course, in both cases there were reports of terrible illtreatment. In perspective, there were approximately 150,000 stolen British children. Not only did those sent to Australia apparently outnumber their Aboriginal counterparts but it seems that, with very few exceptions, they did not return home or experience any family reunion. You could argue at length the differences between what was suffered by each group and the rights and wrongs of separation, but that serves no purpose. The point is that the stolen British children sent to Australia and indeed the removal of children from the slums of Melbourne in the early part of the century put more into context the equality of suffering. I do not wish to attempt to justify what happened to the Aboriginal people. Rather, the point is that they do not have a monopoly on suffering, and history clearly shows that to be the truth. When Noel Pearson was reported recently as declaring war on white Australia, all Australians should have realised the war started long ago when Aboriginal and nonAboriginal activists began their unconscionable public relations exercise aimed at raising the level of gUilt in white Australia. In this PR war, truth was the first casualty, for truth would not serve the purpose of the strategic attack on the emotions and conscience of ordinary Australians. The young in particular have fallen foul of this outrageously deceitful exercise aimed at bringing us to the point where we are about to give perhaps as much as 80 per cent of our country to about two per cent of our population-all in the name of compensation and to free ourselves of the guilt so carefully vated and effectively massaged into our minds. There is no doubt many Aborigines are disadvantaged, but there equally is no doubt they are not on their own in their suffering either now or in the past. There are plenty of examples of, as I said before, equality of suffering, but this PR machine of guilt assaults us with indecent comment not balanced by the surrounding circumstances of history. The stolen children report, Bringing them home, was just one of the more recent examples designed to make us guilty about the past. It was sad. It was terrible and individual stories tugged at the hearts of Australians everywhere-myself included. But it was as if these awful privations were solely owned and experienced by Aborigines. Of course, that is a lie. If the report's purpose was guilt, it served well and its timing was impeccable. We cannot turn back the hands of time, and no amount of compensation will ever change what happened. We will never have true reconciliation until we rid our society of divisive policies clearly based on race alone. We must also rid ourselves of those who financially feed off the exercise of misleading both the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people of Australia. Equality for all Australians is the only path to a cohesive future as one nation.",146
220,Mrs GASH,TOURISM,"I rise to welcome the recent announcement by the United States oil giant Texaco of its intention to pull out of operations in Burma. I too share the view displayed by the company's shareholders and the free-thinking Burmese people that this decision is a victory for democracy. The human rights abuses which the SLORC has perpetuated against the nation of 45 million people is well documented. It has been raised in the House by numerous other speakers. I am pleased the message from Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy is being received by the governments of democratic nations and, more importantly, by multinational corporations whose operations prop up and preserve the culti- power of the SLORC and its generals in Burma. I wish to quote the Reverend Paarlberg, a leader of the Reformed Church of America, an organisation that has been very vocal in its opposition to companies which have a history of doing business with companies which display a poor record in the area of basic human rights. He said: Texaco's decision is a tremendous victory for the Burmese people. It sends a clear message to Burma's military dictatorship that there will be no Business As Usual, until democracy returns. We know that multinational oil company investment provides the largest legal source of currency to the regime. We also know that this particular industry relies heavily in its early developmental stages on a substantial labour force. It is this recruitment of labour and the methods used by the SLORC which have led Amnesty International to report that what particularly distinguished the Burmese junta from other modem tyrannies was its use of slave labour. We should remind investors in oil companies which participate in these projects that the money derived from such ventures, constructed on the bones of Burmese men, women, and children, cannot be justified as contributing to the wealth of the country. I hope the decision taken by Texaco will increase the pressure on other companies to Burma seriously consider their continued operations in Burma. It has been reported that there is a growing protest in some states of America against companies doing business with the SLORC. Businesses have been urged to restrict trade with the military junta. While Texaco's decision has been welcomed by the wider community, the decision by Premier Oil of Britain to buy Texaco shares in the Yetagun project still does not resolve the issue of foreign investment. A spokesperson for the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma said: We welcome Texaco's gesture and we appeal to Premier to seriously reconsider their deal with Burma's illegitimate regime. We believe it is against the current trend of the UK Government's Burma policy and the position of Aung San Suu Kyi who advocates no foreign investment with SLORC. The United Kingdom government is following the line adopted by the United States. The United Kingdom foreign minister said that his government would discourage economic activity in Burma and would urge companies considering doing business in that country to think about their human rights record and listen to the government's advice before making a decision about whether or not to proceed. In July, the Burton Group and Polo Ralph Lauren became the latest groups to pull out of Burma. The Burton Group issued a statement that it had instructed its suppliers to place no further contracts for sourcing from Burma and to terminate all existing contracts by the end of the year. In its statement the company said that it is the Burton Group's policy to listen to its customers and this decision has been taken following a review of customer opinion. We in the House acknowledge the firm stand taken by the United States President, Bill Clinton, and leaders of some European countries. However, we should also welcome the initiative taken by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mr Alexander Downer, to further investigate the impact of investment in Burma by Australian companies. A representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr John Dauth, was recently sent to Rangoon as a special envoy in an effort to seek practical ways to bring about democracy and a greater respect for human rights in the country. Mr Dauth passed on the message to Burma's foreign minister that Australia was looking to them to make tangible progress towards democratic institutions and the better observance of human rights. He also urged the SLORC to seriously consider dialogue with the National League for Democracy and its leaders. I note from an article in this week's national media that already the SLORC has opened up a crack in the wall and invited communication with the NLD-a move which has been welcomed by many nations. The visit allowed Mr Dauth to raise the Australian government's concerns about the human rights situation in Burma directly with the key players. It is important to note that throughout this process Australia has remained in touch with Aung San Suu Kyi and will continue to consult with her about our Burma policy. I applaud the minister for taking this initiative and his efforts to keep open the channels of communication. It is vital that we in Australia continue our support for the people of Burma in their fight to restore democracy to the country. I hope Australian businesses will take a good look at the human rights record of the country before committing their resources. Finally, let me quote a journalist from the Canberra Times who is well acquainted with the country. He said: Any initiative to try to force change in Burma is welcome. However we should not forget the grim realities of Burma. We should not overlook the thousands of innocent men, women and children who suffer and die at the hands of military thugs each year or those dying from disease in the border camps. And we should not forget those who legitimise the peddlers of this misery .also have blood on their hands. Member for Cowan",147
221,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TOURISM,"Tonight I would like to draw to the attention of the House one of the worse examples of cynical political conduct that I have come across in recent years, where a member of this House has sought to prey upon the elderly and the lonely for reasons of cynical personal political exploitation. This is contained in a memorandum which has been sent to his colleagues by the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). The member for Cowan is well known in this House. If you have a cat, be careful, he will kill it; and, if you have a thought, be careful, he will steal it. The member for Cowan is a well-known copycat. At the start of his memorandum, which he sent round to his colleagues-not to his parliamentary colleagues but to his Liberal colleagues because, as the member for Cowan knows, they are very good sources-he says: Acting on a great idea from Fran Baileythe member for MCEwen; got it right so far; we know this is a man who has never had an original idea, he just steals those of othersI have sent the attached card to all the electors in Cowan who live by themselves, some 5000. The attachment is, of course, a Christmas card. He goes on: It is very easy to do using feedback and I think a nice touch. These electors may not get any cards and mine may be the only one, thus reinforcing a relationship which may evolve to advocacy. I assume from that jargon that what the member for Cowan means is that, by preying on people who may well be lonely, he seeks to establish some cynical political way to exploit them so that they might support him in future years. The member for Cowan is a person who we know was involved in the famous telephone hook-up when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was determining what he would do on nursing homes and the accommodation bond. This man might actually want to spend some time devoting himself to substantive policy issues and doing things that might really help the lonely and the elderly in his constituency. His memo goes on, when he indicates that his December letterhead is emblazoned with a season's greeting: Just a couple of brain thoughts for you to consider. The first idea was the member for MCEwen's; I wonder whose the second idea was. This is a craven example of cynical political opportunism and the member for Cowan stands condemned for it.",148

224,Mr HOCKEY,TOURISM,"I wish to comment on a very important principle of international environmental law in its application to the development at Port Hinchinbrook. This principle is a precautionary principle and it is concerned specifically with the risk to the environment brought about by human activity. It operates so that, where the probability of the occurrence of the event and its likely consequences are uncertain, measures taken to avert the possibilities involved with such events are necessarily precautionary. It is a principle which has received increasing acceptance at international levels since its conception in the 1970s and it was recognised as 'a statement of common sense' in a 1993 decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. It is my opinion that this principle should be applied to the activities that are being carried out at Port Hinchinbrook. It should be applied in order to effect an immediate cessation of the development, pending an assessment of the environmental degradation that has occurred at that site. This call comes as a response to what appear to be repeated and flagrant breaches of the deed of agreement pursuant to which the development of Port Hinchinbrook was to go ahead, breaches that local residents have claimed include unapproved acid sulfate soil excavation, failure to treat acid sulfate soil, discharge of acids and excavat-d materials into the sea and into the melaleuca forests, muddy run-off causing plumes stretching three kilometres over seagrass beds, creation and operation of dredge spoil ponds without proper standards of engineering or approval, dredging of the marina basin without an appropriate licence, and the wholesale and unapproved destruction of mangroves. Nor was there a Commonwealth approved environmental management plan, acid sulfate management plan or turbidity control plan in place, or an independent monitor appointed before the site works were begun. The development at Port Hinchinbrook is now larger than the development consented to by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill). What started with a restricted resort including a marina basin now incorporates a harbour and an artificial beach stretching for one kilometre, resplendent with coconut palms. A third excavation site is currently under way. These additions have commenced without approval. However, it is perhaps the dredge spoil ponds containing excavated acid sulfate soils and discharge which are the main source of concern. The walls of the dredge spoil ponds on the southern site were crudely constructed, and the ponds themselves were built across a natural freshwater catchment. The ponds are filled with a sulfuric acid solution, despite fact that this catchment feeds a melaleuca forest. In addition, pipes exist across and through the walls, draining the build-up of water that threatens to col\apse the walls into the adjacent melaleuca forest. This melaleuca forest is classified 'unallocated state land' which has been environmentally designated as the critical habitat of the endangered mahogany glider and an ecosystem of concern. The developer at Port Hinchinbrook relies on dilution and on the buffering capacity of seawater to raise the pH level to neutral. However, buffering changes the chemistry in ways that are harmful to marine life, and allows the metals and organics content of the sulfuric acid to precipitate out onto the fine clay particles which are then borne to the Great Barrier Reef, from where the metals enter the food chain. Breaches for this month are staggering: the destruction of mangroves; the dumping and spreading of sand on the foreshore at Oyster Point, effectively suffocating the mangrove replanting area; repeated long-term turbidity plumes arising from the development, streaming off Oyster Point on the outgoing tide and being carried over world heritage beds; and dredging right through world heritage seagrasses. There has been no comprehensive assessment of Port Hinchinbrook and its environmental impacts. I am yet to see or hear of a report suggesting that the development should go ahead. I have, however, received a plethora of material which more than suggests that this development should be stopped immediately. It is incumbent on this generation to err on the side of caution when it comes to developments such as that at :port Hinchinbrook. This is because environmental impacts do not respect borders. The development at Port Hinchinbrook is destroying the environmental status quo on the edge of a world heritage area. While we are witnessing the devastating effects the development is currently having on the environment, no-one can speak with certainty of the long-term and potentially irreversible effects of this continuing development. Let us place the onus on the developer to show why, in light of all the contradictory the evidence, his development should go ahead. But let us do it now, before it is far too late.",149

Although there are privileged denying that there is a crisis in our primary and the fact that when Australia is compared to other NA 11980 OECD countries we are nearly at the bottom of five to 15.

This is a problem and it will not go young and it is just as important as the literacy insecurity and isolation is Australia's alarming It also will not go away. The actual resources allocated that directly Minister Kemp is correct to describe literacy wrong and, in fact, somewhat dishonest in refusing He and his Orwell-like responses on education day, have their day of reckoning.

Accordingly, the standing committee by challenging these accepted norms, thereby young people. As a responsible committee, we examined many of merit. One such strategy is the scheme which wage.

The coalition government is acutely aware government's announcement of an $18 million initiative suicide is testimony to this. I do not believe that job related pressures do nothing to relieve pressure is largely unavoidable in today's people, to some degree, if unnecessary What is far more clear, however, is the economic introduction of a youth wage. There is a general people graduate from a secondary school education including literacy and numeracy skills-problem as a priority for improvement. That is not to potential employee.

On the most recent it is much more than the mantra of growth When we look at the growth we have had in had to have in 1990-91, the employment growth other developed countries, such as the United per capita growth in GDP of about 3.7 per averaged a miserable 1.7 per cent per annum. If we look at New Zealand, which has had with an average employment growth of 2.9 around 2.6 per cent per annum over the last of 1.5 per cent. In other words, our economy to see that we have averaged 3.7 per cent that is less than half our growth in GDP. Therefore, to the problem. The issue for young people in particular is in labour productivity or because employers to be too expensive. The report recognises relationship between minimum wages, the price people. In essence, our impressive growth rate countries because real wages growth has been market. The reason that this conclusion seems persuasive, years, as I said, in which we sustained 1.7 0.9 per cent real wages growth and the New coming back to Tony Blair's speech to the Trade be as concerned about the people I surveyed my electorate last April and I will one issue of concern to people was unemployment. concerned about, unemployment will be right that on polling day most people say to themselves, to lose it,' and they will vote on other issues. unemployment.

The other point, Union Congress, is that the unions need to who do not have work as those who do. do it again in April next year, and the number If you ask Australians what they are most up the top.

Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Ministerial Round Table on Sustainable (Question No. 1628) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 26 March 1997: Who are the members of the (a) Ministerial Round Table on sustainable energy and (b) Energy Policy Forum and when was each member appointed. Mr Anderson-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The membership of the Ministerial and Business Roundtable and the Energy Policy Forum were announced in my press release DPIB 96121P of 31 May 1996. The organisations which were invited to particiia pate were as follows: Ministerial and Business Roundtable Australian Coal Association Australian Co-generation Association Australian Gas Association Australian Institute of Petroleum Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Electricity Supply Association of Australia Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries Minerals Council of Australia Renewable energy industry Energy intensive industry (two representatives) Energy Policy Forum Australian and New Zealand Solar Energy Society Australian Automobile Association Australian Coal Association Australian Co-generation Association Australian Conservation Foundation Australian Council of Social Services NA Australian Gas Association Australian Institute of Petroleum Energy Australian Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association Australian Local Government Association Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Business Council of Australia Electricity Supply Association of Australia Electricity Users Group Energy intensive industry (2 representatives) Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries Greenpeace Australia Minerals Council of Australia Renewable Energy Industries Association Road Transport Forum Solar Energy Industries Association of Australia Sustainable Energy Forum Sustainable Energy Industries Council of AustralUranium Information Centre The members were invited to participate in these bodies by letters which I sent to these organisations over several days in late May 1996. Job Application Requirements (Question No. 2118) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 August 1997: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether it is a common procedure for Departments to require job applicants to provide multiple copies of their application documents, even though there is no legal obligation to do this. (2) Do some Departments require up to five copies of all documentation submitted by job applicants while others require three and some only one; if so why. (3) Does imposing a requirement to produce multiple copies of complicated documentation when applying for each job pose a significant financial burden on some unemployed persons. (4) Is the procedure being used as a de facto filter to rule out some candidates. (5) Will the Minister take action to minimise and standardise the number of copies required to be submitted by job applicants. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is common procedure for Departments to request job applicants to provide multiple copies of their application documents, however, if only one copy of an application is received, the applicant is not required to provide further copies. (2) There is no legislative requirement for job applicants to provide multiple copies of their applications. I am not advised of any Department requiring up to five copies, however, it is common practice for Departments to request applications to be submitted in triplicate. This is for ease in processing applications and enables the efficient distribution of applications to the Selection Advisory Committee (usually comprising three members). (3) There are a number of programs which offer self help facilities, which include the use of copiers to copy job applications. Job seekers who have been unemployed for 12 months or more, are in case management or less than 21 years of age can use SkillShare open access facilities which normally include newspapers, phones, photocopiers, PCs, facsimile machines and one-to-one assistance. Self help facilities are also available for applicants who are participating in job clubs. Job clubs are now part of the Job Seeker Preparation and Support Program-JPS. Post job club support for up to 13 weeks is provided to people who do not find employment during the program and this would normally include access to self help facilities, including the use of photocopiers. JPS, SkillS hare and case management arrangements cease on 30 April 1998, however, a trial of self help facilities is planned to commence shortly, which will inform the process of establishing self help facilities at Centrelink outlets from 1 May 1998. 4) No. (5) The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission's 1996 publication Recruitment and Selection, which provides guidelines to agencies on vacancy filling, explicitly states that there is no mandatory requirement to submit employment applications in triplicate. The publication notes that it is up to each department to specify in what form applicants may supply information, and that many departments now make use of electronic facilities. Cultural and Artistic Organisations Grants: Electoral Division of Barton (Question No. 2234) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 September 1997: (l) Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 94 (Hansard, 22 August, 1996, page 3627), do the organisations referred to in the answer still receive grants from the Australia Council; if so, is it the same sum. (2) Have other cultural and artistic organisations within the electoral division of Barton made application for grants or other assistance from the Commonwealth; if so, (a) which organisations and (b) what has been the result of each application. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. (2) Yes. I am advised that since approving the grants referred to in the answer to question No. 94, the Australia Council has approved a grant of photo- $9000 to the St George Rugby League Football Club and Shopfront Theatre to work with local communities to develop a theatrical performance for presentation at the football. The project was completed in September 1997. The performance was well attended and the project was considered to have achieved its objectives. In 1996 the Macedonian Australian Welfare Association of Sydney applied for a grant for a collecting project under the National Library of Australia's Community Heritage Grants Program, but the application was unsuccessful because the project was outside the Program guidelines. Aged Care Industry: Payment Arrangements (Question No. 2278) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 25 September 1997: Is there provisional three tier payment arrangement in the aged care industry; if so, will this lead to a sharp diminution of subsidies to residents to a stage where they may be required to cover all of their expenses for residency. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the new arrangements for income testing residential care subsidies, which will commence on 1 March 1998, Government subsidies are reduced based on the additional income tested fee which the resident pays based on their income. Residents cannot pay more than $63.30 a day, or the cost of Government care subsidies if this is lower. Most residents will pay much less. Full pensioners will not pay an additional income tested fee, and nor will hostel residents receiving the lowest level of care, who are not receiving a Government care subsidy. Part-pensioners will pay on average around $3.60 a day in additional income tested fees, and non-pensioners will pay around $11.90 a day on average in additional income tested fees. Tertiary Institutions Funding: Western (Question No. 2374) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 20 October 1997: (1) Has the Western Australian Government advised the Commonwealth of its priorities for Commonwealth triennial capital development funding for tertiary institutions for (a) 1997-98-99, (b) 1998-99-2000 and (c) 1999-2000-01; if so what Institution Curtin University of Technology Edith Cowan University Murdoch University The Western Australian Government is in agreement with these allocations. With regard to the year 2000, WA has requested funding to support several initiatives at Edith Cowan University, for seed funding for developments in regional areas, including Albany and Geraldton, and support for the upgrading of electronic infrastructure to promote greater collaboration between institutions. Decisions on CDP allocations for 2000 will be announced in the Higher Education Funding Report for the 19982000 Triennium. The Western Australian Government has foreshadowed that in 1998 it would be discussing with the Commonwealth funding for collaborative linkages with T AFE as well as institutional initiatives for the year 2001. However, no decision will be made on funding for 2001 until the release of the Higher Education Funding Report for the 1999-2001 Triennium in late 1998. (2) The Western Australian Government has not varied its 1996 priorities but is reviewing co-ordination between institutions to avoid duplication of services and to maintain efficient delivery of relevant and viable courses. For example, the 1999 allocation, notionally allocated to Edith Cowan University, has been earmarked to support infraare the priorities for Western Australia in each triennium. (2) Has the Western Australian Government varied its priorities since the 1996 round of funding; if so, in what way. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia (1) Discussions have been held between the Commonwealth and Western Australia, as part of the annual consultations between Commonwealth and Statefferritory higher education authorities, on projects to be funded from the 1997, 1998 and 1999 allocations, and on possible future allocations. The Commonwealth Government has already announced Capital Development Pool (CDP) allocations for 1997, 1998 and 1999 for Western Australian universities. The allocations already announced (in 1997-99 funding report prices) are as follows: Project 1997 1998 1999 $m $m $m Kalgoorlie 3.053 3.000 infrastructure development in 2.500 Perth region Rockingham 6.173 7.125 structure development in the Perth region, especially collaborative and electronic projects. Provision of the funds is dependent on the development by the Western Australian Government and relevant institutions of a strategic plan addressing the effective placement and use of both existing and any new infrastructure, potentially including the development of the Midland site. Aged Care Accommodation: Electoral Division of Werriwa (Question No. 2398) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 22 October 1997: (1) How many (a) nursing homes and (b) aged persons hostels are there in the electoral division of Werriwa. (2) What is the name and address of each (a) nursing home and (b) aged persons hostel referred to in part (1). (3) How many beds are there in each (a) nursing home and (b) aged persons hostel referred to in part (1). (4) How many beds in each (a) nursing home and (b) aged persons hostel in the electoral division of Werriwa are owned and operated by (i) private operators or companies and (ii) community or religious organisations. (5) What sum of Commonwealth funding (a) did each nursing home and aged persons hostel receive in (i) 1995-1996 and (ii) 1996-97 and (b) nursing home or aged persons hostel receive in (i) 1997-98 and (ii) 1998-99.

Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs: Charities (Question No. 2428) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 27 October 1997: Has the Minister's Department provided funding to charities in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 and (c) 1996-97: if so, (i) to which charities and (ii) what sums were provided. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable will each member's question is as follows: It is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question as: The concept of a charity differs depending on what definition is being used. For example, particular State, Territory and Commonwealth legislation define ""charity"", ""charitable institution"" or other similar terms, in different ways. Additionally, a charity has its own meaning at common law. It is not clear what definition is being used in the question; and, Even if it was clear what definition is being used, the Department does not record the charitable status of organisations that are funded. To respond to this request comprehensively would require a manual search of the file for every contract or grant for the years in question, in each Departmental Division or State Office. In many cases, the records will not identify charities directly, and we would be relying on the knowledge and judgement of officers to identify funding which relates to charities. The Department suggests that if individual charities are nominated then it would be in a better position to provide a more complete answer. Child Support Agency Clients: Electoral Division of Parkes (Question No. 2438) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 October 1997: How many Child Support Agency clients reside (a) in· (i) each postcode area and (ii) total in the electoral division of Parkes, (b) in each State and (c) in Australia. Mr Costello--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) (i) Analysis of the number of Child Support Agency (CSA) clients residing in thepostcode areas which fall within the electoral division of Parkes is shown in the table 1. Table 1 also includes postcode areas which overlap into electoral divisions bordering the electoral division of Parkes. Table 1 Electorate Parkes Parkes/Gwydir "" ParkeslRiverina (a) (ii) The number of CSA clients that reside in of Parkes is 4548.

248,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government acknowledges that dental health is important in its own right, though it is not a highly significant driver of other health costs as suggested by the question. When coming into office the Government was faced with an unexpectedly large deficit inherited from the previous Government. In making its decision to cease supplementary funding to the States for public dental services, the Government noted that public dental care had traditionally been a State responsibility and that health card holders would continue to have access to public dental services, regardless of who funded them. The Government is not considering reintroducing supplementary funding to States and Territories for this purpose. Growing Virus Resistant Plants: Risks (Question No. 2463) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: Has (a) the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management, (b) the Plant Industries Committee or (c) subcommittees associated with either committee, sought expert advice on the potential risks associated with growing virusresistant transgenic plants; if so (i) from whom and (ii) has the advice been used as the basis for public policy or draft legislation. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the auspices of the Plant Industries Committee, there is a committee looking at good agricultural practices in the use genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This committee is developing policies for the sustainable management of plants that have been genetically modified using modem biotechnology techniques. As a part of this work, plants that have been modified to be virusresistant will be considered. The Committee has not reported as yet. The Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management at its meeting in August 1997 considered a report on gene technology regulation prepared by a working group of State and Commonwealth officials mainly from agriculture departments. That report made reference to virus-resistant plants in the context of the need to develop appropriate legislation to cover genetically modified organisms and product derivatives, but did not give advice on their efficacy or risk. The report was endorsed by SCARM and the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ). In my press release of 8 August I said ""The ARMCANZ meeting agreed on the urgent requirement for a responsive and coordinated national system to address the notification, assessment and approval of GMO activities and products. ""The system agreed on, in principle, today will be put to the Commonwealth and State governments for their early consideration. ""Such a framework must provide assurance to the community regarding the use of this technology, while ensuring reasonable certainty to investors and researchers to enable them to proceed with their activities under an effective, but not overbearing, regulatory arrangement."" On the 30 October 1997, the Hon John Moore, Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon Robert Hill, Minister for the Environment and myself announced that the Commonwealth Government had agreed that it was necessary to develop legislation for the appropriate regulation of gene technology. Currently, expert advice of the nature referred to in the question is the responsibility of the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC). Over recent years GMAC has reviewed a number of applications for the release of virus-resistant plants. Parent Visa Application (Question No. 2485) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 17 November 1997: . (1) How many applications under the subclass 103 parent visa have been received in 1997-98 to the date of answering this. question. (2) Has the 1997-98 cap for the subclass 103 visa been reached; if so, on what date. (3) How many applications under the subclass are awaiting processing and finalisation. (4) How many visas will be issued in the subclass in 1998-99. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) From 1 July 1997 to 18 November 1997 a total of 1,042 applications covering 1,807 persons have been received under subclass 103. (2) The cap on subclass 103 visas was reached on 24 September 1997. - there is a small number of cases which are exempt from the cap because the applications were lodged before the Migration Reform Act became law in September 1994. (3) As at 18 November 1997 there were 9,957 persons (5,630 cases) in the subclass 103 pipeline who are undergoing processing or are queued. Processing of applications is not prevented by the reaching of a cap imposed under section 85 of the Migration Act 1958. (4) The size and composition of the 1998-99 Migration Program will be decided by Cabinet in the Budget context and publicly announced after that decision. Indigenous Land Fund (Question No. 2546) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 20 November 1997: (1) Was the indigenous Land Fund set up to acquire land for Aboriginal persons who could not prove an association with their land. (2) (a) Are resources being provided from the Indigenous Land Fund to Aboriginal persons who have lodged extant land claims; (b) if so, is this consistent with the objectives of and requirements of the Indigenous Land Fund.",200
249,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: (1) No. The preamble to the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Act 1995 states that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund was established to help redress the dispossession of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. Section 191B of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 provides that the purposes of the Indigenous Land Corporation are to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire and to manage land so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. Neither the preamble nor the tive provision cited above make inability to ""prove"" association with a particular area ofland a qualification for land acquisition using monies sourced from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Indeed, the Indigenous Land Corporation's National Indigenous Land Strategy states (page 5) that, wherever possible, the Indigenous Land Corporation will aim to ensure that traditional owners (or people with traditional links to the land) become the holders of the relevant title. That Strategy was tabled in the House of Representatives in March 1997 as required by Section 191N(7) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. (2) (a) Yes. While the Indigenous Land Corporation's policy is flexible and decisions on individual proposals are made after assessment of those proposals against the criteria set down in the National Indigenous Land Strategy, the Corporation' s Strategy (page 5) states, as a general proposition, that ""the ILC will give priority to land where a native title claim has not been lodged, and where it is unlikely that a native title claim would be successful. Consideration will also be given to other land fights mechanisms available to assist indigenous people to regain their land."" A successful native title claim may not, however, deliver to the successful claimants an interest approaching full, beneficial ownership ofland (as, for example, in the case of pastoral leases, where a determination of native title fights and interests will be subject to the fights of the pastoral lessee). Their land needs will, in such cases, still need to be addressed and access to resources from the Aboriginal and Tortes Strait Islander Land Fund is a legitimate avenue for addressing those needs. Moreover, land of especial cultural significance to a particular group of claimants may not be claimable at common law or under the Native Title Act 1993 (because, for example, the land is freehold). Access to the Land Fund also provides these claimants with a legitimate avenue for addressing substantive legislatheir land needs. (b) Yes.",202
