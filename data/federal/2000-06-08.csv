The Labor government seemed to environmental issues but, equally, seemed to substance. What Labor really showed was certainly never got around to developing environmental and economic costs to the nation they might address that. On the question of greenhouse and the whole looked closely at what the government has assumptions that are being pressed upon us coalition has allocated nearly $1 billion to while we did become party to the Kyoto protocol believe that it is very important to protect Australia's with them. Obviously there are many things done.

We do not yet have a definitive afternoon to speak on the Appropriation Bill to the budget handed down by the budget speech here with me and it is a very thin, is a veiled document because it has not got much This is supposed to be ‘the' budget for the 21st pages of very little for ordinary Australians. is a nasty budget that does not address any of the that does not actually deal with any of the real done about. In fact, this budget does very tale about this budget is that it is definitely a right mind would take this as their election NA Thursday, 8 June 2000 platform budget to another election. So there is definite: we are definitely not in the run-up was all that the government was going to be few very serious problems. One of the things that the government is great it is at managing the economy, telling everybody how well the economy is going generally happy. But the reality, when you go and talk telling us the same story. They are certainly we have the government telling us how comfortable we should all feel, ordinary people comfortable and they are not feeling so good We are told, from economists, how well bottom line is, but at the same time we are seeing the Australian dollar fall to record lows share market taking extraordinary hits. Usually should be helping the markets and helping see an immediate reaction in the fall of the adversely to any comments by the Treasurer. says he is the manager of great credibility in the Australian dollar take another fall. So things are addressed in this budget. We are seeing foreign debt at all time record they are paying off the Australian debt. Well, about $50 billion and $80 billion-they are throwing meaningless. But, at the end of the day, we remember the debt truck that the Prime Minister, still got this debt truck, except now it is a and it is his debt truck. What is he doing about a triple trailer debt truck from the government. they are at economic management and that they and everything is going so well, I am prepared to look at this philosophically. and-as the Prime Minister likes to say-walk of the street just for a moment and take it correct that the economy is going so well and at that for a minute. But, if it is, isn't it getting rid of? Isn't it under the system that claim that the economy is doing so well? So, we are doing so well today under the old system-because 1 July this year-then why would you change it? The reality is two things: in a number of lot better, and we are not doing a lot better because wrong. Most of its wrong priorities are set speech 2000-2001. I just wanted to start off very heart, and it is what this government does poor and give to the rich. It sounds like a argument, but everywhere I look it is the only it gives to the rich. MAIN COMMITTEE 17527 is one thing we can take out of this budget which to an early election, because if this was it, if this offering the Australian people, then it has got a very good at doing is telling everybody about how everybody about how well off they are, telling and how everybody should be extremely to ordinary Australians, is that they are not not telling me that story. So while, on one hand, good we should all feel and how relaxed and out there are not so relaxed, they are not so about what is contained in the this budget. the budget is going generally and how good the seeing a number of things happening. We are in something like 30 years. We are seeing the when the Treasurer of this country, who the economy, stands up and says something, we Australian dollar or we see the markets reacting Here we have a Treasurer who stands up and economic terms, and every time he speaks we see there are some real concerns and none of these highs. We are seeing a government that says who are they paying it off to? They are talking around billions like they were absolutely are seeing record levels of foreign debt. We all John Howard, was driving around. He has B-double instead of what he was driving originally, it? He is making it bigger-we are going to see So while they are crowing on about how good are setting the record straight in the economy we are seeing a different picture. I am prepared to look at it from both sides both sides of the street. I will walk both sides from their point of view. If the government is that everything is so rosy, then, okay, let us look under the old system of the economy that you are has brought us to this position today that you if that is the case, why would you change it? If the new system does not start until areas we are doing okay but we should be doing a this government has got all of its priorities out in this very thin document called the Budget by saying that. But what this budget does at its at its very heart, is find ways to take from the simplistic approach, or maybe even a simplistic conclusion I can find. It takes from the poor and NA 17528 MAIN COMMITTEE Everything about this new tax system is based tax system. It is about taking from the you are, the better off you are under this system. the case.

Again, what we have seen in this taking from huge increases in taxation, not less taxation. tax cuts, but let nobody be fooled by this; there in reality the revenue raised by the government revenue coming from? It has got to come from coming from the pockets of ordinary Australians. When the government says, ‘We are going to have heard it before. The government comes back a year later and gives you $10 and says, most people are not going to swallow that $990 are. What it is actually doing is The tax increases contained in this document, about increasing prices.
