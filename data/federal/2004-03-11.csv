The bill also requires original to AFMA when they are surrendered, so that they also allows fishery officers, where it is not physically to exercise their powers without producing written identification at the first available opportunity. The bottom line is that this bill stands to fishing industry. It has been put together AFMA's management advisory committees, and the AFMA board. AFMA have been making some need to determine management plans for all fisheries, that many of our fisheries are managed under rather than through actual management plans. report as fisheries managed under the Fisheries now determined management plans for the Tuna Fishery, the South East Trawl Fishery, stock.

So I commend this bill. I would now like to address a couple of Amendment (High Seas Fishing Activities and further amendments to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to enable Australia to give effect in as a party to the agreement to promote compliance agement measures by fishing vessels on the high of this bill cannot be underestimated. This at the United Nations Food and Agricultural which Australia participated.

But there needs to be overall global matters relating to the Fisheries Legislation Other Matters) Bill 2004. This bill provides Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management its domestic law to the obligations it would have with international conservation and manseas. That is extremely important; the value compliance agreement was unanimously approved Organisation conference in December 1993, in agreement will enter into force internationally of acceptance on 24 April 2004. part of an international response to the lack of vessels by fishing nations.

The amendments to additional statutory functions and objectives Australian flagged vessels on the high seas with the compliance agreement to ensure that tion about high seas vessels and give effect change obligations. That is so important. But more important amendments under the Fisheries Management AFMA to deliver and enforce effective fisheries fisheries. The amendments cover a diverse range fishing concession holders to keep and maintain ited powers of an officer to stop and detain vehicles sent of the owner or person in charge of the vehicle but separate status to recreational fishing; tween the Governments of Certain Pacific States, which is attached at schedule 1.

The charter fishing industry competes with Cairns for the number of charter weekends we have had the interclub competition vessels competing in an international game Game Fishing Association, and properly and professionally of this bill is that it determines that charter sels.

This gives charter boats a sepaAct 1991 as recreational fishing. The amendment fishing in line with that for recreational fishing report Looking to the future: a review of Commonin June 2003. It means that the Fisheries ManNA agement Act 1991 will no longer apply to charter zone, or outside the Australian fishing zone that all of the charter fishing boat crews in will be very pleased with that.

Unfortunately, Amendment Bill 1998, which I debated in this not successful. But we were successful when move to have black and blue marlin made.

One House before, is that a black or blue marlin bait for a striped marlin is not intended for it. those for catching striped, black Whilst those fish are no longer coming to which is a waste. The reality is that the percentage market for marlin is very limited. The market fishing from marlin fishing, is very high. The bill is quite considerable. But I believe that the conservation of our fish stocks, from allowing lin or shortbill spearfish as a commercially fishery stocks is quite severe.

ONA agreed that these judgementsThat is, judgments that had the been quoted in the speeches, were not necessarily ones made on the basis of material ONA had not seen, They were considered accurate quotations, in the documents. That is, that our government decided to quote and US intelligence agencies. Furthermore: In response to a question about the threat of Iraq's thought it was not a judgement that DIO would have made. That is, the chief officer of the Defence Intelligence government were saying-that John Howard, based on information they were being given our own defence agencies would have made.' Government presentations were in some areas incomplete, United Nations information on Iraq. ‘Incomplete' is a very polite way of saying you hear the rest of this, you will understand the committee noted: For example, in 1995, the United Nations debriefed From this debriefing, Mr Howard quoted admissions gram for developing offensive biological weapons-one That is what John Howard said that Saddam Hussein's notes: This description of Hussein's admission was true, period, and the bulk of the Kamal Hussein's debriefing nuclear programs, the destruction of weapons and programs and the overall success That is, the true picture was that in the weapons of mass destruction program, described terms that the Prime Minister repeated just situation in Iraq that was described in 1990 have known that that information was misleading.
