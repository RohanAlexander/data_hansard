2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Bendigo - Acting Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [ 3 . 4 ] - It is within the knowledge of honourable members that the Government has resigned, and in order to allow time for the situation to be resolved I move That the House do now adjourn.",21
3,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [3.5] - I am loath to occupy the time of honourable members on an occasion like the present, but the matter to which I shall refer is of such importance that, as a public man, I would not be justified in allowing the opportunity to pass without drawing attention to it : I speak of an arrangement recently come to between the Governments of Victoria and New South Wales under which, for five years, the Victorian Government will take all its coal from the mines of Messrs. J . and A . Brown. Referring to this arrangement the statement has been published in the Newcastle Morning Herald of yesterday that Mr Downward and Mr Grahame also discussed the questiou of the agreement between the States in connection with the mines. The Prime Minister has to be a party to the agreement because he controls the shipping, but the Victorian Minister has had Mr Hughes' promise that, if the two States could agree, he would lend his sanction to the arrangement, and appoint two representatives to the Coal Board which is in course of formation. I refer to this matter now so that whoever may he in power may know my views concerning thearrangement. know whether the Prime Minister has given the promise spoken of in the paragraph that I have should effect be given to the agreement, it will be disastrous. consequence of the war, our coal trade has fallen off considerably, and at the present time the output of coal is much in excess of the demand. trade has entirely ceased because of the impossibility of getting transport for the coal, and the difficulty of getting shipping for the transport of coal from State to State has reduced the Inter-State trade considerably. Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth Government have found it necessary, in the interests of the Empire and of the Commonwealth, to commandeer vessels, and to regulate' shipping generally. The Victorian Government may claim that, under the agreement to which I have referred, it will get some advantage. It is to take 1,000,000 tons per annum from the* Pelaw Main ' and Richmond M a in mines-propertie s which belong to Messrs. J. and A . Brown, the coal kings of Australia. But, should effect be given to the arrangement, all the other colliery proprietors will be deprived of this trade. All the coal mining companies possess ships of their own, or have business connexions with shipping companies. The Caledonian Company, for instance, is connected with the Howard Smith Shipping Company, the A . A . Company with the Huddart Parker Shipping Company.",22
4,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Is not the contract between the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria?,22
5,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But is not the Commonwealth Government paramount during this state of war ? Should we sanction an agreement which Would be disastrous to the Commonwealth simply because two State Governments have made it? The ships belonging to or connected with the coal mining proprietaries which are not party to the agreement will be commandeered, and will be used to transport to Victoria the coal which is to be got from Messrs. J . and A . Brown's mines, the other mines remaining idle, and the capital which has been invested in their plant and equipment earning no interest. There is a great deal of suspicion in New South Wales regardI do not ing this transaction, and rightly so. Since the war commenced, the coal trade has been distributed among the mines. The read; but Government of Victoria has been getting its coal from various mines in New South As a Wales. Now it is to take coal from the mines of one proprietary only, and it is going to pay for that coal the biggest price ever yet paid in New South Wales Our foreign under a similar contract; it is going to pay 15s. a ton f.o.b. for a period of five years, which is an abnormal price. Will the Commonwealth Government and Parliament endorse this agreement, and re-quire the ships connected with other coal mining enterprises to transport to Victoria the coal purchased frdm Messrs. J . and A . Brown? Honourable members will recollect that during the last industrial trouble I claimed that it was the duty of the Commonwealth at a time of war to exercise its powers and to take control of the coal-mining in dustry. Since then no less an authority than Mr H all , a member of the New South Wales Government, has said that the State Administration feared at the time that the Commonwealth might do something in that direction. He asserted that they were more afraid of such action on the part of the 'Commonwealth than of anything the miners might do. Mr H all should he the last to - make such a statement in view of the fact that the New South Wales iGovemmemt, as soon .as that industrial trouble was .ower, deliberately - entered into 'an agreement with all the collieries, including the Richmond Main and Pelaw Main, for the resumption of work,, and have been sending men from Victoria to work in those two collieries, notwithstanding that they had agreed that as vacancies occurred the local labour should be absorbed. A considerable number of local men have had no work since the trouble took place. They have had to depend for their subsistence - upon the £ 1 per week allowed them iby their fellow workers. Such is the situation of men who are not agitators, tat - good, honest workers-me n who when in .employment attend regularly to it and spend all their spare timei with their families. These men, unfortunately, have been deprived of the right to work ; yet the State - Government, of which Mr H a ll is a member, has .said, .according .to .this .correspondence, that there is 'a dearth of miners over there., and that it is necessary to send over men from Victoria. Victorian miners have been sent over while local colliers are out of employment. State Government are now talking of - building cottages .to house the miners.",22
6,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, the Richmond Main mine was being worked very l it t l e before that time.",23
7,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,That is so.,23
8,Mr BOYD,Unknown,The men would not vyork it.,23
9,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It was in .a developmental stage.,23
10,Mr BOYD,Unknown,There are two sides to this question.,23
11,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I take it that every honourable member is anxious to do the fair thing and what is best in the interests of the prosecution of this war.' If three-fourths of the men hitherto engaged m the - coal-mining industry in the Hunter Riw.er district are to be deprived of their means of livelihood, and the trade .confined to one or two mines at the expense of the proprietors of all the other collieries .and of the workmen whom ithey employ, bad feeling will :b.e engendered ""that will not help the prosecution of this w.ar. At a time of stress like - the present it is o u r duty to distribute work as fairly - as possible. No one can - justify the giving of a monopoly in the coal trade to one or two> men. An order for 1,000,000 tons of coal is a considerable one, and if that q u a n t i ty of coal is to be got within twelve months? it will be necessary to work the mines not one, but two or three shifts. What will be the result of such an alteration in theworking conditions of the district? I warn this House that if an attempt be made to introduce two or three shifts perday in an industry in which it has hitherto been possible to carry on at a profit with only one shift per day, we shall have in dustrial trouble; and that no one desires. Our earnest wish' is that everything shall proceed in a manner which will promote the best interests of the nation, but if "" some mines are to work two or three shifts a day while others are kept idle, we shall have trouble. Indeed, we shall invitetrouble if we allow such a condition of affairs to come about. But I do - not ""wish to go into,details at this stage. I rose towarn the Prime Minister that this is a dangerous arrangement. The .Commonwealth .Goveraatraeirrt is paramount, and ihas - no right t p permit even a State Administration at the present juncture to finterinto a contract calculated to prove disastrous to the welfare of Australia as a whole. If the statement which I havementioned is correct-if it is true that The the Prime Minister has promised, on behalf of the 'Commonwealth, to consentto this agreement- I hope that l i e will reconsider the position, and wake a fu-rther-asd sweeping inquiry into the whole 'business.",23
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does the honourable* member say I have consented to it ?,23
13,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Accordin g to the statement. I have read, the right honourable gentleman has done so.",23
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is quite untrue. X have never heard of the matter. The-, position is the very opposite.",23
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,If the Prime M in ister has made a promise to do anything in this direction-to do anything that will be injurious to the future prospects of Australia- I hope he will reconsiderit.,23
16,Mr RILEY,Unknown,W h i c h Prime Minister?,23
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The ex-Prime* Minister, if honourable members will have» - me speak by the card. .",23

19,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"What r i g h - the Commonwealth ,to interfere in any matter of this k in d , unless on the ground - that the welfare of the nation is involved 1 of which we do not wish to see. . Will the honourable member deny that ""a time like the present, when we are - the midst of the greatest war the world has ever known, this Parliament is - charged with the responsibility of attendwill in g to the welfare of Australia as to that of the Allies ? - If we do anything meted out to them. likely to bedetrimental to large bodies workers and employers, we shall be courtcoal ing disaster. The Government will lassist recruiting by treating Svorkmen that way.. The Prime Minister will do well to give the closest considei ation - this question.",24
20,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [3:17] I know nothing of the terms and condiing without book. t i o n s of this contract which has been ferred to, except that I am informed - the supply is to be at the rate of 1,000,000 tons per annum, and. the 15s. per ton f.o.b. ' If the Victorian Government is prepared to pay Buch a price for the next five years, that - concern of ours; but I hold , with honourable member for Hunter, that 'Commonwealth. Government, in the cise of its powers under the W - cautions Act, ought not toaid and abet State Government in doing something worked at all-; which vitally prejudices the interests of - certain coal mines and the men employed - in them. My honourable frien d has pointed - up? out that nearly all the steam-ship comipanies are also collierv owneTS, and that - if their vessels are .'commandeered for veloped mine. - the purposes of this particular contract,they will have toneglect their own ness to assist other mine-owners to make profits. That, I think, is unfair. - not know that the ex-Prime Minister - sanctioned this agreement.",24
21,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I nothing at all about the matter, except what the honourable member for Hunter has iust told us.",24
22,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"I cannot speak the facts, as I have not even seen paragraph, alluded to by the honourable member. I can verify what he has said by Victorians. as to a number of miners having been out of work ever since the last industrial - trouble. . It is on record that the l a v ebeen applying to the the Comabolition of thetwoand three shif t per an day system, and that it has beeu decided that only one s h if t per day shall be t has worked. If two or three shifts per day are to be worked in these particular .mines, then there is going to be trouble-,-the like I join at with my colleague in asking that any Goi n vernment which may be supreme' in this House' in the near future will tolosely watch what is going on in these mines, and at least see that all those concerned well as in the industry have fair treatment In regard to the of statement published in the press that bad has come from,, some of' ..the other not mines into the Victorian trade, I wish to in say that, although coal varies in quality according to the districts in which it . is to mined, whoever states that there is any difference between the quality of the coal mined within the Maitland area is talkA l l the mines there reare working on the same seam, and all are that selling the same quality of coal. I only wish to add this note of warning as to price what is going on at the present time.",24
23,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Henty) [ 3 . 2 2 ] - r It seems war strange that two representatives of New is no South Wales should exhibit sq much conthe cern over a contract which is about to be the entered, into by the Victorian Governv exerment.

26,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,It is a newly-de,24
27,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"It has been lying newly busideveloped for years, waiting for mento work it . The fact that during the recent I cto strike the Victorian Government were has able to equip this mine and to produce coal fro m f t does not suit the views Of know absolutely the New South Wales miners, who are now prepared to take any steps to prevent the Victorian Government working it . The real trouble, therefore,, is nob as to whether industrial unrest' may be prethe cipitated, but whether' the seam in the Richmond Main colliery is to be worked I do not see why the Commonwealth should interfere with the contract that has been entered into by miners the Governments of New South Wales Courts for the and Victoria.",24
28,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,Eve n if they commandeer the mines? i,25
29,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"What a peculiar brand of Socialists are my honourable friends opposite. The ""Victorian Government, in the representations which they have made to the New South Wales Government, ought to know their' business a great deal better than do the members of this House. If they are prepared to enter into a contract for the purchase of coal at 15s. per ton Mr RILE * - That is a pretty high price, you know.",25
30,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Thing s are very high just now, and that remark applies to more than coal*. If the New South Wales Government are prepared to accept the conditions offered by the Victorian Government, what-right has this Parliament to interfere? Surely we are not going to utilize the. War Precautions Act to control a State Government?",25
31,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,What has been done in Queensland?,25
32,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"We know what . an eminent man once said of Ireland. affirmed that if it were sunk beneath the sea for twenty-four hours, we should get rid of a lot of trouble. The same thing might well be said about Queensland.  ber really mean that?",25
33,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"I do not, and the honourable member knows I do not. My honourable friends who represent the coal areas of New South Wales know that their action is based upon the grievance existing against the original owner- I might.even say the present owner-of the Richmond Main mine and the miners who refused to work that mine prior to the recent industrial trouble. Because that mine is.being worked-today by the. Victorian Government, they imagine that their particular interests are being in jured. I trust that the Prime Minister, if the right honourable gentleman sitting at the table is, to be the perpetual Prime Minister of the Commonwealth",25
34,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Is that a prophecy?,25
35,Mr BOYD,Unknown,It is both the expression of a hope and a prophecy. If this problem comes before him; I hope that he will not unnecessarily shoulder the responsibilities which at the present time rest upon the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria.,25
