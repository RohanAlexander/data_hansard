0,NA,Unknown,occurred on odd occasions- I suggest that the Leader of the House will agree that this is the case,82
1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Is the honourable member for Lyne suggesting .that I have misled the House? Mr Lucocfe-The Chair has put the question again for the second reading and allowed the debate to continue.,82
2,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order.,82
3,Mr REYNOLDS,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I might not be very popular for saying this but frankly there has obviously been a technical error here tonight. I do not see any reason why the ordinary processes of Parliament should be frustrated by the absence of a person to take the call when' he was intending to take the call. I ask the Leader of the House to condone the recommital of the second reading.",82
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I want to make this quite clear. I have already said that when the question was put 'that the Bill be now read a second time' I hesitated for some time looking for somebody to rise. Nobody rose from the centre table or from the Country Party benches, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Angas. I have already indicated to the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party who is in the chair at the centre table now, that the matter can be quite easily rectified by going into Committee, when honourable members may speak on the Bill, or they may speak in the third reading debate. I would suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Country Party should indicate which way he wants to do it.",82
5,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"May I speak on order? Mr Turner-On the point of order, Mr the Deputy Speaker, you have said that you looked for the honourable member for owra because his name was on some list.",82
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I did not say that. ' Mr Turner-How did the name of the honbeen ourable member for Berowra come into the debate?,82
7,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"The Leader of the House said that. Mr Turner-Ver y well. I accept, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you did not mention the 'honof ourable member for Berowra. 16754/73-R-[76 ]",82
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,That is right. I do not know of any list. Mr Turner-This is the point I want to make: Mr Speaker does not take cognisance of any list.,82
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,That is quite right. Mr Turner-Therefor e if he looks around believing that someone ought to be there because he was on the list and does not see that person this is no reason why he should not therefore,82
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is no pomt of order. It is not a point of order. Mr Turner-The second point I want to raise, Mr Deputy Speaker",82
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Look , I did not mention the honourable member for Berowra. I know of no list of speakers. I mentioned that nobody rose from the centre table or from either side of the House. Mr Turner-So I move on to my second point. You said then, Sir-ther e is no question about this-that nobody rose from the centre table. There is no particular priority that somebody has at the centre table. It was your duty, Sir, I submit, to see if any member rose anwhere, whether someone you expected to rise because he was on a list, someone who happened to be at the centre table or someone who happened to be on the front bench. It was your duty, Sir, plainly, I submit, to see if anybody on this side of (he House rose. Quite obviously the honourable member for Cowper did rise.",82
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! There is no point of order. The honourable member a point of will resume his seat. Mr Turner-We are making a travesty of,82
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable Bermember has not made a point of order. Mr Turner-This is a travesty.,82
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will resume his seat. Leave has not granted to proceed to the third reading forthwith and accordingly the House will now go into Committee.,82
15,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, can I raise a point of order? I put this proposition to the Leader of the House: The normal practice this House is that there should be a second reading debate. There are a number of speakers from the Government side as well as from the Opposition who want to speak on this debate. I accept, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have made your judgment on this matter. I believe that it was perhaps unfortunate that you were not able to see the honourable member for Cowper rise. I ask the Leader of the House",82
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honthat. ourable member for Cowper did not rise when the motion was put. The suggestion from the Deputy Leader of the Country Party is that the Deputy Speaker did not see the honourable member rise. I ask him to withdraw it.,83
17,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I withdraw that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I suggest that perhaps the Leader the House might be prepared to permit a reply second reading debate to take place as it the belief of members of the Opposition that there would be a second reading debate and in view of the fact that there seems to be understanding on the order of speakers.",83
18,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"You were a bit slow, that was your problem. I call the Leader of the House.",83
19,Mr DALY,Unknown," I am quite certain, Sir, that your ruling is correct. We were waiting for the debate to continue and nobody on that side rose to take it. The Leader of the Australian Country Party, instead of approaching me the first place, came in on the bounce on the hop, and said that the honourable memOrders. ber for Cowper did rise. He said that you did not see him, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that you should have called him. And then later on the course of discussion he said perhaps you did not see him; perhaps he did not rise. I not influenced by death bed confessions. Conand sequently, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not ask you to resubmit it. The Opposition, which is saying that it is to be the next Government, ought to be awake and alert. If its members are asleep when these things come on that is their business. For part this debate now is in the Committee stages and instead of wasting the time of this House, use up the time available to debating it in Committee as you should. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that you stand by the decision which has been justly given and wrongly challenged by every honourable member opposite. It was a just one and a proper move: one and the Opposition can now debate this in Committee.",83
20,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I move dissent from your ruling.",83
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,What is my ruling?,83
22,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,You r ruling is that the second reading speech is concluded and that we should go into Committee. You have already ruled,83
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"My ruling is that the question that the Bill be now read a second time has been carried by the House. The question we are now discussing is whether or not leave is granted to proceed to the third reading forthwith. I have asked whether leave of is granted but you have not replied. If your is in the affirmative we will proceed to was the third reading forthwith and the debate will then continue. AH the honourable members you are worried about will get their misopportunity to speak. Alternatively, we can go into Committee and they will still have the opportunity to speak.",83
24,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I submit that you have just given your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, and from that we dissent.",83
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Order ! This is not a ruling on the interpretation of . Standing Orders. All I have done is to state what the position is. It is not a question of acceptance of a motion of dissent in from a ruling because I have not given a and ruling on the interpretation of Standing All I have done is to state a factual situation, which is quite clear, that there was a question that the Bill be read a second time. in I looked for honourable members from both sides of the House to rise to their feet to am speak on it. I waited some considerable time then put the resolution. I made one error in after that proceeding to the third reading and calling the honourable member for Cowper. I corrected that and asked should we proceed to the third reading forthwith. I have still not received a reply to that question. Otherwise mv we go into Committee. I have not given a ruling; I have simply carried out the Standing Orders of this House and therefore the question you by of dissent does not come into it. Suspension of Standing Orders",83
26,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown, I That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prohibit the recommittal of this Bill and so enable the second reading debate to continue.,83
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Is the motion seconded? Mr Ian Robinson- I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,84
28,Dr FORBES,Unknown,I second the amendment.,84
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The House will come to order, particularly those in the gallery. I think that in future members need to be a little quicker on their feet and a lot of trouble will be saved.",84
30,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"The practice of this House has always been that honourable members should be given a fair and adequate opportunity to speak in this chamber on legislation which is submitted to them for consideration. We have before us at the moment a Bill called the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Bill. All honourable members of this Parliament are concerned about the opportunities there are foi them to speak on the air and to use mass media both for the dissemination of information relative to their own particular interests and the availability and the content of matter that is used by broadcasting stations. This legislation relates to licence fees pertinent to casting stations. There has been complete denial of the opportunity of any honourable member of this Parliament to talk in the second reading debate. I believe that there was unfortunate confusion as to the first speaker listed but the fact that there was only a first speaker is signincant. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly) suggested that there is a list of speakers and that the person whose name was at the head of that list was not here and consequently it was quite obvious that there was to be no debate. The fact that there were 2 Government supporters and something like 6 or 7 Opposition members wishing to speak is ignored. In the case of most legislation dealt with in this Parliament there has been a second reading debate. For us not now to have the opportunity of having a second reading debate is indicative of the sort of tactics that the Leader of the House and the Government seek to pursue. The Government is not interested in hearing about the causes and consequences of the pattern of legislation which it has introduced. It is more interested in trying to push things through. Its view is: To hell with the consequences no matter how people are affected by the legislation. This Parliament can survive only if the people elected to represent the Australian people are given a reasonable opportunity of expressing a point of view on legislation which materially affects every Australian. This legislation is important. I believe it is signincant that quite a number of speakers were listed. The nature of the legislation covers an area of concern, not only to parliamentarians, but also to people where ever they are in Australia. Yet there is to be no second reading debate. The Leader of the Government apparently has decided to exercise arbitrary judgment and to deny an opportunity for all those members to speak other than he whose name was first on the list and who was not here in the chamber at the time. This is completely unacceptable. I regard your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, as quite regrettable. You, I understand, as a Deputy Speaker, perhaps have not had the opportunity of being in the chair throughout each stage of this debate and other debates. But whoever is in the chair, whether it be you, acting on behalf of Mr Speaker, or Mr Speaker himself, should provide adequate opportunity for members to debate significant issues. It ill behoves the Leader of the House broad- to deny the opportunity for honourable members to talk on matters of this character. I believe that this is an instance which needs to be driven home to the people of Australia of how power is now running to the heads of the members of this Labor Government. There is no denying that they are forgetting all about those who elected them. They are not concerned about hearing the point of view of the average Australian. The Minister for Minerals and Energy",84
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Armitage)Order! The Deputy Leader of the Country Party will resume his seat. The honourable member is suggesting that there is an attempt by the Chair, and by the House, to prevent honourable members from having their say. I already have pointed out clearly that on a number of occasions I asked whether it was the wish of the House to proceed to the third reading forthwith, in which case any honourable members on either side of the House would have had the full right of debate. I also pointed out that if the House decided instead to go into Committee every honourable member concerned would have a full right to speak. Therefore I ask the Deputy Leader of the Country Party to withdraw the inference that the Chair has tried in any way to prevent honourable members, as he put it, from having their say.",84
32,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker, you do not seem to realise that this is a dissent from your ruling.",85
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! It is not a dissent from my ruling.,85
34,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I withdraw that remark because I accept that it is not.,85
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member should not become quite so confused as to what motion he really moved. He has moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to permit the recommittal of the second reading of the Bill. I ask him to stick to that motion and not to speak on extraneous matters; otherwise I will have to pull him up again.,85
36,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders. This House should support the concept that the second reading debate on this Bill should be recommitted. The only action available to the Opposition in order to ensure that there be a debate on this Bill is to move for the suspension of Standing Orders to allow the recommittal of the Bill. It is important that this House be given the chance to debate important legislation. We are concerned with the implications of this Bill. Unfortunately no opportunity has been given for any member from either side of the House to speak on this Bill. Mr Keogh- A point of order!,85
37,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,The provisions of this Bill affect every member of the House,85
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! A point of order has been taken. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party will resume his seat. Mr Keogh-The honourable member for Richmond is again reflecting on the Chair by saying that no opportunity was given to members on either side of the HouseCountry Party supporters-It is the honourable member for New England. Mr Keogh-Well , the honourable member for New England has again reflected on your integrity by suggesting that there was no opportunity given to members on either side of the House to speak at the second reading stage. I was present in the House when you called on the second reading motion and I saw that the honourable member for Cowper did not rise when you called.",85
39,Mr CALDER,Unknown,What nonsense! Of course he rose.,85
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Country Party,85
41,Mr CALDER,Unknown,That was nonsense.,85
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Look, that little corner, the extreme left corner, will",85
43,Mr CALDER,Unknown,The extreme left is over there. You do not know your left from your right.,85
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The extreme left, the Country Party corner will maintain a little more order, if they do not mind. I think that the Deputy Leader of the Country Party understands- I hope he doesthe Standing Orders of this House and that under those Standing Orders there can be no attempt on the part of the Chair to prevent members from speaking. The Chair has outlined quite clearly that it has not under any circumstances prevented members from speaking. It has given them every opportunity. I therefore ask the honourable member to withdraw any remark of that type. If he continues with it it is an inference against the Chair.",85
45,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I believe that this Bill should be recommitted at,85
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.,85
47,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,-What remark?,85
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Do you not listen?,85
49,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I heard a series of comments.,85
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The remark was that the House was trying through the Chair to prevent members from speaking in the debate on the Bill.,85
51,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,1 withdraw that remark. It is necessary that this legislation be recommitted to the consideration of the Parliament to afford members an opportunity to speak on it Mr Keogh- A point of order!,85
52,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,It is necessary that there be an opportunity for the legislation again to be considered by the Parliament. The farce that is being pursued by the honourable member for,85
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! A point of order has been taken. Mr Keogh-He is again reflecting on your integrity by repeating that the opportunity was not given. The opportunity was given when you called.,85
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I gather that the Deputy Leader of the Country Party has withdrawn the inference that the Chair was endeavouring to prevent debate,86
55,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Yes . Mr Keogh-He said it again.,86
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"If so, no point of order arises.",86
57,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Member s of the Government seem to have defects in their hearingapart from any others. It is necessary in my opinion that the Bill be recommitted to the second reading stage to enable a second reading debate to take place. I believe that members in this chamber would like to speak on this legislation. I believe that it is an important piece of legislation. I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders so that the Bill can be recommitted to the second reading stage and members may speak on a piece of legislation that increases charges applicable to broadcasting stations and which prejudices small stations wherever they be situated. I believe that this piece of legislation has aspects which need to be debated. Without a second reading debate, it is not possible for all the implications of the measure to be considered effectively. It is a complete departure from the customary practice for no second reading debate to take place. For that reason, I believe it absolutely essential that this motion be supported. Mr lam Robinson- Mr Deputy Speaker",86

NA upon notice were circulated: Services Employment: Civilians Rented Offices (Question No. 731) (Question No. 611) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: How many civilians were employed by each of the Services as at 30 June 1973?",90
93,Mr BARNARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable May 1973, page member's question is: As at 30 June 1973 the numbers of civilians employed in the Service Departments were: Navy Army Air 12,892 11,383 4,716 Figures exclude locally engaged personnel overseas. Electoral Enrolments (Question No. 812) Mr MCLeay asked the Minister for Services and Property, upon notice: (1) How many persons made eUgible to vote at Federal elections by the reduction in age requirements have enrolled in each of the States and Terri(2) How many persons on State rolls have (a) applied and (b) not applied for enrolment on Federal (3) In view of the compulsory aspect of the legis.. 15 lation, how many persons (a) have been subject to . . 16 penalty and (b) are in the process of being penalised. 5 (4) What are thefinesinvolved. 9 (5) What measures is the Government taking to 8 advise eligible persons that the right to vote is preceded by the right to enrol, and neither is voluntary. 4 and Mr Daly-The answer to the honourable 9 member's question is as follows: (1) The number of persons aged 18-20 years who have enrolled up to 28 September 1973 areNew South Wales .. .. 187,131 Victoria .. 166,254 Queensland 74,046 South Australia 54,655 Western Australia .. 37,207 Tasmania .. 15,560 Australian Capital Territory . . 7,338 Northern Territory .. 1,434 (2) (a) and (b) In New South Wales and Victoria where a joint Commonwealth/ State electoral roll is maintained, the same number of persons in the 18-20 years age group (187,131 and 166,254 respectively) have claimed enrolment for both Federal and State purposes. As separate Commonwealth and State rolls are maintained in both Queensland and Western Australia it is not practicable to make a comparison between the names on these rolls in order to ascertain the information sought. In South. Australia approximately 18,000 persons aged 18-20 years enrolled for State purposes prior to 21 March 1973 (the date of effect of the lower franchise age for Federal purposes). Of these, approximately 400 are enrolled for House of Assembly purposes only. The remainder (17,600) have either obtained enrolment for both Federal and State purposes or are no longer eligible for enrolment in South Australia. In Tasmania the number of people enrolled for Federal purposes exceeds those enrolled for State purposes. Enrolment for the 18-20 years age group became effective for Federal purposes on 21 March 1973 and for State purposes in Tasmania on 1 August 1973. (3) (a) 864. <b) Nil. (4) Penalties are prescribed by Section 42 (4) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which reads' A person who is guilty of an offence against this section is punishable upon conviction(a) in the case of a first offence-by a fine of not less than One dollar and not more than Four dollars; or (b) in any other case-by a fine of not less than Four dollars and not more than Ten dollars.' (5) The Australian Electoral Oflice has conducted extensive advertising newspaper and radio campaigns in the metropolitan and country areas. Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon notice: (1) With reference to his statements that the Commonwealth has contributed $419m towards the oil exploration program in Australia, does the calculation of subsidy allow for amounts that have been paid back or will be paid back in the future; if so, in what way has the calculation been derived. (2) Does the figure of $419m derive from calculations of money contributed and assessed from individual personal income tax returns or from gross amounts nominated by companies or both; if so, in what way are these figures derived. (3) Does the figure of $419m include potential capital writeoffs; if so, (a) what figure has been used as the basis for these calculations, and (b) in what way does the figure take into account the unsuccessful program which can never be written off. (4) What have been the (a) annual and (b) total amounts paid under section 77D of the Income Tax Assessment Act since its inception, and what is the projected figure for 1972-73. Mr Connor-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the course of my statement on 12 April 1973 concerning 'Federal Petroleum Search Policy' I indicated that $419m was the estimated contribution of public revenue to oil and gas exploration to the end of 1971. Of this S174m has come from oil search subsidy payments by the Australian Government and by other forms of State and Australian Government expenditure. This included approximately S l l l m from oil search subsidy payments, but does not allow for almost $Im which has been refunded because of commercial discoveries and other adjustments. It is not possible to give an accurate figure for amounts to be paid back in future as these will depend on the extent to which existing discoveries become commercial. (2) I am advised that the Commissioner of Taxation estimated the total of the taxation concessions ($245m) in the following way. The cost of company concessions and the exemption of dividends was based on information extracted from company income tax returns and had regard to deductions actually allowed and deductions shown as being available for allowance in later years. The estimate in respect of the special share-holder concessions was based on amounts declared by petroleum exploration and mining companies. Oh(a) My statement of 12 April indicated that the estimated cost of the special deductions allowed in the period 1966 to 1971 and of the entitlement to future deductions for capital expenditure on exploration by companies which have discovered petroleum is $92m. Of this, an amount of $80m has been allowed in assessments and an amount of $12m represents an entitlement as at 1971 to future deductions. (b) The figures quoted in 3 (a) were derived from an examination of income tax returns of companies which have discovered petroleum in commercial quantities. The figures do not include the cost of potential deductions availOil Exploration able to those companies which are not yet (Question No. 814) petroleum producers. (4) (a) and (b) Section 77D was introduced in 1969 and the Commissioner of Taxation has estimated that the costs to revenue of this concession in respect of petroleum 'exploration and mining in the three years ended 30 June 1970, 1971 and 1972 were $14m, $10m and $9m respectively making a total of $33m. No figures are available for 1972-73. A forerunner to that Section (77A) provided a similar concession for petroleum exploration and mining companies from 1959 to 1969. The Commissioner of Taxation estimates that the cost to revenue of that concession was $82m over the period. National Water Resources Program (Quesdon No. 820) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, upon notice: (1) How much has been allocated to each State for water projects from the national water resources program. (2) What projects have been approved to combat pollution OT salinity. (3) What projects have been approved since the Government took office. (4) What project applications are being considered by the Government at present.",90

(2) A grant of up to $3.6m (payments of about $1.7m based on actual cost) to Victoria for two salinity reduction projects on the River Murray is the only grant specifically to combat either pollution or salinity. (3) The following projects have been approved by the Government(a) Grant to South Australia of up to $2.1m for Lock to Kimba PipeUne. (b) Grant to Queensland of $0.55m for weirs on the lower Dawson River. (c) Grant to Queensland of up to SSm for the Eton (Mackay) Project-Kinchan t Dam. (4) The question of consideration of applications for financial assistance has been examined in the context of our overaU approach to water management, and I expect an announcement will be made very shortly. Mildly Mentally Retarded School Leavers Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) What is the intended function of the work preparation centres approved for Melbourne and Sydney to cater for mildly mentally retarded school leavers. (2) What categories of staff will be employed at these centres, and in what numbers. (3) How many persons is it estimated will attend these centres in the first 3 years of their operation. (4) Where will these centres be located. (5) What is the estimated annual cost of running these centres.",91
95,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) To provide social and vocational assessment and training designed to prepare mildly mentally retarded school leavers for suitable employment. (2) The Melbourne Centre will employ1 Sessional Psychiatrist 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Social Worker (number of positions will be dependent on the size of the case-load) 1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 Welfare Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 Foremen 4 Instructors I Storeman t Liaison Officer 1 Clerical Assistant 2 Typists 1 Labourer The proposed staffing for the Sydney Centre includes1 Sessional Medical Consultant 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Case Work Co-ordinator (Psychologist) 1 Social Worker (Number of positions wiU be dependent on the size of the case-load) 1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 Welfare Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 Foremen 4 Instructors 1 Storeman 2 Clerical Assistants 1 Typist 1 Labourer (3) Because of the experimental nature of the project it would be difficult to estimate numbers. The initial case-load will be around Sydney 50, Melbourne 40. (4) Initially, at South Yarra, Victoria, and Granville, New South Wales. (5) The estimated total annual cost of running both of these centres is approximately $356,000. (Question No. 885) Hospital Benefits Funds (Question No. 904) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) How many hospital benefits fund contributors are on the special accounts list in each State.

All transfers are then verified by departmental investigating officers to ensure they are in accordance with approved rules of the funds. (8) Details of hospital and medical costs of special account contributors are not known, however, the following information may be of assistance to the honourable member: (a) During the year ended 30 June .1972 the operating deficit of $33,656,801 met by the Government in the hospital benefits special account represented 91.62 per cent of benefits payable and management expenses. (b) During the year ended 30 June 1972 the operating deficit of $4,200,241 met by the Government in the medical benefits special account represented 66.16 per cent of benefits payable and management expenses. (9) No. Mr Bourchier asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notioe: (1) Is it a fact that many patients of Homes for the Aged Blind are considered as ambulant patients because they can walk about or sit up even though they require constant intensive care due to their affliction and are incapable of looking after themselves. (2) Will he investigate the position with a view to allowing all residents in Homes for the Aged Blind to be classified as intensive care patients.",92
97,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Under the provisions of the National Health Act, those patients in approved nursing homes who need and receive intensive nursing home care are entitled to a higher rate of nursing home benefits. In determining eligibility for this higher rate of benefit, regard is had to whether the patient is wholly or substantially dependent on nursing care. While blindness in itself is not considered sufficient to warrant intensive nursing home care, a blind person who is incapable of looking after himself and is wholly or substantially dependent on nursing care, is considered to be an intensive nursing home care patient. A sympathetic approach is adopted when an aged blind patient is suffering from some concurrent illness. It is necessary for the proprietor of a nursing home to make application in respect of any patient who, because of his condition, isprovided with intensive nursing home care. I am informed that for the year ended 30 June 1973 intensive nursing home care patients constituted approximately 47 per cent of all nursing home patients throughout Australia. In contrast with this figure the ratio ot approved intensive nursing home care patients at the Homes for the Aged Blind at Bendigo and Ballarat, Victoria, for the months May to July 1973 were approximately 94 per cent and 71 per cent respectively. Environmental Impact Studies (Question No. 938) Mr Wilson asked the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, upon notice: (1) How many environmental impact studies have been initiated by him or his Department on projects proposed or initiated by (a) the previous Government and (b) the present Government. (2) What are the projects in respect of which environmental impact studies have been or are being made. (3) Will he make available to the public all completed impact studies as soon as practicable after their completion. (4) Will he infonn the public of environmental impact studies as they are initiated from time to time. (5) If not, how can environmental groups do other than busy themselves in fighting rearguard actions if the public is unaware of proposals likely to prejudice the environment. The Aged Blind (6) In what way is it intended to involve the (Question No. 909) affected public or the public in general in the decision-making process' so that the need for rearguard actions to protect the environment is reduced. (7) Is it a fact that the real need is to change the way in which land use decisions are made. (8) If so, what changes have been made in the way in which the Government makes its land use decisions.",96
98,Dr CASS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) None. It is the responsibility of the Department or organisation putting forward a proposal to initiate the related environmental impact statement .Nevertheless, my Department has indicated in response to inquiries in numerous cases, that impact statements should be prepared. (2) Environmental impact statements have been prepared on the proposed Googong Dam, on the proposed Molonglo Parkway, on the proposed telecommunications tower on Black Mountain, on the proposed water pipeline between Lock and Kimba in South Australia and on the proposed Marri woodchip project in Western Australia. A considerable number are being prepared on a wide range of subjects still under consideration. These include land acquisition, dam, airport and building construction, housing development and roads. (3) Impact statements will be released to the public except on those occasions where it is not in the public interest to do so, for example where land speculation might be encouraged or where national security might be endangered. (4) No. This is a matter for the department or organisation putting forward a proposal, though in the interests of 'open government' I would hope that they will do so. (5) Proposals currently under consideration are designed to give the public an opportunity to participate in decisions on environmentally important issues. An example of the type of public participation that is in mind is provided by the Public Hearing on the Molonglo Parkway which has just concluded. The opportunity for public comment or involvement will come before the decision on the proposal is made. (6) See answer to (5) above. (7) While this is only part of the problem, it is a very significant aspect. The environmental impact statement technique covers a much wider field, but land use is often a fundamental part of the decision. <8) Through the use of the Environmental Impact Statement procedure, environmental considerations including land use are receiving greater attention in decision making than they did previously. In addition the Australian Advisory Committee on the Environment is currently investigating the question of land use planning in Australia, and my Department is examining ways in which better decisions on land use can be encouraged. However it will be apparent that constitutional power over land use rests with the States, some of which have in recent years been paying greater attention to this problem. Organisations like the State Planning Authority of N.S.W. and the Land Conservation Council of Victoria are examples.
