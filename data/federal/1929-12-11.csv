Dean and Sons, against the War Service Homes Commission, in regard to which I moved in a previous parliament for the appointment of a select committee. As the verdict of judge and jury in the lower court was favourable to the appellants, will the Minister ask the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the case with a view to deciding whether the appellants have not at least a moral claim to compensation ?  result of the frequent representations made by the honourable member I have decided to ask the Public Accounts Committee to investigate this case.

12,Mr WEST,IMPROVEMENT OE FLOCKS AND,"Will the Prime Minister consider the desirability of utilising Mr MCMaster's gift as a contribution towards a national laboratory at Canberra, instead of for the erection of buildings in the Sydney University grounds, which are unsuitable and situated in a congested suburban area? Furthermore, the establishment of such a laboratory within the city will be a contravention of the municipal by-laws.",12

30,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,"I desire to make a personal explanation. In the Evening News of the 9th December, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) is - credited with having said in the course - of an address delivered by him to a ing of Nationalists in Sydney that the - Gwydir election had been won by the promise, published in a pamphlet, of 6s. 6d. a bushel for wheat. I wish to say that at no time during the period of the election or since has the promise been made hy me that the farmers would be paid 6s. 6d. a bushel for wheat. I do not know where the honourable member secured his information, because to my knowledge no pamphlet containing a promise of that character was ever issued under the auspices of any organization with which I was associated during the election. The Labour party's policy is to give to the farmer the cost of production, plus a reasonable profit, and. honourable gentlemen opposite have never been pretrade. pared to assist us in securing it.",13
31,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,"Has the Prime Minister seen a statement in the Sydney Sun of yesterday's date containing some remarks by the honourable member' for Calare (Mr Gibbons) to the effect that during the recent election he did not say that he would see that the wheat growers received 6s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat, and that what he did say was that he would use his best endeavours to induce the Government to give that extent of assistance to the wheat-growers; also that since his election he had been using his best endeavours to persuade the Government to carry out that policy. Will the Prime Minister say whether his Government has given consideration to the honourable member's proposal?",13
32,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,"I have not seen the statement in the press referred to by the honourable member. My policy speech prior to the last election, and other policy speeches made on behalf of the Labour party, offered no guarantee of 6s. 6d. a bushel for wheat. If the honourable member for New England (Mr. Thompson) is so concerned about a guarantee being given why did he not urge it upon the last Government which he supported? SUSPENSION OF MIGRATION.",13
33,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,"I ask the Prime Minister if the reply of the British Government in regard to the suspension of assisted migration to Australia was dealt with at the Premiers' Conference on Monday last? If so, what was the reply, meet- and what was the attitude of the conference to the Commonwealth Government's proposals?",13
34,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,The reply from the British Government was not put before the Premiers' Conference because I had not then received permission to release it. The Leader of the Opposition has a question on the notice paper dealing with this matter which I shall answer later. DEIED VINE FRUITS.,14

No. 2. Yes. WIEELESS RECEPTION.",14
37,Mr KEANE,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,"through Mr C. RILEY asked the Postmaster-General, notice I. Will he give consideration to the extremely unsatisfactory conditions for wireless reception obtaining in country districts distant from broadcasting stations? 2. Will steps be taken to overcome the bad conditions for wireless reception in Bendigo district, which are seriously militating against primary producers who have to depend, in the main, for weather and stock reports and other important information on the broadcasting services, and will he give early attention to this matter so that this vitally important information may be satisfactorily received by the people whom it concerns? 3. Will he give consideration to the urgent need for the establishment of relay stations in such country centres as Bendigo in order to render the information broadcast intelligible at all times?",14
38,Mr LYONS,COMMONWEALTH BUILDINGS I N,"The difficulties experienced by listeners in country towns and areas are appreciated by the department, and it was with this knowledge in mind that steps were taken with a view to establishing subsidiary relaying stations. The conditions in Bendigo have been specially examined, and there are no means of giving real improvement until one or more of the subsidiary stations are in operation. The construction programme for these stations has been tentatively arranged involving very heavy expenditure, and some time must necessarily elapse before the stations are in operation. NA FIELDS. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.",14
39,Mr HAWKER,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice Whether financial assistance is available to promote the development of mining for minerals, other than coal or gold, which might lead to alleviation of unemployment, and if so, under what conditions would he consider an application for assistance in the Moonta and Kadina copper fields?",14
40,Mr BLAKELEY,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"F u n d s are provided under the Precious Metals Prospecting Act for prospecting for gold, silver, platinum and osmiridium. It is not the practice to make advances to individual prospectors, but onlyto State Governments to supplement expenditure regularly incurred by them in providing aid to prospectors. The question of providing as) sistance in the Moonta and Kadina copper upon fields is a matter for the consideration of the State Government. Copper is not included as a precious metal ui ler the Commonwealth Precious Metals P.iospeeting Act. MOTOR CHASSIS. CUSTOMS COLLECTIONS.",14

45,Mr HAWKER,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the items in the new excise tariff schedule, which discriminates between Australian-made whisky bottled in bond and Australian-made whisky withdrawn from bond in bulk are designed to give a competitive advantage to a large Australian distilling company which supplies its clients with bottled whisky, as against smaller distillers for whom a large distributing organization would represent too large an overhead charge to be economical? 2. Were representations made requesting this differentiated excise duty, and if so, by whom ?",15
46,Mr FORDE,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,Information on these points will be furnished when the tariff schedule is being discussed. MIGRATION AGREEMENTS.,15
47,Mr LATHAM,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeIs he now in a position to make available to the House the communications between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government with reference to the migration agreements ?",15
48,Mr SCULLIN,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"I received a cablegram from the British Government yesterday agreeing to publication of its communication, but suggesting that this be done simultaneously in Great Britain and Australia, and asking for three days' notice of the proposed date of publication here. In reply, I have intimated that I propose to announce the text of the communication in Parliament on Friday next. the A statement setting out the terms of the cablegram sent by me to the British Government last month was tabled in this is House on the 22nd November. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. RENTED PREMISES.",15
49,Mr LYONS,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"On the 22nd November, 1929, the honourable member for E as t Sydney (Mr We s t ) addressed to me the following questions:1. Is it a fact that his department, owing to the extension of business, is compelled to occupy rented premises in Sydney? 2. If so, would the amount of the rent paid is greatly exceed the interest and the liquidation of the cost of erecting a suitable building on ground already owned by the Commonwealth? 3. Will he urge the Government, in the interests of economy and efficiency, to provide accommodation for the conduct of business on its own premises? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member as follows:1. Certain post offices in Sydney are conducted on leased premises in localities where the greatest service will be afforded to the public in the immediate vicinity. 2. See answer to 3. 3. The question of the erection of offices for the accommodation of Commonwealth departments in Sydney on the site already acquired will receive consideration when funds can be made available for this work. DESPATCH OF TELEGRAMS.",15
50,Mr LYONS,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"On the 4th December, 1929, the honourable member for Boothby  ing question:1. Is it a fact that morse telegraphic instruments are to be removed from certain post offices in the Commonwealth as a result of the proposed alteration in the method of handling telegrams, wher«by telegrams will be telephoned through to these post offices instead of being despatched by morse telegraph instruments ? 2. If so, (a) what are the names of the post offices in New South Wales and South Australia from which these morse telegraph instruments are to be removed; and (6) how many postal clerk positions, in these two States respectively, will be abolished as a result ? I am now in a position to furnish the particulars asked for in part (2) of the question, namely:(a) The proposals contemplate the of morse instruments in the near future the under-mentioned offices:New South WalesNew Lambton, Yanco, Nambucca West Kenipsey, Alstonville, Ulmarra, Tabulam, Broadwater, Copmanhurst. In South AustraliaElliston, Melrose, Booleroo ^Centre, rabara, Carrieton, Caltowie, Yongala, Hallett, Port Broughton, Red Auburn, Blyth, Brinkworth, Bute, Edithburgh, Port Victoria, Currahave mulka, Ardrossan, Paskeville, Spalding, Gawler Rail, Salisbury, gaston, Tanunda, Barmera, Gumerdebate acha, Lyndoch, Woodside, Nairne, Goolwa, Port Elliot, Willunga, Wolseley, Milang, Robe, Brighton, Magill, Henley Beach, Payneham, Mitcham, Stirling West.

In South Australia thirteen positions of postal clerk will be abolished, and thirteen positions of postal assistant created in lieu. NEW BUSINESS AFTEE 11 P.M.",15
51,Mr SCULLIN,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [11.23] - I m o v eThat Standing Order 70 be suspended until the end of this month. The purpose of suspending this standing order is to permit of new business if necessary being taken after 11 p.m., in order to facilitate business and clear the notice-paper.",16
52,Mr LATHAM,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Kooyong) [11.24] I have no objection to this motion, because one recognizes that it is necessary at the end.of a session; but I shall be pleased if the Prime Minister can see his way during the course of the day to inform the honourable members if any new business is likely to be taken after I I p.m. It might be done immediately before the dinner adjournment. I hope it will not be necessary to take new business after 11 p.m. We are meeting at 11 a.m. and we ought to get through our business without all night or long sittings. In saying that I am speaking on behalf of all honourable members-althoug h we shall not have that long opportunity for the discussion of the Estimates which has been so ardently advocated by so many whom I see facing me now.",16
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Cowper) [11.25]I have no objection to offer to the procedure proposed; but I think that removal it is fair for the Prime Minister from in reply to state whether any new controversial business will be introduced during the remainder of the session, Heads, what is the nature of the business he intends to get through, and whether any all night sittings are contemplated. WirHe will recognize that during the few weeks we have been meeting, the parties Hill, on the Opposition side of the Chamber done their best to facilitate the pasOwen, sage of Government business. There has Anbeen no obstruction in any respect. The on the Address-in-Eeply was not prolonged, and on the measures which have been submitted honourable members have spoken as briefly as possible.",16
54,Mr WEST,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,East Sydney) [11.26] In vie\v of the fact that some gentlemen in another place have assumed an attitude of fight and,16
55,Mr LATHAM,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,On a point of order. I ask whether it is in order for an honourable member to refer to current debates in another place.,16
56,Mr SPEAKER,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Hon. Norman Makin). - It is quite irregular for an honourable member to comment on debates in another place, and I ask the honourable member for East Sydney not to reflect upon the other chamber.",16
57,Mr WEST,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,That deprives me of the opportunity of putting the question I wished to submit to the Prime Minister. The fate of certain legislation in another place may have a considerable effect upon the suspension of this standing order.,16
58,Mr SCULLIN,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Prime Minister) [11.28] - I do not contemplate that any new business will be taken after 11 o'clock at night, but lest the necessity should arise this standing order must be suspended. In any case it is quite a usual practice for this motion to be carried to enable business to be cleared up at the end of a session. The Government is hoping to be able to get through its business without all-night sittings, but if that is not possible, late sittings are inevitable. No..»new bills will be brought up. There are certain notices of motion on the business sheet which must be disposed of. The Loan Bill, which of course is an annual bill, the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Bill, which, is urgent, must be passed, the Budget debate must be concluded and the Estimates agreed to, and the income tax rates bill and a short Seat of Government Administration Bill must go through. I hope that we can manage to bring our business to a conclusion without all-night sittings. To-day's progress will give us a fair indication of the way things will go. Question resolved in the affirmative. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.",16
59,Mr SCULLIN,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [11.30] - I move That Government business shall take dence over general business tomorrow. The object of this motion is to enable the Government to dispose of its business promptly, so that it may be sent on to another place as soon as possible; but, when Government business has been disposed of, an opportunity will be given for the consideration of notices, of motion standing in the names of private members.",17
60,Mr THOMPSON,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"New England) [11.31] - I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the f acf that I have a notice of motion on the business-paper relating to an investigation of the position of the tobacco industry. A similar motion was carried in the last Parliament on the voices. A select committee was actually appointed, and it held a couple of meetings, but, owing to the dissolution, the work of the committee had to be abandoned. I suggest that it is important, in the interests of this industry, that we should not allow another three or four months to elapse before that investigation, is resumed, and I trust that the Prime Minister will make a special effort to allow the motion to be considered before the House rises for the recess. I have no intention to make a further speech when the motion is called on. I spoke at length on the subject last session, when we had a two hours' debate. I think that the motion would be disposed of very quickly. Only this week the .Victorian tobacco-growers desired to visit Canberra for the special purpose of waiting on the Prime Minister as a deputation, and urging the Government to reappoint the committee immediately. In conjunction with the honourable member for Indi (Mr. Jones) I persuaded those growers not to proceed with their deputation.",17
61,Mr JONES,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Indi). [11.33] - I strongly support the remarks of the honourable member for New England on this matter. The tobacco-growers are most anxious that the committee should be reappointed. The tobacco-growers were persuaded not to form a deputation to the Prime Minister, because of the probability of the reappointment of the committee. I hope that this course will be adopted before the House rises.",17
62,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Wide Bay) [11.34] - I rise merely to place on record precemy disapproval of the denial, during the whole of the session, of an opportunity to considered notices of motion given by private members, which relate to matter which they claim to be of the greatest importance. I do not intend to vote against the motion.",17
63,Mr COLEMAN,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Reid) [11.35] - The only notice of motion on the business paper providing for the appointment of a select committee is. that standing in the name of the honourable member for New England, and if it could be disposed of by general agreement, in view of the fact that a similar motion was agreed to in the last Parliament, the Prime Minister could possibly give special facilities to enable it to be discussed by leave.",17
64,Mr YATES,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Adelaide) [11.36] I do not object to the course being pursued by the Government, because I feel that the motion is necessary. I have a notice of motion for tomorrow, which I was hoping would be 'considered. It refers to tubercular returned soldiers, who have been unable to prove that their complaint is due to war service. If the motion is not dealt with before we rise, at least three months must elapse before the matter can be discussed. I think that honourable members on all sides will support my motion. These unfortunate men gave the best of their lives, in the bloom of manhood, and the granting of war pensions to them would not cost the Commonwealth too much. It would be a declining responsibility, financially, and the Commonwealth could be expected to display the degree of human sympathy that the motion involves. I suggest that the Prime Minister, as a matter of Government policy, might recognize the claims of these men, so that they might be paid in accordance with the War Pensions Act.",17
65,Mr STEWART,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Wimmera) [11.38] While recognizing the circumstances in which the Government is placed, the postponement of private members' business, particularly in the last Parliament, when it was continually treated in this way, made private members' day practically a farce. I hope that the Prime Minister will recognize that private members now have too few opportunities of putting forward particular projects that they believe to be of great importance. I hope that, in future, the privileges of these members will be safeguarded, so far as possible. Eegarding the point raised by the honourable member for Eeid (Mr Coleman), I am quite prepared to allow notice of motion No. 1, which is in my name, to stand aside, so that precedence may be given to the notice of motion of the able member for New England.",18
66,Mr MACKAY,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Lilley) [11.40] - In my opinion the Prime Minister would be wise to adhere to his motion. It is apparent that each honourable member, who has a private notice of motion regards the matter dealt with by him as being of the utmost importance, and therefore, the Government should not give precedence to one over another. The position of the tobacco industry might well be investigated by the Tariff Board. If already tlieThat, it has been inquired into by that body, the board's report should be regarded as final, and there is no justification for the further expense that the appointment and of a select committee would entail.",18
67,Mr SCULLIN,MOONTA ANDKADI NA COPPER,"Yarra-Prime MinisI ter) [11.41] - I have always felt that private members have rights in this House, and it is with great reluctance that I have submitted a switching motion to give precedence to Government business on a private members' day; but should be remembered that this is an ceptional session. Usually, when a new Government has been appointed, there merely a formal meeting of Parliament, aud an adjournment for some two months or so to enable Ministers to prepare their policy; but we were^forced to have this session owing to the financial arrangeof ments that had to be made. Therefore, we must suspend private members' business until Government business has been disposed of. I have explained the reason why this precedence should be observed; measures now under consideration in this chamber will be awaited in another place. If the present motion is carried, Government business will take precedence tomorrow over private notices of motion, which will be placed under the heading of general business, and when we have disposed of the Government business, private members' motions will be called on. Special consideration will be given to notice of motion No. 2 relating to the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the tobacco industry. A committee was appointed by the last Parliament to carry out the investigation, and its re-appointment by this Parliament will be more or less a formality. I have assured the honourable members for honor- New England and Indi that an opportunity will be given for the consideration of this motion before the House rises, so that the committee may resume its inquiries during the recess. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.",18
68,Mr LYONS,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Wilmot-Minister for Works and Eailways) [11.43] - I movein accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation report:-Maylands , Western AustraliaEstablishment of Automatic Telephone Exchange. t is proposed to erect a building on a site at the corner of Carrington-street and Central-avenue, Maylands, and to install therein an automatic telephone system having an initial equipment for 1,100 subscribers' lines. The it ultimate capacity will be approximately ex2,300 lines, which will provide for requirements for the next 20 years. The is exchange is necessary in order to meet the rapid development that is taking place. The area to be served comprises the eastern portion of the existing Perth exchange area, and includes the suburbs Mt. Lawley, Maylands and Bayswater. The estimated immediate cost of the work is £41,290. On the opening of the exchange, an annual revenue of £9,340 is expected, increasing to £11,600 by the fifth year. I lay on the table plans, &c, in connection with the proposed work.",18
69,Mr R GREEN,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Richmond) [11.4'4] Although I raise no objection to the motion, I have noticed that a number of - proposals for the erection of automatic telephone exchanges in the capital cities have recently been referred to the Public Works Committee. It is now some considerable time since the Postal Department, with a great flourish of trumpets, announced that it had perfected a system by which automatic exchanges could be adapted to the needs of country districts. This experiment was being made in two localities in Victoria, as well as, possibly, in some other districts. The latest reports that I saw stated that the trials had proved so satisfactory that it was likely that the system would be generally installed at no very distant date. I shall be glad, therefore, if the Postmaster-General can indicate whether the use of automatic telephones in country districts is still in the experimental or whether the trials which we were given to understand were being made, have proved successful. I presume that all these automatic telephone exchanges will be provided for out of loan moneys, and in view of the present financial position it might be advisable to delay certain of these city undertakings until we know definitely whether automatic telephones for country districts can be placed upon a proper basis. We were led to believe that this new system would revolutionize telephonic communication in country areas, and we are all anxious to know just what is the position.",19
70,Mr WATKINS,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Newcastle) [11.47] I do not intend to oppose the motion, but with the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) I take this opportunity to remind the Postmaster-General that there are other places in the Commonwealth beside the capital cities, and that many important centres are in urgent need of improved telephonic facilities. The city which I represent has a population of 130,000 people, but up to the present there has been no proposal to install an automatic telephone exchange there. It is time that the people in these large provincial centres, as well as those living in our rural areas, received more consideration. An automatic telephone exchange in Newcastle would return teD times the revenue that is likely to be received from a number of proposals for metropolitan areas that have been put in hand.",19
71,Mr BELL,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Darwin) [11.50] - I entirely agree with those honourable members who have preceded me as to the need for improved telephonic facilities in country districts. Some time ago I was informed by the ex-Postmaster-General that certain trials had been carried out with automatic telephones for country subscribers, and that the department intended to purchase about 100 of these telephones for further trials, with the object of ascertaining whether it would be possible to obviate an increase in the hours during which country manual exchanges remain open. Unfortunately a decision on this important matter has been deferred from time to time. On several occasions I have urged that the service should be available to country subscribers until at least 8 stage, o'clock. Since the Postmaster-General is himself a representative of a country district, I hope he will not be guided entirely by the advice which he receives from the permanent head of his department, for I am afraid that the heads of many of our departments are not conversant with - all the disabilities suffered by people who live in the country. I am sure that the Minister is anxious to improve the present rural telephonic facilities, and I hope that he will ascertain, with the least possible delay, whether the automatic telephone for country subscribers is or is not a success. If it is not successful then it will be necessary for the department to arrange for an extension of the hours during which country exchanges are kept open, so as to meet the convenience of their subscribers. If the automatic telephone designed for use in country districts proves to be successful, its installation should remove what has hitherto been a serious grievance among country subscribers for a long time.  agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell). It is highly desirable that we should have improved telephonic facilities in our country districts in the interest, not only of country subscribers, but also of city exchanges. Hitherto more attention has been given to the convenience of operators in country telephone exchanges than to the subscribers themselves. Doubtless it is too much to expect telephone operators to remain on duty for an unreasonable number of hours, but the present arrangement is wholly unsatisfactory to people living in farming districts. Frequently a farmer is obliged to cease work for the purpose of telephoning or receiving telephone messages. I hope, therefore, that the Postmaster-General will do all in his power to overcome the existing disabilities which country subscribers experience, and that shortly it will be possible to the people of Australia the full benefit of this time-saving device.",19
72,Mr NAIRN,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Perth) [11.53] - I have every sympathy with the views of those honourable members who are asking for improved telephonic facilities in country districts. Perth affords the most definite example of the success of the automatic telephone exchange, and we are now anxious to have the system extended to the suburban area. I hope also that it will be possible in the near future to extend this convenience to large cities like inquiry will be expedited. Newcastle and many other of the larger provincial centres throughout the Commonwealth, As regards this proposal, I trust it will not be held up because of complaints from honourable members representing country districts. The three suburbs to be served by the proposed new exchange have a population of many thousands. The proposal is in of an extension of the Perth automatic telephone exchange system, and I have no doubt that it will prove remunerative. to me.",20
73,Mr LACEY,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Grey) [11.55] - I did not intend to speak to the debate on motion and should not have done so but for the criticism of certain honourable members opposite. For many years I urged the ex-Postmaster-General to sider the installation of rural automatic, telephones, and I received from him, as well as from the present Postmasterwith General, an assurance that that system was still in the experimental stage. understand that the equipment is being made in Australia, so I am hoping that it will be possible shortly to install these automatic telephones in many of our country districts. But what I really rose to say was that it is singular that honourable members who are now sitting in Opposition should today be voicing complaints about the country telephone facilities, in view of the fact that the Postmaster-General has been in office for only a few weeks.  made frequently by honourable members on this side about the need for improved telephone facilities in country districts.",20
74,Mr LACEY,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"During the last Parliament' we considered several proposals, I suggest that honourable members opposite are now indulging in carping critigive cism of this Government's proposals. These works concern chiefly metropolitan divisions, for the reason that exchanges in our capital cities have become so congested of late years that unless we provided automatic equipment it would be necessary to erect additional buildings and install further equipment to maintain them as manual exchanges. Undoubtedly the proper course for a progressive department is to install automatic exchanges. I can assure honourable members that if the motion is agreed to, the They will, therefore, be well advised to allow the motion to pass so that the proposal may be referred to the Public Works Committee.",20

76,Mr LACEY,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"I ask for the withdrawal of that statement, which is most offensive",20
77,Mr SPEAKER,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Hon. Norman Makin). this - The right honourable member for Cowper has said that the honourable member for Grey made a deliberate mis-statement. That remark is offensive to the honourable conmember, so it must be withdrawn.",20
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"I withdraw the word ""deliberate,"" and will content myself saying that the honourable member for Grey was guilty of a mis-statement of I facts. When I was speaking to a previous motion submitted by the Prime Minister, I said that honourable members on this side of the House were doing what they to facilitate the Government in the transaction of its business. The debate would not have been continued except for the remarks of the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey). The previous Government during its term of office spent £23,000,000 in extending the telephonic services in Australia. This was more than the total sum expended under this heading previously in the history of the Commonwealth. Wot only did the previous Government develop our telephonic facilities to this extent, but it sent an oflicer abroad to investigate the possibility of providing rural automatic exchanges on a large scale. Upon the officer's return experiments were conducted and these, proved to be successful. Following upon that, the previous Postmaster-General submitted a programme of rural automatic installations to this House for its approval and in his programme £100,000 was set aside for that purpose. I understand that the present Postmaster-General has adopted that programme. In these circumstances it ill becomes the representative of a rural constituency to criticize the administration of the previous Postmaster-General which has transformed country districts. Such carping criticism provokes unnecessary debate. I am sure that the present Postmaster-General will do his best to continue, as rapidly as pos- predecessor. sible, the installation of rural automatic exchanges. Such ungenerous statements as those made by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) are to be deprecated.",20
79,Mr GREGORY,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Swan) [12.2] - I also think that the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) was most unfair and ungenerous in his remarks. The strongest objection to this motion has come from the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins). Honourable members on this side of the chamber are not opposing the motion, but are simply urging that the policy of installing rural automatic exchanges should be carried out as speedily as possible. We have been under the impression for some time that it would be possible to provide our country people at an early date with a continuous service by means of the automatic system. We have every reason to believe that the could new system is efficient and economical. In these circumstances I trust that the Postmaster-General will press on with as many installations as possible.",21
80,Mr MACKAY,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Lilley) [12.3] - The honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) has not been a Government supporter long enough to realise the wisdom of refraining from making provocative speeches like the one he has just delivered. The new Postmaster-General has not been in office long enough to be able to push ahead with the installation of rural automatic exchanges, but I feel certain that he will carry out the programme of his predecessor. It is of the greatest importance to our country people that they should be granted a continuous telephonic service without avoidable delay. I brought this subject under the notice of the Bruce-Page Government four years ago, and have done my best since then to urge the merits of the service. We have reason to believe that the department is enthusiastic on the subject. The success that has been achieved in Victoria has encouraged us to look for rural automatic installations in many country centres throughout the Commonwealth. The system is not only convenient, but economical, and I trust that the Postmaster-General will take full advantage of the excellent ground-work done by his",21
81,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Wide Bay) [12.5] - I protest against the Government proposing to install three automatic exchanges in city centres without giving any indication that it proposes to provide rural automatic exchanges in country districts. It has been rightly stated that the previous Government gave a lead to the world in connection with rural automatic exchanges. In view of the fact that the previous Postmaster-General had made provision for the manufacture in Australia of a considerable quantity of equipment for rural automatic exchanges, we anticipated that early this year a number of installations would have been put in hand. But now we find that attention is to be given to three city exchanges before anything further is done for the country. The people in the cities are already vided with a continuous service, whereas the people in many country centres have to be satisfied with a service which is disreached saturation point. continued at 6 p.m. daily. Such a serunable vice causes great inconvenience to the business and domestic life of country people. It is urgent that automatic changes should be installed in as many country centres as possible without delay. The existing manual systems in the cities are providing a continuous service, and cannot see why they should not be rebut tained until the principal country centres have been provided with an automatic service.",21

The Minister owes continued presence in this Chamber to fact that many of his constituents really believe that he alone was instrumental improving the telephonic facilities which they enjoy. Of course the members of this House know the facts. Minister most artfully applied the proit to be done. gressive policy of the last Government in this respect to his owu advantage, and is regrettable that he should have endecessor couraged the honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) to show such ingratitude. The last Government treated the country districts generously in regard to telephone facilities, and it is to be hoped that present Government will continue policy.",22
83,Mr LYONS,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"Wilmot-Minister for Works and Eailways) [12.9] - Naturall I have every sympathy with honourable members who, like myself, represent country constituencies, and so long as I occupy my present position I that shall do everything that I can to increase the telephonic and other facilities of the people who live side of the cities. It is evidently the settled policy of the Commonwealth treat the Postmaster-General's Department as a business concern. Consequently any work that will be immediately reprohe ductive is given preference over work prothat may not be so profitable from the revenue point of view. Many of the existing manual exchanges in the cities have They are to cope with the business offering without extensive and costly additions to the existing system or the installation of exa comprehensive automatic service on sound business lines. The motion proposes an inquiry into the case of one exchange, and this has led to an objection I not only by representatives of rural areas also by representatives of important provincial cities, such as Newcastle. The policy of the department is to retain the existing manual exchanges so long as they can cope with the business offering and the financial position remains as it is. Certain experiments have been conducted in connection with rural automatic These are being continued, such a measure of success has already been achieved that the department is justified in undertaking the installation his of rural automatics whenever and the wherever it is possible to do so. The only limitation imposed upon our work in in this connection is that caused by the existing financial stringency. We can only install rural automatic exchanges as The fast as the financial position will allow I do not desire to make any provocative it remarks, but I am afraid that my prein office created an impression that rural automatic exchanges would be installed at a much faster rate than it is possible for us to install them.",22
84,Mr LATHAM,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,The previous Postthe master-General was very careful in his that statements in that regard.,22
85,Mr LYONS,MAYLANDS AUTOMATIC,"It has been shown quite clearly today that honourable members y opposite are under the impression that it is possible for us to go ahead immediately with the installation of these exchanges in many centres, and I know that impression exists in the country. I do not blame my predecessor for it. I have no doubt whatever that he made outhis statements in good faith.",22

The proposal is to erect a building on a site, which is Commonwealth property, situated in Burwood-road, Hawthorn, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system having an initial equipment for 6,900 subscribers' lines. The ultimate capacity will be 11,000 lines, which will provide for requirements for twenty years from the date of opening. The exchange is necessary as the existing common battery manual equipment will reach the limit of its capacity during 1932, and further extensions to provide for development will not be possible in the present building. The estimated immediate cost of the work is £173,020. On the opening of the exchange an annual revenue of £69,790 is expected, increasing to £86,400 by the fifth year. I lay on the table plans, &c, in connection with the proposed work.",24
106,Dr EARLE PAGE,HAWTHORN AUTOMATIC,"Cowper) [12.21]. - I rise because of certain statements which have been made today regarding the finances of the Postmaster-General's Department. That department is treated as a business undertaking, in the making up of accounts, and its operations are incorporated in the Estimates under a separate heading. During the last five years there have been three surpluses and one deficit in the department, and it is anticipated that this year there will be a profit of £829,000. Those figures completely dispose of any suggestion that the financial position of the Commonwealth generally is responsible for any alleged unsatisfactory administration of the' Postmaster-General's Department during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government. That Government made no attempt to make the Postal department a taxing machine. The department has shown small surpluses, but they have been used to cheapen facilities. Postal charges have been reduced from 2d. to l i d . , and telephone charges have been calculated on a radial basis instead of the basis of the actual length of line. The late Government on two occasions provided £100,000 on the Estimates for rural automatic exchanges, butthat money was not expended, because the expert officers of the Postmaster-General'a Department anticipated further important improvements, and i i i the circumstances it was considered wise todefer the work. I understand that the Loan Estimates of the present Government will be identical with those of the late Government, in which case £100,000 will again be provided for rural automatic telephone exchanges. I deprecate the suggestion that any delay in connection with these services was due to faulty administration of the country's finances by the late Government. I think that the present Postmaster-General does not really believe that the present financial position, as regards ability to borrow on the English market is due to the financing, of the late Government any more than that the recent trouble on the New York Stock Exchange was the result of any action of the late Commonwealth Government. The difficulties in connection with borrowing, in these markets at the present time are due to causes over which, no Government has any control. I do not suggest that the present Treasurer is responsible for the difficulty he is experiencing in borrowing money in London.",24

I remind the right honourable gentleman that the House is now discussing whether a proposal to construct an automatic telephone exchange at Hawthorn shall be referred to the Public Works Committee.

That latitude cannot be allowed to develop. I did not check honourable members earlier because opinions had been expressed which I felt called for a reply.

It does occur to me, however, that there is room for doubt as to the desirability of referring the proposal to build 36 cottages in Canberra to exthat committee. This proposal arises out of an act of policy in transferring certain of the public departments to Canberra. work The committee is not asked to advise upon that act of policy, and therefore the determination which brought about the desirability of doing this work, is not within the scope of the committee's activities. As a result of that determination of policy, it is necessary to build in Canberra 36 cottages at a cost of over £25,000. I suggest to the Minister that in some circumstances-for instance, if we were starting anew at Canberrathere would be some justification for placing this motion before Parliament. I doubt very much whether it is necessary to refer to the Public Works Committee, not the question of building these 36 houses at all, but the plans of each one of them.

The fullest information as to material is available, and there are large stores of material in Canberra. Is the Public Works Committee to decide what materials are to be used and whether the houses are to be built of wood, brick, concrete or stone? It cannot do that unless it examines the details relating to each particular cottage. This House would gain nothing by a general report on methods of building and design. The Commission architects have years of experience behind them in respect of cottage construction at Canberra. There are plenty of plans available and I ask the Minister whether there is anything to be gained by referring this proposal to .the PublicWorks Committee. This is not a party matter and I suggest that it is fairly open for general discussion. These inquiries cost money and I presume that honourable members on the Government side are just as anxious as honourable members on this side to curtail unnecessary expenditure.

Some excellent homes are today being built in Melbourne and they will be available for inspection by the committee. The material used in their construction is Lionite, and it is giving marvellous result*. It is only by inquiry that we shall be able to ascertain whether that material is suitable for Canberra. I trust that the House will carry the motion so as. to enable the Public Works Committee to make full inquiry respecting the materials to be used* in the construction of cottages at Canberra.",27
138,Mr SPEAKER,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Hon. Norman Makin). - I remind the House that the Standing Orders will not permit of the suspension of the sitting at 12.45 p.m. as is the custom when the House sits on Friday mornings if notices of motion are still under discussion. The time allowed for the discussion of notices of motion is two hours from the meeting of the House and if this debate is not concluded by 1 o'clock, it must stand over until orders of the day have been disposed of.",27
139,Mr MACKAY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Lilley) [12.45] - For a number of years it was my privilege to be a member of the Public Works Committee, and I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to its members for the useful work that has been accomplished. I agree that the' Minister is doing the right thing in proposing to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee. The erection of homes by the Federal Capital Commission has not been as satisfactory as we all desired. Unfortunately, most of these homes were built on too lavish a scale, with the result that many of our public servants find it difficult to meet their rentals, notwithstanding the allowance that is made to them. I believe that the Government should consider whether it is not in the best interests of all concerned to write down the capital cost of those homes by 20 per cent.",27
140,Mr BLAKELEY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"The cottages that were constructed in the early days of Canberra might have been excessive in cost, but those now being constructed are within 10 or 12 per cent, of Sydney or Melbourne prices.",28
141,Mr MACKAY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"I am glad to hear that. The Minister will realise that the public servants who occupy the early cottages labour under a big disadvantage, and it would be better to adjust the matter now rather than perpetuate that disability. Owing largely to the forced growth of Canberra the cost of living here is out of all proportion to the cost in the State capitals. We are* all aware that, when Parliament was sitting in Melbourne, it was considered desirable that we should move to the Federal Capital at the earliest possible moment. That hastened the progress of construction in Canberra, and inflated building costs. The Public Works Committee should take advantage of the experience gained by the War Service Homes Commission. While a member of the committee it was my privilege to inspect a number of war service homes, and I was amazed at their excellent design and low cost of construc- mittee. tion. They are quite as suitable for our public servants as are any Commission homes in Canberra, while their cost is infinitely less. The average cost of construction for. war service homes for the year 1928-9 was £838 in New South Wales, £752 in Victoria, £715 in Queensland, £762 in South Australia, and £825 in Western. Australia. The limit of the advance under that plan is £800, plus £150 for extras. I believe that the War Service Homes Act has conferred a substantial benefit upon returned soldiers, and I am sure that many public servants in Canberra would be glad to live in houses similar to those constructed by the department. We are proud of the type of public servant that we have in the Commonwealth Service and it is the duty of the Government and Parliament to make their conditions as congenial as possible. I urge the Government to have an investigation made into housing conditions in the Federal Capital, with a view to determining whether it is possible to reduce substantially the capital value of many of the houses erected by the Federal Capital Compnission. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [12.51]. - I partly agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) in this matter. I understand that the subject has already been investigated by the Public Accounts Committee. I ask the Minister in what locality the new houses are to be built? Are they to be concentrated, or spread over various areas as was previously the case?",28
142,Mr BLAKELEY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Thirty-si x houses will be concentrated in one locality. Mr E. EILEY - I am glad to learn that. I see no reason why the construction of these houses should not begin immediately. The Public Works Committee is already inundated with many references in connection with automatic telephone exchanges and other matters, and several m months would elapse in the new year before Parliament could meet and consider their report in connection with these homes. The Department of Public Works has an excellent staff of efficient architects and artisans, and they could go ahead and supervise the construction of these houses. It is unnecessary to refer the proposal to the Public Works Com",28
143,Mr GREGORY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"The trouble is that there is to be some departure from the Griffin scheme. Mr E. EILEY - There are hundreds of plans of cottages to choose from.

163,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Dalley-Treasurer [2.34] - The bill provides the necessary authority for the appropriation of money ' to give effect to the proposals contained in the budget speech which I delivered some days ago. The Government's proposals for this financial only slightly from those submitted by the late Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). One or two slight-alterations have been made, to which I shall direct attention later. This limitation of our loan expenditure the outcome of decisions reached at several meetings of the Loan Council, at the loan programme for the Commonbe spent this year. wealth and State Governments for present financial year was considered. The loan expenditure announced in speech was £5,520,345. This amount made up of Commonwealth works totalconnexion ling £5,085,845, £384,500 for the Capital Commission, and £50,000 for North Australia Commission. The sum of £5,520,345, agreed to at the last meeting of the Loan Council, was arrived reducing the previous loan proposals the Commonwealth by 20 per cent. 1928-29 the actual expenditure of the Commonwealth from' loan funds was £8,231,147. This year's programme is less by £2,710,802. If I direct attention the principal works and services covered by this year's programme, and compare the proposals relating to them with actual expenditure of last year, honourable members will see where alterations been effected. In connection with and repatriation services, chiefly war , service homes, the actual expenditure year was £1,660,479 and the estimate this year is £1,035,000. Telegraphs, phones, buildings, and other works for department of the Postmaster-General cost last year £3,003,870, and the estimate for this year is £2,800,000. The actual expenditure in connection with the monwealth railways last year was £878,691, and the estimate for this year loan £288,500. The actual expenditure on the Grafton to South Brisbane railway last year was £675,000, and the amount estimated for this year is £616,000. On defence works-the balance of a subsidy towards construction of floating dock, naval bases, aviation buildings, plant and machinery for the manufacture of munitions and other works-the amount expended was £203,196, and the estimate ) for this year £246,500. On advances for the purchase of wire netting, £230,838 was expended last year, and £100,000 is being provided this year. On the river Murray waters scheme, £250,000 was loan spent last year and £225,000 is year differ provided this year. For advances of passage moneys in connection with migration, £132,S15 was spent last year and £100,000 is proposed to be is spent this year. Last year the expenditure on Parliament House, Canberra, was which £638,500 and £5,500 is proposed to That was a the charge against last year's expenditure, and is merely a transfer of liability, my the Federal Capital Commission being is recouped the expenditure it incurred in with this building. Last year Federal the expenditure on sundry works of the various departments was £48,742, and the proposed expenditure this year is £80,345. Last year £555,000 was expended by the at by Federal Capital Commission, and the of estimate for this year is £384,500. Last In year the North Australia. Commission spent £40,800, and the estimate for this year is £50,000. Allowance was made for the credit received in connection with to the sale of Commonwealth ships last year to the amount of £86,784, and this year £165,000 will be received. In the this year's Estimates the general saving to be expected is about £246,000. have The actual expenditure for 1928-29 war totalled £8,231,147, and the estimated expenditure for this year is £5,520,345. last The total of the amounts included in the for bill-£6,045,795-exceed s the estimated teleexpenditure for this year, which is the £5,520,345. The difference between the sums is made up in this way: Certain savings are to be effected, the precise nature of which cannot be indicated at Compresent, because they will depend upon the progress made throughout the year, and the amounts which can be saved from the various votes. The total saving expected to be made is £287,500. The net expenditure will be kept down. Repayrequiredment will be made to the Loan Fund £165,000 for sale of ships. Certain vances to the North Australia Commismade sion outstanding at the 30th June, Lyons), 1929, and totalling £72,100, are cluded in the present bill. Money works advanced and expended last year was not covered by last year's loan raisings. There is also a small item of £850 for the redemption of loans raised by the South Australian Government for the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnathe datta. The expenditure will be carefully watched to see that we do not exceed the amount provided in the loan estimates. The Government is under a definite obligation, not only ro this committee, but also to the Loan Council, not to exceed the loan programme approved of from time to time by the Loan Council. Comchamber ? pared with the loan estimates of the previous Government, the only adjustments made in regard to the votes themselves are as follows: We have alloted an additional £50,000 for war service homes. Mr R GREEN.""-Does that mean that further construction of war service homes can be proceeded with? Mr THEODORE. - It will not give the War Service' Homes Commission right to proceed at a greater rate than at the present; it will assist the Commisthat sion to carry out its definite obligations. These operations have been very seriously curtailed in consequence of the necessity of limiting the commission to an expendifered ture of £1,000,000 for this year. Prowill vision is made for an additional shall £25,000 in connection with the River Murray Waters scheme, but we shall not know whether that amount willl be reborrow quired until we have ascertained whether the contracting States will be able to vide their quota.",30
164,Dr EARLE PAGE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Has this matter been discussed by the contracting States?,31
165,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"There was some preliminary discussion at a meeting Loan Council in Melbourne three weeks ago, and the matter is now the subject of correspondence between the various Governments concerned. If the contractfully ing States can provide their quota, this £25,000 will be required as the Commonwealth's share towards the total amount We have provided £200,000 of more than was previously proposed in adresponse to the urgent representations by the Postmaster-General (Mr. who said that if the money could innot be made available certain public which, if finished, would be reproductive, would have to be stopped in an incomplete state. There have been decreases in certain directions. For instance, the votes of the Defence Department have been reduced by £50,000, and vote for the Grafton to South Brisbane railway by £15,000. That sum represents money that will not be required this financial year; there have been no instructions to the constructing authorities to reduce the rate of progress. Mr R, GREEN - Has the reduction any bearing on the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Bill recently passed by this",31
166,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"No . That measure gave - the constructing authority power to go beyond the £4,000,000 limit. The reduction of the vote cannot be regarded as a restriction upon progress, but is an indication to the constructing authorities of the actual amount of money available. The indications are that the amount of £15,000 will not be required during the the present, financial year.",31
167,Mr FRANCIS,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Are we to understand there will be no cut in the vote for the construction of this work?,31
168,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"There will be no cut, nor will the rate of progress be interwith; but the whole of the amount not be required this year, and we be able to set off this £15,000 against certain increases in other directions. Clause 2 empowers the Treasurer to £6,300;000 which is in excess of the total amount shown in the schedule of proworks. The additional amount is necessary to cover the cost of flotation, and any shortage resulting from issuing the loan at a discount.",31
169,Dr EARLE PAGE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"How is it proposed of the to save the sum of £246,000?",31
170,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"It is impossible to say just how much will be taken off each item; but all expenditure is being carewatched to keep the total down to the required figure. Eor instance, the Estimates show an item of £20,000 for new Commonwealth offices at Brisbane. That work is a necessity, and will have to be put in hand. It has been strongly recommended by the Works Committee, and the Works Department is anxious to proceed with it. There is no likelihood, however, of its being started this year, because of the need for keeping down expenditure to the total provided for on the Estimates. Mr D. CAMERON - Why then was the amount put on the Estimates?",31
171,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"A sum of £20,000 was on the late Estimates for this work. It was impossible to revise every item, but it was found that there was an actual and imperative necessity for providing money for the War Service Homes Commission. An additional £50,000 had to be found for this purpose. We also yielded to the needs of the case, and provided £200,000 for post office works. Having done that, we were required to save money elsewhere on our works programme, but had no time to go through every item again. That is why it is stated that there will be a saving of so much; and this will be effected by keeping a careful watch upon all expenditure Although there is need for the new Commonwealth offices in Brisbane, it is not absolutely necessary to start them this year. I regret that the work has been delayed, and the Assistant Minister (Senator Barnes), who was also, I think, a member of the Works Committee which recommended it, also regrets that it cannot be gone on with this year. There is no prospect of its being commenced before July, but it is hoped that provision will be made for it in next financial year. I do not think that I can deal in any greater detail with the Loan Estimates. Perhaps as discussion ceeds in committee I shall be able to answer such questions as are raised. The that it has not. Loan Council has very carefully considered the loan position from time to time. I have no doubt that it did the ganda. same under the regime of the last Government. Successive meetings were held, and several loan programmes were rereferences vised drastically in a downward direcAustralia, tion. There have been two meetings since the present Government has been in office, and we see no prospect of allowing State or Federal programmes to be increased. The main consideration is the impracticability of raising the necessary funds by loan, either on the Australian or the oversea market. The council sees the greatest difficulty in raising the money for the existing programme, restricted as it is. The monetary situation in London is not very encouraging for the immediate raising of loans. It may improve by February next, but there appears to be no possibility of the Commonwealth obtaining loans on reasonable terms within the course of the next few weeks.",32
172,Dr EARLE PAGE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"What are Australian 5 per cent, stocks selling for in London now?",32
173,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"They are down to 91, and have been lower. State 5 per cent, stocks have gone as low as 89. There is a great disparity between the demand for Australian stocks in London, and that for New Zealand and South African stocks. There is no reason for such a disparity, but it exists.",32
174,Mr STEWART,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Are our stocks much lower in price?,32
175,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Ver y much lower - at least six or seven points. There has always been an advantage in favour of New Zealand and South Africa to the extent of a point or two, but the disparity has been very great during the whole of this year. Australian stocks have been quoted at five points, and sometimes more, below those of New Zealand and South Africa.",32
176,Mr STEWART,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Can the honourable gentleman suggest a reason for that?,32
177,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Variou s reasons the have been assigned. My own opinion is that there has been harmful propaganda in London- I do not say it is party propaganda-the effect of which has been to diminish the value of Australian prosecurities. I am not suggesting that it has political purposes; in fact, I know",32
178,Mr LATHAM,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,It is brokers' propa,32
179,Mr THEODORE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Sometimes , but there are often over-candid and unreliable as to the economic position of and the prevailing seasonal conditions. Questions are raised as to whether our financial policy is not imperilling the credit of Australia. In my opinion, much of the matter published in England on this head is not justified, and has had a most harmful effect.",32
180,Mr LACEY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Has the financial game anything to do with it?,33
181,Mr THEODOEE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"I do. not suppose that there would be any reason for playing the financial game to the detriment of Australia as compared with New Zealand and South Africa. It must be remembered, of course, that South Africa is in a favourable position in that there are in London big financial houses with large interests in South Africa. For that reason there is probably a better understanding in London of the potential wealth of South Africa, and the opportunities which that country provides for investment. Those in London who have personal knowledge of Australia and its resources have not the least apprehension regarding the soundness of investments in Australian securities. It is the uninformed mind in Great Britain which constitutes the danger, and that mind has been fed by pernicious propaganda appearing in various financial papers Sometimes the objectionable matter has originated in Australia in the form of press messages. It has probably not been sent with the idea of hurting Australia, but that has been its effect. It sary to understand the nature of this mischievous activity in order to combat it. If all parties here would co-operate, especially the newspapers, much could be done to help Australia. The newspapers should be very careful as to what they transmit in the way of news for publication in England. In this way we might hope to create a better understanding of Australia, and improve the market for our loans.",33
182,Mr HAWKER,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Is it not a fact that New Zealand and South Africa have horrowed much less than Australia?,33
183,Mr THEODOEE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Ne w Zealand has borrowed less than Australia, because it is smaller, but I do not know that it has borrowed less in proportion to population.",33
184,Mr LATHAM,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,It s borrowing per head is not less.,33
185,Mr THEODOEE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Ne w Zealand's appearances on the London money market; are less frequent than Australia's, but it has to be remembered that Australian borrowing has to satisfy the needs of all the States. I do not know what the per capita borrowings of South Africa have been as compared with those of Australia, but South Africa has borrowed in London a great deal of money for private enterprise. Including that, I think it is true that she has raised as much money in proportion to her white population as Australia has.",33
186,Mr MAXWELL,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,Has any systematic effort been made by our representatives in London to correct the false impressions of which the honourable member has spoken?,33
187,Mr THEODOEE,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Yes , and good results have followed. Mr Collins, one time Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, was appointed financial adviser to the High Commissioner in London, primarily so that he might correct the wrong impressions which existed in Great Britain regarding Australian investments. He has achieved a certain measure of success, but the disturbing events since the beginning of this year have rendered his work nugatory to a considerable extent. The work will not be discontinued, however, as it is imperative that the Australian stock market in is neces- London should be improved.",33
188,Mr MACKAY,ERECTION OF COTTAGES I N,"Will any part of this £6,000,000 be included in the £10,000,000 now being raised?",33

In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message)",33
190,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Capricornia-Actin g Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.0]. - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to amend the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act 1922-1927. This measure is'of considerable import-, ance because, when it becomes law, its operation will have the effect of making possible the provision of a great deal of additional employment at a time when unemployment is very acute. It gives expression to the policy of the Labour party to increase employment by providing for an increase in the bounty on galvanized iron sheets from £3 12s. to a ton, and is in accordance with the following recommendation of the Tariff Board made on the 16th July, 1926 :That the schedule of Iron and Steel Products Bounty Act No. 29 of 1922 be amended by increasing the rate of bounty provided galvanized sheets from £2 12s. to £4 10s. a ton. The Tariff Board further recommended that item No. 145 of the Customs Tariff be amended so as to - provide for the following deferred duty:-110s . British preferential; 135s. intermediate tariff, and 150s. general tariff. The government of the day increased the bounty to £3 12s. a ton from the 1st January, 1928; but action was not taken to increase the duty, which still stands at 20s. a ton British preferential and £3 a ton foreign. In 1920 the firm of John Lysaghts Limited decided to engage in the manufacture of galvanized iron at Newcastle. 1923-24 the industry has been assisted by way of a bounty, and up to the 4th December last the total expenditure was £404,816.",33
191,Mr STEWART,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Has the whole of that amount been paid to Lysaghts?,34
192,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"My information is that it has all been paid to Lysaghts, and that they are the only manufacturers of galvanized iron in Australia. The following figures in relation to production and the amount of bounty paid have been prepared by the department:Year. Production. Bounty 1923-24 10,285 39,758 1924-25 17,132 44,525 1925-26 18,931 49,220 1920-27 26,121 07,915 1927-28 22.990 05.990 1928-29 28,515 102,650 Up to the 31st December, 1927, the rate of bounty was 52s. a ton. It was then increased to £3 12s. a tori. In 1928-29 the production was 28,515 tons, and the bounty paid amounted to £102,650. During this financial year, up to the 4th December last, 9,654 tons had been produced and £34,785 had been paid by way of bounty.",34
193,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Are they using Austratralian material exclusively?,34
194,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Yes .,34
195,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"How mauy men are they employing ? £4 10s - Mr Forde - They are now employing about 600 men, but by the end of next year it is anticipated that the number will have been increased to nearly 1,000. The increase in the rate of bounty will involve an adfor ditional expenditure this year of £9,000. This company has never made big profits. It has had to cope with severe competition from abroad, and has paid only one 5 per cent, dividend on its ordinary shares since it commenced operations. The amount of bounty which would give adequate protection to the industry could not be determined in 1920 on account of post-war inflation of prices and the fact that in England the price of galvanized iron was between £35 7 and £40 a ton, which provided an ample' margin of profit for the locally-manufactured article. It was obvious that these high prices could not be maintained and Since that eventually the company would need some government assistance. According to Mr H . R. Lysaght, managing director of John Lysaght (Australia) Limited, at different times his company received the assurance of Mr.  as Minister for Trade and Customs, and of the late Major Oakley, Comptroller General of Customs, that if it enlarged its works sufficiently to supply the bulk of Australia's requirements a duty would be imposed that would enable it to carry on successfully. Since then the prices of English and foreign galvanized iron have dropped continuously, until now all Tons. £ good brands of 26G corrugated iron are quoted for the Australian market at rates free on board, which are equal to £21 10s. landed at any of the chief Australian ports. That is actually lower than the price at which this company can land its Newcastle iron in Sydney or at any other Australian port, allowing for the bounty it receives from the Commonwealth Government. It has been endeavouring for some time to secure a greater measure of protection. The delay that has occurred in the consideration of the needs of this and many other industries has caused thousands of men to be dismissed from factories in Australia; and this Government was left by the last Government a legacy - of 180,000 unemployed. Unless action is taken before Parliament goes into recess, many more men will be dismissed by this company before Christmas. As a matter of fact they say they will . have to dismiss practically the whole My principal reason for urging the speedy passage of this measure is that it will assist the industry to employ additional labour and make less acute the unemployment problem. When the company has enlarged its plant and is supplying a greater proportion of Australia's requirements, we can consider the question of increasing the duty and withdrawing the bounty.",34
196,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,What proportion of the Australian market does this company now supply?,35
197,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Approximatel y a quarter; but it is hoped that this assistance and the investment of further capital in the extension of the plant will enable it to increase its ratio to over 50 per cent, by August or September next. The present duty on galvanized iron, together with the proposed bounty of £4 10s. a ton, makes the total assistance to the industry £5 10s. a ton. If the proposed increase of 18s. operates from the 1st January to the 30th June next, the additional expenditure in this financial year will be £9,000. That is a modest sum when we consider that it will be the means of giving employment to a large number of workers. Already the company has spent over £500,000 at Newcastle. Plans are now being prepared for the extension of the mill to a capacity of 60,000 tons per annum by August or September next. That production will"" enable the company to supply approximately half of Australia's requirements, and give employment to over 900 men. A further programme of extension is contemplated, involving an additional expenditure by the company of approximately £250,000. When that programme has been completed the company will have spent nearly £1,000,000 in order to produce between 75 per cent, and 80 per cent, of Australia's requirements from both the Australian and British factories.",35
198,Mr MAXWELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Did I understand the Minister to say that a promise was made to the firm that if it extended its works sufficiently, protection to cover it would be given whatever the cost might be?",35
199,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The managing director of the firm says that both  staff. ten, when Minister for Trade and Customs, promised that if it extended its works and placed itself in a position to supply a larger proportion of Australia's requirements, adequate protection would be given to it. If this bounty operates for another year, the company will be in a position to supply well over 50 per cent, of Australia's requirements. I understand, also, that another company proposes to engage in the manufacture of galvanized iron. When that position arises the question of withdrawing the bounty and giving adequate protection can be considered.",35
200,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Is the Minister able to refer the committee to the promise's he says were made?,35
201,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I do not know that there is any evidence that a promise was made in writing; but the company states that this assurance was given to a deputation, and it was probably given verbally.",35
202,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Has the company indicated the occasion, and can the honourable gentleman place before us some report upon it?",35
203,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The company has by letter referred the Minister to it. Since the bounty began to operate, production has amounted to 139,628 tons. If the duty were increased to £5 10s. a ton and the bounty were discontinued Australian consumers would have to pay a duty amounting to over £330,000 on the proportion of Australia's requirements that must be imported to keep going an industry which by the end of next year will be able to supply half of Australia's requirements from its own factory here. In the circumstances, the Government considered it more advisable to give this additional assistance hy way of an increased bounty, and to consider, at a later date, the questiou of the imposition of a protective duty. If the duty were increased the rate of the present hounty would have to be reduced by the amount of such increase in accordance with section 3 of the Iron and Steel Products Acts of 19221927. I understand that the company will be satisfied with the payment of an increased bounty in lieu of effective protection. The acting managing director of John Lysaghts Ltd., in a letter written on the 29th November, said:- "" We realise that for reasons of policy it may suit you better to grant us extra protection in the form of bounties."" There is nothing to prevent the Government from reconsidering the matter within twelve months in the light of the extension that has taken place, or is in prospect, and increasing the tariff protection in lieu of continuing the bounty. It is estimated that when the further programme of extensions has been completed an additional 400 or 500 men will be employed, apart from the extra employment that will be found in the supply of plant, the bulk of which will be made in Australia. An extra 35,000 tons of Australian steel, and an extra 5,000 tons of Australian zinc will-be required annually; whilst an additional 200,000 tons of Australian coal will be used in the manufacture of the raw products into the finished material. Hundreds of thousands of Australian made bricks will be required, as well as large quantities of sulphuric acid, and there will be an increased consumption of electrical power. The use of this extra material must mean the provision of more employment. The value of the hounty is to be estimated, not alone by the number of persons who will be directly employed in the production of galvanized iron, but also by the increased employment that will be provided in subsidiary industries. The Government hopes that when local manufacture has increased sufficiently, a duty may he imposed in lieu of the bounty. Tn the meantime the passage of this bill is expedient because the increase of the bounty will keep in employment the large number of men who otherwise will be dismissed, and enable an extension of the manufacture of galvanized iron at a time when more employment is urgently needed. Progress reported. Mr Forde. BUDGET (No. 2) 1929-30. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed, vide page 969). On motion by Mr THEODOREThat the first item of the Estimates undei Division 1-The Parliament, namely, ""The President, £1,300,"" he agreed to. upon which Mr LATHAM had moved by way of amendment That - the item be reduced by £1.  - I propose to deal first with the decision of the Government to advance to the States immediately £1,000,000 from the unexpended balance in the Federal Aid Roads Trust Fund. The Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) told us yesterday that the money is to be used by the States in accordance with the terms of the Federal Aid Roads Agreement, which, however, is to be very sympathetically interpreted by the Minister for Works. Although the honourable gentleman did not say that the safeguards contained in the agreement will not continue to operate, he left little doubt in our minds that the sympathetic interpretation of it by his colleague will make easy the substitution of day labour .for the contract system. At the end of June last the trust fund was in credit, approximately, £1,750,000. The Commonwealth grants to the States £2,000,000 per annum, so that the accumulation in the fund represents less than one year's contribution. That money already belongs to the States, and has been earmarked to cover programmes that are already approved. One reason why the States got into arrears in the expenditure of the money provided by the Commonwealth for the construction of roads was that until the last Government guaranteed to them a grant of £2,000,000 per annum for ten years, contractors had no inducement to acquire modern road-making plant. The predilection of several States for undertaking construction work themselves by day labour also militated against heavy expenditure by the contractors in the purchase of equipment. The insistence by the last Government that, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, preference should be given to the contract system, other things being equal, did much to re-establish the confidence of contractors, with the result that to-.day the States are able not only to expend their quotas for the current year, but to overtake arrears. In fact last vear they expended £26,000 in excess of the £2,000,000 quota, and there is nothing prevent them, in the current financial and next year, from expending £3,000,000.",35
204,Mr THEODORE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"There is nothing to prevent them, but it is clear from the South Wales. programmes in hand that they will not overtake arrears for a long time.  is gambling on the chance that the will not overtake arrears for at least years, but it is possible that they may do ment so within a couple of years. If that pens the Government will have to recoup the trust fund from either taxation .loan funds. The £1,000,000 to be vanced to the States is earmarked for programmes that have been approved, but are told that the money is to he expended outside those programmes, and that the trust fund will be recouped at the end of seven years. The paramount condition imposed by the Commonwealth Governmoney ment is. that the money must be expended quickly; to that end the agreement is to be interpreted or mis-interpreted sympathetically that the safeguards gard to the efficient use of the money be set at naught.",37
205,Mr THEODORE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"All the safeguards be preserved.  be raised by the Minister for Works dispensing with tenders and the subtrue stitution instead of the day-labour system. The main object of the Government is to disburse the money as quickly as possible. Therefore, the Government's proposal has the appearwill ance of an expediencyraid on trust fund regardless of established safeguards^ agreed to after much consideration by this Parliament. The safeguards are to be set aside, not by an amendment of the agreement, with the consent of this House, but by the simpler method of sympathetic interto pretation. The Sydney Morning Herald report of the conference of Commonput wealth and State Ministers on Monday efficiency. last stated-""The only conditions attachture ing to the grant are that the money must be spent without delay, and that it must be spent on road works.""",37
206,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"And within the terms of the roads agreement.  of circumventing even that condition reto quiring the money to be spent on roads. year For example, the New South Wales quota will be £276,000, but not one additional penny will be expended on roads in New Mr E. RILEY - How does the honourable member know that?  States Bavin has frankly admitted it, and seven because the Commonwealth Governhas agreed to conditions hapwhich permit the £276,000 to take the place of an equivalent sum of or State money already voted for the conadstruction of roads. In other words, £276,000 of State money will be set free we for other purposes. In effect, there is no distinguishable difference between the arrangement the Government has made and the utilization of this trust fund for purposes other than roads. Although the is to be handed over to the New South Wales Government, not one additional mile of road will be constructed so in that State during the next twelve in remonths. No amount of Ministerial will casuistry can get away from that fact. Again, where this money is spent on will roads, the safeguards ensuring wise expenditure will be removed. The Treasurer, by interjection, gave an to assurance that they would remain. It is that they will remain, but they will be absolutely inoperative, because the Government has indicated its' anxiety to interpret the conditions of the agreement so sympathetically that the safeguards be practically non-existent. Therea fore, I consider this arrangement is a gross breach of faith with the road users, who have been promised in return for the petrol tax that they will have full value in better roads. Money expended with the primary object of relieving unemployment is rarely used the best advantage, for the simple reason that, for the sake of humanity, we up for the time being with glaring inI f inefficiency in the expendiof money on roads to relieve unemployment is inescapable, then such money should be provided by the general com_ munity, and not by one section, which is entitled to the fulfilment of the promise that it will receive full value for the special taxation imposed for improved roads. If it is necessary that the Commonwealth should provide this £1,000,000 - and I am in full accord with the Government's desire to relieve unemployment-it should take the straightforward course of obtaining that sum either by taxation or by loan, instead of by the mischievous subterfuge of raiding a trust fund established for another and very definite purpose. The items in the former Government's Estimates which have been altered by the new Government are few in number, but the changes are strikingly for the worse and include most significant alterations in the incidence of taxation. Por example, there is reduced taxation on beer and increased taxation on petrol. In the opinion of the present Government, cheap beer is much more necessary than cheap transport. The Government proposes to take the tax off beer to the extent of £600,000 per annum, and in its place, apparently, it will put on a petrol tax to the extent of £800,000 per annum. The former government imposed a petrol tax for the express purpose of improving the roads, and it used not only the whole of the proceeds of the tax for that purpose, but an additional sum out of revenue. But this Government puts a tax on petrol, and, incidentally, on transport, for revenue purposes. Those interested in race meetings and picture theatres will pay, by way of taxation, £640,000 less than was proposed by the previous Government, while twice that amount is to be extracted, by means of additional income taxation, from business enterprises and individual income tax payers. There is to be a 20 per cent, super tax on companies, business enterprises which provide a great deal of employment, and an additional £600,000 is to be taken from individuals by means of the 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent, super tax on incomes. A large part of that sum would doubtless have been used in further reproductive enterprise, and in further employment. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) said that the new Government intended, and was elected, to find remedies for Australia's parlous economic position. The honourable member is not without some sense of humour, and I regret that he is not in the chamber at  the moment. It seems to me that he could obtain full play for his sense of humour by realizing the methods to be employed by the Government in its endeavour to lift Australia out of its present "" parlours economic position."" A tax is to be imposed on transport to avoid the necessity for a tax on beer. There is to be a tax on work, on reproductive enterprise, in order to spare the "" movies "" and the ""ponies.""' He also said a good deal about certain industries having reached saturation point. The beer drinker, too,under the regime of this Government, will be able to reach saturation point more easily than before. The economic outlook of the present Government can be very briefly summed up in this way: "" Movies,"" races and beer are far more important in bringing about our economic salvation, and lifting us out of our parlous economic position, than hard' work as typified by reproductive enterprise. Not only will the taxation imposed by this Government be much .greater than that proposed to bo levied by the late Government, but it will be put on where it will do the greatest possible harm. The late Government not only imposed lighter taxation, but it levied it where it would do the least possible injury to reproductive enterprise and employment. The Government has brought down amended figures in its Estimates for greater departmental expenditure than was proposed by the late Government. Despite the fact that that Government would have imposed less taxation, it proposed to wipe out a substantial portion of the existing deficit, but this Government apparently intends to leave the deficit where it is. It has received some £1,200,000 in interest in connection with expropriated German properties. This sum came into its hands as an outcome of the war, and it should be used either to reduce the war debt, or the deficit due to it ; it makes little difference to which column it is applied. But to spend that money in any other way than in the reduction of our debt would be an absolute scandal. I join with the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country party in demanding to know what the Treasurer proposes to do with that £1,200,000. It is well known to honourable members that we have to meet annually a liability arising out of the war of about £30,000,000, of which about £21,000,000 represents interest and sinking fund payments in connection with our war debt, and the remainder soldiers' pensions, medical services and so forth. If this £1,200,000 were applied, as the previous Treasurer proposed to apply it, to the reduction of the deficit, it could said just as truly that it had been used to reduce the war debt, for the simple reason that this immense annual liability of £30,000,000 per annum was one of the causes of the late Government's deficit. I shall refer to one item in the Estimates that has not been touched upon, so far as I am aware, by"" any previous speaker on the other side of the chamberthe vote of £100,000 for migration. This is the same amount as was proposed by the late Government, and it is not difficult to realise that, if honourable members opposite had been on the Opposition side, and that sum had appeared in the Estimates put forward by the late Treasurer as a vote for migration, there would have been a massed attack, in which practically every one of them would have joined.",37
207,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member knows that a good deal of that sum has already been expended. How much we can save of the balance is problematical.  that, while some of it has been expended, the fact that the item remains in the Estimates as originally inserted shows that honourable members opposite are compelled to take' a rather more sane view of things now than they did when in opposition. This money is required to provide assisted passages, and it is considerably less than was provided in the previous year. The late Government proposed to cut down the vote, realizing that the depressed economic conditions would cause a natural reduction in our migration figures. This item is definitely linked up with the £34,000,000 tripartite agreement between the British, Commonwealth and State Governments. An endeavour was made by the present Government to suspend the assisted passages clauses of the agreement, without consulting the States. What has been the result of that we do not know. It is extraordinary that, although a conference was held on Monday between Ministers representing the Commonwealth and the States, nothing was said, apparently, on that subject, judging by the reply given today to a question directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the fact that he received a cablegram from the British Government as far back as last Thursday, it is strange that he could be not obtain the sanction of Great Britain to broach the matter on the following Monday to the States which were so vitally concerned. We were told in the Governor General's Speech that, after dealing with Great Britain, the Government would consult the States in this matter. I submit that that was putting the cart before the horse, because the States, and not the Commonwealth, are responsible for the absorption of assisted new-comers, having regard to the possibilities of employment within their respective borders. The Commonwealth does not initiate the bringing here of a single assisted migrant. Assisted migrants come here through two channels only-by requisition and by nomination. The States requisition, perhaps, a certain number of domestic servants or farm labourers each month, and have it in their power to reduce that number, or cut out migration altogether, if they think that the circumstances warrant it. The same principle applies to nominated migrants, because they can be brought here only with the concurrence of the States. The States have absolute power to reduce migration to the merest trickle, or suspend it altogether, without the intervention of the Commonwealth. The State Governments are even more deeply involved in regard to employment than is the Commonwealth Government. For this reason, if for no other, the Prime Minister should have approached the States before communicating with the British Government. He should not have ignored them and treated them with such high-handed discourtesy. The inference from such conduct is that the States cannot be trusted to exercise a proper discretion. The Bruce-Page Government always went to the greatest pains to secure the closest possible co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. This is shown by the formation of the Federal Loan Council, and by the setting up more recently of the Federal Transport Council. In every possible way the last Government sought the cooperation of the States. In fact, it could be said that a new era of co-operation was being established. It is regrettable, therefore, that this Government should have imperilled the success of the work done hy the last Government. The Prime Minister has told us that he intended to consult the States after he had heard from the British Government. Surely such a policy is the last word in discourtesy. The honourable gentleman could have asked the States to scrutinize closely the requisitions for, and nominations of, migrants. Had he done that no one would have offered any objections to his action, in view of our economic position and the volume of unemployment that exists. But, unfortunately, he did not take that course. It seems to me that this action was one of the worse that the Government could have taken at this juncture, for it might have jeopardized the success of the agreement which has, so far, been of tremendous value to Australia. It is not generally known by honourable members that the £34,000,000 agreement has been liberalized in many respects in the last year or two. The money may be obtained at an average rate of £3,400,000 per annum for ten years. Por every £1,000,000 that we borrow under this agreement Great Britain hands to us a capital sum of £200,000. Formerly it was £130,000 for every £750,000 that we borrowed. In other words, today we receive a gift of 20 per cent, with every £1,000,000 that Ave borrow for the purposes of the agreement. That 20 per cent, is really the capitalized equivalent of one-half of the interest due by Australia on such borrowings for the first five years, and one-third of the interest on such borrowings for the second five years of the agreement. Not only does the Commonwealth get this tremendous interest concession from Great Britain, but the States also enjoy additional concessions from the Commonwealth. In the first five years of the agreement they receive a concession from the Commonwealth which is equivalent to one-third of the ruling interest rate. The British Government pays half of the interest; the Commonwealth one-third of it, and the States only one-sixth of it in  the first five years of the agreement. In other words, if the money is . raised at 6 per cent, the States will pay only 1 per cent. If the money is raised at 5 per cent, they will pay only five-sixths of 1 per cent. These are extraordinarily good terms for the States. In the second five years of the agreement the British Government, the Commonwealth Government, and the State Governments each provide one-third of the interest rate. If the money is raised at 5£ per cent, each State will pay for its portion If per cent. It needs no stretch of the imagination to realise the tremendous advantage these easy terms afford to young and rapidly developing States like Western Australia, or Queensland. Under the agreement such States will be able to obtain cheap money for ten years for developmental projects which they desire to put in hand. For the first five years they will be able to get the money at 1 per cent., and for the second five years at about If per cent. We could continue the enjoyment of these favourable conditions if we were willing to absorb even the comparatively small number of migrants which has come to Australia in the last year or two. Seeing that the money may be used for the purpose of constructing developmental roads and railways other than main lines, for the establishment of irrigation farms and the clearing of land for dry farms, for the provision of water conservation schemes, and for the erection of sugar mills, butter factories, and so on, there is every reason why we should do our best to obtain as much of it as possible. As a matter of fact, a dragnet clause at the end of the agreement makes it possible for us to do almost any developmental work with this money provided that it enables us to carry a greater population than at present. To my mind, the agreement is one of the finest ever made between the British and Commonwealth Governments. Under the advantageous terms laid down we are able to obtain £1,500-this figure was formerly £1,000-for the provision of each farm for the settlement of a family of four persons, and it is worth remembering in this connection that every alternate farm so secured may be used for the settlement of an Australian family. To put this in another way, we can get £375 of cheap money for every person that we receive under this part of the scheme, and the new-comers need not necessarily be wage-earners. For the purposes of the agreement a child in arms counts the same as a farmer or an artisan or a domestic servant. Surely it cannot he argued seriously that we are unable under these conditions to nnd a niche in . Australia for a few more people. In my opinion it would be a good thing if the obligation to absorb settlers under the terms of this agreement could he pooled,' so to speak, over the whole of Australia. At present State boundaries are a consideration. It might be possible for States like Western Australia, which are capable of developing farm schemes on a comprehensive basis, to receive people of that kind who could not be received in other States, whereas persons who are fitted only for secondary industries could be taken in other States, though not in Western Australia.",39
208,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The Government of which the honourable member was a memfrom the Opposition. ber did not seek such an amendment of the agreement.  ceiving comparatively few migrants under the agreement lately. In 1926 we received 31,000 persons into Australia from Great Britain. This is the highest figure reached since the war. Since then, however, our economic depression has affected migrapeople tion. Depressed economic conditions here must pay their own fares. always have an influence upon migration. It is probable that during this year shall receive into Australia from the United Kingdom not more than 10,000 settlers. Seeing that more people have been leaving Australia than have been arriving here of late, this trickle of tion could have been continued with vantage, for it would have made it have, is £37. possible for us to continue using the cheap money that Great Britain is prepared make available to us under the agreeprove ment. Even if we could not have conshipping tinued to receive quite so many people, the Government could have suggested to the States that extreme vigilance should be exercized in connection with requisitions and nominations. Instead of taking this course it ignored the States and rushed forward to give Australia probably the worse advertisement she has received in the Old World for a generation. What will the people overseas think"" of us? They know that Australia has an area comparable with that of the United States of America, and that the United States of America successfully carries a population of 120,000,000 people. The Prime Minister has blatantly advertised that Australia is incapable of maintaining a population of any more than onetwentieth of the number comfortably supported by the United States of America. This must most adversely affect our credit overseas. The end which the Government desires .to achieve could have been attained quietly by the method that I have proposed, of suggesting to the States that nominations and requisitions should he more carefully scrutinized. But the Prime Minister has seen fit to noise it abroad that we cannot support a larger population than we have ""at present.",41
209,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"All the noise has come  assisted passages should be provided for own kith and kin who desire to come here because of the very heavy fares charged in the ordinary way. It should be clearly understood that there is no assisted migration from Southern Europe or the other countries of the world. The of those nations who wish to come Only British people are provided with assisted we passages. When I came to Australia 21 years ago it was possible to secure a comfortable White Star outside cabin with a porthole for £23. To-day, similar accommodation costs between £60 and £70, migraand the price of third class accommodaadtion, which is what assisted migrants If prospective migrants were faced with the necessity of to providing £37 in passage money it would an impassable bar to them. The companies are not paid £37 for each assisted migrant who comes here, but only £33. But that it too much for the ordinary British worker to find for passage money, particularly if he is a family man. Under the agreement a single man has to pay only half the fare of £33. The British Government and the Commonwealth Government pay the other half between Then in the case of families, say a father and a mother and at least one child under nineteen years, they get here for one-third of the full amount. Such migrants pay £11, the Commonwealth £11, and the British Government a similar amount,while children under twelve years are brought in free, as are also domestics. The distance from Great Britain to Canada is shorter*than that from Great Britain to Australia, and naturally the fares to Canada are much lower, and unless we do something to assist those who would come here rather' thango to Canada, we shall find ourselves practically isolated. In addition, we shall have greater difficulty than we have today in maintaining the standard of 98 per cent. British stock, because it is, perhaps, easier, on account of the shorter distance, for the Southern European migrant to come here than it is for the Britisher. We therefore encourage the Britisher to come here by assisting his passage, thus ensuring the retention of our high perceutage of British stock. We in Australia are proud of that percentage. As a matter of fact, we can boast of more pure British blood in Australia than can even Great Britain itself, because in proportion to our population we have less alien blood in the community. While it would be decidely unwise at present to encourage the flow of people here, because of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, I think that it was very unwise for the Prime Minister to try to cut off the flow altogether. The proper course would have been to consult the States with the object of getting them, to exercise a closer supervision of immigration. I believe that, when we recover from our present economic depression, this country will, if properly developed, be capable of sustaining a population even greater than that of the United Kingdom. We should not, at any rate, advertise our incapacity to do it throughout the world. We should keep quiet about temporary difficulties,  than expose them to exaggeration as the Prime Minister did the other day. Many people seem to think that every person who comes to this country takes a job rather than gives a them. job. Our secondary industries are today manufacturing solely for a population of 6,000,000, and, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart), they are incapable of selling their wares overseas. They have to confine themselves to the sheltered local market and to limit their manufacture to the requirements of Australia. Had we a population of 12,000,000 instead of 6,000,000, the secondary industries would naturally enlarge their capacity to exactly double what it is today, and therefore it should be conceded by those who oppose migration under all circumstances, that there is a good side to it, that the man who comes here provides a job because he needs clothes, boots, and a home. It is said by some honourable members that the immigration agreement has failed for the reason that, during the last few years, the number of migrants arriving here has been disappointingly small. The agreement has failed not because of anyinherent weaknesses in it, but because of economic factors quite apart from and outside of the agreement altogether. When we discuss immigration, the subject of unemployment is usually linked with it, and it has been said that migration aggravates unemployment. I believe that what would bring about increased employment more than anything else is the settlement of the coal dispute. Quite apart from the welfare of the miners, and the fact that they and their families have been living on short commons for a long time, it would mean the stimulation of industries quite outside of the. coal industry. A drop in the price of coal would provide a stimulus to industries dependent upon coal, and I favour the proposal that has been put forward, that the New South Wales Government should provide the equivalent of 2s. a ton in the way of reductions in rail freights and other charges, that Is. 3d. a ton should be conceded by the coal-owners, and 9d. a ton conceded by the coal-miners, making a rather total reduction of 4s. a ton in the price of coal. It is, perhaps, not realized by every one that a reduction of 4s. a ton in the price of coal would immediately mean a reduction of 12s. a ton in the price of steel, because it takes 3 tons of coal to produce 1 ton of steel. Imagine what effect that reduction would have in stimulating industries dependent upon coal as their base. In view of the possibility of the settlement of the coal dispute on those lines, and I sincerely hope that it will be settled, we should review the question of whether an additional bounty of 18s. a ton on galvanized iron is necessary.",41
210,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"A reduction in the price of coal would assist the galvanized iron industry.  that industry. I realise that it is not competent for me, at this stage, to discuss the Iron and Steel Products Bounty Bill which has been introduced into ""this House, but it has been proposed by the Government to increase the bounty on galvanized iron by 18s. a ton. There should be first taken into consideration the possibility of re-opening the mines, with a consequent reduction in the price of - coal of 4s. a ton, and the corresponding fall in the cost of production of iron. I know that honourable members supporting the Government regard awards, even if they are impossible from an economic point of view, as sacrosanct; but it is better than an impossible award should go rather than that an industry and a man's livelihood should go. Had sound advice been given earlier by the leaders of labour there would have been a resumption of work on the coal-fields a long while ago. ""We had the spectacle, during the election campaign, of the campaign director of the Labour party employing what can be best described as a confidence trick on credulous men. While their money was taken from them for campaign purposes they were told in return that if a Labour Government assumed office it would re-open the mines within a fortnight. That was one of the most gigantic pieces of brazen bluff ever practised upon the people in the history of political contests. It is not surprising that some of the men are embittered today, when now the Prime Minister offers - them wiser counsels and recommends them to accept the advice of their leaders. A precedent was created by Parliament some few years ago for just such an arrangement as is now proposed in connection, with the coal industry. In 1922, the meat exporting industry was in a parlous condition, and it was impossible for it to carry on the' export trade in view of the high cost of treatment, the high freights, and the high slaughtering rates paid to the slaughtermen of Queensland. The Commonwealth Government at that time offered the beef industry an export bounty of i d . a lb. on condition that, first of all, there should be a reduction of i d . per lb. in freight on the part of the shipping companies, a reduction of - Jd. in the treatment costs at the meat works, and a reduction of 12s. a week in the wages, of the slaughtermen. The slaughtermen at that time realized that economic facts were stronger than impossible awards, and they decided to accept a reduction in wages so that they could keep their jobs. I looked up, the other day, what the former Leader of the Labour Opposition, Mr Charlton, said ou this subject. He found no fault with this arrangement and had no word to say against a reasonable reduction in wages, in view of the stern economic factors existing at that time. Those engaged in the coal industry could easily take a leaf out of the book of the slaughtermen and, hy getting back to work, help to increase employment in other industries. It is much better to create employment first for those who are here, and, secondly, for those who would come here, than to try to dam back by artificial means the little trickle of immigration which is still flowing. I do not propose to deal with the tariff proposals of the Government at this stage; but, in passing, I wish to allude to one item which, I think, is worthy of. special notice. The item concerns woven hoods of various qualities, not produced in Australia, not produced anywhere in the British Empire, from which are made in this country the hats of the agricultural labourer, the schoolgirl, the woman of small means and the well-dressed woman of fashion. The new flat-rate duty on the cheapest quality hoods amounts to 2,000 per cent. This fiat-rate duty will raise the cost of thehats of the well-dressed woman of fashion hy Is. or perhaps not at all. On the other hand, it will raise the price of the hats of the agricultural labourer, the schoolgirl, and the working woman absolutely beyond their reach, and if that is not discrimination in favour of the rich as against the poor I do not Enow what it is. I am much concerned, in view of the tariff changes, about the possibility of retaliation on the part of Great Britain in connection with the preferences that we enjoy today. There seems to have been shown, in the framing of the tariff schedule, an utter disregard of the possibility of retaliation on the part of Great Britain. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) that if the preference which we are today enjoying on dried fruits were taken away the industry would probably face ruin. the former Prime Minister went to the Economic Conference in 1923 he put up a great fight for the acceptance by Great Britain of the principle that the overseas dominions should, in a fiscal sense, be given some preference over foreign countries. Largely as a result of his endeavours the Economic Committee, which sat to inquire into this subject, recommended that Great Britain should give a preference of £10 a ton on dried fruits, sultanas, currants, and lexias. Shortly after that recommendation was made, the Ramsay MACDonald Government got into power for a brief period, and the preference was unobtainable. But had the Australian Labour Party of that day bestirred itself to the slightest extent, we should have been able almost at once to enjoy a considerable amount of the preference proposed. At that time there was a duty on dried fruits entering Great Britain from all sources', of £7 on sultanas and lexias, and £2 a ton on currants. Preference to Australian dried fruits was hanging in the balance in Great Britain, and was finally turned down by a majority of only four votes in a house of nearly 700 members. We on the Government side tried to induce the Australian Labour Party to get into touch with their confreres in Great Britain, feeling that the least touch at  that time would have turned the scale in our favour. The Labour party here failed us on that occasion, and the preference extended to us was one-sixth of the total duty. That is to say, on sultanas and lexias, which bore a duty of £7 a ton, we received a rebate of £1 3s. 4d. We actually paid a duty of £5 16s. 8d. On currants we received a preference of onesixth also, receiving as a rebate 6s. 8d. per ton. That system operated until the Baldwin Government again assumed power, and it immediately gave us the full amount of preference. It was able to do that without going back on its pledge to the people of Great Britain that it would not, during the lifetime of that Parliament, impose any additional duties upon foodstuffs, regardless of origin. It was able to do this simply by withdrawing the duty on dried fruits imported from any part of the British Empire, and When allowing that on foreign products to stand. In that way the Government avoided breaking its pledges, but it helped Aus : tralia. The retention of this preference, comparatively small though it is, is of vital importance to the dried fruits industry of Australia. We enjoy a more generous preference of £14 a ton on dried fruits entering Canada, and Australia is trying to take full advantage of this by selling as much as she possibly can in the market where we have the greatest preference. There is a limit, however, to the absorptive capacity of Canada, and for a long time to come we shall have to sell the greater part of our surplus in Great Britain. It may be interesting to honourable members to know the extraordinary extent to which we have to depend on Great Britain for a market for our dried fruits. The dried fruits industry has expanded enormously within the last ten years. In 1919, immediately after the war, we produced about 14,000 tons of sultanas, currants and lexias. Of that quantity we consumed 12,000 tons, and exported 2,000. This year we have produced about 72,000 tons. We are still consuming approximately 12,000 a year, and we have, therefore, to export 60,000 tons, as compared with 2,000 ten years ago. That indicates the serious problem with which we are confronted in marketing our dried fruits, and illustrates how essential it is that we should retain the preferences we already enjoy. I hope that the Government will do everything possible to secure the retention of those ferences, without which I feel that the soldier settlers at Eed Cliffs, Mildura and other places will have to pull up their vines. On the matter of compulsory military training the Labour party of today shown its decadence as compared with the party of fifteen or twenty years for one, shall certainly support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that compulsory military training is more efficient than voluntary training, and that it is essential for defence of Australia. The Government's financial proposals provide for an increase, instead of tailment, of departmental expenditure, and the extra revenue required is to ' raised by taxes of the worse kind. While the last Government proposed to obtain whatever it requred to balance the ledger from taxation on amusements and luxuries, and by other taxes such as would interfere least with productive enterprise, this Government proposes to tax such enterprises to the utmost, notwithstanding the fact that they are the sources of national income, and the providers employment. The Government regards cheap beer as much more important than cheap transport, and moving pictures in their thousands. and pony racing as of greater value for the rehabilitation of Australia than productive enterprise.",43
211,Mr GABB,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Why indulge in repetition ?  not say a good thing too often, and because the honourable member, and others on that side, do not appear to grasp the facts. Outstanding in the Government's budget are three amounts, £1,200,000. The Government proposes to extract £1,200,000 more than the last - Government by direct taxation, half of it from companies and half from dividuals. It will raise at least £1,200,000 more by means of a tariff, £800,000 of which will be .a tax on transport- a most essential thing for the development of tralia. The other £400,000 will be partly Paterson). provided by a tax upon the clothes of the workers. The third sum of £1,200,000 pre- is interest on expropriated properties. The last Government proposed to employ this legacy from the war to reduce our deficit, but this Government refuses to say what it is going to do with the money derived from this source. If this budget is a fair sample of Labour finance, has the sooner honourable gentlemen opposite return to the Opposition benches the betago. I , ter it will be for Australia.",45
212,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Wannon) [4.25] The honourable member who has just resumed his seat expressed surprise at the the' small number of migrants coming to Australia during recent years.. One need not look far for the reason. It is because the Commonwealth has not treated fairly a curthose who have come. We employ recruiting agents in England and Scotland, he who tell prospective migrants to come to Australia, where there is an abundance of work at anything from £5 to £7 a week, while millions of acres of land are waiting for human hands to till. The unfortunate migrants have been deceived. All over Australia are hundreds of these unfortunate people, brought to this country under false pretences, now walking the roads with their swags on their backs begof ging for work and food. Yet the honourable member for Gippsland expressed surprise that migrants were not coming here  prise.",45
213,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I understood the honourable member to say that he was dis of migrants adapted itself to the prevaileach of ing economic depression.,45
214,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Such Australian employers as road and quarry contractors inhave extended preference to aliens as against British-Australians in the matter of employment, and in no part of Australia has that been more marked than in the electorate represented by the honAusorable member for Gippsland (Mr.  under the agreement relating to assisted passages.",45
215,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"We have not treated the migrants fairly. We have . deceived them, and work promised them was not available when they arrived. The millions of which were to be waiting for them are not available either. Those acres are not here for our own people. I support the action of the Government in suspending migration activities until such time as conditions improve in Australia, and we can provide employment, not only for new arrivals, but for the hundreds of thousands of persons who are out of work here today. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), when speaking last evening, expressed the hope that Australia would institute a vigorous policy of land settlement, and thus increase the volume of our exports. He made that statement when attacking the tariff submitted by the Government. I heartily agree with the honourable member for Wimmera, and I believe that every honourable member of the Committee agrees with him. Unfortunately for him, however, and for Australia, the land is not available here on which to settle more people. Furthermore, during the war and since, land values have been inflated very much. It is almost impossible now for a man of moderate means to go on the land, except in Western Australia. In that State large areas of cheap land are still to be had, and to the credit of the Government there, be it said, a progressive policy of land settlement and water conservation has been undertaken. But in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the land is locked up, and the Governments of those States are taking no steps to resume large holdings so that the landless may be placed on the land. The wealth of a nation is derived from its lands, and if its citizens are denied the right to occupy those lands, there be nothing but stagnation. Wheat-growing cannot be made profitable at the prices at which wheat lands are being purchased today, especially in Victoria. In the top end of theWimmera district the ruling price for wheat land is as high as £28 and £29 an acre. No person can make wheat-growing pay if his land has cost him £25 or £26 per acre. The cost of wages is infinitesimal in comparison with the cqst of the land. Whilst we realise that it is not yet possible, and will not be for many years, to carry out a vigorous policy of land settlement in the older States of Victoria, New South acres Wales and South Australia, we should at least strive to adopt scientific methods in our primary industries. Those who are occupying land today could double or treble their production of wheat, wool and butter if they used top dressing. Last week I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he would approach the Nauru and Ocean Island Commission with a view to securing a reduction of the price of the phosphatic rock that is imported by this country for the manufacture of superphosphate, and the honourable gentleman replied that he would use his best efforts in that direction., Those of us who understand the tillage and cultivation of land know that in . Victoria, Tasmania and the south-eastern part of South Australia, there are districts containing hundreds of thousands of acres of land in which there is a bountiful rainfall and a very fine soakage. Some of the land certainly is poor; but poor land gives the best results when it is top dressed. It should be our aim to secure a reduction of railway freights, and of the landed cost of phosphatic rock to the extent of at least £1 per ton. If we can thus assist our landholders, particularly the poor man who has not the ready cash to top dress his land every year, the benefit will be tenfold. The honourable member for Gippsland  fruits industry is in a parlous condition. That is very true. Every man who is engagedto-day in the growing of fruit in Australia is in a bad way. But what was done by the previous Government to asaist #can those men except to give the industry the benefit of a bounty? It is generally admitted that the home market is the best: It should, therefore, be our aim to develop that market equally with markets abroad. I hope that early in the new year the Government will proceed with the marketing scheme that it proposes to submit to the producers of Australia. It should be made Commonwealth-wide, aud be linked up with a similar scheme that the Labour Government in Great Britain proposes to put into operation. There is no reason why marketing schemes throughout the Empire should not, to some extent, be uniform - If we can do that we shall have gone some distance towards bridging the gap that exists today between the producer and the consumer. It is deplorable that the man who produces apples and oranges receives only about a farthing each for his product, while the consumer has to pay 3d. and 4d. apiece for oranges, and generally not less than 2d. a piece for apples. I say, deliberately, that the producer is being robbed because of the lack bf a proper scheme of marketing within Australia. It is the duty of this Government to evolve such a scheme. Seven or eight years ago the Labour Government in Queensland brought into operation a marketing scheme for that State, and the results have been fairly satisfactory. It should be a good basis for a scheme embracing the whole of Australia. We must see that the consumer's obtain their requirements at a reasonable price. There is no product that is morn monopolized than fruit. Last year I was in Mildura during the grape-picking season, and saw large consignments of grapes being sent away by rail. I asked the growers what price they expected to obtain, and was told that they would be satisfied if they were returned l d . per Out of that return they have to pay for boxes, branding, cultivation, labour, and water rates. Yet in Melbourne the price charged to the consumer was 3d. and 4d. per lb. It is time that we put our bouse in order and propounded a scheme under which the producers would secure better results than they have had in the past. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) yesterday voiced strong opposition to the voluntary system of military training. He expressed the opinion that this Government made a mistake, and had endangered our defence force when it suspended compulsory training. Shortly after the Government announced its intention we read many expressions of opinion from persons, both in Australia and abroad, who arc qualified to speak on the subject. Sir Ian Hamilton stated that in his judgment the voluntary system is the best for Australia; and I heartily agree with him. In my boyhood days there was nothing except voluntary training, and we underwent it because we liked it. I venture to say that we did three times as much drill as is done today under the compulsory system, and reached, a stage of efficiency not inferior to that of the products of compulsory training. But it is of very little use to talk of maintaining a land force in Australia unless we are prepared to tackle the big work of unifying our railway gauges. If we were attacked tomorrow and desired to mobilize our land forces in the northern part of this continent .at least two months would be occupied in the transport of 30,000 troops from Victoria to Queensland, because of the breaks of gauge at Albury and Wallangarra. There are breaks of gauge also in the other States. If we intend to rely largely upon a land force as a means of defence we must make uniform with the New South Wales gauge those that differ from it in Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, no matter what the cost may be. I believe, however, that this country will never be invaded. The ideals and aspirations of the people of other nations today are in the direction of peace, not of war. If we hasten the day when the nations of the world will disarm and their leaders lb. will strive for the policy of peace, as opposed to that of war, we shall be in the vanguard of progress. Some military leaders have stated that future wars will be fought in the air. We - have read recently of military manoeuvres in Great Britain, France and elsewhere, involving the use of poison gases from aeroplanes. God help humanity if these destructive agencies are liberated in another conflict of the nations. The League of Nations and the representatives of the five great powers that are to confer in England in January next should do everything in their power to educate all nations to the ideal of universal disarmament and world peace. It is Australia's bounden duty to support enthusiastically any efforts to that end. Much criticism has been directed against the Government for not having already given effect to many of the planks in the Labour party's platform. Some of those critics sat behind the last Government for nearly seven years, during which not one important promise to the electors was honored. In 1925 the last Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) announced in his policy speech that his Government would introduce unemployment insurance and national insurance and would provide £20,000,000 for home building. Not one of those promises has been honored.",46
216,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,All the houses could not be built at once.,48
217,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Not one brick has yet been laid under the Commonwealth housing scheme, and we are still without schemes for unemployment and national insurance, notwithstanding that a royal commission was engaged for two years, at great expense to the taxpayers, in quiring into and reporting upon these proposals. Yet honourable members opposite have the audacity to attack a Labour Government that has been in office for only two months. The fact must be borne in mind that when the Bruce Page Government assumed office the Treasury had an accumulated surplus of £7,4*00,000, and the subsequent five years were the most bountiful in the history of Australia, owing to the high prices ruling for stock, wool, and wheat. Notwithstanding those advantages the last Government, after selling the Commonwealth Woollen Mills and the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, went out of office, leaving a deficit of £5,000,000 and an army of 300,000 unemployed throughout Australia. The Labour Government is asked why it has not found work for the unemployed men and women and why it has introduced new taxation which allows the picture proprietors to escape. The Government was obliged to raise more revenue, and the picture theatre proprietors will be caught by the income tax. Had the tax on gross receipts proposed by the last Government been imposed it would have been passed on to the patrons of picture shows; in the last resort it would have been paid by the women and children, but through the income tax the wealthy interests in the picture industry will make their contribution to the revenue, in such a way that they cannot pass it on. Some members of the Opposition are despondent because of the new tariff schedule. They regard it as extreme and hurtful to their friends. It is intended to hurt somebody, and the people against whom it is principally directed are those who are importing extensively from foreign countries. The large warehouses are filled, not with British or Australian goods, but with the products of cheap labour in foreign countries. The new tariff schedule is designed to check the operations of the importers who are exploiting our markets and to give adequate protection to those who have invested millions of pounds in Australian factories and machinery. We are proud of our conditions of labour and the wares that are produced by our people, and this Government has the courage to in- do its duty to the manufacturers regardless of the criticism that may emanate from the Free Traders who sit in Opposition. The Australian people have repeatedly declared in favour of a policy of protection, and Labour has never neglected an opportunity to give effect to it. We are more than ever determined that those who are building up our secondary industries and are producing under Australian conditions of hours and wages shall be protected against the competition of foreign sweaters. The critics of the new tariff are concerned not so much for our cousins in Great Britain as for the manufacturers of Japan and also of Germany, from which reparation payments are being received. At one time the Nationalists declared that never again would Australia trade with Germany, but we are now doing so on a large scale. The policy of the Government is Australian in character, and will be continued so long as the Labour party remains in power. Those who say that the Government is neglectful of the interests of the Australian people speak with their tongues in their cheeks. I am glad that it has definitely declared in favour of protecting both the manufacturers and the man on the land. Whatever can be done to further the interests of Australian men, women and children will be done by a Labour Ministry.. Progress reported. In Committee of Ways and Means:",48

In submitting this motion, it is not my intention to discuss the details of the schedule or to make a long speech on the merits or demerits of either protection or free trade. A copy of the schedule and also a memorandum showing the difference between the old and the new rates will be distributed among honourable members. This schedule and that laid on the table a few weeks ago, will, together, comprise over 300 items.",49
219,Dr EARLE PAGE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Does this schedule alter any other item's, or is it entirely new ?",55
220,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"It corrects some anomalies that occur in other items, and contains a number of new items; there will be an opportunity, later, to discuss the details. As the Minister responsible for the duty of laying the tariff proposals of the Government on the table, I deem it my privilege to deal with the general principles that have guided the Ministry in giving the additional meas'ure of protection that the manufacturers of this country will be afforded as a. result of the Government's action since it has assumed office. So far as trade is concerned, the tariff has two objects, one direct, and the other indirect. The direct aim of this schedule, as well as that tabled some weeks ago, is to protect Australian industries and provide employment for the Australian people. This is particularly necessary at a time when we find, even on the admission of the late Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Gullett), according to a speech delivered by him in Queensland a few months ago, that we have a greater amount of unemployment in Australia than we experienced at any period since 1893. These proposals are submitted in accordance with a definite promise made by the Leader of the Government during the last election campaign. He stated in his policy-speech thatBreaches in the tariff wall will be repaired at once. Labour stands for the fullest possible protection to all industries, primary and secondary. The cotton bounty will be supplemented by effectively protecting the cotton yarn and piece goods that can be made from Australian-grown cotton. Of course, the Prime Minister made that promise in accordance with the platform of the Federal Labour party, which stands [41] for the effective protection of Australian industries. Planks 4 and 5 of that platform state4. The new protection, embodying the effective protection of Australian industries, prevention of profiteering, and the protection of the workers in such industries. 5. Import embargoes for the effective protection of Australian industries, subject to the control of prices and industrial conditions in the industry benefited. Owing to the limitations imposed by the Commonwealth Constitution it is impossible, at present, to give full effect to the Federal Labour party's platform; but this Government is doing its utmost to build up Australian industries. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Customs said a few weeks ago, the hand that gives can take away. If any manufacturer is found to be exploiting the people, because of the protection resulting from these higher duties, the Government thai has given him that protection can also deprive him of it .",55
221,Mr LACEY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I think that special attention should be paid to that.,55
222,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"It is most necessary. Since this Government has been in power' only about six weeks, it has not been possible for it to deal with all the requests that have been placed before the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton) and the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin). There are about 1,100 requests in the department, and I desire to pay a special tribute of praise to the departmental officers for their indefatigable work in investigating them. In many cases, they are working long hours to assist the Government in giving effect to the mandate that it received from the people at the recent election. I wish particularly to give credit to the Acting Comptroller of Customs, Mr Abbott, for the way in which he has worked. Unfortunately, the Tariff Board has been exceedingly busy, and it has not been advisable for the Government to wait until it could reconsider some of the items that appear on the schedule. It was necessary, because of the exigencies of the industrial situation throughout Australia, for the Government to take immediate action to save certain industries that were threatened with extinction. We had to do something to prevent certain manufacturers from putting off large numbers of men. We know, from investigation, that some of them, in the last few months, when the late Government was in office, were dismissing 40 or 50 employees every weekend. Owing to the efforts of the present Government, however, those dismissals have ceased, and, on the admission of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, the schedule that was recently tabled has meant the provision of 30,000 extra jobs, and it is estimated that, as a result of the present schedule, and the foregoing one combined 50,000 positions will be made available immediately, while well over 100,000 jobs will be provided when certain extra plant and equipment have been installed. To have referred all these matters to the Tariff Board, and to have awaited for its reports, would have meant more than twelve months delay, in many cases. I think that honourable members from Queensland will agree with me when I say that we have had an example in the case of the cotton industry of the disaster due to delay.",55
223,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,There is nothing in this schedule about cotton.,56
224,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"If the honourable member had studied the last tariff schedule, he would have found that the cotton growers had received everything for which they had asked in the way of protection.",56
225,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,What about increased bounties ?,56
226,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"We do not deal with bounties in tariff schedule; but in any case the Tariff Board turned down the request. The honourable member will see that this Government has provided protection in the schedule just placed on table against the importation of cotton seed oil in order to give the necessary impetus to the manufacture in Australia of that valuable by-product of the cotton industry. This will play an important part in enabling the growers, co-operatively, to take over the whole of the industry in Queensland. The industry waited for seven years for the late Government to do what the present Government has done within a month of assuming office. It has given the growers all that they asked for and all that was recommended by the Tariff Board, and, on further investigation, we gave them something that the board did not recommend, but which was found to be absolutely necessary. Those growers are deeply grateful for the assistance that they have received, and they will not thank the honourable member who is interjecting for the party political bias that forces him to take up his dog-in-themanger attitude. The matter of protection for the cotton industry was referred to the Tariff Board on the 21st May, 1928. The board did not take evidence for four months, and nine months elapsed before its report came to hand. The late Government held up the report for eight months before taking any action; but the present Government, within a month of its return to office, gave the industry all the protection for which it had asked.  tion?",56
227,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member  feel uncomfortable. Within a month the Labour party gave those primary producers what the late Government had failed to give them. It will be found that the schedule protects primary as well as secondary industries. The honourable member will find something in it of benefit to the onion growers, which was refused by the late Government. The schedule provides for increased duties on the following cotton productsItem 105(A) (1) (6) and (o)-Piec e goods. Item 105(AA)-Piec e goods (knitted). Item 110(A) (3)-Blouses . Item 110(A) (4)-Coats . Item 110(A) (5) and (B) (3)-Costumes , dresses or robes. Item 110(B) (1)-Knitte d apparel. Item 115(A)-Socks . Item 115(B)-Stockings . Item 120(c)-Towels . Item 123(A)-Waddin g and cotton-wool. Item 392(A)-Cotto n yarn. Item 432-Ra w cotton (including linters). Item 229(H) (1)-Edibl e oils. The inclusion of edible oils will give the necessary protection to the cotton-seed oil mills.",56
228,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I have advocated all that.,56
229,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"But the honourable member had no influence with the late Government. Talk is cheap; it is action that is - needed. Within a month of its accession to office the Government has done these things. Look.at the assistance that the new schedule will give to manufacturers. For the year 1928-29, Australia imported 361,174 gallons of cotton-seed oil to the value of £59,344. This came from the United Kingdom, China, France, Japan and the United States of America. Our imports from Japan alone totalled 66,306 gallons, at a cost of £12,632. This protection was asked for by the Queensland Cotton Pool Board and by Senator Massy Greene, as Chairman of the British-Australian Cotton Associa. tion. The late Government held the matter up for over two years, and did nothing, although the Tariff Board's report was in its hands for over eight months, notwithstanding the fact that it had definitely pledged itself during the 1928 election campaign that, immediately after the election, prompt action would be taken.",56
230,Mr MAXWELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Does the Acting Minister anticipate that these increased duties will raise the cost of living?,57
231,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"No ; I shall quote figures to prove that increased protection does not necessarily mean an increase in the price of commodities. One of the items in the schedule which may be criticized by honourable members opposite is that which provides a duty of 9d. per lb. and an ad valorem duty of 20 per cent., British preferential for wool tops. If there is one industry in Australia that should be protected through all its stages it is the wool industry. We produce the finest wool in the world; but for too long have sent practically the whole of every clip to the other side of the world to be manufactured. obliged us to import the finished articles. Last year Australia's wool clip totalled 950,000,000 lb. of wool, and was valued at £69,572,000. During that year we exported 810,540,500 lb. of wool to other countries, which was valued £61,612,995, and we imported 1,102,957 lb. of wool tops, valued at £233,241. Those wool tops should have been manufactured here. As most honourable members know, the manufacture of wool tops is the first process through which the raw wool passes. The wool is first scoured, then combed into then spun into yarn, and then woven or knitted into cloth. We should be doing most of this work in Australia. We have some wool-top manufacturers operating at present. Last year our wool top export figures were as follows:Exports. lb. £ Canada 209,246 63,279 New Zealand 7,331 1,466 Japan 554,949 102,067 United States of America 1,248 145 Total 872,774 .. 166,957 Seeing that our manufacturers are willing to install additional machinery for the manufacture of wool tops, and that this would provide employment for hundreds of additional men, there is every justification for the introduction of this schedule. We have a mandate from the country to protect our great primary and secondary industries. Last year our imports of manufactured and partially-manufactured woollen goods were valued at £2,364,035. There is no justification for that in a wool-producing country. We should set about making our own requirements. We have been tinkering with the question long enough. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) asked by interjection a moment ago whether the introduction of this tariff would increase the cost of living. It does not necessarily follow that an increase in duty means an increase in the price-of goods. That is indicated by the following figures, which show the price of certain commodities before and after the introduction of new duties:Prior to Nov., After This has 1927 1927 Schedule Schedule per doz. per doi. s. d. s. d. Ladies' artificial silk vests .. 09 0 . 57 0 Ladies' shaped cotton and woven vests 28 6 . . 28 6 Men's cotton athletic ribbed at singlets 16 .. 15 0 Men's shirts underwear 60 ..58 0 Men's pants underwear 51 .. 48 0 Men's shirts underwear 54 ..51 0 Men's pants underwear 62 .. 58 0 Ladies' vests underwear 69 ..62 0 'Ladies' bloomers underwear 62 ..56 6 f t will be remembered that following upon the imposition of increased duties on electops, tricity meters, the Australian manufacturers were able to secure practically the whole of the local market, and thus reduce the price of meters from 36s. to 18s. each. The following figures in relation to the price of farming implements indicate elearly that the introduction of an effective tariff reduces prices:Item. Price In Price In Beductlon. 1920. 1928. £ «. d. £ «. d. £ i. d. 6-ft. Harvester . . 165 0 0 123 0 0 82 0 0 8-ft. Harvester . . 192 10 0 1SS 8-ft. Header 242 10 0 179 16-Hoe Grain and Fertilizer Drill 79 0 0 61 0 0 18 0 0 Furthermore tariff protection increases employment. Some honourable members opposite would like to get their goods from black-labour factories elsewhere without considering the welfare of the workers of Australia.",57
232,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"On a point of order, I ask whether the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs is in order in reading his'speech?",58
233,The CHAIRMAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Mr MCGRATH) The Minister is perfectly in order in referring to notes.,58
234,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I know that it hurts some honourable members opposite to hear the truth.,58
235,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The Minister's remarks are offensive and untruthful.,58
236,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member for Swan may not like to hear the truth; but he need not become insolent when honourable members on this side of the chamber set out to protect the interests of Australia. In view of the figures I have quoted regarding the implements manufactured by the Sunshine Harvester ""Works, I am justified in asserting that, so far from ruining Australia, our protectionist policy has been of great assistance to the country. Certain honourable members opposite might have been inclined, when their party was in power, to give a larger measure of protection to some of our industries, but they were prevented from doing so by members of the so called Country party.",58
237,Mr R GREEN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I rise to a point of order. A day or so ago Mr Speaker ruled that if any remark made by an honourable member was considered offensive, individually or collectively, it must be withdrawn. The Acting Minister has used the word "" alleged"" in connection with the Country party. That is offensive to me and I ask that it be withdrawn.",58
238,The CHAIRMAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I know nothing of the ruling to which the honourable member has referred. As Chairman of the Percentage Committee I rule that the remark to Beductlon. which the honourable member has objected is not unparliamentary.,58
239,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Certain honourable 20.64 members who occupy seats on the corner 19.48 0 0 37 10 0 0 0 63 10 0 26. M benches represent the free trade importing interests of Australia, although they 22.78 profess to represent the farmers. The. honourable member for Echuca (Mr Hill ) , the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) have all, at different times, advocated that the tariff should be reduced or abolished and that our Arbitration Court should be abandoned. .",58
240,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"On a point of order, the statement that the Acting Minister has just made is absolutely and wholly incorrect, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",58
241,The CHAIRMAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The Minister's remarks were not out of order, though the observation of the honourable member for Swan might well have been objected to by the Acting Minister.",58
242,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"If .the honourable member for Swan denies that he has advocated the abolition of the tariff, I am prepared to accept his statement; but I have frequently quoted, in this chamber, extracts from the Hansard report of a speech made by the honourable member for Echuca in 1924 to the effect that the sugar embargo should be discontinued and the tariff and Arbitration Court abolished.",58
243,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Hear , hear!",58
244,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I am interested to hear that interjection. How can the honourable member and others of ' his party expect us to believe that they represent the primary producers? The recem histoi'y of the cigar-making industry in Australia shows the need for additional protection. Five years ago, we had 1,456 operatives employed in this industry, but at present we have only 600 working in it from three to three and a half days per week. The motor cars imported completely assembled last year would have given employment to 1,000 additional men. The additional protection now . being granted to motor car spring makers will mean increased employment in Australia, and the expenditure of an additional £400,000 annually in iron and steel alone. Hundreds of men will also be employed in erecting new buildings and assembling additional plant to make these springs. It is anticipated that the total number of additional men that will be required in this industry will be about 5,000. We now have 80,000 persons engaged in the clothing and textile industry in Australia. As a result of the additional protection which will now be accorded to the textile industry, it is expected that almost immediately the number will be increased to 100,000, and that ultimately, it will reach 145,000. It is time that steps were taken to interrupt the flirting that has been going on between free traders in Australia and foreign traders, many of whom carry on their operations in black labour countries. The extra protection that will be given to the timber industry in relation to ply wood and veneers, will, it is expected, make possible the employment of 1,000 more workmen. Our leather bag and trunk factories will be able to provide additional employment for 12,000 men. It is anticipated that our paint and varnish works will require 150 hands immediately, and that our glassware and earthenware industries will be able to absorb another 900 persons. This additional work must do a great deal to relieve unemployment. I believe that Australia will welcome the additional protection that this Government has given to our industries. The introduction of this schedule cannot be interpreted as an - unfriendly gesture to any other country, for every Government is charged with the duty of conserving the welfare of its owu citizens. This Government is placing the interests of the Australian workmen first, and surely that is a laudable attitude to adopt.",58
245,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Kooyong) [5.27] - I do not propose, at this stage, to discuss the items in the schedule that has just been tabled; I shall have a later opportunity to do that. I wish to draw the, attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that last week an announcement appeared in a section of the press that another tariff 'schedule would be tabled this week - When the Prime Minister was asked whether that statement was right or wrong, he declined, in accordance with the usual practice, to give any information on the subject. I have no complaint to make in that regard. But evidently it was known in some quarters that another schedule would be tabled, for, after the Prime Minister had refused to make any statement on the subject, the press repeated its assertion in more detail that another schedule would be introduced. An extensive schedule had just been tabled and it is difficult to see how any one could guess or anticipate that another schedule would be introduced almost immediately. It is most important from the point of view of the public and of the revenue that there should be no leakage of information in regard to the introduction of tariff schedules. We should all be very uneasy if we felt that interested persons had obtained information in advance in relation to tariff subjects.",59
246,Mr THEODORE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Surely the honourable member does not suggest that the information came from a Minister?,59
247,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I do not for a moment make that suggestion. My object in speaking at this stage is to ask the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, and not as Leader of the Labour party, to use every means in his power to discover how this information was obtained. I do not speak as the representative of a party in this connection, but in a wider sense as a representative of the people. I urge the Prime Minister.to use every means at his disposal to ascertain who wrote these paragraphs, and from whom the information was obtained. It must be obvious that information of this description is of immense pecuniary value to certain individuals of the community. Apart altogether from any question of party, I ask the Prime Minister to have an inquiry made in the interests of the community as a whole.",59
248,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [5.31] - I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) that it is most important that, in the interests of the country, there should be no leakage in regard to any proposed tariff amendments. When the honourable member rose to speak, I wondered whether he was about to suggest that any information had come from a member of the Government.",59
249,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I do not suggest that for one moment.,60
250,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I am glad to have that assurance. Every precaution has been taken to prevent any leakage. The head of the department and myself have made every inquiry to ascertain the source of that information, but we are unable to find it. We do not know whether there was good guessing or leakage of information. I suggest that there was guesswork. In the rush of business it was necessary for the officers of the department to consult with the Minister and myself at Parliament House, in my room. The pressmen are keen and they can make guesses. I suggest that that was the basis of that information. This is not the first time that there has been a leakage of information. I have never known a tariff schedule to be tabled without some speculation in the press beforehand, and some withdrawals from bond in anticipation of the new duties. Take the last schedule tabled by the late Government.",60
251,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The anticipations were all wrong.,60
252,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Some were wrong, but many other's were right.",60
253,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"It was doubtful guesswork. ""^ Mr Scullin - There was clear evidence of guesswork or leakage, because there were enormous withdrawals from bond and a consequent loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. The definite statement was published in a section of the press that there was to be an increased excise duty on spirits. So definite was the information, that withdrawals were being made from bond weeks before Parliament was called together, and before any tariff schedule could be laid upon the table. That is well known to honourable members. It must not be forgotten that less notice has been given of the intentions of this Government in respect to proposed tariff amendments than' was the case previously.",60
254,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,What about the recent whisky withdrawals from bond?,60
255,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"There is always anticipation of increased tariffs; but the whisky withdrawals from bond prior to the tabling of the last schedule, by the late Government, were ten times as much as they were just recently. It is true that those who made these withdrawals anticipated that the increase of excise would be larger than it actually was, and probably, had they known the facts, their withdrawals would have been much less. But they knew or guessed something. Every precaution has been taken, both by the department and by the Government, to prevent leakages of information, and we can do nothing more to ascertain the source of that information. If the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) can suggest in what way further inquiries may be made, I shall be glad to have his assistance. I might ask him what methods were adopted by the late Government to remedy the many leakages that took place during its term of office. I do not know whether there was any leakage in this case. A definite statement was published that a new tariff schedule was to be introduced, but as no one was able to guess what it contained, I venture to say that the anticipations were nothing but guesswork. '",60
256,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I should be pleased to make a suggestion privately to the Prime Minister.,60
257,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I shall be glad to have it, and if we find that there is any leakage in any part of Australia, we will run it to earth. I am inclined to think that it was good guessing. One item, at least, of the tariff schedule was certainly anticipated.",60
258,Dr EARLE PAGE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Cowper) [5.38] It has been suggested that there were definite leakages in connection with the tariff schedule introduced by the late Government. It will be remembered that although there may have been good guessing on this occasion, there was bad guessing on the previous occasion, because some £300,000 in duty was paid on petrol, although there was no subsequent increase in the tariff on that commodity. When the previous tariff was imposed it would have paid the liquor interests .over and over again to have retained in bond most of the whisky they withdrew, instead of withdrawing it and going to the extra expense of storing it outside. There is no basis for the suggestion that there was any leakage connected with the last tariff tabled by the late Government. There may have been guesswork, but it was bad guesswork, which, indeed, reacted upon those who groundlessly anticipated heavy increases in tariff-this time the guesswork seems remarkably good. Progress reported.. BUDGET (No. 2) 1929-30. In Committee of Supply: (Consideration resumed from page 1058.)",60
259,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Darwin) [5.39] - The debate upon the budget usually takes the form of a general survey of the economic position of Australia and it is only right that that should be so, particularly on this occasion, in view of the present cial depression which is causing dismay to a large number of the people, and intense worry to the Government. I sympathize with the Government. I do not wish to be unduly critical of its actions, because it has not been long in office and, naturally, has not been able to bring down the whole of its programme, or to give ful l consideration to the proposals that it has placed before honourable members. It is rather strange that the Treasurer has had sufficient time to examine thoroughly the estimates of the late Treasurer, and to accuse him of gross inaccuracies in respect of his estimates of revenue and expenditure for this financial year. I presume that both the late Treasurer and the present Treasurer, when framing their estimates, relied upon the advice of the departmental officers. It is, therefore, difficult for me to believe that the late Treasurer was widely astray in his estimates of revenue and expenditure. It appears to me that the present Treasurer has purposely underestimated the revenue anticipated by the late Treasurer, whose previous estimates, we must admit, were invariably more or less accurate. I have sufficient confidence in him to believe that his estimates for this year will not fall very .short of the mark. It is difficult for any Treasurer to estimate the revenue to be derived from customs, because so much depends upon the purchasing power of the community. I am not greatly concerned when customs revenue is overestimated, because, in many cases-, a decrease is evidence that the people are keeping in their pockets money which would otherwise have been spent for the benefit of foreign nations. I have criticized in the past the practice of understating customs revenue, so as to justify additional income taxation, and by that means accumulate at the expense of the people a huge surplus at the end of the financial year. I am concerned about the welfare of the people generally, and we should not take from them, by way of taxation, more than is necessary to enable the Government to meet the liabilities of the Commonwealth. The late Government proposed to increase the tax on luxuries, and especially on amusements. That would have been a wise step, because such a tax would have finan- lessened the burden upon industry and the people generally. The present Treasurer proposes to impose a super tax on the taxable income of individuals and companies. I do not intend to discuss the proposed increase of the tax upon individuals, although I contend that it would have been wiser and fairer to tax amusements. I have always opposed any proposal to tax companies' profits. It is fairer, and in the best interests of the community generally, to tax individuals. By taxing the profits of a company, the individual is taxed twice. My great objection to company taxation is that it deters people from investing money in companies which alone, in many instances, can develop Australia. The individual cannot afford the amount of money necessary for certain developmental industries, whereas the community, by investing its savings in companies, can exploit mining, agriculture and secondary industries without running the risk of great loss. But people will not invest their savings in enterprises if the profits are to be heavily taxed as soon as there are any profits. I am concerned with the development of Australia, and in finding the capital necessary to develop it. Persons willing to put capital into enterprise for the development of our primary and secondary industries should be encouraged, and the imposition of this super tax is not in the interests of the development of Australia, nor is it just to individuals. On the subject of Australia's economic position one notices that the opinions pressed in this House are to a large extent biased by the interests which honourable members represent. Some say that the tariff will be detrimental to primary industries, and that the burden of it will have to be borne by the workers. To a certain extent that is true, but not to the extent suggested by some of my Country party friends. ""With some of their views I disagree entirely. Others say that our disabilities are due to high wages, and that we must reduce the cost of production. Of course we must; but no oue who has thought seriously on the subject believes that the reduction of wages will adequately reduce the cost of production. We should encourage the individual to work harder and produce more, to spend less on luxuries and amusements. We must look the facts in the face; mere palliatives are of no use. I do not wish to discuss the question of the fixation of wages by arbitration systems or other means, but it is obvious that the tribunals set up for that purpose have not been successful in regulating wages on an equitable basis as between different sets of workers. One example is outstanding - that supplied by the present coal trouble. It concerns every .person in tralia, and practically every industry is affected. We must look deeply into the causes responsible for the present trouble before we can suggest remedies. We know that the coal-miners have been paid very well for the work done, compared with what workers in other industries receive, even those in other mining industries. I do not suggest that the fault is all on one side. A royal commission is inquiring into this matter, and I wish that its report would be available earlier. I think that there is grave wrong on both sides, but the leaders of the unfortunate miners have not advised them well. It is a notable fact that it is those engaged in the best paid industries in Australia, such as the coal-miners and waterside workers, who have been responsible for most of our industrial disputes. They are well organized, and have felt their strength. cause of their great power they have been encouraged, by the so-called Labour leaders Mr Bell. of this country to press for conditions ex- to which they think they are entitled, to the detriment of other sections of workers. Compare the wages paid to miners and waterside workers with those received by workers in the forests and on the farms, the men who really do our most important work. Such men receive only 10s. to 12s. a day compared with about £10 a week received by the coal-miners who have revolted because they were asked to accept a small reduction. Compare the wages of the coal-miners with those of the workers in the silver, tin and copper mines. I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) that it is the duty of members on both sides of the House to co-operate in an attempt to find a settlement of our existing industrial troubles. Somebody has said that there are 300,000 unemployed in Australia today. Somebody else has said that there are 200,000. I do not know the figures, but if there are only 100,000 unemployed it is too many.",61
260,Mr LACEY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member would be quite safe in saying 150,000.",62
261,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Well , let us say 150,000. The greatest problem with which Australia is confronted today is how to find work for the workless, if they are willing to work. It is absurd, however, to suggest Aus- that men who have been earning up to £10 a week should be kept by the dole when there is work for them to do, and they will not do it, and while there are thousands of men prepared to work for a quarter of that wage if they were allowed.",62
262,Mr CUSACK,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The miners do not average £3 a week.,62
263,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"They do not average anything when they are not working. No industry can succeed if there are 10,000 men hanging round .for the jobs that 5,000 men can do. That has been the position for years past on the coal-fields. I was a member of this House when the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), then Prime Minister, brought in a bill known as the Industrial Peace Bill, because a judge of the High Court would not give the coalBe- miners what they demanded. The late Mr Justice Higgins would not be dictated to by the Government of the day. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that the coal industry was too important to be held up. He had an act passed, under which a tribunal was appointed to fix wages and conditions on the coal-fields. That tribunal granted everything that the coal-miners asked, and the owners promptly put up the price of coal. There has been trouble in the coal industry from that day until now. The industry has lost its export trade, and a result of the increased cost of coal, other industries in Australia have not been able 'to compete with - manufacturers overseas. Every other source for the development of power has been exploited to take the place of coal, and all the coal industry was considered to be too important to be held up.",62
264,Mr JAMES,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,What were the miners given by the tribunal ?,63
265,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I do not know.,63
266,Mr JAMES,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,They were given an eighthour day.,63
267,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) knows more about the industry than I do, but I can recall many debates in this Parliament on the coal industry. It was stated by the predecessor of the honourable member - Mr Charlton-o n one occasion that it was not right to say that the miners were earning big money, because some were working only two days a week. At that time there were more men on the fields than were needed to work the mines, but while hundreds were idle there was plenty of work to be had elsewhere in Australia. There was little or no unemployment then, but the miners who could earn enough in two days to keep themselves and families for a week hung round the mines instead of engaging in other work. That was the beginning of the trouble in the coal-mining industry. Increased customs duties will not solve the problem of unemployment, though if the promises of the Minister for Trade  tant (Mr Forde) that the new tariff will have the effect of reducing the price of commodities, and at the same time provide increased revenue to the extent of £700,000 are fulfilled, I for one shall no longer be critical of the Government. The Postmaster-General has introduced proposals which differ somewhat, but not very much, from those of his predecessor. The effect will be to increase the rates for postal and telephone services. I am not criticizing that for the moment. If they are necessary, the increases will have to be paid. The department is supposed to be a business department. I hope it is, and I believe that in the main it is run on business lines. The Postmaster-General, in replying during a short debate this as morning, when he introduced a motion submitting certain proposed works to the Public Works Committee, appeared to resent what some honourable members on this side of the House had said about his department. So far as I could because judge, nothing that was said was meant to be critical of the present Postmaster-General; at any rate, nothing I have said can be so construed. The Postmaster-General has said that the increased charges for telephone services would not apply to subscribers to country telephone exchanges. There would be no increase in rates, he said, for calls within a five-miles radius of the exchange. I remind the honourable gentleman, however, that telephone subscribers in the country can do very little business without using a trunk line. In the State of which I am one of the representatives, country subscribers are very often 10 to 15 miles from a town, but it is in that town that they have to do their business. The country resident does not use the telephone to bid his neighbour the time of day, but to transact his business, which is done with the town. Therefore he must use the trunk line; consequently the increase of the trunk line rates affects him severely. The late Postmaster-General increased the trunk line rate by l d . a call. Probably he thought that it would pass unnoticed. I do not think that many people did notice it ; but I saw what a difference it made when I received my half-yearly account. The increase applied whether the call was over a distance of fifteen miles or 400 miles. It was grossly unfair to the country telephone subscriber.",63
268,Mr LYONS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The latest increase does not apply up to 60 miles.,63
269,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I am pleased to be given that assurance. Although it is generally admitted that the late Postmaster-General rendered valuable service in connection with the extension of the telephone system in country districts, we who represent those districts are satisfied that a great deal more remains to be done. It would be wrong in principle to withhold further extensions because country services are not paying, or to lay down the rule that those who are connected to city exchanges are entitled to greater facilities because of the larger volume of business transacted by those exchanges. The commercial man benefits equally with the man outback from extensions to country districts. The cities could not exist if the country did not develop. That is an aspect of the matter which demands consideration. I have frequently contended that it unfair to ask subscribers in country tricts to be responsible for the additional cost involved in an alteration of the closing hour from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Many of those who are in charge of the facilities in country districts voluntarily provide the service to the later hour. Country subscribers can transact their business most conveniently between the hours of 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., and if that facility were afforded generally the insory crease in the business transacted during those hours would be much greater than the department estimates. I hope that the present Postmaster-General (Mr. Lyons) will inquire very carefully into all of these matters, and not be guided wholly by the heads of the department, who not only are unacquainted with the circumstances, but are not always sympathetic. We believe that the MinisThere ter is sympathetic, and that he will agree that today. to any practicable suggestion. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) has moved ""'that the item be reduced by fl,' as an indication of opinion of this committee that the Gothusiasts. vernment has acted wrongly in abolishing compulsory citizen military training without Parliamentary authority, without having organized any alternative many years. system of national defence "". I support that amendment, because I believe it was wrong for the administration abolish a system of training, provision for which is made by an act of this liament. Compulsory training is good for the youth of this country. I think it will be admitted by an overwhelming majority of honourable members that it Mr Bell. the first duty of any Government to provide an adequate system of defence and to give security to our people.",63
270,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Compulsor y military training does not do so; that is the trouble.,64
271,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member, for Corio (Mr Lewis) has previously stated that he is not in favour of any system of defence. But a more astonishing statement was made by him, when, in reply to the inquiry, ""Where would you have h^en if we had lost the war?"" he said, "" We would have been better off."" I believe in compulsory military training, because it is democratic. Why is should a few persons bear the whole burdisden, and give their time to preparation for the day-if , unhappily, it should arrive-whe n our people may be called on to defend their homes. I have been a volunteer for over 35 years, and if I had any bias it would be towards the voluntary system; but I realise that the Minister for Defence (Mr A. Green) cannot, as he suggests, obtain a system of voluntary defence equal to that provided by compulmilitary training and at a less cost. If he succeeds in inducing 50,000 volunteers to take the places of trainees, the expenditure will be as great as it is now. He proposes to offer them 4s. a day. He will not get 50,000 persons to give their services for that sum. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill) and all I , gave our services for nothing and found our own uniforms and equipment. are not many persons who will do",64
272,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,And we were as well trained.,64
273,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Probably we were a little the better trained, because we were enThe greatest objection to the voluntary system is that it does not provide a reserve force. The honourable memand ber for Wannon and I served for The strength of the force was kept up; but there was that no regular reserve force. When men to train for three or four years and then pass out, their places are taken by others. ParAssociated with our system of compulsory training we should have a complete organization that would enable us to call upon all men to serve for the work for is which they were most fitted. When men pass out we should know precisely where they are to be found, and what service they are best able to give. I trust that we shall never-again be called upon to defend our country, but it is absurd for any person to say that there is no possibility of another war taking place within the next ten years, or for the Minis- ter to claim that we should be given six months' notice. An invader is always ready to strike, but a defender has to make preparation to repel an invasion. We should never be given six months' notice in which to train our men. Although we sent to Gallipoli perhaps the best trained and the best equipped men who ever went into battle, they still had a lot to learn. It is the first duty of any government to make provision for the adequate defence of the country.",64
274,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,That is what everybody says.,65
275,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member says that he does not believe in any form of training. The only point on which there is a difference of opinion between us is as to the best and most economical system to adopt. I regret that when the Minister for Defence (Mr. A. Green) was replying to a previous debate he spoke as he did respecting the service of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White). Colonel White's service either in peace or war will bear a searching examination. Everyone who knows the honourable member and is acquainted with what he did will regret that, in a spirit of peevishness, the Minister cast reflections upon him.",65
276,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The Minister withdrew his remarks and said that he did not mean them.,65
277,Mr BELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Anothe r remark which the Minister made during that debate was that he did not consult his adviserS, because they were interested parties, and their jobs depended upon the continuance of compulsory training. Can it be imagined that men like Sir Henry Chauvel, Generals Dodds and Brand would not give honest advice even though their jobs depended on compulsory training? The Minister evidently realized that he was in a difficult position. In the first place, he said that it was a matter of policy. Then, possibly fearing that there would be an uproar in the community, he compromised and said that we would have a voluntary system instead of a compulsory one. I hope that the voluntary system will be successful. I . shall use whatever influence I possess to encourage young men to volunteer. I fear, however, that such a system will not prove profitable to Australia. I do not believe that young men of the right age will devote themselves to training on half a day a week for a remuneration of 4s. a day. If success should not attend the voluntary system, I trust that the Government will be able to provide an adequate substitute for compulsory training. I support the amendment, because the Government has ignored a law which it was sworn to administer, and has abolished a system of training that Parliament intended we should have. I shall welcome any system that will provide an adequate defence force which would be able, at reasonably short notice, to defend the women and children of this country. Only those who have seen war can appreciate what, it really means. I do not think that the Defence Act should limit to this country, service in time of war. We should be placed at a strategical disadvantage if our men had to remain in their own country because of the limitations of a defence act which prohibited us from compelling our young men to fight an enemy in another country in defence of this.",65

My success the ballot box was' quite unanticipated. In the meantime, regardless of consequences to myself, I shall speak as I think and feel. I am entirely familiar with the forms and procedure this chamber, and if, during the course my remarks I should unwittingly transthe gress, I hope that you, Mr Chairman, not visit your displeasure on me too severely. The Leader of the Opposition said earlier in the session that the Labour party had been returned to power as result of a series of mis-statements which he dubbed untruths. One of those una truths, he said, was that the Bruce-Page Government Lad designedly embarked a campaign for the reduction of wages, and he challenged any honourable memman of the board. ber to repeat that assertion. Not only did I make the statement, from the public platform during the electoral campaign, but I have the temerity to repeat it now. Whatever may have been the motives and intentions of the last Government, the fact remains that, if effect had been given to its proposals, a reduction of wages must have resulted. If the Leader of the Opposition does not realise that, has but a meagre knowledge of industrial affairs and the way in which the proposal for the abolition of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would have operated. I speak not only with a theoretical knowin ledge of industrial matters, but also practical experience of the operation both the Federal and State systems of wage regulation. Nearly every organization under the Federal Arbitration Court awards was, at some period, subject to a wages board determination, and because of dissatisfaction with the limited scope and powers of the boards, chose deliberately to seek from the Federal Arbitration Court improved conditions that were impossible of attainment the State system. That was so with the organization with which I have been closely associated for the last 22 years. Mr Lewis. six years experience of the operation of the Victorian Wages Board sysI tem, my union sought the protection a wave of the Federal Arbitration Court; its award, governing the conditions our industry, is limited enat tirely to the members of my organization employed by respondent employers, the and nothing would induce its members deliberately to forsake the court and unreturn to the jurisdiction of a wages of board. Amongst our objections to the of . latter are the system of administration, pro rata payments, and the almost will entire absence of provision for weekly hiring. Many of the conditions' prescribed in the federal award are impossible of attainment under the wages board system, which lays down no guiding principle for the determination of conthe ditions and rates of pay. The Federal Court, on the other hand, has laid down definite formula for determining the minimum rates of pay for an adult emon ployee. The Victorian wages board system leaves that entirely to the chair",65
280,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,And in practice that is so with the present Arbitration Court.,66
281,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"It is not so. Ever since the famous declaration by Mr Justice Higgins in the Harvester case, the court has followed a definite procedure in fixing the minimum wage in an industry. Under the wages board system, it he is possible for adults to be employed at considerably less than an adult should receive, and I quote from official statistics published on the 1st October last, some typical determinations. Persons engaged "" Shops, miscellaneous boards,"" may be from employed for a period of 48 hours at. of the following rates:. Age. Males.

283,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"In some callings the merest shadow of organization exists, and in a calling federal in character it is impossible without creating - an interstate dispute for the employees to reach the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.",66
284,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,If that is so the proposals of the last Government did not affect those employees.,67
285,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"For males engaged in confectionery, pastrycook, fruit, and vegetable shops, the Board fixed the following rates:21 years, 60s.; 22 years, 703.; 23 years, 81s. 6d.; females, 45s. For persons employed exclusively in booksellers' and newsagents' shops and engaged in the sale and distribution of newspapers, the rates are:Age.

287,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"If not thousands at least hundreds. I shall probably be met by the Leader of the Opposition with the statement that the State Governments would have amended their industrial laws so as to bring them into consonance with modern ideas about the regulations of employment in industry, but such a suggestion will not bear investigation. How could he forecast what would have been done by the Victorian Parliament? We have a Tory Legislative Council which controls the social and industrial legislation of Victoria. We realise from past experience that it is impossible to get any legislation passed by that body in keeping with progressive ideas. Therefore, we have to accept the facts as we find them, and, in the circumstances, I have no hesitation in repeating the declaration that I made from the public platform, that the proposal of the late Government would have meant a reduction of wages. What is true in regard to Victoria may also be said of South Australia and Tasmania.",67
288,Mr COLEMAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,And New South Wales.,67
289,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I did not think that New South Wales came within the same category of inferior industrial conditions as the States that I have mentioned.,67
290,Mr THEODORE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"It does - under the present administration. Wages Mr LEWIS - So there is every justification for the fears entertained as to the effect of the proposal of the Bruce Page Government. Fortunately, for the people of Australia, that Government was wrecked at the last election, and the Nationalist party was practically annihilated. During the recent campaign, Females. I repeated a story that had been told by s. d. s. d. Mr King O'Malley, about a farmer 35 0 who had purchased a valuable stud 40 0 40 0 bull. The farmer expected to derive considerable profit from the animal, but he experienced much difficulty in keeping it within bounds. The bull used to stray into adjoining paddocks and try Females ft. d. s. d. conclusions with the bulls belonging to the 35 0 farmer's neighbours, and it was usually 42 6 victorious. Owing to the com50 0 plaints made to him on this score, the farmer determined to remove the bull to another paddock where he thought it would cease to give trouble; but, unfortunately, he placed the animal in a paddock in the vicinity of a railway line. One day, the bull, in search of fresh conquests, stood in the middle of the railway track, and seeing a train coming, decided to test its strength against the approaching locomotive, with the result that it was killed by the collision. When the farmer found the remains of his valuable animal scattered along the railway track, he remarked, "" Well, I admire your pluck, but damn your judgment."" I can imagine the remnant of the following of Mr Bruce addressing a similar remark to him at a party meeting at the conclusion of the last election. Earlier in the proceedings, I had the temerity to interject while the late Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) was addressing this committee on financial subjects He evidently regarded it as a piece of impertinence that a political novice should dare to challenge his conclusions. He reminded me that I was a child in matters of finance. If I ever .essay the task of quoting statistics, I hope that I shall never emulate the example of the late Treasurer, who poured forth a torrent of figures in a most incoherent manner, leavhis audience completely bewildered. The only way in which I can describe him is as "" the indecipherable Page."" In the course of his remarks, he made reference to the career of the present Treasurer, and to his record as Treasurer of Queensland. I shall leave to the Treasurer the task of dealing with the strictures of the right honourable member, regarding his control of the finances of Queensland. The value of the work of any administration cannot be judged merely by reference to figures with respect to increased taxation. The true test of the economic and industrial stability of a community is the extent to which its happiness and prosperity have been increased. If additional taxatiou produces beneficial results, it is justified. One inescapable fact regarding Queensland is that, after fourteen years of Labour rule there, it is still the cheapest State in which to live.",67
291,Mr RIOKDAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,And the best State from the point of view of hours and conditions of labour.,68
292,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"It is also true that Queensland has a lower percentage of unemployed than .any other State. Despite its difficulties, owing to a drought period extending, I understand, over the last seven years, during which cattle have died by the thousand and sheep by the million, that State has gone ahead, in the industrial and economic sense, by leaps and bounds, although it recognizes a shorter working week than any other State. By these standards I am prepared to determine the value of Labour rule in Queensland. I quote as my authority Mr Larcombe, who was Minister for Railways for many years in that State. In one of his pamphlets, he showed that, under Labour rule, Queensland was the only State that had not increased its income tax rates since 1920. He went further, and demonstrated that the Commonwealth Government was levying heavier taxes upon the people of Queensland than were being imposed by the State Government for the purpose of carrying on the public services. If that is true, the burden of taxation that the people of that State have to bear today is not due to Labour administration. If I had the pamphlet before me now, I could furnish a record of Labour rule in that State, which is at once the pride and envy of the Labour movement in other parts of the Commonwealth. Queensland's housing legislation is the most liberal to be found in any country. The social and economic prosperity of the masses of the people is of greater importance than whether the amount of income tax paid by the wealthier section of the community is greater than that imposed in other States. In the past financial year, the only three States that were able to show a surplus of revenue over expenditure were those under Labour ruleQueensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. Labour was in office in Victoria in 1927-28, and that was the only period when the growth of public expenditure was arrested, although the Labour Government there was compelled to face additional expenditure to relieve unemployment and to meet the needs of hospitals' and charitable institutions. It also provided an amount for educational purposes far in excess of that devoted to this object by its predecessors in office. It was able by the exercise of rigid economy in other public departments to reduce expenditure to £25,000 less than the amount expended in the preceding year. Its predecessors in office had a deficit of £616,000, for the immediately preceding financial year, but the Labour Government concluded the year with a deficit of only £165,000. Apparently, it is characteristic of the Nationalist maladministration of the public affairs and finances of this country to pile up deficit after deficit for the Labour party to reduce and liquidate.",68
293,Mr BEBNABD COBSEB,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The .opposite was the case in Queensland.,68
294,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I shall leave the Treasurer to deal with the honourable member. Our opponents have been urging this Government to tread warily and proceed slowly. Such admonitions are entirely unwarranted and unnecessary; but, unfortunately, the Government has shown a disposition to heed them. I trust that it will move a little faster than it has done hitherto. I do not believe that the exigencies of the present situation require that we should keep on the beaten track, and employ only such methods of finance and administration as meet with the approbation of our opponents. If the circumstances warrant and demand the adoption of unorthodox methods we should adopt them. In the past Labour governments have been too ready to stick to the beaten track; but I trust that this Government will explore and exploit the credit of Australia to the fullest possible extent. I hope that it will take its oourage in both hands, and use our credit through the Commonwealth Bank to develop our resources in every direction. We may be told that if we depart from the orthodox methods of previous parliaments and governments we shall injure the credit of the country. I disagree with that view. When the Labour Government of 1910-13 introduced the Commonwealth Bank Bill and the note issue a great deal was said about men with hob-nailed boots, who came from mine, field, factory, and workshop, daring to interfere with the delicate intricacies of public finance. Perhaps the feet of the members of the Labour party of that day were heavily shod with hobnailed boots, but at least they had cool heads and clear brains. They discarded the criticizm of their opponents, and proceeded to build a financial structure for this Commonwealth which no Government since has dared to destroy. It was said that the Commonwealth note issue would be useless and worthless. The notes were contemptuously referred to as "" Fisher's flimsies."" It was said that they would be discounted at 5s. and even 10s. in the £1, and that the tradespeople would refuse to accept them in payment for goods. All the dismal forebodings of our traducers were falsified by the march of events. The Commonwealth Bank has also rendered immensely valuable service to Australia. It kept the interest rates down during the war, and for 5s. per cent, performed services for the performance of which the associated banks wanted 38s. per cent. It saved the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of pounds in loan flotation. The note issue was raised to within the vicinity of £60,000,000. believe it has now been deflated to about £44,000,000. Why should we always go cap in hand to the great financiers overseas for money to develop the resources of Australia? We should use the credit of the country to a greater extent that previous governments have used it. I trust that the Government will utilize our credit and our resources to make us independent of the money markets of the old world. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) referred somewhat gloatingly to the fact that by means of the Transport Workers Act peace had been secured in the maritime industry of Australia. The ex-Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) in an election address at Hamilton made a similar claim. It is true that peace has been observed on the waterfront during the past twelve months, but - oh God, at what a price! Apparently the Transport Workers Act was designed to destroy the organizations of the workers. Since the licensing system has been in operation on the waterfront it has been well-nigh impossible for members of the old Waterside Workers Federation to obtain employment in the industry. These unfortunate men have been pursued with a malignance which is almost unbelievable. Peace may have been secured for the time being, but the Labour movement can never be crushed by these methods. The Waterside Workers Federation will be resuscitated. Let me make a prophecy for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition. What has happened in recent days on the waterfront of Australia had a parallel in the United States of America in the old days of the slave trade. The Americn Congress at one time passed an act known as the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which extended the slave-holding area. At the time of the passing of that act, guns boomed, bells rang, and sirens shrieked in celebration of the victory of the sponsors of that act. As the opponents of the measure walked down the steps of Congress after it was passed, Senator Seward, addressing one of his comrades, said"" They may celebrate the present victory, but the echoes that will be wakened will never rest until slavery itself shall die."" The Leader of the Opposition may have succeeded in crushing the Waterside I Workers Federation for the time being; but he is only driving trade union organization underground. If Le is not careful he will create a force that will eventually bring the whole capitalistic system to utter destruction. What was truly said in relation to the slave traffic in America years ago may be said with equal truth today of those who have been temporarily defeated in their fight for economic and social freedom. Are we to be mere pawns in the hands of our opponents to be used for the production of profits and the creation of wealth for them ? There was a time when Labour was inarticulate, but today we enjoy the advantages of education, and are able to express our aspirations and ideals. Our oppressors of other days thought that by educating us they could make us more effective instruments of wealth production, but they forgot that simultaneously with increasing our economic efficiency they were enlarging our mental outlook. We came to understand that we were not mere animals. We had a vision of a distant horizon, and we realized that we were intended to enjoy some of the advantages of human progress and civilization. To-day there is being borne in the air a sound as gentle as a zephyr. Soon it will become a murmur, before long that murmur will grow into a roar. It is impossible to stem the tide of human progress. Any attempt to do so must, end in failure, and those who are responsible for it will be overtaken by a relentless flood which will bring ruin and desolation to all who try to resist it. I shall allow nobody to curb my aspirations or to prevent me from enjoying the benefits of civilization and progress, and I speak for the class from which I had sprung. I went into the recent election campaign resolved to fight with all my strength for the preservation of the legal means of protection which the workers of Australia had been granted by this Parliament. I believed that the preservation of this means of protection was vital and essential to the well-being of the class to which I belong. My fight succeeded beyond my wildest dreams and hopes; but if someone else takes my place at a later stage that will not prevent the domination, in the course of time, of the political party to which I belong. Ultimately Labour will rule, not in Australia only, but throughout the length and breadth of the world. J/r. Lewis. I wish to deal briefly with the subject of compulsory military training. I made it known during the election campaign in unmistakable terms that I was opposed to boy conscription. I said that on the public platform, and my statement weni over the air. I believe that, by an accident. I had the unique distinction of being the only member of the rank and file of political candidates to have his political speech broadcast. Therefore, it is well known what my views and opinions are upon that subject. Like the rest of my party, I am pledged to provide adequate home defence for this country, but I shall use my best endeavours within the party to alter that plank of its platform. I have been the minute secretary of the Melbourne section of the World Disarmament movement. My ideal is the complete disarmament of all the nations of the world, and I am prepared to show my sincerity by advocating the complete disarming of this country. I shall do my best to get. my party to adopt and follow that course with regard to what we call the defence of Australia. What is moving-the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) ? Time and time again he has challenged the members of this side in regard to what they did during the Great War. I presume that that honourable member followed the dictates of his conscience, that he did his duty according to what he thought was right. Likewise I followed the dictates of my conscience. I did not go to the war, and if another war breaks out in the near future I shall still refuse to fight. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) has stated that the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin), in the course of his speech, claimed that wars were brought about by the profitmongers of the nations of the world. To refute that statement the honourable member for Forrest said that certain economists'had made an examination of the causes of the war, and had reached the conclusion that the protectionist policy of the various nations was largely responsible for international wars. If that be true, then the wars in which Australia has engaged were trade wars. Are we to sacrifice the lives of our people upon the altar of war merely for trade purposes? We are not justified in sacrificing a single life in the interests of the commercial and financial magnates of any country. I refuse to be a party to trying to create an atmosphere of militarism in this country or in the minds of our people. I shall do my best from every platform, whenever I get an opportunity, to instil into their hearts and minds a hatred of war in all its forms. The last war I regard with unspeakable horror, as an act of unpardonable human folly. I did not attempt to induce any one to go to the last war, nor will I attempt to induce any one to go to any subsequent war. We arc told that to prevent war we must arm and build up a defence system, so that we may overawe our neighbours and make them afraid to attack us. Europe in .1914' was an armed camp, and yet all the preparations for war did not prevent the outbreak of the great conflagration. We have been told that this and that country caused the last war. But years after its termination Mr Lloyd George, a man who had a unique opportunity of acquainting himself fully with the causes which led to that disastrous conflict, declared that none of the nations engaged in the war desired it ; that they simply drifted into it. If I wanted evidence of the unfitness of"" military men to determine whether a country should engage in war or remain at peace, I have the finest example in the bellicose attitude of the honourable member for Balaclava, who is constantly challenging other honourable members as to what they did during the great war.",68
295,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Ha d the member read Hansard he would know that that is not so.,71
296,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I have read not only worse. Hansard, but also the daily press. I saint have been closely following the honoron, able member's career. I may be a newmake-up comer in this Parliament, but I am not unacquainted with the political questions that have been agitating this country some time. The views of nearly every public man in this country are known to me.",71
297,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Why did the honourable member say last night that Australia would have been better off had we lost the war?,71
298,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I have already indigare nantly repudiated that accusation against me.,71
299,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Unfortunately, ' the honourable member made that statement.",71
300,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I did not, and I ask, Mr Chairman, that that accusation be withdrawn.",71
301,The CHAIRMAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Mr MCGRATH.) I ask the honourable member for Balaclava to withdraw his remarks.,71
302,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I made reference to what was undoubtedly said in this chamber last night.,71
303,The CHAIRMAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The honourable member must accept the word of the honourable member for Corio.,71
304,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,In that case I have no option but to accept it.,71
305,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I thank the honourable member for Balaclava. Preparation for war has never yet prevented war nor will it do so in the future. This country is armed, and that is a justification for any other country to arm, too. It is only by the accident of birth that the honourable member for Balaclava and myself were not born in some other country. We cannot choose either our parents or the place of our birth.",71
306,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,It is a pity that the honourable member was no't born elsewhere.,71
307,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"That is immaterial to me. If I were a native of another country I should, to the best of my ability, take up the attitude that I am taking now. My sentiments are briefly expressed in the following passage from a pamphlet entitled National Security and honourable International - PeaceNo nation can be got to imagine that the others are just like itself, neither better nor Yet it is probably safe to say that, for saint, hero for hero, blackguard for blackguard, barbarian for barbarian, and so through' all the intermediate grades, the of all the nations big or little, is the same, in proportion to the population. Had the honourable member for Balaclava for been born in Germany instead of in the British Empire, he would probably be taking up the attitude that the Prussian junkers adopted before the war. His prototypes exist in every country of the world, and they are continually issuing warnings about the possibility of armed conflict. They say that other peoples going to attack them. Cannot the honourable member conceive that the people of other countries may be disposed to be peaceful just as he is, that they have no desire to kill him, and that their only reason for arming themselves is that they fear that men like him are going to kill them ? If this country, as an evidence of its sincerity and earnestness with regard to the aholition of war, were prepared to set an example by throwing down its"" arms, other countries would do likewise. It requires more moral courage to throw oneself upon the justice and goodwill of other people with regard to the maintenance of peace, than to arm oneself to the teeth. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) has said that the guns at Queenscliff Fort are entirely obsolete for defence purposes, and that the armaments of a hostile fleet, standing miles off our coast, far beyond the range of those guns, could blow that fort to smithereens. Our men might just as well be armed with pop-guns so far as our defence is concerned. On the frontiers of America and Canada there is not a single armed soldier or fort, yet peace has been preserved between those nations notwithstanding the absence of arms. Denmark is taking steps to disarm, and I undertake to say that that nation will be freer from invasion .when it has disarmed, than armed Belgium was at the beginning of the Great War.",71
308,Mr MAXWELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Would the honourable member be prepared to apply that principle to industrial warfare?,72
309,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Yes . I do not believe in the employment of force or violence in connection with industrial disputes - I believe in moral and peaceful suasion in all walks of life, and in the maintenance of peaceful human relations.",72
310,Mr MAXWELL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The honourable member is consistent.,72
311,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"In this chamber we have taken away the last semblance of authority from the Speaker, that relic of barbarism called the mace. How are we kept in order ? There are no armed forces in this chamber to prevent us from getting into conflict with each other.",72
312,Mr YATES,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,There is the Sergeant-atAnns.,72
313,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"He does not attempt to kill us. He simply takes a refractory member out of the chamber, who, when he has expiated his offence, is permitted to return. This chamber is ruled by moral and not by physical force. What is true in relation to this chamber should be true in regard to the relations of nations. I am opposed to boy conscription. I am opposed also to militarism, because it is an abnegation of civil liberties. We are taking children of eleven and a half years from the control of their parents, and placing them under the authority of the military caste. That should not be permitted.",72
314,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Since when have the military authorities conscripted boys of eleven and a half years?,72
315,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Boy s of eleven and a half years must, under our defence system, register themselves, and when they are twelve years they must begin training; and since the training begins in the year in which the boys reach twelve years, many of them are under the control of the military caste at eleven and a half years of age.",72
316,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,That is quite wrong.,72
317,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"My authority is a book entitled, Conscription under Camouflage, It was written by John Percy Fletcher and John Francis Hills. It contains an account of compulsory military training in Australasia, down to the outbreak of the Great War. These men. made a close study of the matter, and know a great deal about it. Quite irrespective of whether the age is eleven and a half or not, the fact remains that children attending our State schools are subject to military control under a system which compels the teacher to act in place of the parent and impress the children for purposes of military training. When it was found that some of the teachers were refusing to allow themselves to be used for this purpose, military officers were allowed to act in loco parentis. Boys have been incarcerated in cells because they refused to allow themselves to be enrolled under the"" military banner. They have been subjected to solitary confinement, and there have been thousands of prosecutions. The whole system was becoming a farce, and was rapidly breaking down. So great was the number of defaulters that the Defence Department refused to issue particulars of prosecutions. I am not prepared to allow a military caste to dominate this country, aud crush the civil liberties of the tralian people. Our Australian condevastated scripts, like those of every other nation, are not allowed to ventilate their grievances in public, or to write to press. I know of one case in which a wrote to the press a story about a boxing bout between two boys in camp. Because of that he was hauled over the coals the military authorities, and reprimanded.",72
318,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Who introduced compulsory military training?,73
319,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I do not care who brought it in-it was a mistake. I supported it once. Under the leadership of the right honourable member for Worth Sydney (Mr Hughes), and moved by his eloquence, I was at one time an ardent supporter of compulsory military training. I once attended a meeting on the Yarra Bank addressed by Harry Holland, now the leader of the Labour party in New Zealand. I listened to his analysis of our military system, and I defended that system against him. I found afterwards, however, that he knew a great deal more about its abuses than I did. Eventually he had to leave this country, because he refused to allow his son to come under the domination of the military caste. No country has ever yet prevented, nor ever will prevent, a war taking place by building up what are called defence forces. Every nation says that it is arming only for defence, and yet the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) tells us that he does not want to defend Australia on its own territory. He does not want a ""scrap"" in this country; but wishes to send our citizens overseas to fight. He twitted the Minister for Defence (Mr A. Green) for his statement that it would take six months to - land an effective army of invasion in Australia, and that in the meantime it would be possible to train forces to it. I hope, with the help of this Parliament and the people of this country, to prevent the sending of our citizens to fight outside Australia. With the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) I hope that we shall spend sufficient money in peace propaganda to make impossible a recurrence of a bloody and Ausbrutal war such as that which recently mankind. Can honourable members conceive the cost of the last war to the nations which participated in it ? An the American has compiled a pamphlet-in lad which he has attempted to set out some of the things that could have been done in the way of social service with the by money which the last war cost. He saysI could build a school in every hamlet of ten persons, a church on every hilltop, a hospital for every 10,000 inhabitants, a university for every town of 100,000 inhabitants, a home costing not less than £1,000 for every adult male in all the belligerent countries, and we could provide a motor car costing not less than £500 for every family. Wit h the residue of the money invested at 5 per cent., I could endow all the institutions to make them independent of government aid or public subscription. That was the cost of the last war, and what did we get out of it?-the dead, the sorrowing, the maimed and the afflicted, and, in addition, a legacy of debt. What is hampering this country today, and arresting our economic development, is the interest burden imposed on us in consequence of the last war.",73
320,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Who committed Australia to the war-to the last man and the last shilling?,73
321,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Mr Fisher must answer for his own sins. I refuse to accept the responsibility. From the day when war was declared I opposed it. I opposed war then, and I oppose it still. As a result of the march of events I am convinced that I was right. If all the citizens of every belligerent nation had taken up the same attitude we should have saved the world a hell of misery. Mr D. CAMERON - Does the honourable member think that it is not necessary to make any preparation for the defence of this country?",73
322,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I do not think military forces are necessary. We can rely upon moral force. This resist House is ruled by moral force, and not by violence. Does the honourable member think that he is the only peaceably disposed person in the community? Does he wish to go and kill anybody else? If he is not disposed to march across the frontier and take the lives of his fellow men, why should he not think that they are disposed to leave him in peace? I shall say this for the honourable member, that he made the most temperate speech on this subject which I have heard, with the exception of .that delivered by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch). It was entirely at variance with those of some other honourable members who have had military experience, and who have tried to bait honourable members on this side for the convictions they expressed. The preparations which such honourable members are so fond of advocating did not prevent the last war, and will hot prevent another. Since the nations, according to Mr Lloyd George, drifted into the war without any desire of their own, I am not prepared to entrust to such palsied hands the fate of thousands, since they might again easily allow the country to drift into another bloody holocaust. I believe all the nations should disarm. A sentiment for peace is growing throughout the world, and I shall do my best to cultivate it. Possibly I am not the most peaceful exponent of the doctrine of peace. I admit that I am irascible, and apt to become heated, but I am earnest and sincere. I have people near and dear to me, and I should not like to see them witness another such war or be involved in one. I believe the risk of another war is far greater when the nations are armed. If we examine the history of the human race in regard to past wars, we shall find that kings have sent men to their doom for a smile from their mistresses. Nations have been plunged into war for the satisfaction of private ambitions or personal quarrels. Is there anything to he proud of in the record of the last war ? It was indignantly repudiated that it was a trade war, but everything indicates that it was that and nothing else. That there was some moral justification for Britain's entry into the war in defence of a treaty of peace cannot be denied, but it should be remembered that France and Russia would not have embarked on hostilities hut for the admitted fact that Britain had, in consultation with those countries, planned military strategy, and decided upon the position which they should occupy in the event of an outbreak of war between France and Germany. Are we to entrust to persons such as were responsible for Mr Lewis. that arrangement, the destiny of nations, and the peace of the world? I hope that neither prince nor cabinet, apart from the people themselves, will be trusted with the responsibility of declaring war. If the people are unarmed, we shall be far more secure than if they are armed to the teeth. Challenge breeds challenge, and so the nations go on piling up armaments upon armaments. More will be achieved in the direction of peace by disarming than by continuing our military preparations. At one time it was considered that the honour of the individual could be satisfied only by fighting a duel. That practice has long since passed away, except in a few isolated places in Europe. At one time duels were fought between the representatives of opposing political parties in the Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland. Are those countries any worse off because duelling has been suppressed, as it has been in most countries of the world? What we have done in this direction in civil life, I believe we can do in the sphere of international relations. Since I have been a member of this House, I have listened to only one speech from the other side of the House with pleasure, edification and profit. That was the speech delivered by the honourable  who gave the House a temperate, reasoned and unimpassioned address. I am pleased to pay this tribute to him, and I shall always be prepared, whenever he makes a speech, to listen to him with attention and appreciation. To most of the speeches which I have heard from the Opposition side of the House, I can apply the epitomised description, once recorded of an impassioned speech delivered in the House"" of CommonsWhat has been Baid that is true is not new, and what has been that is new is not true.",73
323,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Lilley) [9.15] - The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis) has made a somewhat eloquent and forcible speech, but he is very sadly astray in regard to many of his facts. I am inclined to think that honourable members who sit opposite will have difficulty in explaining away some of his remarks, and probably, when he sees them in cold print, he will regret having made them. He was particularly unfortunate with his allegation that the workers of Australia are oppressed. He ought to know that ahout 95 per cent, of the adults in the Commonwealth are workers. It is absurd to say that they could be oppressed by the remaining 5 per cent. I was also interested in his reference to the State of Queensland, and am glad to know that he holds such a high opinion of its possibilities. Apparently, however, he has confined his reading to works by Labour on the Nationalist Government. I suggest that he read the views of the Nationalists on the Labour Government. I further remind him that, within the last few months, there has been an election in Queensland, and the people of that State were so little impressed with Labour administration, that they returned another government, with a very large majority. I congratulate the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), upon having been Leader of the Labour party when the people of Australia decided that there should be a change of government. Durdo ing the time that the honourable member was Leader of the Opposition, he earned for duplication. the respect and esteem of his opponents, who always admired his conscientiousness and sincerity. I trust that, while he Prime Minister, he will be blessed with health that will enable him to carry out the important duties of that high and honourable office. I cannot conceive how the Government can be gratified at the result of the recent general election, as some of its supporters would lead us to believe is the case. is true that the Prime Minister has an overwhelming majority behind"" him; the Government must feel keenly the humiliation of .being in a minority in the Parliament as a whole. It is some consolation to members of the Opposian tion that, while the Labour party has the responsibility of government, it will be helpless to interfere to any serious extent with the constructive programme that has been carried out during the last six years.",74
324,Mr LACET,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The people of Australia did not think it was constructive.,75
325,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"They were grievously misled by Labour propaganda, which did not contain a great amount of truth.",75
326,Mr RIOBDAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Canno t a similar remark.be made about Queensland? "" Mr MACKAY - The honourable member is well acquainted with Queensland. I challenge him to compare the propaganda of the two parties in the recent elections. I wish to relate - one or two of the accomplishments of the late Government. The public debts of Australia were consolidated, permanent sinking funds were established, and the centralized management of government borrowing was instituted. These changes strengthened the confidence of our creditors, both at home and abroad. There has been a greater measure of co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth, with a consequent avoidance of duplication in the public services. The other day, I asked the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Blakeley) whether it would be possible to extend the existing measure of co-operation in connection with our electoral rolls; and I hope that during the recess he will whatever he can to bring into line those States which are now responsible During the regime of the late Government there was a fuller realization of is ..our dependence upon our primary and secondary industries. Our resources have been develoDed and our Droducts marketed on an orderly basis. Science has been applied to the problems of our industries, which have been organized along the lines of co-operative effort: On this foundation the late Government hoped It to build so that Australia might make the progress that her wonderful resources but warrant. A necessary preliminary to that desirable condition, however, is the existence of friendly relations between the two partners in industry; and it was in honest and sincere attempt to bring that about that the Government was defeated. But the necessity for the display of a better spirit and a greater measure of co-operation between employer and employee still exists; it has not been altered by the defeat of the last Government. The present Government will need to direct its efforts towards securing an improvement in that direction. After a great deal of misrepresentation, the electors were persuaded to vote heavily against the late Government, because it advanced proposals for the removal of dual control in industrial regulation. Honourable members opposite are mistaken if they imagine that the policy of socialism received an endorsement. The Government was given an exceedingly limited mandate. The late Government was challenged to appeal to the electors on a single issue; and that fact was emphasized by practically every candidate in his speeches to the electors. Even the Leader of the Labour Party, the present Prime Minister, admitted it. His policy speech contains the following paragraphThe issue upon which Parliament was dissolved was whether the people should be consulted before federal arbitration was destroyed. Parliament insisted that this great wrong should not be done behind the back of the people, and the main question to be determined on 12th October, was whether the people believed in the maintenance of federal arbitration or not, whether they believed with the Government that the National Parliament should shirk its responsibility for the legal - regulation of industrial conditions to enable industrial disputes to be determined by tribunals rather than by. direct action. The late Government might have continued in office for a further two years if it had decided that the challenge which was issued on the floor of this chamber was of so little importance that it ought to be ignored, because twelve months previously it had been returned with a very large majority. Some supporters of both the National party and the Country party outside of this Parliament consider that a mistako was made in going to the country; but the action then taken illustrated the high-mindedness of the late Prime Minister and his desire to do the right thing regardless of party advantage.  ber consulted?",75
327,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"At meetings of the Nationalist party its members are always taken into the confidence of their leader. The verdict of the electors was a complete contradiction of their previous attitude. It will be remembered that on no fewer than four occasions, previously, they were appealed to by way of referendum-by the Fisher Labour Government on two occasions, by the Hughes National Government, and in 1926 by the Bruce Page Government-and on each occasion they declined to extend the industrial powers of the Commonwealth; yet, when the late Government attempted to rectify the position in a way that it considered would meet the wishes of the people, by handing over to the States full power to regulate industry, the people again registered their disapprobation. But this is not the time to invent excuses nor to ""express regrets. We who now sit on this side desire to assist the Government in every way to build up a better Australia and to improve the economic position. The Government is expected to make an attempt to unravel the tangle that our industrial legislation is in at the present time; and I am pleased that the Prime Minister recently announced his intention to convene a peace conference of employers and employees. I sincerely hope that the Government has not gone cold on that proposal on account of the fact that objections to it have been raised in one or two quarters. I notice in the Sydney Morning Herald of a recent date that a meeting of the Sydney branch of the Carpenters Union expressed uncompromising hostility to the proposed conference. The report statesA recent meeting of the Sydney branch of the Carpenters Union expressed uncompromising hostility to the proposed industrial peace conference convened by the Prime Minister, Mr Scullin. The decision of the Federal Government was described as an act of treachery against the working class. It was condemned on the ground that the suggested conference would assist the employing class in smashing the militancy of the organized workers. For the reason that objections are being raised the Government should not refrain from proceeding with the conference. It will be remembered that the late Prime Minister calle'd a similar - conference. I believe that some good would have been accomplished on that occasion but for the fact that the Australian Workers Union decided not to participate in it. This Government is in a position to make the proposed conference a success.",76
328,Mr MARTENS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The late Government should have had the conference before it passed its industrial legislation.,76
329,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The late Prime Minister provided means for holding the conference. He was prepared to stand down and allow the employers and the workers to discuss these matters privately. On no fewer than four occasions the late Government endeavoured to bring about peace in industry. Having regard to the expensive Commonwealth and State systems of industrial arbitration, the continuance of the coal strike for nine months is most distressing. I realise the delicate situation in the industry today, but I hope that the Government will stand up to its responsibilities and do what it can to encourage industrial peace. If it will carry out its promise to promote friendly relations between employer and employee, and thus enable us to proceed on sound lines with the development of our industries, great benefit will be conferred on the people of Australia. Unfortunately, the extremists of the Labour party welcome the confusion and distrust that are caused by industrial turmoil. They seem to delight in fanning the fires of class hatred, and make no secret of their desire to promote disruption. In dealing with these fomenters of strife the political leaders of labour do not show .that courage which is necessary. majority of honourable members supporting the Government are moderate men, but they appear to fear the extremists.",76
330,Mr WATKINS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Are not extremists to be found on the other side?,77
331,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"There are extremists on both sides, the conservatives on one side, and the communists on the other. But there is no need for any political party to pander to either section, for the great majority of the people are moderates. The duty of every political party is to do what is in the interests of the majority. By some agitators every hold-up of industry is regarded as a step towards nationalization. The honourable member for Corio- (Mr Lewis) is optimistic regarding what the Labour party may accomplish by such a policy, which, however, has been discredited in every State of the Commonwealth. He expressed pride in what has been accomplished in that direction by the Labour party in Queensland, but the Auditor General's reports show that the State enterprises have been dismal failures. I hope that the present Government will profit by the bitter experiences of the past.",77
332,Mr KIORDAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Quot e one report in which the Auditor-General condemns State enterprises.,77
333,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I refer the honourable member to any report made by the Auditor-General within the last ten years. Private enterprise is not all that it should be, but until we can find a better economic system we should endeavour to improve that which we have, rather than experiment with the communistic doctrines that are in operation in Soviet Russia. The present Government has an opportunity to bring about peace in industry, and I commend to the notice of the Prime Minister the statement of his predecessor after his defeat at the last election. Mr Bruce said in his personal message to the people of Australia The prosperity and happiness of the people are of paramount concern. Only by bringing about better relations in industry, and simplifying the method of its control and regulation can increased output and cheaper production, concurrently with the maintenance of wages and the standard of living, be obtained, and The only thus can prosperity in industry and permanent relief from the distress and suffering caused by unemployment be ensured. Those are wise words which are free from any political motive, and the present Government might, with advantage, pay heed to them. We all recognize that trade unions serve a useful purpose, and we are proud of the fact that so many of our workers are organized for the betterment of their conditions. They are justified in trying to get higher wages and improved conditions, and so raise the standard of living. But under the present economic system capital also has responsibilities, and profits are necessary in order that wages may be paid, plants improved, and production increased. There is no reason why capital and labour should not work harmoniously together to their mutual advantage. During the last election campaign we were told on every hand that the proposals of the last Government were designed to reduce wages. Nothing could have been further from the truth, and honourable members of the ministerial party do not seriously believe that that was intended. They have a sufficient knowledge of economics to understand the difference between a nominal wage and an effective wage. Mr Bruce frequently spoke about the high cost of production, but it is untrue that he suggested a reduction of wages. Greater co-operation between employers and workers is necessary so that production may he increased. Then wages will increase and the standard of living will improve. A new spirit of goodwill in industry is very necessary, and honourable members opposite, instead of making political capital of this debate, would be better engaged in advocating co-operation and harmonious relations between capital and labour. Mr Bruce will be best remembered for his efforts to create a better feeling in industry. He spoke often on the subject and the sending of an industrial commission to America and the convening of an industrial peace conference were directed to the one end of increasing and cheapening production, while protecting and advancing the standard of living. The present Government has an admirable opportunity to continue that work. Ministers enjoy the confidence of unionists, and if the Prime Minister and his colleagues are sincere in their proposals for a peace conference, they can bring it to fruition by using their influence with the various unions. I admit that the Government has a gigantic task. The economic position is unsatisfactory, and the finances require careful handling. I suggest that all the brains are not to be found in Parliament. Some of the new members have already given a good account of themselves, and we may expect wise counsel from them from time to time. But the Treasurer should not hesitate to call to his aid commercial men of large experience, and to act on their advice. During the election campaign the Prime Minister talked much of economy, whilst at the same time making many promises which would enormously increase Commonwealth expenditure. This is not the time to try out doubtful experiments. The honourable gentleman said that his Government would not introduce revolutionary changes, and if he will stand by that promise, honourable members of the Opposition will be ready to help him in every way possible. The present economic and financial condition of Australia demands that party considerations shall be subordinated to the imperative need for the Mr Mackay. co-operation of all parties in order to bring about an improvement. If there is one political principle in regard to which the people are unanimous it is the maintenance of a White Australia. But we must realise that that policy is regarded by other nations as provocative. Those living in over-populated countries view with resentment the reservation of this continent for the exclusive use of a comparative handful of people, and this is certainly not a time for the weakening of the national defences. The first administrative act of the Government was the suspension of compulsory military training; and the only excuse offered for that step was the need for economy. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) have shown convincingly that there is no likelihood of saving money by the adoption of the voluntary system, and we are justified in assuming that the Government abandoned compulsory training as a concession to the extremists in the Labour movement. I am informed that the Minister for Defence proposes to attract possible recruits by new and attractive uniforms. Surely there is no economy in issuing new and more expensive uniforms while probably 50,000 of the present pattern are in the departmental stores. If Ministers were candid they would admit that they have taken this course merely because it is one of the planks of the Labour party's platform. I do not think that the people believed at the last election that this action would be taken without reference to Parliament. The wise course would have been to do nothing until a suitable scheme had been drawn up to replace the present system. Since the defence system is to be seriously interfered with, we realise that the need for economy is not the only aspect from which it has been considered. In my opinion the Government has also blundered in asking the British Government to suspend the assisted passages clause of the £34,000,000 migration agreement, without first consulting the States.",77
334,Mr WATKINS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The honourable member has been speaking of economy.,78
335,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Yes ; but I am also considering the need to fill the empty spaces of Australia. Surely the parties to this agreement should have been consulted. The Government has interfered with the rights of the States.  bring migrants to this country while we have so many unemployed here ?,78
336,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"No"" ; but I point out that the nomination of migrants falls within the province of the State Governments, which are fully responsible for the care of the migrants on their arrival. The honourable member for Gippsland  scheme is of great benefit to the States, because it enables them to carry out works that provide employment and, at the same time, develop Australia's resources. I recently asked the Prime Minister for particulars of the sums to be expended in the various States, and the nature of the work to be done, in terms of the migration agreement. The reply that I received showed that the expenditure approved amounted to £2,082,437 in Western Australia, £1,369,000 in Victoria, £938,250' in South Australia, £30.000 in Queensland, and £1,521,600 in New South Wales, or a total of £5,941,287. This money is to be used for land settlement, railway construction, water conservation, irrigation and other public works. It was discourtesy on the part of the Commonwealth Government to take any action in the direction of suspending that agreement without consulting the StateSj which have already been told by the Prime Minister that they are responsible for the provision of work for the unemployed. The proper course to pursue was to call a conference with the States and ask for their advice. The decision of this Government does not prevent the States from continuing their migration policy. I realise that Australia should ease down on migration until the economic position improves; but the Commonwealth Government might reasonably have devoted its energies to improving the industrial relations of the people, thereby bringing about a revival of trade that would provide for a progressive increase in population. If development is to proceed, we must open further avenues of employment; but we can only do this by inducing capitalists to invest their money here, and thus increase production. This means that the high cost of production must be reduced. Under the present circumstances, investments are discouraged. We had an illustration recently of the fact that the manufacturers in Australia are being forced to leave the country. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Forde) tabled today a second tariff schedule, which imposes increased duties on imports. He said that the object of the increased duties was to provide employment for the workless in Australia. If they would do that we should all commend his action, and probably say that the end justifies the means. But it must be realized that, owing to the high cost of production, less than 5 per cent, of Australia's manufactures is exported. We read quite recently in the press that the firm of H . V. MCKay Limited, of the Sunshine implement works, had been compelled to establish a factory in Canada in order to recover its lost export trade.",79
337,Mr WATKINS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Hav e not other firms in Australia been forced to take similar action ?,79
338,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"That may be so; but it is a sad commentary on manufacturing in Australia, that our factories should be compelled to transfer a portion of their .gross activities to other countries.",79
339,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Is it not perfectly natural that H . V. MCKay Limited should establish a branch in Canada in order to obtain Canadian trade?,79
340,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The Acting Minister looks innocent, but he cannot expect honourable members on this side to accept that suggestion.",79
341,Mr FORDE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I had an interview with Mr MCKay, and I know that what the honourable member is saying is absurd.",79
342,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The following paragraph appeared in the press regarding this matter:Arrangements have been completed by Messrs. H. V. MCKay Proprietary Limited, agricultural implement makers, of Sunshine, Victoria, for the establishment of a manufacturing business in Canada, with a view to regaining the valuable trade which the company once did with the Argentine. This is one of the few Australian manufacturing enterprises which has been able to develop, in the face of severe competition, an export business. That trade, mainly with the Argentine, was lost during the war, and the high labour costs ruling in Australia, combined with restrictive industrial legislation and strikes, have since effectively operated to prevent the company from recovering the strong position it once held in that market. Hence the decision to manufacture where such conditions do not prevail. It is understood that the Canadian plant will provide employment for 1,500 men. That statement more than anything else, should bring home to the Government the necessity to face the position squarely, and consider effective rather than nominal wages. It is possible that, when this company has established its branch in Canada, it may decide to transfer the whole of its operations to that country. That would be a calamity, and I hope that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs will look into the matter. If he has the information that he suggests is in his possession, I am sure that the committee would welcome it.",79
343,Mr MCNEILL,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,There is no danger of MCKay's leaving Australia.,80
344,Mr MACKAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Probably they will maintain their works in Victoria; but it would be much better if they carried on the whole of their operations in Australia. I make bold to say that we need an Australian-wide reduction in the cost of production that would bring about a complete transformation of the industrial and financial position. It would mean the absorption of employment in useful directions, and it would enable us to maintain a progressive increase in our population. The policy of the Bruce-Page Government was being developed along those lines, when it was proposed to remove the dual control of industry. It is intended by the present Government to increase taxation. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), have dealt exhaustively with this subject. It seems to me to be a matter for deep regret that industry is to be further penalized, because the Government at the last election permitted itself to oppose the proposed tax on luxuries and amusements. When the people have had time to consider fully the effect of this decision, they will realise that they have blundered badly in voting the Labour party into office, because it has shown utter disregard for the problem of the high cost of living. The Treasurer (Mr Theodore) has said repeatedly that the producer pays and the worker suffers. Naturally, industries must pass on increased taxes by raising the prices of their products. While it may be regarded by honourable members opposite as a fine stroke of policy to place heavy burdens on industry, these must necessarily be borne by the consumers. I know that it is necessary for the Government to balance the ledger; but I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it would have been much better if the Treasurer had utilized for this purpose the £1,200,000 received from expropriated German properties. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton) is proceeding to Great Britain, and he hopes to induce its people to buy more Australian products than they have purchased in the past. When the Minister arrives in Great Britain he will probably be told that his Government can have very little faith in Australia, because it has abolished compulsory military training and suspended assisted migration. He will also be asked to explain why tariff schedules have been introduced which must have the effect of keeping British manufactures out of Australia. I hope that, during the recess, the members of the Government will get over the feeling of novelty they must be experiencing at being responsible for the administration of the affairs of the country, and that they will introduce proposals which will be really effective for the development of Australia.",80
345,Mr NELSON,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Northern Territory) [10.1] - I participate in this debate with mixed feelings. From the point of view of my constituency, this budget is "" the worse ever."" There is not a glimmer of hope in it for North or Central Australia. The Government, apparently, has no intention whatever of grappling in the near future with the tremendous problems which my constituents are facing. I realise that the finances of the country are in a chaotic condition. I realise, also, that there is a good deal of unemployment in the States. But this is the responsibility of the States more than of the Commonwealth, whereas the obligation to do something for North and Central Australia rests entirely upon this Government. It is 69 years since the indomitable Stuart first blazed the track across Central. Australia. Several attempts had been made previously . to lift the veil of mystery which shrouded the interior of this extraordinary continent; but it was left for Stuart to cross Australia from south to north. Ever since that time efforts have been made to get successive governments to put into operation an effective developmental policy for this huge area. But I am becoming convinced that we have lost the true colonizing spirit. after year duties have been imposed to protect this industry and that, and bounties paid to establish numerous manufacturing concerns in the southern States; but the interests of North and Central Australia have been totally neglected. The first effort of Great Britain at colonization was a dismal failure. It will be remembered that the Mother Country established a number of settlers in the vast continent of America, and called the settlement Virginia. pioneers were set up on farms, and then left to their own devices. The Government of the day neglected to provide them with means of transport and other necessary conveniences. The result was that, in many cases, the settlers perished, and in almost every other case failed to make a success of their holdings. On the other hand, the Spaniards colonized the island of Hispaniola with remarkable success. Unlike Great Britain, they provided their colonists with means of transport and other essentials to development. The world at that time watched with interest the success of Spain and the failure of Great Britain. The Spaniards were not better colonists than the British, but their Government had sense enough to afford them the necessary facilities for developing the new land in which they had settled. Hitherto the people settled in North and Central Australia have not been able to make much progress, because they have been denied means of transport and other necessary assistance. I know that a good deal of distress and misery exists in the southern States because of the prevalent unemployment; but these people are to some extent under the eyes of the politicians, and something has been done to relieve them. But the unfortunate pioneers whom I represent are far removed from the centres of population, and so. have been totally neglected. I had hoped that this Government would do something for them, but my hopes have been dashed to the ground. The Government appears to be ignorant of the fact that it is its particular responsibility to look after the well-being of these people. Even at this late hour I appeal to the Ministry to take a broad national view of Year the situation. I sincerely hope that the Government will avoid the mistake of other administrations, which, time after time, began public works in North and Central Australia and discontinued them because of financial difficulties. In some cases these undertakings have cost more than £30,000 above what they should have cost, because of the interruptions that occurred in the operations. One result of this intermittent works policy is that this huge territory has been burdened very heavily with interest charges which 'it should not have been called upon to These bear. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) said the other day that the best defence Australia could have was the settlement of her empty spaces. I regret that he has not been able to impress this view upon the Government. I was amazed a few days ago to hear an announcement on behalf of the Government that unemployed persons in North and Central Australia would be brought down to the southern States af the expense of"" the Government, and placed upon the already overcrowded unemployed market here. It is deplorable that the Government should adopt such a policy. I say frankly and fearlessly that if this is the best the Government can do for the territory that I represent the sooner it hands it back to the Crown the better. The settlers there would be able to do better for themselves than this Government or the immediately preceding Governments have been able to do for them. The Director of Agriculture of North Australia recently discussed with the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Blakeley) the agricultural problems of that territory. He was able to show clearly that the return per acre from the farms in North Australia was considerable and encouraging, but it is of little use for the people to produce commodities which cannot be transported to market. It should be the first duty of this Government to provide proper transport facilities for these ""unfortunate and neglected settlers. Let me contrast the lot of the residents in North and Central Australia with that of the people of the Federal Capital Territory. I know very well that there is a good deal of poverty and misery here, but those concerned are under the eye of the Ministry, and in response to their constant appeals have been granted some relief. ""We have been informed that a works policy is to be put into operation to relieve their distress. But the people in the far north and in the "" dead heart"" of Australia are unable to make personal representations to the Government and are not seen by the politicians; consequently, not a penny has been provided on the Estimates to relieve their distress. I sincerely trust that before, Christmas the Government will announce that these unfortunate citizens will be treated with at least as much consideration as those of the Federal Capital Territory. Progress reported. BANKRUPTCY BILL (No. 2). Bill, by leave, brought up by Mr. BRENNAN and read a first time. SECOND READING.",80
346,Mr BRENDAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Batman-Attorney General) [10.15] - by Zeawe- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The necessity for this measure arises out of a recent judgment of the High Court in the case of Le Mesurier versus the ""West Australian Trustee Executor and Agency Company Ltd., the executor of Connor. In this case the appellant had been served with a notice purporting to have been issued out of the Court of Bankruptcy, district of Western Australia. That State has been declared a bankruptcy district by proclamation under section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act 1924-28 and under section 18 of that act the Supreme Court of Western Australia was authorized to exercise jurisdiction in bankruptcy. Objection was taken that the notice was issued by a person who assumed to be Registrar in Bankruptcy and had been appointed as under an arrangement made under section 78 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, to execute the duties of Registrar in Bankruptcy in the district of Western Australia. It was contended that the person issuing the notice did not hold the office of Registrar in Bankruptcy created by section 12 of the act, and that the Bankruptcy Act purports to make the Registrar in Bankruptcy part of the organization of the court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy, although it was a State court. The High Court held that the action taken under section 18 of the Bankruptcy Act to authorize a State court to exercise jurisdiction in bankruptcy, did not amount to an investment of the State court with federal jurisdiction within-the meaning of section 77 (iii) of the Constitution and that the section does not enable the Parliament to make a Commonwealth officer a functionary of a State court and authorize him to act on its behalf and administer part of its jurisdiction. The High Court accordingly held that sections 12 (5), 23 and 24 of the Bankruptcy Act are nugatory in relation to the courts of the States and the person appointed to execute the office of Registrar in the district of Western Australia had no authority to issue the bankruptcy notice. The decision of the court has a far-reaching effect upon the operation of the Bankruptcy Act throughout the Commonwealth, in view of the fact that what has been regarded as the effectual vesting of State courts with federal jurisdiction has been declared to be of no effect. This measure is designed to remedy defects in the Bankruptcy Act which have been disclosed by the judgment to which I have referred. It is of the highest importance that the measure should be passed into law without delay, inasmuch as the Commonwealth act is now, by reason of the recent judgment of the High Court, ineffectual in certain essential particulars. I propose to introduce in clause 7 of the bill a slight amendment which I shall explain when we reach the committee stage.",82
347,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Kooyong) [10.20] - ! agree that this bill is not only a desirable, but also a necessary measure. The . decision in the case to which the Attorney General has referred was-given yesterday. It was a case in which I , as' Attorney-General, authorized the interven- 1 tion of the Commonwealth for the purpose of presenting certain considerations to the court in respect of the act as originally drafted by my predecessor, as Attorney-General, in 1924. The decision of the court was by a majority of three judges to two, and this Parliament must necessarily regard itself as bound by that decision. The majority determined two points. Section 77 (i i i ) of the Constitution provides that this Parliament may make laws investing any court of the State with federal jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Act 1924, section 18, purported to do that, by providing that the coui'ts, having jurisdiction in bankruptcy, shall be (a) such Federal Courts, if any, as the Parliament creates to be Courts of Bankruptcy, and (b) such State Court or Courts of a territory as are specially authorized by the Governor General by proclamation to exercise that jurisdiction. No federal courts have been created, and, instead, this Parliament agreed to the authorizing of State courts to act as courts of bankruptcy. Accordingly, certain courts in the several States have been authorized by the Governor General by proclamation to act as courts of bankruptcy. In the case of Le Mesurier, the majority of the High Court held that the courts to be vested with federal jurisdiction should be specifically identified in the Bankruptcy Act. That has never been the view upon which this Parliament has acted. Under the Judiciary Act of 1903, section 39, all State courts are vested with federal jurisdiction in certain matters, without any identification of the courts, and it has always been considered that that section is perfectly valid. Indeed, it is under that section that the courts of the States have been operating ever since the act was passed. In at least in relation to bankruptcy, the courts must be identified in the act, and should not be left to be identified by proclamation by 1jhe Governor General. Accordingly, clause 4 of the bill expressly provides that certain named State courts shall be vested with federal jurisdiction in bankruptcy. These courts are, in fact, the courts which have been exercising jurisdiction under a proclamation by the Governor General. The effect of that clause is, therefore, simply to make the act effective in accordance with the intention of Parliament. The other provision of the bill is that to which the Attorney-General devoted most attention. It deals with the position of the registrars heretofore appointed, and makes their powers relate back to the commencement of the operation of the act. The high Court has held that it is beyond the power of this Parliament to provide that a Commonwealth official shall be attached to a State court vested with federal jurisdiction, as a functionary of that court. There, again, there is a division of opinion in the High Court, but this Parliament must accept the decision of the majority. There is, as the Attorney General has said, a small amendment which, I think, it is desirable to introduce into elause 7 of the bill, so as to make the position certain. The only object of the bill is to give immediate effect to the clear intention of Parliament. This bill is founded upon a draft which I , when Attorney-General, had partly prepared in anticipation of this possibility, and I have no objection to offer to its immediate passage into law.",82
348,Mr GROUCH,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Does not the honourable member think that it would be wise to include the Supreme Courts of South Australia and Victoria, in addition to the Courts of Insolvency?",83
349,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The Court of Insolvency in Victoria is acting as the Court of Bankruptcy by arrangement with the Government of that State. I endeavoured when Attorney-General, to arrange for that jurisdiction to be vested in the Supreme Court. I have had a long experience as a practitioner in Victoria, and I consider that it would be desirable to have the bankruptcy jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court. It would be much more convenient to all who are concerned in bankruptcy work to have these matters dealt with by the Supreme Court, which is always sitting, rather than experience the difficulty of making appointments with the judges of County courts. The honourable member knows of the inconvenience arising out of the present system. However, that question should, when possible, be settled by arrangement with the State Government. Exactly the same considerations apply in the case of South Australia, except that in that State a special history is attached to this matter. There, hy an arrangement with the Commonwealth Government, the Commissioner in Bankruptcy was specially instituted as a judge of the Court of Insolvency in the State of South Australia to enable him to act as federal judge in bankruptcy. If , in this bill, it were provided that other courts than those now acting were to act in bankruptcy, confusion would inevitably ensue. I suggest that it is wise to leave that question to subsequent negotiations between the Attorney-General of the day and the State Governments concerned. I think that the Attorney-General himself will agree with what I have said on this subject. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 6 agreed to.",83
350,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Before this bill is passed I should like to know what it purports to do, and what effect it will have. Does it protect the bankrupt, the creditor, or whom?",84
351,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,It protects everyone concerned.,84
352,Mr BKENNAN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,It is merely intended to carry out the original intention of Parliament by repairing the altered complexion of the act arising out of the decision of the High Court yesterday.,84
353,Mr LATHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"No one's rights are being prejudiced in any way. Clause 7Any order made or act done by a Registrar before the commencement of this act in pursuance of a power purporting to be delegated to him by the court under section twenty-three of the Principal Act or in pursuance of a power, duty or jurisdiction purporting to be had by him under section twenty-four of the Principal Act shall be as valid and effectual to all intents and purposes and maybe enforced as if it had been made or done in suance of an authority or direction given to him under the Principal Act, as amended by this 'act.",84

355,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Moreton) [10.35] - I wish to preface my remarks on the budget by congratulating the Prime Minister upon his elevation to the office he holds. I regret some of the circumstances attending his elevation to that position, but I shall deal with them later. The honourable gentleman has always had the goodwill of honourable members on both sides of the House, and I hope that while he occupies his present position he will continue to merit tEat goodwill. I promise my assistance towards the passage of any legislation designed to help Australia and her people. The office he has undertaken involves responsibilities, and I hope that pur- he will discharge them faithfully. Unfortunately, a bad start has been made, a start which even the last speaker, a member of the honourable gentleman's own party, felt called upon to criticize. Not upon the last speaker only, of the honourable gentleman's supporters, has fallen the painful duty of criticizing his leader. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), have also criticized the Government. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) said that there was nothing in the budget to help the division he represents. With that I agree. There is nothing in the Government's proposals to relieve unemployment in the Northern Territory beyond an offer to unemployed persons of assistance' to leave the Territory, and come South to swell the number of unemployed already here. The honourable member for the Northern Territory characterized the budget as the worse that had ever been presented. He pointed out that he, as a representa* tive of the workers, had been disillusioned, and I believe with him that the workers and their representatives also will be disillusioned when they examine this budget. Its main provision, he said, was for extravagant administration. Anyone who studies the budgets presented by the last Government must agree that none of those charges could be laid against that. Not only have the members of the Government party to whom I have referred criticized the budget, but it has been characterized by the press of Australia, without exception, as being wholly bad. It has been properly pointed out by speakers in this House, and by the press, that the super-tax .of 80 per cent, on company profits is calculated to bring about distress and unemployment, and to increase the cost of living. Industry is already handicapped by the burden of taxation it is called upon to bear, but if it is further taxed to the extent of a 20 per cent, super-tax, business firms will have to curtail expenditure. They will be compelled to pass on the taxation, and this will sweil , the volume of unemployment, increase the cost of living, and make it impossible to develop the country's industries. The Treasurer, when presenting his budget, complained that he had not had sufficient time to reconstruct the budget of the late Treasurer in its entirety, but it seems to me that he had sufficient time to render that document almost unrecognizable. The late Treasurer endeavoured to secure what extra revenue was necessary by taxing luxuries and amusements to the extent of £600,000. He rightly maintained that amusements and luxuries should be called upon to bear their part of the burden of taxation. Most of the extra revenue required was to be collected from the American motion picture interests, other amusements and luxuries, which are not bearing their fair share of taxation. The late Treasurer said that here was a source of revenue which might be tapped to help Australia in its hour of need without affecting prejudicially the essential industries of the country. The American motion picture interests have a monopoly in Australia, and are collecting large profits here each year. They are certainly treating unfairly our suburban and country motion picture proprietors by exacting an undue toll from them. In return, we have been, getting very little from them. Australia has offered them generous support, but they are not prepared to pay their share of taxation. The last Government recognized the needs of industry, and strove to diminish unemployment; framing its taxes in such a way as would' ""interfere least with national development. It is obvious that the present Treasurer prefers to tax the essential industries of the country. By such means he will certainly augment the already very great amount of unemployment. Those who took any interest in the recent election campaign can hold no other view than that the Government has abandoned the taxation of the motion picture in-' terests out of gratitude for the support received from that source during the election campaign. A sum of £600,000 is to be raised by a super tax of 20 per cent, on companies, but the picture interests would have paid that amount if the tax upon them had been allowed to remain. The members of the Government promised on the hustings to reduce taxation and institute economies. In their first budget, however, they propose to increase expenditure by hundreds of thousands of pounds, and taxation by millions of pounds. What is more, practically every new tax introduced by the Treasurer represents a deliberate breach of his election promises. He stated that the workers' beer would not be taxed if a Labour government were elected. said that this scandalous tax would be removed, yet it is still in operation, though reduced in extent. He said that a Labour government would remove the increased tax on tobacco and cigarettes, but far from doing that he has increased it by 50 per cent. The Treasurer proposed to increase the tax from 8d. to Is. a lb. The Treasurer promised, and so did his leader, that what he called a pernicious tax on petrol would be removed, and that they would exempt from taxation petrol used for other than road transport. The budget contains no proposal, nor has any legislation been forecast, to grant this measure of relief. The Treasurer also promised that the tax on petrol would be reduced, but he has increased it. These rash election promises convince me that honourable members opposite did not, in their wildest dreams, ever believe that they would occupy the government benches, and be called upon to honour the promises they made. They promised the people work for all: No one should go without work who wanted it. Yet, - upon a careful examination of the budget we can find no provision in it to supplywork for the workless. So far as provision for public works is concerned, it might be inferred that it was designed for the purpose of increasing unemployment. At a late hour a proposal has been made to utilize money not expended by the last Government, money which was to be used in a comprehensive scheme of road improvement over a period of five ""years. Nothing new has been proposed in this direction-it is only carrying out the late Government's policy. Purther, everywhere in the Public Service complaints are being made against dismissals. Far from finding more work, the Government has launched on a policy of dismissals. Recently a deputation type, readsfrom the Trades Hall made representations in Sydney to the Postmaster General on the subject of the refusal of the department to withdraw notices of dismissal issued to employees. ""When the Government was first returned to power a promise was made that the dismissal notices would be withdrawn, but one of the earliest actions of the Postmaster-General Mr Francis. He after he assumed control of his department was to re-issue the notices. According to a newspaper report, indignation was expressed at the Trades Hall at the refusal of the Postmaster-General to accede to the union's request. It was stated that the men would have received better treatment from Mr Gibson, the late Postmaster-General. One married man with years of service now finds himself out of employment. ""We worked and voted for the return of the Labour Government"" said members of the deputation, "" and all we have got in return is the sack."" I have here a record of the dismissals in the Federal Capital Territory. The returned soldiers, during the election campaign, were promised that in no circumstances would any maimed or disabled soldier be allowed to remain out of work, and they were encouraged to believe that a Labour government would find places for tbem all in the Public Service. Mr Theodore, the present Treasurer, promises in his propaganda that there would be found work in the Public Service for every disabled returned soldier. He saidThe placing in employment of partially disabled returned soldiers is a very hard problem. But for the sympathetic treatment of them by employers it would indeed be almost impossible to solve. These men could all be found positions in the Public Service, doing useful work and thereby distributing responsibility over the whole of the taxpayers; not, as now, leaving it to a very few to carry. This could be done without in any way impairing the efficiency of the Service. One of the earliest utterances of the Prime Minister was that this promise could not be fulfilled. I realise, of course, that it would be difficult to give effect to it. But when elections are won on such promises they should be honoured. Another proposal which the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) placed before the electors in large, bold ANZAC Day:-Preservatio n of ANZAC Day as Australia's national holiday. This Parliament has always stood for ANZAC Day being a public holiday, and the last Government made that provision long ago and the Treasurer knew it . When the present Treasurer was Premier of Queensland he made similar promises, and subsequently left the State without honouring them. Other Labour administrations followed that of which he was the leader and also failed to honour them. It fell to the lot of the present Nationalmanufacturing Country Party administration in Queensland to give executive approval to the keeping of ANZAC Day as a public holiday. [Quorum formed.] A further promise made by supporters of the Government was that free licences would be issued to listeners-in, but since the Government came into power I have not heard of any proposal to give effect to it. Perhaps the most serious misstatement that the present Treasurer made was that if Labour were returned to power the coal mines on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales would be re-opened within a fortnight. I am privileged to represent a very large coal-mining district in Queensland. Practically 66 per cent, of the coal-miners in that State are constituents of 'mine. These men pinned their faith very strongly to the promise of the present Treasurer; but unfortunately, nothing has been accomplished in the direction of ending the suffering that is being caused to the dependents of the miners by this protracted struggle. When the honourable gentleman was asked how he proposed to open the mines, he said that the Commonwealth Parliament had sufficient power to bring about a resumption of work, and that the mere fact that Labour was in office would soon move the owners to open their mines. This Government has been in office for well over two months, and the mines are still closed.. The miners are anxiously waiting for decisive action, but none has been taken beyond the calling of a conference. As a result of his promise, the Treasurer was able to obtain from the suffering miners a contribution of £1,000 towards his election expenses. In today's press appears the statement that a meeting of the Kurri lodges demanded withdrawal from the Australian Labour party and the return of the £1,000 that was subscribed by the miners to fight the elections. They complain bitterly that the Government is not carrying out its definite election promises. The leaders. are called "" Twisters, turn-coats, and wrigglers"". This is a basic industry, which deserves better treatment. I hope that the [42] mines will be opened at a very early date. The dispute is interfering materially with the development of our industries and is one of the principal causes of the unemployment that exists in Australia today. I trust that the Government will acknowledge the wisdom of giving the miners an opportunity, by means of a secret ballot, to say whether they are prepared to accept the proposals put forward as a result of the recent conference. They have been urged to accept them by the Prime Minister himself. When, in the future, political parties make promises of this character, with the object of securing votes, they should show a greater readiness than the present Government has shown to honour them. The people were told that there would be no increase of taxation, yet, even at this early stage, a measure has been brought down to add a further 10 per cent, to the taxation imposed on even a taxable income of £200. The only direction in which the last Government increased its taxation was in regard to the super tax of 10 per cent, imposed on all incomes over £2,000. This Government proposes to add 10 per cent, to the taxation on incomes between £200 and £1,500, 15 per cent, on those between £1,501 and £3,000, and 20 per cent, on those above £3,000. If it had collected the £600,000 which the late Government proposed to take from the American film interests, it would not have been, necessary to impose this excessive taxation, which will hamper industry and increase unemployment. The late Government increased the statutory exemption to £300, reduced taxation by 42 per cent., granted increased allowances in respect of children, and deductions for medical expenses, and allowed the primary producers to deduct amountsspent in the development of their holdings. It also introduced the averaging system. Thus were 550,000 taxpayers entirely taken out of the field of income tax. I could deal with the action of the Government respecting the excellent agreement under which the British Government provides cheap money to assist our development and remove unemployment. I could review its handling of many other problems, and show how little has been done to provide for the development of Australia. But I wish to devote the remainder of the time at my disposal to the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), "" That the item be reduced by £1,"" as an indication of the opinion of this House that the Government has acted wrongly in abolishing compulsory citizen military training without parliamentary authority, and without having organized any alternative system of national defence."" No administrative act should over-ride a statute. The existing system of defence should not be scrapped until another has been prepared to take its place. The Labour Government of which the late Mr Andrew Pisher was Prime Minister made provision in 1910 for compulsory military training, and gave Australia an effective defence system and our citizen forces. In introducing the measure, he referred to the pride which he felt at having been associated with our voluntary system of training. Yet this Government, the ranks of which do not contain one returned soldier, proposes to do away with compulsory military training on the grounds of economy without having any definite system to substitute for it. I quote the following words uttered by the late Mr Andrew Pisher in 1910:- . It is no longer a matter of money, but question of principle. It is now a question whether every citizen of the Commonwealth should not undertake the first duty of citizenship of any country, and be prepared to protect its honour and its interest. There have been three stages in the defence of Australia. In the first place, we were entirely dependent for our protection on the Mother Country. Later we were able to make to Great Britain a contribution towards our naval defence; at the same time we also endeavoured to build up a volunteer army. This proved to be incomplete and unsatisfactory. third stage began in 1909. Compulsory military training was established, and under it were laid the foundations of an Australian military force, which in the recent war was the pride and wonder of the world. The present proposal is both unjust and undemocratic, and for a country that has not a professional army it is inadequate for the requirements of the nation. The defence of Australia is one of the most sacred duties Mr Francis. that have been entrusted to this Parliament. One of the strongest arguments advanced in favour of federation was that it was necessary to have a coordinated and efficient defence system, which was impossible so long as the matter was handled by six States. Yet in this enlightened age the Labour party, yielding to the pressure of extremists, has decided to scrap our defence system. The Government has sought to justify its action on the ground that the system is worthless. The Prime Minister has referred to our compulsory trainess as "" boy conscripts."" If we compare their efficiency with the efficiency of the trainees in 1910, under the voluntary system, we shall find that it is much higher, although the standard required has been raised by 100 per cent. Any defects that may be alleged, against the present system will be intensified a hundredfold under the voluntary system. The Labour party has always stood for compulsory unionism and compulsory contribution to its political funds ;yet it is not prepared to compel the youth of Australia to discharge what the late Mr Andrew Fisher described as the first duty of every citizen. The proposal to abolish compulsory military training is a gesture to satisfy the clamour of the militant union leaders or communists within the party fold. If a Labour remained long in office it would be further compelled by its extremists to do away with all forms of military training.",84
356,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I sincerely hope we shall.,88
357,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The Government has taken the first step to abolish entirely the Australian system of defence.,88
358,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Hear , hear!",88
359,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member spoke at length of the horrors of war and the hardships of compulsory training. The Nobody knows the horrors of war better than those who have experienced them, and the. 300,000 soldiers in the Australian Imperial Force will be the strongest force in this country to prevent Australia from taking part in any unnecessary war. But when the old Labour party introduced in 1910* the system of compulsory military training it did Australia a great service, and when the war broke out it was Mr Fisher, a Labour Prime Minister, who pledged Australia's last man and last shilling for defending ourselves overseas. The legislation which made it possible for Australia to take an effective part in the war was introduced by the Fisher administration. The honourable member for Corio has declared that he would take no part in any war. It is the duty of every loyal citizen to assist in the defence of his country, whilst the honourable member declared himself a pacifist he never loses an opportunity to preach the most bitter class warfare.",88
360,Mr R GREEN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,That is warfare of the tongue. It involves no physical risk.,89
361,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The honourable member for Corio is accustomed to waging war on the Yarra bank. I pay my tribute to the naval and military officers of the Defence Council for having been able to save from the wreckage of our defence system so much of the old organization of the Australian Imperial Force and the wonderful traditions of its battalions and regiments.,89
362,Mr BLAKELEY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Thos e officers agreed to the abolition of compulsory training.,89
363,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"That is not so. understand that that step was taken on the authority of the Prime Minister without reference to the Defence Council, and he has definitely said so, and the achievement of that body in preserving the old units is proof that the abolition of compulsory training was strongly opposed by our great military leaders. No military system based on voluntary enlistment spreads the burden and privileges of the country's defence so equally over the young manhood of the nation as does universal service. Nor does any other method of recruiting make so well for the consolidation of national endeavour, the destruction of class hatred, and the promotion of harmony and goodwill amongst all sections of the community. A voluntary army will be mainly composed of men of leisure and means, and that will certainly develop a military caste, which I would regret to see in this young democracy. The voluntary system is unjust, because it expects a section of our youth to carry burdens and accept obligations that are the proper duty of every able-bodied citizen. It will also entail sacrifices on the part of patriotic employers, and render them liable to unfair competition by less public-spirited rivals. At present the inconvenience of releasing employees to attend camps and parades is shared by all. The Government's new defence proposals will penalize public spirit, and put a premium on selfish disregard of the country's defence. The system of compulsory service was accepted by the Ausbut tralian people for over twenty years, almost without friction or ill-will, until recently, when opposition to it was inflamed by Labour organizers for party political purposes. In the past, voluntary enlistment has failed and proved most costly, and it will he a greater failure in the future, particularly because of the many great counter-attractions of the present day, and the ampler means which youth now has for enjoyment. The ostensible reason for the change is the need for economy; but the Government will have to pay the volunteers more than is received by the compulsory trainees, and the provision of new and more costly uniforms will involve heavy increased expenditure. Even at great cost we have little chance of organizing a volunutary I army as large and efficient as that produced by the compulsory system. Another advantage of compulsory service is the greater opportunity it affords for the proper allocation of - our young manhood to the units in which they can render the most efficient service.",89
364,Mr R GREEN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Tell the committee why the Australian Imperial Force rejected conscription. We did not want the cold-footers who were sheltering behind the Labour party in Australia.,89
365,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member has correctly stated the reason. The modern army is rapidly becoming more mechanical, and requires special and continuous training, which cannot be given to the rapidly changing personnel of a volunteer army.",89
366,Mr MARTENS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,What nation are we to fight?,89
367,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The purpose of our army is to defend Australia. It is worth defending, although apparently honourable members supporting the Government do not think so.",89
368,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"No issue is worth the sacrifice of human life.  quires a corps of officers and non-commissioned officers trained in the handling of large bodies of troops. Such training cannot be had under the Government's proposal, and great difficulty will be experienced in getting senior officers qualified to lead our forces.",89
369,Mr BLAKELEY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Shal l we not have the services of the honourable member for Moreton, the honourable member for Richmond, and the honourable member for Balaclava ?",90
370,Mr FRANCIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"That remark is unworthy of the honourable member. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green), because of his physical disability, is - not likely to serve in another war. If the Government is content to depend on disabled and limbless men to officer the new army, we can imagine the sort of advice that the Governor General must be receiving from his Ministers on this important question. Compulsory service enables a proper index of our manhood to be prepared and ensures its effective utilization. In the Light Horse regiments almost all were voluntary enlistments, and a first class personnel practically makes a complete change in numbers twice in every three years. A Bulgarian publicist recently complained that the voluntary army of 32,000 prescribed for Bulgaria by the Peace Treaty of Nevilly cost about three times as much as an army of similar strength compulsorily trained would have cost. I remind honourable members that in 1910, when the British Empire had a two-power naval standard, the late Lord Kitchener, in his report on the defence of Australia, saidIt is an axiom held by the British ment that the Empire's existence depends marily upon the maintenance of adequate and efficient naval forces. As long as this tion is fulfilled and as long as the British superiority at sea is assured, then it is an accepted principle that no British dominion can be successfully and permanently conquered by an organized invasion from overseas. [Quorum formed.] He further showed that the concentration of force in one theatre of war might be compulsory for the navy; that in other seas British naval forces might remain for a time inferior to those of an enemy, and that some time might elapse before the command of those seas could be assured. Now that Great Britain has to accept a one-power naval standard this possibility is even more - real. Lord Kitchener pointed out that it was our duty to provide a military force adequate to deal promptly with any attempt at invasion until the command of the seas could be assured. I am a great believer in the League of Nations and its future usefulness, and I hope that one day it will be a great factor in maintaining the peace of the world. But those who pin their faith entirely to the League and neglect their defence are not worthy of their heritage. The position of Australia is unique. This outpost in the Pacific, with a coastline of 12,000 miles, amazing resources almost as yet untouched, and a population of only 6,000,000, must be the envy of the world. History has shown that when countries are over-populated, the comforts of life few, and the standard of living low, their peoples are compelled to look for relief in territorial expansion. This condition of affairs has already caused Japan to seek room for some of its surplus population in the United States of America. As we all know, Japan was denied that privilege, but, if America were not so powerful and so well prepared, the great Japanese nation could scarcely have treated the hostile American legislation so philosophically as it has done. America's strength was its safeguard. Australia, with its small population, if undefended, would be in a less fortunate position. Let me briefly examine the conditions in countries immediately adjacent to Australia. Japan and Korea have a population of 78,000,000; China, 437,000,000; Persia, 9,000,000; Arabia, 5,000,000; Madagascar, 3,500,000; India, Govern251,000,000; Siam and Indo-China, pri6,000,000; the Malay States, 3,225,000; condiaud Java, 50,000,000. I am no alarmist, but one must be prepared to face facts. If we are to maintain the White Australia policy we must have an army capable of defending our country. The adequate defence of this great continent cannot be built up in a day. It can be achieved only by a steady progressive policy extending over a period of years. We are the trustees of the generations yet unborn, and we have a sacred duty to ensure the maintenance of an effective and progressive policy of defence. This cannot be done by continually changing our military system, and certainly will never be achieved by purely voluntary enlistment. The compulsorily-trained force was the most efficient army - that Australia ever had. Visiting many camps, I found the young men thoroughly enthusiastic and anxious to become efficient. At no time during the last twenty years have the trainees voiced any objection to the compulsory What is the real cause of the sudden change of policy regarding our defence? The Minister for Defence was reported in the Melbourne Argus of the 26th October last, as having saidNo alteration in routine or policy would be made without careful consideration, and the advice of every responsible officer would come. A definite defence policy has not yet been evolved by the Ministry. For the present, the existing conditions in the department would not be disturbed. . . . The has not discussed the abolition of military training, and it will be months before this question becomes a matter for discussion. When the more pressing problems have been dealt with, we will make a comprehensive review of the defence policy. On the 29th October, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) was reported in the Melbourne Argus as having made the following replyBallarat, Monday - Mr MCGRATH referred to-night to a statement by the new Minister for Defence that the Ministry had not yet given consideration to its policy concerning compulsory military training. Mr MCGRATH said that Mr Green should know well that the abolition of compulsory training had always been ft fundamental plonk in the Labour party's platform, and his statement therefore was certainly ill-advised. Compulsory military training would vanish before Christmas. ' I remind the honourable member for Ballarat that the abolition of compulsory military training was not always a plank of the Labour party's platform; it was only recently included as a result of the activities of political extremists in that party. I object strongly to the Government doing away with that system by an administrative act. This action has been taken regardless of the consequences at the dictation of the extremists within < the Labour party. The amendment will certainly indicate to the people where, the Opposition stands on the matter of compulsory military training. I await with the utmost interest the proposal that the Government has to introduce' to make adequate provision for the defence of Australia. The Labour party today is not even a shadow of the great party that was led by Mr Fisher in 1910, when he gave the young manhood of Australia an opportunity to learn how to defend this country, should that ever be necessary.",90
371,Mr GBEGOBT,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,",Swan) [11.20] - I system. had not intended to speak on this motion, although I am fully in accord with the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham); but, in view of the two tariff schedules that have been introduced, and realizing the possible economic result of the action taken by the Government, I should be failing in my be wel- duty if I did not refer to it. I fully endorse the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson), regarding the vast potentialities Ministry of Northern Australia, and I propose to refer, particularly, to the grave danger that confronts us through failure to populate and develop that great area. Apart from its possibilities in the direction of agricultural and pastoral development, the latent mineral wealth is enormous, but the population there is - smaller today than it was twenty years ago. If the question of our right to. hold that country were ever raised before the League of Nations, how could Australia assert that it was taking steps to populate and develop it? The great change that needs to be brought about there cannot be effected merely by the expenditure of Government money; we must first, alter the economic conditions in that part of Australia. We should allow all goods except luxuries to be admitted free of duty. The ships of the world should be allowed to call there without hindrance for the next 25 years or so, because, at the present time, the trade of Northern Australia is worth nothing to the people in the southern portions of the Commonwealth When industries eventually develop there, the time will be opportune to ask the settlers to abide by the same conditions as those applying to the people in other parts of Australia. The empty spaces of the North constitute one of our greatest dangers from a defence point of view. . I cannot help resenting the pacific utyet terances heard to-night particularly those from the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lewis), who spoke of the horrors of war, but said nothing about the terrors of invasion. What was his attitude during the timber workers' strike, and during the strike of the wharf labourers? Did he then talk of pacific methods?",91
372,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Certainly .,92
373,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I did not think much of his pacific methods when I heard of bombs being thrown and people being injured.,92
374,Mr LAZZARINI,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,You r paid agents threw the bombs.,92
375,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I ask that those words be withdrawn; they are most insulting.,92
376,Mr LAZZABTNI,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I withdraw them. meant, of course, the paid agents of the party opposite to which the honourable member belongs.",92
377,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I rose particularly to object to the tariff schedules tabled by the Government. The five great economists appointed by the late Ministry to report upon economic conditions in Australia must have had prophetic vision, because, at page 99 of the book published by them, they statedA protective policy is especially dangerous, beoause it appeals to the good side of human nature in general, when that human nature is able to judge only by superficialities. We think that the tariff may be likened to a powerful drug with excellent tonic properties, but with reactions on the body politic which make it dangerous in the hands of the unskilled and the uninformed. Honourable members reading those paragraphs now must realise that the members of that committee had some prophetic instinct; they must have foreseen the advent of this administration and the imposition of these huge tariff duties without any knowledge of their effect on industry generally. Personally I am not displeased at. the action of the Government, because I believe the effect of these duties will force the people to realise the seriousness of the position into which Australia is drifting. It is obvious that the schedules were prepared without any sound technical knowledge of their effect on industry, and without any information from the Tariff Board, which was specially created for the purpose of advising not only the Government, but Parliament, as to what tariff duties should be imposed. I am astounded at the information contained in the report of the Economic Advisory Committee as to the cost to Australia of these high protective duties. I find that in the manufacture of electrical apparatus, the excess cost of the goods produced is £660,000, and the salaries and wages paid in the industry total only £793,000. I find also that in blankets and flannel goods, the excess cost due to protection is £468,800, while the wages paid in the industry is only £399,000. In knitting factories, the excess cost of manufactured goods is £1,699,000 and the wages and salaries paid is £1,269,000. [Quorum formed.'] I I do not wish to weary honourable members by reading further from the list. The instances which I have cited prove conclusively that the protection given to many of our secondary industries is far in excess of the actual wages and salaries paid in the respective industries. All these huge tariff increases must necessarily mean an increase in the cost of living and the cost of production. Timber duties have been increased by over 800 per cent, since 1919, and still Australian timber is unable to hold its own. The other night the honourable member for Bass (Mr Guy) spoke of the disaster which had overtaken the timber industry in Tasmania. Can we wonder that it is in difficulties in view of the huge tariff duties which have resulted in higher costs of all forms of production in Australia? It is admitted that we have some of the finest hardwoods in the world, and yet we cannot market them. Only the other day members of the Public Works Committee paid a visit of inspection to a number of houses erected by the Federal Capital Commission, in Canberra, and found that Baltic pine was being used for flooring, and Oregon for lintels, door frames and roof rafters. Not one stick of Australian hardwood is being used in those buildings. Recently also I was in a hostel that was built in Hobart a few years ago lined with ornamental wood work and thought that there, at all events, Australian timber would be used, since Hobart is almost in the heart of the blackwood country. But there again I found that oregon was used almost exclusively. This extraordinary state of affairs is due to the uneconomic conditions in industry as the direct result of Government interference, arbitration awards, and excessively high tariff duties.",92
378,Mr KEANE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Does the honourable member know what wages are paid to our timber workers?,93
379,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I know that some years ago our timber workers were earning good money and were a contented body of men, because the wages they received represented a greater value than the wages of today. Higher tariff duties have increased the cost of timber houses by anything from 50 per cent, to 70 per cent. I am astounded at the carelessness evidenced in the preparation of the new schedules. One importer of clothing informed me that he was asked to pay a duty of £3,000 on £180 worth of material for school childrens' clothing. Most extraordinary duties also have been imposed on imported cotton socks, as well as on foreign matches. We all know also what action has been taken lately by those who control the Sunshine Harvester works at Sunshine, near Melbourne. That concern, which has always enjoyed a solid measure of"" protection, has for many years taken a heavy toll from the farmers of this country. When it found that it could not retain the Argentine connection, which it held prior to 1914, it decided to establish a factory in Canada where there are no irritating industrial restrictions.",93
380,Mr JONES,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The Sunshine people have done very well in Australia.,93
381,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I have not been in agreement with members of my own party in regard to these matters The first essential in Mr MCKay's works is cheap and ample power and his raw materials at the lowest possible prices. Who should be called upon to pay to make it possible for the Sunshine Harvester Works to get iron and steel at a reasonable price. I suggest that the doctor, the lawyer and the politician should have to bear part of the cost. The whole burden should not be allowed to fall upon the primary producer, yet that is what is happening today. We should apply the bounty system to these key industries, and not impose these absurd duties. I would not object to the imposition of moderate duties to assist industries which are being established in Australia. I should not object to a duty of 15 per cent, or 20 per cent. Such duties should, with the natural protection available, enable an industry to establish itself. Men like Sir William Lyne and the Honourable Alfred Deakin were protectionists, but they would never have dreamt of imposing the heavy duties provided in the schedules that have been tabled in this House in recent years; but the evil is that once the manufacturer finds the politicians pliant there is no end to his demands. Canada is a protectionist country which has to carry on her operations in close proximity to the great manufacturing country of America. Here are some of her duties compared with ours for similar itemsCanada - Pi g iron, British 6s. 3d.; foreign, 10s. od. per ton. Angle rods, British 17s. 9d.; foreign, 29s. 2d. Girders and beams, British, 8s. 4d.; foreign, 12s. 6d. Australia - Pi g iron, British, 25s.; foreign, 45s. per ton. Angle rods, British, 80s.: foreign, 130s. Girders and beams, British, 80s.; foreign, 135s. Before the Broken Hill Proprietary Company began manufacturing iron and steel at Newcastle, it informed the Government and the people that it did not desire any assistance by duty or bounty. In those days it was able to buy coal for l is . a ton. Last year, it had to pay 25s. 6d. a ton for it. In 1916, when coal was l is . a ton, every one on the coalfields was fairly well satisfied, but now when it is 25s. 6d. a ton nobody is satisfied. We have set up Arbitration Courts to fix wages in our various industries. Sir John Quick recently went to Western Australia to determine the wages that should be paid to railway men there. What does he know about railway work? Judge Drake-Brockman boarded a locomotive the other day to get some knowledge of an engine driver's work. But how could such a casual acquaintance with a calling fit a man to determine the wages and conditions that should apply to it? Our whole Arbitration Court system is absurd. I asked last session for a return showing the freight charges for carrying merchandise 100 miles, 200 miles, 300 miles and 400 miles in Canada, the United States of America and Australia respectively. I believe that the figures would be astounding. Wages are higher in the United States of America than in Australia. Mr MCKay has made up his miud to establish works in Canada, not because wages are lower there, but because the methods of industrial control that prevail in Australia are so impossible.",93
382,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,That is not what he says.,94
383,Mr CUNNINGHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Mr MCKay not had an industrial dispute in his works for fifteen years.,94
384,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Bu the has been most adversely affected by strikes and lockouts in other callings. In 1914, he was able to export £200,000 worth of machinery to the Argentine. Why is he not able to do that today? It is because of the absurd industrial restrictions which - trevail in Australia. According to the 'Labour Gazette of Canada, a labourer in that country receives 3 dollars 60 cents or a little more than 15s. per day of eight hours. Electricians, building carpenters, joiners, sheet metal workers and tinsmiths get seven dollars a day and chief foremen and plumbers get eight dollars or about 34s., a day. Our wages in Australia are not higher than that. Mr MCKay has been obliged to establish works in Canada because our industrial position is so uncertain and the raw matrials for manufacture are considerably cheaper. In 1926, the time lost in Canada through strikes and lockouts was 296,811 working days, and in Australia it was 1,128,000. The respective figures for 1927 were 165,000 and 1,300,000.",94
385,Mr CUNNINGHAM,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The honourable member does not seem to realise that those figures were compiled on a different basis.,94
386,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I have quoted from the official record for Canada and the official record for Australia.,94
387,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member takes those figures at their face value and does not analyse them. Mr GREG'ORY - Since 1920, Canada, because of its improved methods of administration, has reduced the cost of living by no less than £1 per week, while we in Australia, have, by our expensive system of administration, continually increased the cost of living. That, unfortunately, has had the effect of depreciating the value of the wages paid to the workers. The tariff schedule which was recently tabled in this chamber must undoubtedly further increase the cost of living. Honourable members supporting the Government may think it of great advantage to Australia to pass legislation, the effect of which will be to attract more people from the country to the cities. But is it not a menace to the very existhas ence of Australia to have most of the population of the States situated in the capital cities?",94
388,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The increased use of machinery in country districts has driven the workers to the city.,94
389,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"If we continually increase the cost of production our settlers will' refuse to develop the land. Should low prices rule for this season's wheat, very few farmers will sow crops next year. The wheat industry is one of the greatest assets of Australia. It enables the cities to live! The destruction of that industry would mean disaster to this country. With the exception of Nestle's Milk, leather and one or two other articles, none of our secondary industries export their manufactures. Our youth are as well educated as the youth of any other part of the world. They are robust and willing to Work. I have a wonderful confidence in them and I believe that, if given the opportunity, they will make good. With the type of workman that we have in Australia, our secondary industries should be able to compete in the markets of the world, but, unfortunately, under our present economic conditions, that is impossible.",94
390,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,In the course of time we shall be able to compete with other countries.,94
391,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The boot-making trade of Victoria has been protected by that State for 40 years and by the Commonwealth for nearly 30 years. Yet we hear repeated statements to the effect that a dreadful depression exists in that industry in Melbourne. Up to 1899 awful conditions existed in Victoria under a policy of protection. The development in New South Wales under a free trade policy was remarkable, while in Victoria men and women were sweated and underpaid.",94
392,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Was not that a justification of our industrial laws?,95
393,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Mr Massy Greene, when tabling his famous tariff in 1920, pointed out that it would relieve unemployment and build up great industries which eventually would become self contained. Have we not more unemployment in Australia today than ever before in the history of Australia?",95
394,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,It is due to the war effects.,95
395,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,It is due to the incompetency of this Parliament.,95
396,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,The honourable member is absolutely hopeless.,95
397,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"The honourable member should realise that we must have wealth, and that wealth comes from the soil, the mines, the farms, - the pastoral areas and the timber areas.",95
398,Mr LEWIS,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,Wealt h has many forms.,95
399,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Undoubtedly , but I am referring to basic wealth, and unless wealth is created we cannot maintain good conditions for our people. As honourable members know, I have for some considerable time disagreed with the financial policy of the Commonwealth. Australia is suffering a severe depression and some honourable members have suggested that the only remedy is to borrow more money. Let me tell them that we have been borrowing money too extensively of recent years. In the last four years we have borrowed over £140,000,000. Altogether, we owe about £1,100,000,000 and unless we set our house in order we shall soon be on the verge of bankruptcy. We must give more encouragement to the man on the land, and this can only be done by reducing the cost of production.",95
400,Mr HOLLOWAY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,During the last four years we have had the spectacle of reckless expenditure.,95
401,Mr GREGORY,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"At one time we could obtain money at 3 per cent and 3^ per cent., but today the interest rate is practically double, and this Government proposes to continue the reckless expenditure. The worker and the primary producer have to foot the bill. They get the worse end of the stick. When there is a depression it is the worker who suffers. Much has been said about the proposed grant to South Australia, and many honourable members have spoken of the doles and sops that are being continually given to certain States of Australia. I should like honourable members to realise that in the last seven years New South Wales has drawn in bounties, and in the form of assistance to industries, no less than £1,900,000. In view of that fact. I hope that in the future we shall hear less of the cry that doles arp beiug paid to Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. If this Parliament continues to increase the tariff and thereby further penalize the primary producers, I shall do my best to induce the people of Western Australia to adopt the policy of secession from the Commonwealth. I stood solidly for federation, and have a great desire that it should be continued. However, too great a weight is now being placed on the shoulders of the people of Western Australia, and it is impossible for them to bear the burden. Unless a change is effected in the near future, the desire will spread amongst the people of the States, and particularly those of Western Australia, for secession from federation.

402,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [12.4 a.m.] - For some time, indeed, since the Sixth Parliament, there has been an excess number of members on the House and Library Committees, and it is desired to make a reduction. I might say that the gentlemen whom I am moving to be discharged from the necessity of attending those committees, have volunteered to retire from them. I ask for leave to moveTliat Messrs. Jones, Martens and Thompson be discharged from attendance on the Library Committee.",96
403,Mr THOMPSON,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"I object to leave being f ranted. With all due respect to the 'rime Minister, I remind him that I have not even been approached on this matter. This is the first I have heard about my retiring from the committee.",96
404,Mr SCULLIN,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"In view of the objection of the honourable member, I withdraw my request for leave. I was told that the honourable member had consented to the course proposed.",96
405,Mr THOMPSON,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,I should like to remain on the Library Committee. Motions (Mr Scullin)-by leave - agree d toThat Mr Chifley and Mr Holloway be charged from attendance on the Printing Committee. That Mr Bell and Mr Gabb be discharged from attendance oh the House Committee. PAIBB. ADJOURNMENT. SUBSIDY TO AEBIAL MEDICAL SEBVICEPEBSONAL EXPLANATION. Motion (Mr Scullin) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.,96
406,Mr WHITE,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"Balaclava) [12.7 a.m.]. E - I should like to receive an assurance from the Prime Minister that the grant made during the last two years towards maintaining the Australian Inland Mission Medical Service in Western Queensland will be continued. This subsidy was granted to help the organization, which has raised a large sum of money to maintain an aerial medical service over a radius of hundreds of miles around Cloncurry. The Government has contributed Is. a mile for every mile flown by the flying doctor up to £1,300 a year. This work may be regarded as the most humanitarian aspect of aviation, and deserves to be encouraged. It is a very valuable service, and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) will agree with me that it is of the greatest help to those living in isolated areas. I think it is true that the service supplied by this doctor is instrumental in saving more lives in the course of a year than are lost in all the aviation accidents which occur yearly in Australia. The service is maintained by a Q.A.N.T.A.S. aeroplane, which we subsidize, and was inaugurated with the help of the H . V . MCKay bequest, which provided much of the £5,000 originally raised. It was hoped to extend the service to other parts of Australia, and operate from two or three bases. I refrained from introducing this request in the form of question so that the Government might have time to think the matter over. Perhaps the Minister for Home Affairs may be able later to give me an assurance that the subsidy will be continued. Another aspect of this matter may well engage the attention of the Postmaster-General. In order to maintain communication between the outlying stations between Longreach and Cloncurry, wireless sets have been issued by the Inland Mission, and these, besides disbeing available for medical call, are instrumental in providing a considerable amount of revenue for his department as a result of telegrams despatched by means of them to telegraph offices for transmission. The mission wants to know whether the Postmaster-General will give some practical assistance in the maintenance of these sets, as the expense is considerable.  In connection with the Prime Minister's motion dealing with the Library Committee, I wish to state, by way of personal explanation, that, at the request of the Prime Minister, I got into touch with the Whips of the various parties, and Mr Hunter, on behalf of the Country party, informed me that Mr. Thompson had agreed to stand down from the Library Committee. I was surprised to hear from Mr Thompson that he took exception to Mr Hunter's action.",96
407,Mr THOMPSON,LEON AND STEEL PEODTJCTS,"New England) [12.9 a.m.] - In view of what the honourable member for Boothby has just said, I do not wish to press my objection. I feel very disappointed that I have been put off the Library Committee. It was not done with my consent, and I am quite sure that the honourable member for Maranoa did not mention the matter to me. In order to facilitate proceedings, however, I am prepared to retire from the committee, though I do so much against the grain. House adjourned at 12.10 a.m. (Thursday).",97
