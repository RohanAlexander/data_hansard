It should not, policy, important as fiscal policy might be. public resources of the nation and, as such, yes, I have dared use the 'v' word; it has been fashionable in this place-but a vision for If there is a basic difference between the alternative government, it is this: this government government does not do; the alternative government government actually can do. This government of government, decreasing the role of government, in retreat. The alternative government defines the energies of government to build the nation, its human infrastructure, to contribute to what building. When it comes to a vision for the nation, not have one. If you think this is an extravagant, attention to what can only be described as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, Mr Costello, what vision underpinned the government's budget nature of the question. He had no response to strategy serving in terms of an By contrast, we on this side of politics do believe that, when framing the budget for the fundamental questions as to why and how we in Commonwealth revenues.

He simply looked bemused at the that overarching question, 'What is your fiscal ultimate blueprint for the nation?' not apologise for the 'vision thing' because we nation, it is not only valid but necessary to ask are raising and expending some $150 billion both valid and necessary to ask what impact the individual and corporate incentive, and therefore economic efficiency and performance. We NA 6930 MAIN COMMITTEE believe it is valid and necessary to ask what the by way of revenues and whether those revenues the weak and provide equal opportunity to the to ask whether we are providing educational background, whether we are caring for the sick, whether we are offering aid to the destitute, All these are valid and necessary questions who we are as a people, not just as individuals; some collectivity of self-interest. They also a nation. Budgets are huge resources for governments just built by individuals. They are built by individuals reflected in the energies and resources the allocation of the resources of government that the ultimate burden simply depends on individual the economy at large is a radical I would like to address briefly just three of this government's vision for the future of and briefly, what is its education vision? And, its vision for the nation's engagement Firstly, on tax: in designing the tax architecture national objectives are to be served by the articulated in the various tax bills currently whether this tax proposal will increase economic perforce of that, it will also increase total factor economy. It is reasonable to ask whether this reasonable to ask whether it will maintain price this overall tax proposal will have on overall impact it will have on the overall efficiency reasonable to ask what impact it will have on Finally, it is reasonable and critical to ask taxation vision for the nation-will All these questions go to the heart of the create. In the absence of a formally articulated we have before the nation at present is something you have when you are not having an articulated vision. Let us look at its constituent elements. What the appropriations which are before us at the economy? If you look at the collection of evidence inquiry and in the public discussion beyond economic growth which will occur as a result be negligible and, on the basis of a substantial subject, it will be negative. The maximum positive on what additional increment will be added of this package being implemented, which factors out there in the economy, is 0.2 per Monday, 21 June 1999 taxation architecture of the nation will deliver will be sufficient to ensure that we protect strong. We believe it is valid .and necessary opportunity based on ability and not just whether we are giving shelter to the homeless, be those destitute at home or abroad. because they go to the heart of the question of what values we hold as a people, not just as ask the question of who we wish to become as to build nations with. Nations are not individuals as well as the collective resources of of government. To believe somehow that is some minor bagatelle, some irrelevancy, and incentive, and individual initiative in misreading of economic reality. ' elements of this overall equation. First, in terms the nation, what is its taxation vision? Second, third, how does this government seek to reflect with the region and the world? of the nation, it is reasonable to ask what architecture of taxation which the Treasurer has before the parliament. It is reasonable to ask growth. It is reasonable to ask whether, productivity in the overall efficiency of the tax initiative will increase employment. It is stability. It is reasonable to ask what impact government revenues. It is reasonable to ask what of the taxation collection system, just as it is the federation itself, fiscally and functionally. what impact this new tax architecture-this new have on basic Australian fairness. sort of Australia that this government wishes to vision, the. tax policy or the tax proposal that like a vision by default. It is the vision that . impact will this tax proposal that is core to moment have on future growth in the Australian before the nation, both before the Senate that inquiry, you will find that the impact on of this package being implemented will at best slice of the professional literature on this projection contained in any of the literature to national economic growth as a consequence would not otherwise occur as a result of other cent per annum in the long term. The long term NA Monday, 21 June 1999 is defined at the fiveto seven-year point. That dividend indeed. The second element I said we should touch as reflected by the tax proposal before us hugely, what will it do for the efficiency the economists describe as the total factor equation. It is basically a question about whether, the income taxation system in the country, people are going to allocate and use the economic than they have in the past. If you tum to the professional literature, evidence, either in the publicly argued case before the Senate inquiry on the GST or elsewhere suggests that factor productivity in this economy being introduced. The third thing that I said we would touch Here the impact will not be negligible; it evidence before the Senate inquiry-and the disbelief at this, but if he reflects on the most acutely familiar with because I was born is one of the primary employment generators. be torpedoed amidships by this tax proposal, Senate inquiry are that the national loss Queensland and the other states will be something a several year period. If that is the definition order of magnitude, then the government's definition contained in the Oxford Concise Dictionary. We look at price stability, a further test proposal before us. The heroic boffins of Treasury proposal will be maximally 1.9 per cent. No economist-in the country accepts that proposition. contained in the professional literature on this package once it flows through will be in the contribution to price stability in the economy-and Reserve Bank repeatedly reminds us, is critical the Australian economy-then I do not think, professional community are speaking the same language. A fifth test of this government's taxation underlying presupposition which the government community at least, is that the existing taxation deliver adequate future supplies of revenue requirements of the nation. Once again, if you look through the tax it, do we find any shred of evidence anywhere existing raft of tax measures and you'll find MAIN COMMITTEE 6931 is a long time to wait for a small and marginal on when looking at this vision for the nation is: well, if it is not going to grow the economy of the economy? What will it do in terms of what productivity in the economy? This is a critical by bringing in new price signals through combined with the impact of the consumption tax, resources at their disposal more efficiently again we find that there is not a single shred of by the government or in the evidence presented in the public debate on this issue, which will increase as a consequence of this package on is: what will its impact be on employment? will be decidedly negative. Consider again the member for Fairfax just shakes his head in constituency from which he comes, one which I am there, it is a constituency where in fact tourism If there is a sector of the economy which will it will be tourism. The projections before the to tourism employment across the nation in both in the range of 50,000 to 100,000 jobs over of a po-iti.Ve dlvidend from a proposal of this of 'positive' frankly escapes anything of what vision is somehow encapsulated in this tax project that the price impact of this overall other credible economist--correction: no other The range of projections which are subject suggest that the price impact of this order of four to six per cent. If that is a useful price stability, as the Governor of the to the future macroeconomic management of again, that the government and the rest of the vision is what its impact will be on revenues. The has somehow managed to sell, to part of the system is broken in terms of its ability to to Commonwealth coffers to fund the future social package and the formal documentation attached to where the government says, 'Stick to the that revenues fall in a heap in three years, five NA 6932 MAIN COMMITTEE years, seven years or nine years'? No. The evidence It is not there because it is not true. The demonstrated by the ballooning in government adequate to deliver our future revenue requirements. of this new proposal before us, this new tax increment in government revenues. What you in the future be even more flush because this when it comes to guaranteeing the delivery who will be dancing in the streets-quite apilrt which will, of course, provide services necessary complex tax package which has been introduced in the Babylonian Empire-are the Australian increment to the future revenue delivery delivery is not necessary given the fact that count, but has not been proven or established I spoke also of the impact on the federation. vision for the nation-in fact proposed Commonwealth and the states which could only as vertical fiscal imbalance, that is the greater for revenues as a proportion of the total revenues responsibilities of the states. That was the old package. Now we have a with the Democrats. A deal which has been causes, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, affects the states is unacceptable and should line is, if you look at the fiscal and functional does not do a single thing if the vision is to which are approximate in strength and size to In fact, it heads in precisely the reverse direction. fact that the package before us achieves On fairness itself, we come to the kernel of of economic growth, if it fails the test of adding the employment of the nation, if it fails to ensure the functionality of the federation and if it direction on questions of fairness, we might where we come to the core of the argument. that what we have here, in its essence, is the redistributes the taxation burden of the nation a massive wealth redistribution tax. That is logic which underpins this entire package; that a vision based, in the end, on what I can individual greed because it fails all the broader economic benefit to the economy at large When a vision for a nation says that 'greater rich' - and that is the summation and conclusion a risk worth taking when measured against the Monday, 21 June 1999 is not there at all. Why is it not there? existing revenue system of the Commonwealth as revenues in the last three years is perfectly In fact, if we look at the revenue impact system for the nation will represent a further will find is that the Commonwealth coffers will consumption tax proposal is an absolute beaut of revenues to the Commonwealth. The people from the accounting industry of the nation to assist businesses comply with the most since taxation measures were first introduced Taxation Office because it is a huge additional to the Commonwealth. This additional revenue the existing system not only is not broken on that to be broken in the debate to date. ANTS mark I-the first version of this taxation that a system of arrangements between the result in the exacerbation of what is described reliance by the states on the Commonwealth of the states and relative to the total outlay new package as a consequence of the deal done described by that great advocate of Labor Party when he said that the current tax package as it be taken back to the drawing board. The bottom architecture of the Australian federation, this return to the states a capacity to raise revenues the revenue responsibilities of the same states. If we aggregate the arguments, we find in very little by way of positive vision. the argument. If this tax package fails the test to economic efficiency, if it fails to add to price stability, if it does nothing to add to does nothing about and in fact heads in the reverse well ask, 'Why are we doing it?' And that is The often unstated reason we are doing this is Robin Hood tax in reverse. This is a tax which away from the rich and towards the poor. It is the core of the argument; that is the core of the is the core of the government's vision. It is only describe as the worse forms of accentuated tests of economic efficiency and of overall as well as any passing test of social justice. taxation rewards should be delivered to the of that vision-and that vision is somehow other risks, I think it is a vision which the NA Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE nation does not need. What the government is by embarking upon this enterprise to deliver community, it is at the same time worth risking economy; it is worth putting at risk inflationary at risk the unemployment situation within the which remains of basic fairness in our society. the government's vision, simply in order to deliver and within our economy who least need it. Here Australian taxation spectrum. If this is this government's taxation proposal-in the essence of its architecture-it It is one which is as economically irresponsible of individual greed. I said I would touch briefly on education what this government does through the budget which has had $800 million ripped out of it. had $2 billion ripped out of it, if you add to the sector through the increase in HECS that matter which the federal minister for in the House of Representatives-and if you unpack sound and fury signifying nothing, because very little by way of additional resources something serious and substantial about literacy speak from my experience of having worked country-requires significant resources. individually by the state Labor government in programs exceed by a country mile that which boasts of as representing his concrete contribution the nation. You cannot educate a nation on the cheap. Australians with the skills that they need for to obtain the benefits necessary for them and our work force with the skills for the next industrial on the cheap. These are essential investments of our economy as well as the equity of our society.

A number of versions of rules of engagement existed for 79 Squadrons at Butterworth during the Indonesian Confrontation. These rules are detailed, complex and reasonably lengthy documents. However, medals are not awarded on the basis of rules of engagements, or by comparison of rules of engagement. They are awarded on the basis of whether service is rendered under warlike (active service against an identified enemy or adversary) or nonwarlike conditions are derived from diplomatic, military and medical assessments. The assessments relate to the degree of threat to personnel by hostile forces, the individual and environmental hazards encountered, and other relevant factors such as living conditions and restrictions on recreational activities.

International Labour Organisation: Declarations on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work (Question No. 575) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Did the Australian Government vote in support of the ILO's new Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work at the 1998 ILO Conference. (2) Will the ILO's reports measuring compliance by countries to the new declaration be completed in the year 2000; if so, what action has the Australian Government taken to ensure compliance and commence preparing Australia's country report on the declaration. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government voted in favour of the ILO adopting the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work at the 86th session of the International Labour Conference, Geneva, in June 1998. (2) The purpose of the Declaration is to reaffirm the commitment of ILO members to the fundamental principles of the Organisation regardless of whether or not they have ratified the corresponding Conventions. The Annex to the Declaration provides that those ILO Member States that have not ratified relevant Conventions will be required to submit an annual report on any changes which may have taken place in their law and practice. The purpose of the annual reports is to enable the ILO to assess overall trends in member States and identify gaps in technical assistance and cooperation. Australia has ratified six of the seven Conventions corresponding with the principles of the Declaration and already reports to the ILO on their implementation. As Australia has not ratified Convention No 138, Minimum Age, 1973, the Government will be reporting to the ILO in November 1999 on Australia's implementation of the principles associated with the abolition of child labour. Consultations with the State and Territory governments will commence shortly with a view to developing the report. Australia has not ratified Convention No.138 because Australian law does not comply with a number of its express requirements, and there is insufficient flexibility in the Convention to allow ratification to be considered. As at February 1999, only 72 of 174 ILO member States had ratified Convention No.138. In view of the poor rate of acceptance of this Convention, a new Convention and Recommendation aimed at eliminating the worse forms of child labour will be considered for adoption at the 1999 International Labour Conference. International Labour Organisation: Prohibitions on Abusive Child Labour (Question No. 576) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Has the ILO accepted that two of its core labour standards are a prohibition on abusive child labour and a prohibition on forced labour; if so, has the Australian Government considered following the US Government's lead to devote additional funds to the ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour. (2) What sum has the Australian Government committed to the program in each year since its inception. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In June 1998 the International Labour Conference (ILC) adopted the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The purpose of the Declaration is to reaffirm the commitment of ILO members to the fundamental principles of the Organisation regardless of whether or not they have ratified the corresponding Conventions. These fundamental principles include the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour and the effective abolition of child labour. A donation to the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (lPEC) is not proposed at this time. Out of 174 members, Australia is already the 12th highest contributor to the ILO in terms of membership fees. (2) Australia donated $USI00,000 to IPEe through AusAID in 1995. This was paid in two $US50,000 instalments to fund a pilot project on bonded child labour in Nepal. Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation: Lump Sum Payments (Question No. 578) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Does the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 propose an income test on lump sum compensation payments for pain and suffering. (2) Is it a fact that lump sum compensation payments historically have been regarded as intending to compensate an injured person for the suffering and loss of quality of life they have endured. (3) Does the Bill propose that periodic payments of lump sum compensation under $2000 within a 28 day period will not be income tested; if so, is common for compensation for pain and suffering to be paid in that manner. (4) Is it a fact that under the provisions of the proposed legislation lump sum compensation payments for pain and suffering will result in reduced social security and veterans' entitlements but that similar provisions will not apply to libel settlements, another fonn of compensation for pain and suffering; if so, why. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Currently: - periodic payments are counted as income for all social security and veterans' income support recipients; and - lump sums are counted as income in the fortnight of receipt for allowance recipients, but ignored for pension recipients. The Compensation for Non-economic Loss (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment) Bill 1999 changes this current treatment of non-economic loss payments to make periodic payments more attractive than one-off lump sums. Under this approach, lump sums may be income tested over 26 fortnights, but with the following concessions applying: - the first $10,000 of a non-economic loss compensation lump sum will be disregarded; - payments by compensation payers/insurers made directly to third parties for necessary modifications and/or equipment related to the injury (eg home/car modifications, mobility aids, hoists etc) will be disregarded; - where a person purchases an income stream product with their non-economic loss compensation lump sum, the lump sum will be disregarded under the Bill; and - a Secretarial discretion may disregard certain payments from being assessed under the Bill. (2) Lump sum compensation payments can cover a variety of heads of damage, including lost earnings, lost capacity to earn, past and future medical and care costs pennanent impairment, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life etc. (3) Yes. Periodic non-economic loss payments are currently available to people injured in motor vehicle accidents in Victoria, and legislation has been passed in Victoria which would make periodic payments available under their workers' compensation legislation. (4) Yes, subject to the concessions listed above it at answer (1). This Bill applies to 'personal injury' compensation payments made solely for noneconomic loss. Payments made for defamation would not typically be categorised as being in respect of 'personal injury'. National Competition Council: Draft Report (Question No. 587) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: Is it a fact that the draft report of the National Competition Council on the review of subsections 51(2) and 51(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 recommends the removal of certain exemptions for intellectual property under the Act; if so, will he ensure similarly to his assurance concerning the protection of newsagencies' home deliveries that the removal will not endanger research and innovation in Australia.",169
17,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Competition Council completed the final report for the National Competition Policy (NCP) legislation review of subsections 51(2) and 51(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1976 in March 1999. The Government is considering its response to the final report, and in doing so, will take account of the vital importance of research and development to Australia's future prosperity. Centrelink: Notification Changes (Question No. 590) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Community Services, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Has Centrelink decided not to notify pensioners directly about changes to their entitlements. (2) Are pensioners required to phone a central inquiry point for information about their entitlements. (3) Are sufficient personnel available to deal promptly with pensioners' queries. (4) What are the delay times in responding to telephone queries to the Centrelink multilingual inquiry points. (5) Has the number of staff been increased to deal with queries to the multilingual inquiry points. Mr Truss-The answer to the hOliourabJe member's question is as follows: (1) There has been no such decision taken. Where there is a legal requirement to do so, Centrelink advises customers of changes to their entitlement. (2) Pensioners are not required to telephone a central inquiry point for information about their entitlements. They may inquire about their entitlements by either telephoning Centrelink Call or visiting or writing to their local Centrelink Customairspace er Service Centre. Centrelink Call has improved its services to provide more specialised advice, with a dedicated '13' telephone number to deal with enquiries from Retirement customers (132300) and a separate dedicated '13' telephone number for Disability, Sickness and Carer customers (132717). (3) Yes. For those calIers who do choose to contact Centrelink Call, staff numbers have doubled in the past three years. There are now over 3,000 staff working in 22 Call Centres, with another two centres to be opened next year. Over the last two weeks 98.4% of Retirement and 93.6% of Disability, Sickness & Carer customers were able to contact Centrelink CalI on their first attempt. Centrelink has Customer Service Centres as welI as visiting services and agencies which are available to assist pensioners. (4) Centrelink Call provides a multilingual service to over 21 language groups. The multilingual telephone enquiry centre is located at the Liverpool Call Centre. Customers who rang the multilingual service in April waited on average for just 20 seconds and in May this wait time was just 17 seconds. (5) The number of inquiries to the multilingual service has remained at a steady level of around 800 enquiries each day over the last twelve months. The 38 staff as at May 3 1999, which has also remained at a similar level over the past twelve months, meet the demand with all callers being served on their first attempt. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Air (Question No. 595) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Further to the answer to question No 155 (Hansard, 11 May 1999, page 4165) does the concept of segregated air space involve aircraft landing from one direction and taking off from the opposite direction so that the paths of aircraft which are arriving and departing do not intersect either on land or in the air; if not, will he describe the concept which was supported by the study conducted by Ratner & Associates in 1992. (2) Do any modes of operation under the Long Term Operating Plan for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport involve the paths of arriving and departing aircraft crossing either on land or in the air; if so, which modes. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Airservices Australia advises that segregated provides the facility for the operations of approach and departure controllers to be carried out independently to the greatest extent possible. This is achieved by airspace and flight path design, which segregates the operations of aircraft. Where flight paths are required to cross, procedures ensure that aircraft do not conflict with each other. (2) Airservices Australia advises that all modes of operation at KSA, including the parallelniodes that were introduced by the previous Government, require the paths of some aircraft to cross at some point on the ground and/or in the air. Integrated Humanitarian: Settlement Strategy Program (Question No. 599) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Has the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy program been put to competitive tender; if so, (a) why, (b) how will a better service for refugees and humanitarian entrants be provided and (c) how will he ensure that the ,quality of service will not be undermined. (2) Has he responded to the findings in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs on competitive tendering of welfare service delivery, presented to the House on 29 June 1998, which advised against the further tendering of welfare services until the Government develops a contestability continuum; if so, what was his response; if not, Space why not. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As I announced in a media statement. I released at the beginning of February this year, funding for core services for refugee and humanitarian entrants. under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy will progressively move to a competitive tendering and contracting b.as is. (a) The Government sees contracting out of humanitarian settlement services as the next step in a process of continuous improvement, stemming from the introduction of the IHSS in 1997-98 as a more holistic and targeted approach to settlement services for Humanitarian Program entrants. The Government's primary goal is to ensure that the specific needs of this vulnerable group are clearly identified, and that' services to meet these needs are designed, and Â·delivered in the most efficient, effective and equitable way. The Government considers that this can best be achieved through contracts in which it clearly articulates required outcomes. (b) Aside from more clearly articulating the outcomes the Government wants for Humanitarian Program entrants and providing an integrated approach for delivering these outcomes, contracted out service delivery should also result in better targeting of services from the client perspective and more effective and efficient financial management. This will allow existing Government resources to benefit the maximum number of entrants. Such results are consistent with the recommendations of the December 1998 Australian National Audit Office report on the provision of migrant settlement services. (c) In developing the Request for Proposal , documentation, my Department has clearly identified the principles and high standards the Government will expect from potential contracted service providers in their delivery of services to Humanitarby Ian Program entrants. These principles and standards, which place the focus on the client, will form a key part of service delivery contracts and pe formance against these will be closely monito ed by my Department. Contractors will also be required to aintain good working relationships with oth,e service providers, including volunteers. Thi--ill assist in maintaining the holistic integrity of'mSS services and the retention of committed volunteers. (2) Responsibility for preparation of the Government response to the inquiry rests with my colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care and his department. I am advised that discussions are occurring between the Department of Health and Aged Care and other departments, in particular Family and Community Services, with a view to finalising the response in the near future. My Department has provided input to the response. That input related to the Government's access and equity strategy as expressed in the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society and its relevance to contracting out of government services. Also of note is that in 199798, my Department collaborated with the Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) in preparing guidelines for managers to ensure the Charter principles were integrated into the Commonwealth's framework for competitive tendering and contracting. In progressively moving to the contracting of IHSS services, my Department has acted in a manner consistent with the DOFA guidelines. Carriage of - xplosives: Contracts, (Question No. 601) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 May 1999: (1) Which companies have contracts with the Department of Defence for the carriage of explosives. (2) Do all vehicles used by each company referred to in part (1) to carry explosives meet the required standards set out in Statutory Rules 1991, No 329-Explosive regulations.

(5) Are all company employees engaged in carrying explosives trained to the level of explosive ordnance class 1. (6) What level of training is undertaken annually drivers engaged in carrying explosives. Mr Moore-The answer to' the honou'rable member's question is as follows: (1) DAS Operations Pty Ltd trading as DAS Distribution. (2) Para 2.1(1) and Para 15(1) of the contract stipulates that vehicles must conform with the stap.dards in schedule 3 of the Explosive Regulations (Stat. Rules 1991 No 329). This is verified. (3) Para 12 of the contract details security requirements including the need for Contractor employees to hold Secret security clearances. This has been verified. (4) Para 19 of the contract has specific clauses detailing indemnity requirements. (5) The department's contract (para's 2.1(vi) and Para 14) requires contractor staff to be competent and fully trained. (6) Whilst the contract does not specify annual training it does require drivers and supervisors to be competent and this aspect is rnonitored. Australian Defence Force Personnel: Foreign Awards (Question No. 613) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 May 1999: . Will he provide details of all foreign awards that current and former Australian Defence Force personnel have permission to accept in respect of overseas military service after September 1945. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Award Korean War Service Award United Nations Service Medal with Clasp 'Korea' Unit Awards Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation United States Presidential Unit Citation Vietnam Campaign Award Government of the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal Unit Awards United States Presidential Unit Citation United States Meritorious Unit Citation United States Outstanding Unit Award (with Combat 'V' Device) UnitedÂ·States Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation United States Navy Unit Commendation Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation Individual Gallantry and Meritorious Service Awards (United States) Distinguished Service Cross Silver Star Legion of Merit Distinguished Flying Cross Bronze Star Air Medal Army Commendation Medal Navy Commendation Medal Combat Flying Medal Medal of Freedom (Republic of Vietnam) Gallantry Cross (several levels) Armed Forces Honour Medal (several classes) Staff Service Medal Training Services Medal Civil Action Medal Individual Gallantry and Meritorious Service Awards (Cambodia) The following table lists all foreign honours and awards approved for wearing for service after September 1945 according to available information derived from Department of Defence files: Remarks Award National Defence Medal (Bronze Star) Gulf War United Kingdom Distinguished Flying Cross Member of the British Empire Gulf War Medal United States South West Asia Service Medal Legion of Merit Bronze Star Meritorious Service Medal Navy Unit Commendation .

Additionally, all foreign awards will only be officially recognised by the Australian Government in cases where a formal offer has been made by Head of State or the Government of a country with which Australia maintains diplomatic relations; or by an official agency of the United Nations (UN); or by other international organisations diplomatically by Australia.
