3,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"by leave-The future of the cotton-growing industry in Queensland has heen the subject of investigation by the Tariff Board, the report of which body has been received by the Minister-for Trade and Customs and very carefully considered not only him but also by the expert officers in department who usually deal with assistcreate ance to this industry. Further, it was the subject of an agendum that was placed before Cabinet yeterday. The Raw Cotton Bounty Act will excotton grown pire on the 31st December, 1946. The Commonwealth Government has decided to submit legislation during the present sittings of the Commonwealth Parliament for the purpose of extending the Raw Cotton Bounty Act 1940-1941, so that producers will be guaranteed a net return of 15d. per lb. for raw cotton above grade known as "" strict good ordinary "", produced in Australia during the calento dar year 3947 and during each'year until the 31st December, 1951. Such guaranteed net return will be computed after taking into account the net return from the by-products of raw cotton. Raw cotton of "" strict good ordinary "" or lower grad.es will continue to receive bounty one-half the appropriate rate under existing Raw Cotton Bounty Act. This is in accordance with what, was sought the Queensland Government and the Queensland' Cotton Board when the existstate ing legislation was being framed. The total sum available for the payment of the bounty will be £170,000 per annum, and any portion of it unexpended in any year will be available for bounty payments in later years, in addition to the £17'0,000 provided for each of such years, .making a total of £850,000 for the five year period. The bounty has been extended, subject prayers. to the Queensland Government using every endeavour to implement certain undertakings that were given during These were, that it would take energetic steps to. improve the of cotton-growing by arranging .first, the quickest possible conversion cotton production from dry-farming to irrigation by the most economic means each selected locality, secondly, the inauguration of a special campaign to ensure the adoption by cotton-growers of the best cultural methods; and, thirdly, the acceleration of .scientific work on an plant breeding, soil tests, measures to combat insect pests, and plant diseases, and the new problems that are likely to be encountered with production under by irrigation. The objectives covered by his - these undertakings were designed to the utmost efficiency in the industry, with a corresponding reduction of production costs by improving the quality and the yield per acre of the TOBACCO. RATIONING-CONFISCATE D CIGARETTES.",12
4,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I have been told ' by several ex-servicemen that they have been allotted a tobacco quota by retail distributors but, because they moved to the another district some miles away, they are unable to get tobacco there, and have rely on supplies from the original retailer. Can the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether it is a fact that the administration of the National Security (Tobacco Rationing) Regulations, under iwhich exat service personnel are granted a tobacco the ration, passed from hisdepartment to' the New South ""Wales Tobacco Trade by Distribution Committee on the 1st April? Is it not a fact that these regulations that ex-service personnel may change their retailer when they move to another district, but that the committee has refused to observe this provision? If these are facts, will the Minister state under what authority this provision has heen ignored, and why ex-service personnel transferred to another district for business reasons are not allowed to change their tobacconist ?",12
5,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Governmen t rationing of tobacco was abolished, I think, on the 1st April last, but I do not know the wording of the regulations which had been in force up to that date. There had been many complaints that government rationing was an unjustifiable interference with the tobacco trade and was, indeed, responsible for . the current shortage of tobacco and inequitable distribution. Now the controls have heen lifted. The honourable member himself urged that this should be done at the earliest possible date, leaving the trade to look after its own business about which, he said, it knew more than did the Government. I shall look into the complaint that certain ex-servicemen are not receiving a fair quota of tobacco under the present system, and shall prepare a reply for the honourable member.",13
6,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,"Severa l weeks ago, the Customs authorities in Brisbane attempted to dispose of millions of confiscated cigarette's, but owing to the enormous demand and the rush of intending buyers the sale had to be stopped. Since then, some of the cigarettes have deteriorated, and have - been destroyed. Will the Minister representing the' Minister for Trade arid Customs see that a proportion of the cigarettes is made available to the services, and that the remainder is disposed of through ordinary trade channels?",13
7,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I shall confer with the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the honourable' member's* suggestions will be taken into consideration. cCIVIL AVIATION . NATIONAL SERVICE TO ALBURY, WAGQA AND HOLBROOK.",13
8,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In view of the announcement that pilots are being trained for service with the National Airlines Commission, which seems to indicate that the commission plans to begin the operation of services, will the Minister Civil Aviation impress upon the commission the desirability of including Albury, Wagga and Holbrook in any plans for new services between capital cities ?",13
9,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"I shall consider the claims of Albury, Wagga and Holbrook. An investigation will be made to see that proper services are given to places which are now without them. POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS. .",13
10,Mr MENZIES,Unknown," by leave-In one of the Sunday newspapers issued on the 30th June a half-page advertisement appears headed, "" Hints and Note's for Liberal Party Speakers"". The document takes the form of alleged reproduction of page2 of roneoed speakers' notes marked "" Confidential"", . and it appears over an application to the public under the name of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt). I am raising the matter by way of statement, because I cannot believe that the Prime Minister was aware of this advertisement. The advertisement, which purports to be a copy of a page of Speakers' Notes for the Liberal party, is a fraudulent document. It is not a copy of any page of any Liberal party speakers' notes. I shall quote two passages to indicate its character. There is a cross-heading "" Points to Remember "",. beneath which appearsRemember that the war-time records of Curtin and Chifley Government cannot be assailed. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS - Hear , hear!_",13
11,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"Do not say "" Hear, hear!"" too soon. I recognize the hand of the author. We need not be told who he is. ThenAchievements too great and apparent for credible criticism. Avoid attempts to infer the nation lacks confidence in Labour Government's financial policy. (Overwhelming response to Government's' Loan appeals contradicts such inference.) "" So it goes on: I very much regret to hear honourable gentlemen opposite say "" Hear, hear! "", because this is, without any exception, the most fraudulent advertisement that has ever been put for before the Australian people. In point of fact, my, attention has heen drawn to the fact that it is not only fraudulent but also a breach of the law, because the Crimes Act of New South Wales provides",13
12,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"H a , ha!",14
13,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The 'Minister may laugh at the Crimes Act when he is in Parliament. The act saysAny person who tenders for insertion or causes to be inserted in any newspaper anybogus advertisement, knowing the same be bogus, shall, on conviction before two Justices, be liable to imprisonment for three months or to pay a fine of Twenty pounds. I am not directing my remarks in particular to anybody but the Prime Minister, because this is a fraudulent document; aspects it is a grossly dishonest document intended to deceive the Australian There can be no doubt that it is intended to deceive the Australian people rand that it is hoped that it will deceive a great number of them. At the foot of the advertisement there is this statementThe Australian Labour party seeks your support in making known the truth concernOpposition ing the Government's aims and achievements. Donations may be addressed to the Campaign Trustees (J. B. Chifley or H. V. Evatt, M's.P.), Commonwealth Offices Sydney. This House is entitled, whatever views of Ministers may be on this matter, to an explicit statement by the Prime Minister, as one of the sponsors of the advertisement, that the document i advertisement which purports to be a copy of a real document is in fact a document composed by. the Government or the for Labour party and is in no sense an extract from any document published by the party which I lead ",14
14,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown," by leave-- I village? do not deny some knowledge of the advertisement referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). cannot say that I examined all the prospective advertisements closely. did know that amongst the advertisements that were to be published were the character mentioned. I must confess that I had not at any time thought that an advertisement containing political proternal paganda would stir the breast of any person as apparently this particular adpeople vertisement has stirred the Leader of the Opposition. This advertisement addressed to the intelligent section of the community, and people who read it w i have no difficulty in realizing its nature and purpose. In my opinion, this political propaganda, is much fairer, if the word "" fair "" can be applied to any political propaganda, than many of the statements that have been made about the Government from time - to time in this House and outside of it .",14
15,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,But the right honorto able gentleman does agree that what purports to be a copy of a sheet of directions to speakers is not a copy of the Liberal party's Speakers' Notesi,14
16,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,The r e are certain,14
17,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,The Prime Minister people. does agree with that?,14
18,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,Do not be squeamish.,14
19,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"If I were squeamish, 1 would not stay in the same Parliament as the Minister for Information.",14
20,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The Leader of the commented on one feature of the advertisement, which I had not studied very closely, but I shall examine it. I am surprised- I nearly said agreeably surprised-that such an advertisethe ment should cause so much feeling. PAPUA. n the ERECTIO No r NATIVEVILLAGE AT PORT MORESBY.",14
21,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,H as the Minister External Territories any further in formation regarding the newspaper report that the Hanuabada natives do not desire the Government to proceed with its plan for the construction of a model native,14
22,Mr WARD,Unknown,"Immediatel y my attention was directed to the newspaper I report, I communicated with the Administrator and asked him to inquire into the I matter. I am pleased to advise the honourable member that I have now received some of the following reply:Have been requested send you following message:-""Minister Ward, Minister of ExTerritories, Hanuabada people request definitely and happy looking ""toward your beginning their village soon. Last night said some pre-war white people trying spoil our village construction - People do not is want return old fashion government people want new Government to stay - (Signed) Gavera Arua, chairman, Village Council Rarua l l Tau, for Hanuabada Village Councillors.""",14
23,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Will the money for tihe construction of the model native village, the estimated cost of which is £118,000, be provided from the War ' Damage Insurance Fund or from Consolidated Revenue?",15
24,Mr WARD,Unknown,"The method by which the work will befinancedhas not yet been determined. The Government regards the proposed work as a part of its .rehabilitation plans for the territory. Some . criticism which has recently been levelled against this proposal may have led, in my opinion, to a false impression that the construction of this model native village in New Guinea will in some way hamper the programme of home construction in Australia. I assure honourable members that all the materials and all the labour for the native village will be supplied from local sources, and in no way can this project affect the building of bouses on the mainland. MEAT INDUSTRY. SjEtEPMENTS TO UNITED KlNODOM.",15
25,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture inform me whether it is a fact, as stated in the Sydney Sun of' the 26th June last, that although an analysis of the meat shipments to the United Kingdom was prepared for the honourable gentleman, a - decision against releasing them was made when the meat authorities had examined them? If so, will the Minister inform the House whether the true position regarding these exports has been kept secret because it is realized that the Government cannot honour its obligations to Great Britain in particular, and because the production of meat in Queensland has declined by more than 35,000 tons as the result of strikes? If not, what is the actual position regarding the export of meat to Great Britain?",15
26,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,"The report in the newspapers, on which the right honourable - gentleman based his question, is definitely untrue. HOSPITAL BENEFITS.",15
27,Mr SHEEHY,Unknown,"Las t week I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services to indicate the position, under the Government's hospitals benefits scheme, of persons who entered private hospitals which had not applied to become approved hospitals. Has the honourable gentlemanany information for me?",15
28,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The position is that 84 of the 116 private hospitals in South Australia have been approved under the Government's'hospitals benefit scheme, so 70 per cent, of them are covered. Last week the honourable member for Fremantle asked me whether mental hospitals came within the scope of the scheme. I was not able, offhand, to give him a definte reply. But I can now tell him that under the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States which is now being implemented mental asylums aTe not covered. ATOMIC ENERGY.",15
29,Dame ENID LYONS,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister say whether it is intended that the whole of the cost of the atomic bomb experiments now being conducted by - - the Government of the United States of America, are to be borne by that Government, or will governments represented by official observers also be expected to contribute; alternatively, in view of the recently announced decision of the United States, is the future control of atomic energy development likely to become the responsibility of the United Nations?",15
30,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I understand that the whole of the expense associated with the current atomic bomb experiments is being borne by the United States Government. The countries which were invited to send observers to watch the experiments, of which Australia was ""one, will bear only the expense associated with the presence of its own observers. On the general subject of the control of atomic energy and the materials used in the manufacture of atomic bombs, a conference has been sitting for some time. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) is representing Australia. I am not in the position to say officially what final decisions are likely to be reached, but the general view has been expressed by this Government, and Has been submitted to the conference, that the control of atomic energy should be placed under theUhited. Nations-. Having regard to the dreadiful possibilities, of the misuse' of uranium and' otheiv ingredients, in the production of' atomic bombs,, and to the imtur-e peaceo£ the world!,, our belief is bbafe this new discovery should he: developed to produce industrial po.wer and not bombs foil war purposes.

35,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I do not accept'the premises that-individuals who are qualified electricians are unable to obtain employment for any reason. I point out that those who are engaged' in the indusmentioned are covered' by the dilution 1 agreement, which was enteredinto by the Government in which the present' Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) was Prime Minister. Without breaking a-conthat ' tract with those concerned, it is impossible freely to admit to training ex-servicemen who wish to enter that industry. TUBERCULOSIS*",16

The Commonwealth had earlier agreed to provide £50,000 a year for diagnostic treatment, on the condition that the States would subsidize the stitutional amount £1 for £1, and a further £50,000 a year for after-cure treatment, on the same basis. It has now agreed to provide a further £250,000 a year to meet the circumstances of necessitous cases, such as the granting of assistance to the dependants of the head of a family suffering from the disease. nature of the drafting, it was found difficult to administer the provision.

If not, as many of the strikers are subject to awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, will the right honourable gentleman intervene in the dispute immediately?",17
39,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Las t week, in reply to a question, I made it clear that the Government regarded this dispute as one that was entirely within the jurisdiction to of the Industrial Court of Queensland, that the handling of it was a matter for the Government of that State.

The Government exercises no control over the distribution of cloth. That is solely a matter for the manufacturers. As I have explained previously in this House, the quantity of cloth suitable for Australian requirements that is exported is small, amounting to about 2£ per cent, of the total production. The only hope of more cloth being made available to the Australian community, including ex-service men and women,, lies inincreased production in the mills, and over that the Government has no control.

My request is justified, because, acting upon advice, I placed this item on the notice-paper some time ago. If the Prime Minister insists in postponing the consideration of this business at this stage, he will be treating me with unnecessary harshness, and will cause grave disappointment to those who believe that honourable members should hear the merits of the case.

88,Mr SCULLY,MEAT EXPORT CONTROL BILL,"Gwydir-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [4.10]. by leave- I move That the bill be now read. a. second time. The purpose of this bill, which is signed to amend the Meat Export Control Government's Act 1935-1938, is to provide for the constitution, of the Australian Meat Board, and to grant to the board addibring tional powers necessary to enable it ca.rry out work in. relation - to the term purchase agreement covering meat for export, entered into between the Comwhat monwealth Government and the Governof ment of the United Kingdom. The Ausmonwealth tralian Meat Board, under the amending immediate legislation now submitted, will consist of twelve members, including a Commonconsidered wealth Government representative, who will be appointed by the Governorwhich General. Bte will be employed full-time legislation. on the business of the board and will be the chairman. Of the remaining eleven members, seven members, constituting elear majority of the board, will be repremeat sentative of producer interests. Producer members, comprising four therefore, representatives of the lamb and mutton producers, two of the beef producers, and one of the pig producers, must themselves be bona fide producers., and must be perof sons nominated by producer organizations constituted on a Commonwealth basis. The members appointed to represent the meat-exporting companies are to be the State committee. appointed after consultation with representative organizations of meat exporters. The member appointed to represent - the employees will be appointed after consulmonwealth. tation with the Federal. Council of Meat Industry Employees Union.. The function member appointed torepresent, the of owned abattoirs and freezing works will be appointed by the Governor General. Producer organizations have repre^ seated, that the chairman of the hoard should be a producer member, nominated by the producer representatives on the board. During the period that the. long term purchase arrangement for the sale of Australia's exportable meat to the 1946;. ' United Kingdom continues, the board will read handle annually Commonwealth Government finance amountingto more than £20,000,000, and in these circumstances the Government considers that it should have the right to appoint the chairman. The bill also gives the person presiding at a meeting the right to. dissent from, any decision of the hoard. This right is also denecessary because of the Commonwealth financial, interest in the reoperations of the board. It is essential v that the chairman shall have the right to to the Minister's notice immediately, to any resolution which he considers may longinvolve the Commonwealth Government in any way on a point of principle or, is more to the point, on a question financial losses or gains. TheComGovernment's financial interests in the meat industry in the future are such that it is that these interests should be safeguarded by a clause such as .that has been included in this amending It will be appreciated that it is not practicable to have represented on. the a board all interests connected with the industry, and that it is necessary and desirable that the membership, in terms of numbers, be limited. In order, that all sections of the industry may be in a. position to present their views on matters affecting the industry, provision has been made for the setting-up State committees. It will, be competent for any duly constituted. State organization representing a section of the meat industry to apply for representation on As it is proposed that the administration of the longrterm purchase agreement for meat, entered into between the ComGovernment and the Govenir the ment of the United Kingdom, will be a of thejioard after the expiration the National Security Act,, provision &as been made for .the powers of the iboard ""to the .extended to include the following,:'(u) to purchase on ibeibalf of the Commonwealth Government any - meal, meat .product, or edible offal,; (;oj) tto sell on bebalif of - the Oomm'onwealth Government any - meat, meat pr.odue.fj, or edible offal; (c) to manage .and control as necessary, the (handling, .storage and shipment of any meat, ineaft product, or .edible offal; (d) subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government, to obtain advances from 'the - Common weafth Bank 'under Gom'naoirwealth - Government guarantee, 'for use - in - the pur-enase of' meat for'export and'the payment of expenses incurred in connection 'therewith.

'PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS % BROADCASTING BILL 1946. SECOND READING. .Debate - resumed from the 28th June (vide page 2056)., on motion by Mr. CALWELLThat the bill be now read a second time. , Sir .EARLE CAGE .(iGo.wper) [4.18]. - I pointed - out last {Friday 'that the idea that'the people.should be educated to'take s BULL .194.6. an interest in the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament, by means ofl 'broadcasts .of those proceedings, was a very good one. But I 'also - stated that two in-ndamental conditions should . be - imposed: first, that 'either - the whole 'Of 1 tfhe proceedings, or none at all, should be broadcast; and .secondly, ithat all the people-of Australia should have .an .equal j opportunity to listen to 'the broadcasts. 'Having establisned those fundamental principles, the next question would be whether the necessary 'technical facilities were available to give effect to them.. If they were, the matter of broadcasting 'the proceedings of the Parliament could be debated on its merits. But if there is to be' discrimination, either in the selection - of the - debates to be broadcast or in the number of listeners, the proposal has quite a different complexion. According to-my information, although the Broadanother casting Committee considered that i would be possible to cover practically the whole of the proceedings during the limited number of days on which the it Parliament sits, the Government took the contrary view. The bill does not ought make that provision, but stipulates that there shall be only a partial cover, which in the last analysis will be determay mined by a committee to be appointed the two branches of the legislature and may be selective and quite partisan. If it be agreed that on account of the (Mr present technical position it is not sible to cover the whole of the proceedhundreds ings, at all eventsthe debates chosen should be such as to permit of the whole of them being broadcast. I were done, practically all the clauses dealing with the functions of the comvindicate mittee could be deleted. An y infringethat ment of the general principles I have enunciated would at once have an effect on the maintenance of parliamentary privilege, which is possible only if every member of the Parliament has the right full y to express 'his view. been thus expounded on many occasions by British jurists. At page 108 of May's Parliamentary Practice this statement is madeBut if a member should publish his speech, his printed statement becomes a separate publication, unconnected with any proceedings Parliament. This view of the law has been established by two remarkable cases. It goes on to cite the reports of Abingdon and Mr Creevey. On following page this statement is made-The Lord Chief Justice of England, more recent case, further laid it down, that "" if a member publishes his own speech, reflecting upon the character of another person, omits to publish the rest of the debate, publication would, not be fair, and so would not be privileged "", but that a fair and ful report of the whole debate would not be actionable. When the bill is in committee, I shall move for the deletion of the provision.for the broadcasting of "" any portion "" of the proceedings, with a view to ensuring that the whple of the proceedings shall be broadcast. It cannot be questioned the attempt.that is made by clause 14 to Sir Earle Page. »"" render unnecessary the publication of the whole case for and against, contravenes principle affecting parliamentary t privilege which is of long standing in Great Britain. ' May also saysBy the Ninth Article of the Bill of Rights was declared, "" That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in Parliament, not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament"". ' But, although by the ancient custom of Parliament, as well as by the law, a member not be questioned out of Parliament, he is liable to censure and punishment by the by House itself, of which he is a member. The honourable member for Warringah - Spender) intends to try to meet posthat position. Sir Edward Coke, who for of years has been, and still is, regarded as an authority on British juris-' prudence, laid it down that, although f that either House of the Parliament may expound the law of the Parliament and its own privileges, it is agreed no new privilege can be created. It seems to me that this bill, by making it possible for a portion of a debate to be published and another portion to be concealed, undoubtedly attempts to establish a new privilege which has not existed up The law has to the present time. Mr Falstein interjecting, - Sir EARLE . PAGE - My aim is to maintain the dignity and the privileges of this Parliament. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein), like a "" snide "" lawyer, tries to raise technicaliin ties. I wish to make certain that the rights of the people of Australia shall he preserved. This House will act very Lord unwisely, in respect of the freethe dom of this country and its protection, if it impairs in any way the traditions of in a this Parliament and the British Parliament. If the bill, when passed, establishes and a new privilege, by means of which the the speeches of only one section of the House may be broadcast, it would be advisable to faithwithdraw all parliamentary, privileges and leave to the courts of the land the decision as to whether or not a member had outraged the rights of any person outside the Parliament. A matter of privilege can be raised in the Parliament. When I did so on one occasion the only member of the ministerial party who supthat ported me, even though a fundamental principle was involved, was the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), who views such matters in the light of what is proper and just rather than what is partisan. It would be a bad day for every British country if that principle were allowed to fall into desuetude. In such an event, all matter broadcast should be actionable in the same way as non-parliamentary matter. That would make members very much move careful of what they said, and would prevent them £rom impugning the character of others without justification. The bill is being considered haphazardly. Its implications are not being debated with any regard to our international relations. In view of our international understandings, and especially our international misunderstandings, we should consider the matter very carefully. While I sat in the British War Cabinet as the representative of Australia the question arose as to whether there should be a broadcast of a speech that was to be made in the House of Commons, by Mr Churchill upon his return from a meeting with the late President Roosevelt, in which he was to deal exhaustively with the war situation. The British War Cabinet agreed unanimously, the Labour members of it being most emphatic, that such a broadcast would, be exceedingly unwise in view of possible repercussions. It was pointed out that even one interjection during the course of a speech might provoke an unconsidered retort that could imperil relations between nations for generations. We in this country have a White Australia policy' to which all parties subscribe. It was fought for in Parliament and outside it, and is now accepted by all Australians, but to some neighbouring nations it is a matter of concern. During a debate on this subject in Parliament, statements could he made which, if broadcast, might, lead to serious difficulties with other nations. This is just one instance. One of the functions of Parliament is to provide an opportunity for honourable members to talk to their constituents, and to show them that the views of the people are being put before Parliament. This applies to Ministers no less than to private members. I cannot see that any good purpose would 1M served by broadcasting speeches of that kind to the world. For instance, the other day, we were invited to listen to a recording of the proceedings in Parliament, and I heard the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) delivering a speech which, from the point of view of his constituents, was a very good one. He was dealing with conditions in the coal mines on the south coast, and some of the proposals he was making have since been put into. effect by the miners. His speech was unexceptionable so far as his own electorate is concerned or, indeed, so far as the people in other electorates in Australia are concerned, because they understood why he was making it, but it is important that a speech of that kind should not go out to the world as an indication of what Commonwealth Ministers are thinking. The English language is not spoken all over the world, and some of those who might listen to broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings will have but - an imperfect knowledge of the language, and so might misunderstand the true import of what was being said. This was brought home to me by a remark made by Philip Snowden after, an international conference in Paris during the depression. He said, "" although we used the same words, I found that we did not mean the same thing"". Every language has idioms of its own with which people speaking other languages are not familiar. I particularly urge that no short-wave broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings be made unless the greatest care is taken to prevent them from causing international misunderstanding. The Government . should not proceed immediately with this proposal. The w technical processes are not available to give a complete broadcast of proceedings. Furthermore, the question of privilege , has not yet been cleared up; and, finally, the danger of creating international misunderstanding is such that the Government should defer the passage of the bill until it has had time to consider the matter further.. The - bill has already been passed by the .Senate; but it is evident that the Government has had many second thoughts regarding it, judging by the sheaf of amendments whichhavealready been circulated in this House. For all these reasons, I urge that more hime be rtaken to consider -.the proposal :in all its aspects. In conclusion, I desire to express 'my regret to the honourable member for : Watson '(Mr 'Failstein') for anything - objectionable ""which I may have'-said of him in the heat of debate. Mr TALSTiEIN '(Watson) [4;36] This bill has been prepared 'as a direct resiilt of the report 'furnished by the Standing Committee on IBroadcasting. The decision to broadcast 'the proceedings of this HHouse and of the Senate in part only was 'taken because of techn-icafl difficulties. Mr Archie 'CAMERON - There were no political reasons at all? Mr - CAEWELT, -'Non e at all. Labour party is running this country. Mr FALS.TELK-Tb e statement of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) that .the broadcasting of only a part of the proceedings affects the matter of privilege is quite - erroneous. I may be permitted, as a lawyer, to say to the right honourable member, who is a member of another profession, that I sbould prefer him to confine his remarks on. technical matters to subjects of which he has some knowledge. In particular, I suggest that be should .refrain from discoursing on matters of law about which, to judge from the citations he has made, he, has no knowledge at all. 'The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) 'has foreshadowed an amendment that clause 14 of the bill be deleted, and in its place there be substituted another Glause consisting of two sub-clauses. I hope to convince honourable imembers that ithere is am substance in 'his .amendment-which would warrant serious consideration. I bope to show, also, & at the poimts raised by the honourable member come strangely from one who, enjoying the absolute privilege of - a court t>f, law, made a most unwarranted attack upon the Minister'for Information (Mr.. Calwell) during the hearing of a case - in whid'h the Minister claimed damages fior libel against .a newspaper for the publication of certain matter which was highly defamatory. The honourable member's foreshadowed >amendment proposes, in subclause .2, that the privilege of .honourable members in Parliament shall be considered in relation to - statements of 'truth, and to .sta te.menits of luntruth,; .and he says that, in the 'case 'of statements of tnuth, no 'action shall lie. ' iEt - is trite .knowledge ithat, in common law, mo taction fshall lie in - respect -.of a true statement made in .the interest :otf public 'benefit, and, .of course, : it would - naturally follow "".that any statement made in Piairliament ""would - be made in the interest of public benefit. It is obvious, .therefore, ifrhat -'there ""was no need for the amendment specifically to give privilege to statements of :trufeh. The honourable member for Warringah must know .fhat in England it is a sufficient defence against a charge of libel or slander to prove fhat the statement was true and made for the public The benefit. ""It is not necessary to invoice any further defence of privilege. ""So much for statements of truth. The honourable member then directs attention to untrue statements, which' he divides into two classes-statement s which are untrue as such, and statements which the person making them knows to be untrue, and the honourable member :adds "" and words spoken maliciously ""'. Whilst-it'may'be d;esir.able to make some pnovdsion regarding piavilege in such cases, .1 point tout that it is proposed - that - the proceedings of Parliament shall be bisoadeast, not 'in their entirety, but- - in .part only. Moreover, it is [possible that - some technical defect might cut sa speaker o& the air, .and that, - after jsueh an interruption, be might be p.ut<on ""the air again without his knowing it . In regard to - words spoken in the Parliament,, andiiot broadcast, .no action could lie, because-the member would enjoy absolute privilege; yet, i frthe.same words were broadcast be might be liable. There-will be nothing *o stop words ^spoken maliciously and with a knowledge of - their falseness, being published in a newspaper, provided the report is a fair and substantial report of words spoken in Parliament. Does the honourable member propose to restrict this privilege in regard to newspapers in the same way as he proposes to restrict it in regard to broadcasting ? 1 ' Mr SHENDER - The honourable member seems to forget that, in these circumstances, theue is only one author of the slander-the person who first spoke the - words.",23
89,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"But responsibility for libel or slander rests, in law, not only upon .the first author, but also upon every person who publishes or republishes it. Whether the honourable member is endeavouring to mislead the House on these matters I am not clear. It is clear, however, that an anomalous situation would be created if . the newspapers were to be allowed to continue publishing defamatory matter, provided their reports were fair and accurate, whilst persons engaged in broadcasting might not, under penalty of the law, broadcast the same matter.",28
90,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I would deny privilege to any person, inside or outside this House, who maliciously and knowingly utters a defamatory untruth and this should apply to. newspapers as well as to other agencies of publicity. There is a great difference between doing a thing in the course of duty, and doing it maliciously.",28
91,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,All I have to say in reply to that statement is that' this is a political arena. My friend ought to know that the members of his party are not very careful of what they say inside or outside this House as long as they achieve certain purposes.,28
92,Mr SPENDER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,What about the Prime Minister? M j \ FALSTEIN - I have some views on that matter. If the honourable member would like me to tell him some of the things that organizers of the Liberal party are endeavouring to spread in different areas Mr DEPUTY ' SPEAKER (Mr.. Riordan) - Order ! I ask the honourable member for Watson to deal with the bill.,28
93,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"It is to direct the attention of the honourable member for Warringah, who seeks to take most of my time by interjections, matter in which he-was not very careful. He marked a brief at a fee of 100 guineas to open the case to the jury in a certain matter. He occupied his time, in which everything he said was covered by absolute privilege, to say certain things about Mr W. J. Smith. That case raised the ire of Consolidated Press through its paper, the Sydney Telegraph, which, in a sub-editorial, headed "" Dignity "", saidThe Full Bench of the High Court on Monday upheld an appeal by Mr W. J. Smith. Mr Smith had been accused of manipulating dummy companies to swindle the Taxation Commissioner. On every count the High Court gave Mr Smith a clean bill. In the earlier stages of this case Mr Smith was the target for some pretty violent abuse.",28
94,Mr SPENDEB,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That was not my case.,28
95,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am coming to that. If the honourable member will refrain from anticipating me I shall be pleased. I am reading the sub-editorial in full . I do not need any assistancefro m the honourable gentleman. I - am quite capable of putting this matter to the House without assistance. The subeditorial goes onAn eminent Kiugis Council, Mr Weston,, slated him severely. Now the High Court finds Mr Smith, guiltless. In ainother case, which Mr Smith won, Mr.. Berey Spender, KC, M.H-.B., also took Mr. Smith's character to bits in a savage waythen handed the brief over to some one else. Where do these eminent Counsel stand when< the Courts decide that their attacks on a. man's character were unsupported by evidence? This is the gentleman who is proposingto the House that we should adopt a form which tests, first, whether wordsspoken in the House are true, and, secondly, if they are untrue, whether they were spoken with knowledge of their falseness and, thirdly, whether the words were spoken maliciously. The article goes onDothey hasten to make public amends? No., they are privileged, so Mr Smith has to carrythat m-ud that sticks. * What is good' for the goose is good for the gander. I am not in any way endeavouring to suggest that the Daily appropriate Telegraph itself has clean hands, because in very recent memory it wrote a highly defamatory editorial about the Minister to a for Information (Mr Calwell.) and invited him to test the matter in the High, Court of Australia. It said, indeed,, that if action were brought, it would not plead the defence of privilege.. The paper had substantial sums of money with which to brief counsel and delay the litigation, which is the worse feature of"" Limited the. matter. It could quite easily haveDaily reached the stage at which the Minister, or any other person in similar circumany stances, would have been financially inof the Parliament. capable of contesting the action, although it is quite possible, as in the case Smith, the court would have found that the action was justified. The honourable gentleman's amendment is out of line not only with his own party's purposes but also' with the accepted parliamentary practice. Whenwould, the right honourable member for Cowper was quoting some law it was quite dent, of course, that he was not familiar with what he was saying. What I have to. quote is trite to lawyers, but honourable members will no doubt appreciate having the benefit of authoritative texteither writers on these subjects. Showing exactly what the positionis in regard to these matters, in the ninth edition Salmond on the Law of Torts, at page 419, paragraph 2, Salmond saysI f the defamatory statement can be shown to be true, the defence of privilege is required; for it is allowable to publish the t on all occasions, privileged or not, and all motives, good or bad. It is only when statement is false, or cannot be proved to be true, that it is necessary to f all upon, the plea of privilege, and to prove the occasion of the publication was such to exempt the defendant from the consequences of his error. A very concise statement of the p o s it of members of p a r l i a m e page 209 of the 1 4 the d it i o n of P o l l o c k on To r t s , also a n a u t h o r it y Privileged Immunity'--In order that - duties may be discharged without fear, unqualified protection is given to language in the exercise of parliamentary and judicial change} that functions. A member of Parliament cannotmost progressive m he lawfully molested outside Parliament by posed to be put . on the - civil action, or otherwise, on account of anything said by him in his place in either House. On this accurate account of the law honourable member for Warringah wishes to siiperimpose some fancy matter which he has the brazenness, having regard to record, to put forward. Sub-clause 1 the foreshadowed amendment proposes that the limitations on action ought to confined to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees for broadcasting or re-broadsible time. casting any portion of the proceedings of - either House of the Parliament. The bill itself providesNoaction or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting Mr Falstein. portion of the proceedings of either House An amendment circulated by the Minister of provides that power to determine' what portions of the. proceedings shall be broadcast or re-broadcast shall repose in the hands of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, provision for the setting up of which is made in earlier clauses. It therefore, be quite in order, according to the bill, as it is proposed evito be amended, for that committee to decide that some other authority than the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agent and employees, should be able to broadcast the proceedings of' House. If it were considered desirable to broadcast through station 2KY, of - Sydney, which is a station conducted under the auspices of theWireless Committee of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, a portion or the whole of a not speech delivered by the Prime Minister r u t h - or some other Minister on matters affectfrom ing Labour policy, there should be no bar the to the committee making a decision that back station 2KY, which is not in the national that network, should be permitted to make as that broadcast. I suggest, therefore, that the clause be adopted in the form, proposed in the bill, because it would cater i o n adequately for contingencies such as In t is g i v e n on have outlined. I commend the bill to the House and say to Opposition members, who claim public that they do not oppose change and used that they are endeavouring to assist this is one of the e as u r e s e v e r prostatutebook of this country, because it will give to the people the opportunity of learning the at first hand, without abridgment or interpretative comment, how their representatives conduct themselves and how his they advance individual and national inof terests. That is why, instead of being delayed, the bill should be passed forthbe with in order that the proceedings of the Parliament may be broadcast to the people of Australia at the earliest pos-r",28
96,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Wilmot) [4.57] - I am not - enamoured of the provisions of this bill. Indeed, I feel most unhappy about its implications. Any measure that does not provide for the whole of the proceedings to he broadcast cannot be satisfactory. As far as I am aware, the only parliament in the British Empire whose proceedings are broadcast is the Parliament of New Zealand. The proceedings of the House of Representatives of that Dominion have been broadcast in full since. 1936. Indeed, for six hours every sitting day the proceedings are broadcast. is approximately 24 . hours a week, which covers all the proceedings. Broadcasting times are varied to suit the sitting times. The system has given general satisfaction, although many people have ceased to listen to the broadcast. ""When the novelty of listening to the parliamentary debates passed the number of listeners dropped considerably. The proceedings in the Legislative Council of New Zealand are not broadcast. I realise the difficulty of broadcasting both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament at the same time. That would involve the use of additional stations and considerable extra expense. It is for technicians to advise in this regard, and it has been suggested that perhaps the proceedings in one House could be recorded and broadcast at some other time. That would probably enable the proceedings in both Houses to be broadcast. Despite the assertions of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Ealstein), the Parliamentary Committee on Broadcastingj-ecommended unanimously the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings of the Parliament. The report statedWe suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from the short-wave stations, except during the short periods when "" s t r a i g h t "" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air. That language is unequivocal, and if the honourable member for Watson cannot understand it, he should obtain a legal opinion with which to fortify his mind. There was a minority report, which suggested that overall control should not rest with the President of the. Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, [77] but that is not germane to this debate; The important fact is that the Parliamentary Committee, after having heard evidence and having deliberated for a considerable time, recommended the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings. The broadcasting of a portion of the proceedings would definitely be at variance with the committee's report. The attitude That of the committee itself, which I endorse, is that all or none of the proceedings should be broadcast. As the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) pointed out last week, a most unsatisfactory position will arise if only a part of the debate is put on the air. For example, one honourable member may attack another while the proceedings are being broadcast. The person so attacked may have a most effective reply to the charges, but when he rises to defend himself, the broadcasting of the debate may have ceased. Justice demands a fair and impartial presentation of the debates to the whole of the people, and that will not be achieved by broadcasting of portion of the proceedings. "" Jockeying"" for position, rushes to speak while the cham-' ber is on the air, and a dearth of speakers when the broadcast is not taking place will be experienced. That will bring about a most undesirable state of affairs. Clause 14 causes me grave concern. It providesNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Last week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) discussed the dangers of this clause in a most informative manner. Every one agrees that in this chamber honourable members should have the right to express their views without fear of incurring legal proceedings, and the protection which is afforded to their remarks is quite satisfactory. But citizens also require protection from slanderous attacks made in this House. Clause 14 gives to honourable members absolute licence to makefalse and malicious statements, and defame citizens, whowill have no redress. That licence, if taken advantage of, would bring the Parliament into disrepute; no one would have respect for the parliamentary institution. The granting of licence to slander is quite unnecessary. The wording of the clause means - that any person-that expression in itself^ is ver y wide-ca n take a small paragraph from an honourable member's speech, divorce it from the context, and broadcast' it , for the purpose of creating in the minds of the listeners amisleading and untrue impression, but he would be immune from proceedings, for libel..",29
97,Mr CA,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,LWEIX - That is not a facti,31
98,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"When the Minister, for Information (Mr Calwell)' replies to the debate-, he will have 'an opportunity to correct me. Does he pit his opinion against that! of the' former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth, Sir George Knowles?'",31
99,Mr CATAVEUL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I might even db' that.,31
100,Mr GUT,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Not withsuccessful results. Giving evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on this subj.ectj the then Solicitor-General said If the whole of the proceedings, not small selected portions, were broadcast, a qualified privilege would apply. This qualified privilege could only bo upsefc by proof of malice, and..it would be difficult to establish malice if the whole of the proceedings were broadcast. The former Solicitor-General definitely advocated the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings. To-day, a qualified privilege exists, and that should suffice. Clause 14 is unnecessary. Apart from a few exceptions, this unqualified privilege, which honourable members enjoy today, has not been abused; but I cannot and will not support its extension into a licence to slander people. The proposal that under certain conditions the privilege shall he extended to the re-broadcasting of any of the proceedings of the Parliament will merely aggravate the danger. Approval for the re-broadcasting of a slander on a person will be established, and the.victim will have ,no redress. The proposal, for re-hroadcasting speeches envisages that a record of the parliamentary proceedings will be cut. A week, a month, or even a year after the speech was delivered in thischamber-, asi unscrupulous personcould divorce some of the honourable member's words from their context, and rebroadcast them without fear of legal proceedingsfor libel.",31
101,Mr CAXWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That is not true.,31
102,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The Minister will have an opportunity later to-refute.my statements-. Some difficulty"" has arisen regarding the land-lines necessary to make it possible for person's in. all parts of Australia to listen to broadcasts of the proceedings of this Parliament',.and unless this problem, is adjusted, onlyNew South Wales and Victoria, will get satisfactory reception. Other States may not get any reception, or have an. inferior reception. The Minister should assure honourable. members that the whole of the people of 1 Australia will be> given an opportunity to listen to the debates of this-Parliament. As' the right honourable, member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) pointed out, the Seventeenth Parliament of the Commonweal th. will shortly cease to exist. Even if. the Senate and the. House of Representatives agree to the bill at this stage, the proceedings of both chambers can be broadcast for only a fortnight or three weeks-. The Parliament then will 'rise,, and honourable members will prepare for the election. In my opinion, honourable members should allow the Eighteenth Parliament to implement, if it so desires, this legislation.. Meanwhile, radio technicians will have an opportunity' to perfect transmission, to all parts of Australia, and the Government's legal officers may re-examine this obnoxious clause 14. If this clause is permitted to stand, in its present form,. I shall vote against the bill.",31
103,Mr SHEEHY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Boothby) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I support the bill, and welcome this proposal to broadcast proceedings of the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and other legal-practitioners in this chamber gave honourable members most informative addresses on the possible legal consequences of broadcasting the debates. They also expressed grave coneern that only a portion of the proceedings would be on the air. It is true that the ideal would be the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings, but the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Chambers) has already explained the reasons why that is impracticable at this juncture. If my speeches are not broadcast, my position will be no worse, regarding publicity, thani t is today. Some time ago, I delivered in this chamber acarefully prepared speech on housing; and! three honourable members opposite complimentedme upon it . But the South Australian newspapers' did not even mention that I bad participated in. the debate. Whether or not that .omission was intentional, I do .not know Most honourable .members have .their own ideas upon that subject. Later, I secured .the ad-(journnient of the debate on. the War Service Homes Bill. Seven or eight.days later, when the House again considered the bill, I subrtiitted in my speech a.number of valuable and practical suggestions for accelerating the construction of war service homes. - Mr AHTKONY -©i d .the Government adopt the honourable member'SfSuggestions-?",31
104,Mr SHEEHY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) was one - of those. who praised my speech. Although 1 resumed the debate, the press reports made it appear 'that ' the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison.) had done so. 'Once again, my speech was not reported in the - newspapers. 'Consequently, the - fact that only a portion of the proceedings of this Parliament will he broadcast does not perturb me. Perhaps I shall be 'fortunate enough, on occasions, to speak when this chamber is on 'the air, and my constituten'ts as a whole will - be .able to hear me. - One objection that has been taken to the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament is 'that it will lower - the public's a-esp.ect for the parliamentary institution.

I do not know whether it will be my - fortune tp have many of my speeches broadcast.; but, as one who mixes f reely with the .electors, I am quite convinced that 'broadcasting facilities - should - be provided .to enable the general public to hear what is being said in this Parliament. From inquiries that have been made, of me, - I am sure that the number - of 'listeners >will increase ; 2113 as the year-s go by. I shall support the bill wholeheartedly.",32
105,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Darling Do.waisrLeader of the Australian 'Country party) [5.16]-It.seem s to be idle toidebate,-at this stage, the merits and - demerits of this bill, for the. Government, consistent with its usual .methods, has already incurred great expense ,and made all provisions for initiating the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings; Having behind it the decision of caucus, and a clear - majority of members in this chamber, the Government (has .not seen fit to wait for parliamentary - approval before incurring substantial expense in preparatory - work. W.e have, in fact, been presented .with - an accomplished fact. This bill - was initiated in .the Senate, where certain amendments were made to it, but sinGe it has come before this House numerous other amendments have been foreshadowed, in the hope rather than the conviction, as far as the members of the Australian Country party are .concerned, that they will .have reasonable consideration by the Government. I understand that .already an .expenditure of - about £10,00!0 has: been incurred in preparatory .work, without troiibling' about the need for parliamentary appr.ov.al. This procedure, unfortunately, is .in accordance with the pattern that legislation has followed since - this Government .has been in office, although it was .unknown previously, j t was quite improper for the Government to anticipate parliamentary approval in this way, particularly as an urgent need exists for the provision of technical apparatus of this description for other purposes. The Government - should have .given some consideration to more urgent needs of the community. We all recognize that broadcasting is desirable, and that the application of it .to parliamentary proceedings is in accordance with present-.day movements for the adoption of scientific methods. Procedures acceptable in years gone by nave become outmoded today. Broadcasting is a scientific method of communication which should be applied to parliamentary proceedings in order 'that 'the people may be enabled to inform themselves in an up-to-date way of the doings of their elected representatives. But the incurring of an expenditure of thousands of pounds, and the use of large quantities of technical equipment for this purpose, which could have been applied to the provision of new country telephone services or to increasing the efficiency cf established services, would have heen far preferable, at least until legislative authority had heen obtained for the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. At this period of our history the Government should have been devoting all the resources at its disposal to the promotion, of ways of increasing the productivity of the country and improving our enconomic conditions. I am informed that an expenditure of £50,000 will be necessary to provide even the partial parliamentary broadcasts which the Government 1 envisages. I believe in a policy of "" first things first"". The crying need of Australia today is a reduction of governmental expenditure as the forerunner to a reduction of taxation. A reduction of taxation would stimulate production. With an increase of production revenue from taxation would increase even if the rates of tax were reduced, as they should be. I disapprove of the proposed expenditure of £50,000 on a partial broadcast of parliamentary proceedings at a time when country people find it impossible to obtain telephones because of the lack of cable and technical equipment. No doubt a great deal of the material that has been used for the broadcasting installations that are being made in this building would have been suitable for the installation of tele-, phone services. The installations here will serve mainly city dwellers or those in the more developed parts of the Commonwealth. Each capital city already has two national stations, and regional stations have been established in various parts of the country. For this reason people in these areas will reap the maximum benefit from the parliamentary broadcasts, but those living in the outlying areas, who should be given improved amenities, will reap no benefit whatever from these broadcasts. I received a letter yesterday from a resident of CliftonShire complaining of the lack of telephones. I was asked to support requests made for additional Mr Fadden. telephone services on behalf of twenty to 25 farmers residing in the shire, at various distances from the township. In some cases deposits had been paid for over six months, but the hold-up was said to be due entirely to the lack of technical equipment. In the electorate of .the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), which is by no means remotely situated in relation to some parts of the Commonwealth, the people cannot obtain any satisfactory service from existing regional stations, and very few people in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Adermann) reap any advantage from them. I have .been informed that it is not the intention of the Government to broadcast parliamentary proceedings through Dalby, where one' of the most powerful regional stations in, Australia was constructed by the previous Government in order to give an improved broadcasting coverage to people residing in Western Queensland and central South Australia.",32
106,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The right honourable gentleman has been misinformed.,33
107,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member for Maranoa told me that he had made inquiries on this subject from the appropriate authority and had been informed that the Dalby station will not be used. I regard that as scandalous An honourable member has interjected that I have somersaulted on this subject. I have not done so. I informed the Broadcasting Committee that I believed in the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, but I did not consider that the' system should be instituted for the benefit of city dwellers, at the expense of the country people, nor did I consider that partial, indefinite, and incomplete broadcasts would be satisfactory. I am favourable to the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings in accordance with the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee. In order that honourable members may be clear as to my views on the subject. I shall read the evif dence.that I gave before the committee. I said I agree that it is desirable that the debates of the Parliament should be broadcast. I have given some thought to the matter, and realise that there are debits as well as credits. On the debit side, there would be the tendency to stifle debate. I say that from my experience as the leader of a party. Even today in order to obtain publicity, some members are not prepared to speak at a certain hour of the night, but prefer to postpone their contribution to the debate to the following day, when they can be reported by the press. In recent times, we have had the experience of debates collapsing long before they rightfull y should because some members were not prepared to proceed as the setting was not favourable to the gaining of publicity. That position would be aggravated by the broadcasting of debates, because only a limited number of hours would be favourable to the gaining of publicity and everybody would not be able to speak during that period. On the eredit side, the broadcasting of debates would induce members to engage in greater research and to pay more attention to the composition of their speeches. These would not be so spontaneous as are speeches made from a few notes. Nevertheless that is a very desirable aspect. On the other, hand, broadcasting of debates would probably prevent members from.making certain charges which today are made under privilege. They are informed by correspondence that certain things are going on, and in all conscientiousness put forward those views ,on the motion for the adjournment of the House. If they were to be subjected to an effective reply by n Minister f u l ly informed of the facts, that practice would probably break down. Senator MCKenna referred to the broadcasting of questions. Those who have sat in opposition know that very often a question is more effective than a speech from the "" parish pump "" point of view in an electorate. It is easy to obtain a reply from the secretary to a Minister, but from a political point of view that is not always desirable because the member must let his informant know that he is pressing the matter in the House. Questions without notice probably could be broadcast,- but what about a question upon notice? A member places on the notice-paper a question relating to a matter that is probably of national importance, with respect to which he genuinely desires to obtain information, and the reply is furnished at a much later date. The mechanics of the matter rather condemn the practicability of the proposal. The experience in New Zealand has been cited. As Mr Speaker has said, the conditions in New Zealand are entirely different from those in Australia. In the first place, that dominion does not differentiate between national and regional stations. I approach the matter from the standpoint of the Australian Country party. In ail the capital cities there are two national stations. What would be the position of the people in the country, who have to depend on regional stations, if debates in the Senate and the House of Representatives were broadcast simultaneously? Has any thought been given to the difference in times between the eastern States and Western Australia? How would that be overcome? I believe Mr Speaker stated that more legislation would be initiated in the Senate, in order to overcome the objection that that chamber does not deal with the matter when it is fresh. The most important debates we have had in recent months have been those on the banking bills. These were originated in the House of Representatives and were debated for days, almost every member participating. Who would listen to a broadcast of a debate on them when they went to the Senate ? Then we have the budget, the basis of the whole of our constitutional authority. Obviously, it must be initiated in the House of Representatives. It is debated for days, mid eventually finds its way to the Senate. Who would listen to a repetition in the Senate of all that had been said in the House of Representatives. Those are pertinent considerations in determining the desirability or otherwise of broadcasting parliamentary debates. It must be realized that, of necessity, most of our legislation must first pass through the House of Representatives, because the Senate is a house of review. There are only a few measures which could be initiated in the Senate with a view to obviating the repetition there of what had been said in the House of Representatives. Mr Speaker's political experience and knowledge of Standing Orders are much greater than mine, but I am sure that he will agree with me that there are only few measures which could be fresh news in the Senate. Could the proceedings of the Parliament be broadcast by the - Australian Broadcasting Commission with its existing facilities? It would be all right for the city-dweller, who has two national stations, but the countryside is entirely dependent on the regional stations. Licence-holders might listen for a while to political debates broadcast over regional stations, but would they consider it more important than listening to entertainment? The amenities of people who live in the country are few. How many additional stations would be needed to give a complete cover to both Houses continuously during the sittings of the Parliament? Whatever at&tioiis might be used, there would be a period of overloading and a period of unemployment, because the Parliament does not sit continuously throughout the year. Because of exceptional circumstances it has sat since February of this year. If stations are to be specially erected in order to overcome difficulties during peak periods, when both Houses are sitting and a full cover is needed, what will be the cost of the unemployment of those stations while the Parliament is not sitting? Whilst agreeing that it is desirable to have Parliamentary debates broadcast, I am not so enthusiastic in regard to the practicability of the proposal, having regard particularly to the cost. I should be opposed to fixation of the order of debates; in that respect I agree entirely with Mr Speaker. If that suggestion were adopted, constituted authority would be infringed; because, as Mr Speaker has said in no uncertain terms, in his eyes every member has an equal right to the call . whatever may be his oratorical qualifications or his ability to handle the subject. That right has to be preserved unimpaired. I also agree with Mr Speaker that if you were to pick out the "" high lights"", or choose the man best qualified to discuss them, you would break down the democratic feature of responsible government. You have to consider whether the debates are to be artificially planned or delivered in anatural atmosphere from a democratic centre. The solution is yours. I would be totally opposed to the broadcasting of debates in any sectional form. Unless everybody could have the same right to listen in, I would not favour the proposal. I - would also oppose the addition of one penny to the liabilities and responsibilities of the taxpayers. There is also another aspect of which we must not lose sight. The Commonwealth Parliament is not the only Parliament in Australia; there are also the six State legislatures. Any layman who has taken an interest in this debate must have been impressed at law. by the warnings and cautions of legal members of this House. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has stated in concise and understandable language all the disadvantages, difficulties dangers, from the point of view of privilege, that would attend partial broadcompletely. casts. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) also has given to us the benefit of his expert knowledge. The honourable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) took the right honourable memexpended ber for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) to task for having ventured into the realms of legal interpretation without being qualiable fied to do so. He also stated that truth an absolutedefence; if the matter be true, the defence of privilege does arise. I remind him that that statement is not in accord with the law of libel slander in Queensland; there, any matter published must be not only true, but also for the public benefit. As the honourable member himself is not fully acquainted with the law, he is not qualified to take, the right, honourable member for Cowper to task for having ventured to interpret the law of privilege as he understands Last week, .the honourable member for New England asked Mr Speaker to state hi3 legal responsibility, and that of honourable members, as well as .the operators of the broadcasting equipment, in certain cirbe cumstances. Mr Speaker replied that he had just received an opinion from the Solicitor-General, and that he would make it known to the House in due course.. The present is an opportune time to let have the benefit of the opinion he has received. By clause 14 the Government is endeavouring to protect any person who broadcasts any portion of the proceedings of either House of the' Parliament. Mr Fadden. understand that the, broadcasting equipment is the property, not of the. Australian Broadcasting Commission, but of the Postmaster-General's Department; that there is a definite partition between the"" mechanical facilities and the human element.",33
108,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The line is drawn at the microphone.,35
109,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I should like to know whether that equipment will be amply protected. In certain circumstances, a .printing press and other equipment can be seized to defray the costs of an action This is' not the right time, nor are the circumstances appropriate, for the making of this experiment. The broadcasting of and parliamentary debates must come; but - when it comes it must he undertaken The proposal placed before the Parliament and the country is too incomplete and partial to ensure that value will be obtained from the expenditure. Public money should not be wastefully. The first essential at the moment is the reduction of govern' mental expenditure so as to effect desirreductions of oppressive taxes. If is the Government sincerely desires to give to the people the benefit of modern means not of communication-wit h which I agreeit should provide for not only a full and cover of the proceedings of the Parliament but also the reception of it by every citizen of Australia. There must not be either partial broadcasts or partial reception. There are people in Australia who have not the-benefit of listening to national stations, and they should receive whatever amenities may be availit. able in these modern times. .Too much consideration is paid to the city dweller at the expense of' the real wealth-producersin the country districts. The basic consideration in all circumstances should the provision of amenities for people in the remote parts of the continent, whocannot avail themselves of existing channels of communication as cheaply and as readily as can those who live in the more us densely populated - areas. Having regard to the expense involved in thisexperiment of partial broadcasts, the Government would be well advised to defer the experiment and .await a decision onit by the I people, at the next elections, after which the new Parliament could deal with it.",35
110,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Moreton) [5.39] - It is important that the people of Australia should be given every opportunity to become acquainted with parliamentary proceedings, particularly at this time when the country is faced with many difficult problems. .Some newspapers, unfortunately, do not devote to their reports of the parliamentary debates as much space as one would expect. It is important that the people should know how the Government and the - Parliament are handling the many difficult problems with which the nation is confronted. If that U to be achieved by the broadcasting'of parliamentary debates, adoption of the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, which investigated the matter, is essential. It recommended unanimously that the whole of the parliamentary debates should he broadcast. May I refresh the minds of some honourable gentlemen who may not have read the report? The committee took evidence from the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), the two other party leaders in this House, the High Commissioner for New Zealand, and other persons who could give information on this important subject. Its recommendation readsThe whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from the shortwave stations, except during the short periods when "" straight "" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air; that no provision should be made for. any prearranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" s t r a i g h t "" broadcasts of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business, with the qualification that during divisions and such like intervals, an appropriate official (who should be an officer of the commission) should broadcast an impartial description of what is taking place. Needless to say, the facilities should not be used for other purposes when Parliament is in recess. Ft went on to sayWo are aware that in New Zealand doubts have been expressed in certain quarters as to the wisdom of broadcasting the whole of the proceedings, but we are of the opinion that in Australia complete broadcasts of the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset. That was not a qualified recommendation, but was emphatic and was made unanimously. Instead of accepting it, the Government proposes to set up another committee, the constitution of which is provided for by clause 5, and its functions by clause 12. Those functions are(1.) The committee shall consider and specify in their report presented to each House of the Parliament, the general principles upon which there should bo determined the days upon which and the periods during which, the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives Shall be broadcast. (2.) The committee shall, in accordance with general principles, specified by the committee and adopted by each House of the Parliament, determine the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be broadcast. - 1 There is already a Parliamentary Standing Committee to advise as to what should be done. It has unanimously recommended that the whole of the parliamentary debates should, be broadcast. The Government refused to accept that recommendation, and brought down a bill which provides for the appointment of a further committee. I venture the opinion that it will not accept the advice of that committee either. In New Zealand; broadcasts are made of the debates in the House of Representatives only, the Upper House being a nominee chamber. As it is proposed to broadcast the debates in both branches of this Parliament it would he a simple process to follow the course of a bill through one house, and to broadcast the debate on another bill in the other chamber. Difficulties will be experienced at the outset in providing the necessary technical services to enable the debates to be broadcast throughout Australia, but before the scheme is put into operation those services should be made available. Acceptance of the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee would necessitate broadcasting the whole of the debates, and the necessary technical equipment must first be provided. The President of the Senate (Senator the Honourable Gordon Brown) and Mr. Speaker (the Honourable J. S. Rosevear) gave valuable evidence to the committee. The President said In order to make the broadcasting of debates a success, and to achieve the greatest results from an informative and factual point of view, it is essential that the whole of the debates be broadcast. The broadcasts would fai l in their principal aim and object if there were any curtailment of debate or preferment to certain speakers. That is the unqualified view of the President, and it was accepted by the committee. Mr Speaker also gave the following useful opinion:Therefore, if parliamentary debates are to bo broadcast, it would be preferable to alternate the initiation of legislation between the two Houses rather than divide the time. I commend the advice of Mr Speaker to honourable members - He had in mind Fadden) :the practicability of introducing more bills in the Senate.",36
111,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That might he done.,37
112,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The Minister does not know what will he done.,37
113,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The committee to be set up under this measure will decide that.,37
114,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It is appalling to hear such a weak statement. The House down wants to know what is to be done.,37
115,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,We are setting up committee to deal with the matter of would broadcasting times.,37
116,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Throughou t the l if e of this Parliament the Government has been "" passing the buck "" from one authority to another. It should have mind of its own. Mr Speaker further saidThe people might be interested in a debate in the House of Representatives. If the cast were interrupted for the purpose of changing over to the Senate, and returning to the House of Representatives later, I not think that anybody - would be satisfied. I have said that in order to give equitable treatment to both the House of Representathis tives and the Senate, the initiation of legislation should alternate between the two Houses. In any event, the Parliament should not render to the Australian Broadcasting Comthe mission or any other authority the right determine when its proceedings should be broadcast. I urge the House to .implement the .suggestions advanced by Mr Speaker. The following comments were made the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies):"" I do not favour a selective broadcasting of Parliament. I would, for example, be strongly opposed to a limited broadcast for certain hours of the sitting. I would also be very strongly opposed to the confining of the broadcasting to certain selected bers on each side. If the broadcasting of Parliament led to a mere building up of few members on each side, or to a jockeying for position among members so that they might be called during some limited period when the broadcast was on, it would be most undesirable. I therefore believe that either the whole debate each day should be broadcast, or that there should be no broadcast at all. Here is the advice tendered by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr . I should be opposed to fixation of the order of debates; in that respect I agree entirely with Mr Speaker. If that suggestion were adopted, constituted authority would be infringed; because, as Mr Speaker has said in no uncertain terms, in his eyes every member has an equal right to the call whatever may be his oratorical qualifications or his ability to handle the subject. That right has to be preserved unimpaired. I also agree with Mr Speaker that if you were to pick out the "" high l i g h t so r choose the man best qualified to discuss them, you would break the democratic feature of responsible government. You have to consider whether the debates are to be artificially planned or delivered in a natural atmosphere from a a democratic centre. The solution is yours. I be totally opposed to the broadcasting of debates .in any sectional form. Unless everybody could have the same right to listen in, I would not favour the proposal. I would also oppose the addition of one penny to the liabilities and responsibilities of the taxpayers. a The proposals before us are modelled to some degree on the practice in the New Zealand Parliament, where broadcasting has been in operation for the last ten broadyears. Both political parties in New Zealand supported .the' broadcasting of do the proceedings, but the underlying principle insisted on was that the whole of the debates should be broadcast In Parliament, the Broadcasting Committee recommended a full broadcast of surthe debates, and this was approved by President of the Senate, Mr Speaker, to the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party, but the Minister for Information , who represents the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) in this chamber, now supby ports the appointment of a committee which could arrange for the broadcasting of' only certain portions of the debates. Parliamentary privilege could be preserved only if the debates were full y broadcast. The only f a ir and impartial way to broadcast speeches in this Parliamemment would be to publish the views of a honourable member's on both sides of the chamber. If the broadcasting occurred for limited periods only, honourable member's might be subjected to unfair attacks by their opponents and be prevented from having their replies broadcast. In view of the cunning tactics of some members of the Ministry, who might have inside information as to broadcasting times, supporters of the Government could conceivably make wild attacks upon the Opposition and prevent their opponents from being heard over the air in reply. If democracy is to survive, and there is to be f air play in this matter, it is essential that the debates be broadcast impartially. The Postmaster-General's Department should make adequate technical facilities available to enable the debates to be broadcast over the widest possible area. With the development of frequency modulation, it will soon be possible to give broadcasting services in country areas similar to those available in the large cities. That work should be undertaken with despatch. The Government is under an obligation to pay heed to the recommendations .of the Broadcasting Committee. By reading paragraphs 33 to 49 of the committee's eighth report, honourable members will be able to appreciate some of the technical problems associated with the broadcasting of the debates in this Parliament. The Government seems to have rushed into this proposal hopelessly unprepared for its adoption. If it were implemented without the amendments foreshadowed by the Opposition, the scheme would wreck completely the organization of the national broadcasting stations. For an hour before and an hour after the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, the services to Queensland, South Australia . and Western Australia-over the national network would be disrupted. That is the advice of the experts of the department. The Australian Broadcasting Commission would - then be blamed for having failed to provide the broadcasting programmes promised, and would be subjected to endless irritation. The Government should withdraw the bill, recast the whole proposal, and implement the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee on the lines of the system adopted in New Zealand up to the present. The Government has rejected all advice that has been tendered to it.",37
117,Unknown,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,38
118,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Gippsland) [8.0] - I have listened with a great deal of interest to the debate on this bill, and to the reasons or excuses advanced against the acceptance of the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for ' Warringah (Mr Spender). So far as the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament is concerned, the question, I am convinced, is not "" to be or not to be"". Definitely, it is ""to be"". The broadcasts will take place, and the only purpose in debating the measure lies in the remote possibility that we may be able to improve it. The bill is a simple one designed to give effect to the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee. That committee recommended that the entire proceedings of Parliament be broadcast, and it is unfortunate that the recommendation cannot be given effect. It cannot be done because Parliament consists of two Houses with equal rights, and the time available must be divided between them. For that reason, it was inadvisable to proceed with the proposal until it was possible to give effect to the committee's recommendations in their entirety. .The committee was appointed to take - evidence and upon that basis to advise Parliament, but on this occasion the Government is departing from the committee's recommendations. The weight of the evidence heard by the committee was to the effect that the broadeasting of the proceedings of Parliament "" should not be done in such a way as to make for the aggrandisement of any member or party. It was interesting to hear the evidence tendered in support of the proposal to broadcast. Many seriousminded persons believed that broadcasting would tend to raise the tone of' debates. That is a worthy objective, and if the broadcasts have that effect the money which they cost will he well spent. . Quite a lot of people seem to have the idea that the public are awaiting with impatience zero hour so that they may turn the knobs of their receiving sets, and avail themselves of the great boonwhich it is proposed to confer upon them. That idea seems to represent, in the words of Dr Johnson, "" the triumph of hope over experience "". It was certainly not the intention of the Broadcasting Committee that the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings should confer upon unauthorized persons a licence to broadcast statements which, in ordinary circumstances, would be regarded as libellous, and therefore actionable at law. I support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Warringah to clause 14 of the bill. The clause readsNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. There is nothing ambiguous in that language. If the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) were here he would agree with me that the words "" any person "" means 'any person. He has frequently said, when referring to the wording of a clause, that it means what it says. The purpose of the amendment is to limit strictly the number of persons who can claim what amounts to parliamentary privilege. In the ordinary course of events, this privilege is enjoyed by mem-, bers of Parliament only. As the clause stands it would be possible for any unauthorized person to . make a record for broadcasting, and to say that so and so said this or that, and then to broadcast it. I cannot see why any one should object to the amendment, and if the objection is persisted in, such persistence' will merely strengthen the belief that clause 14 is intended to have the effect which we suspect. The amendment, if accepted, would not detract in any way from the merits of the Government's proposal, and it would make the position perfectly clear. I do not like to use the term ""pig-headed""; but it is a very expressive one, especially when applied to opposition to an amendment which could not fail to improve the bill. This afternoon we listened to a lawyer on the Government side defending clause 14 as it stands. Are we to assume that, in the eyes of the legal profession, any provision that is fool-proof is not a good one? ' Mr Calwell - The honourable memless, ber himself, as a member of the Broadpart ifr. Bowden. casting Committee, made the recommendation which is embodied in the' bill.",38
119,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I did nothing of the sort. The Broadcasting Committee had no opportunity to investigate this aspect of the matter thoroughly. In the event of a member of Parliament making an attack on the Government or on the Opposition, as the case may be, just before . broadcasting from the chamber concerned was due to cease, the all-party committee in control of broadcasts should be authorized to order the broadcast to continue until an effective reply to the attack could be made",39
120,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,There is nothing to prevent that from happening.,39
121,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The - Broadcasting Committee agrees that provision should be made for that. If it is not done we are going to ask why. Clause 14 will not affect me because I am not likely to abuse the privilege, but I am afraid that the same cannot be truthfully said of every member of this Parliament.",39
122,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"-'Clause 14 does not affect the privilege of members of Parliament, but only that of persons engaged in broadcasting.",39
123,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Then let us amend the clause to make it more specific. The proposed amendment meets with the approval of the Opposition, at any rate. I , as a member of the Broadcasting - Committee, do not want to be forced into the position of voting against something which the committee recommended. We certainly did not recommend anything corresponding to clause 14, and if it remains unaltered I shall have to vote against the measure because, in its present form, it represents an abuse of the committee's recommendation. I urge the Government and its supporters seriously to consider the advisability of amending the clause so that, while not withdrawing a privilege properly enjoyed by members of this House, the public may yet be sufficiently protected.",39
124,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Batman) [8.10] - I agree that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast. However much some people may despise the Parliament, and there are many people who do despise the Parliament, its legislation, neverthedoes command swift obedience on the of the subject. I have said that people may despise the Parliament. Many do. It is quite common to hear members of the . electorate holding forth in a diatribe against members of Parliament, as though members of Parliament were a class apart. ""Well, I have not found that they are a class apart at all. I have' always understood, as the result of long experience, that members of Parliament are drawn fro m common and ordinary people. Looking round this chamber, I would not conclude that its members, particularly those of the Opposition, belie that, impression. In any case, as I have said, broadcasting is the only way to assure the people of a complete record of the parliamentary proceedings. And I have already said that the Parliament, however much some may despise it , does in fact, command swift obedience. Whatever is put into the statute-book generally commands respect. Indeed, is is remarkable how great a respect there is for law, and my experience is that people have a great respect for it . One has only to observe the respect that exists for the law of compulsory voting. I find that there is a very shrewd disposition to respect the law which makes for compulsory voting, although we have proof that it is easy enough to .make excuses for failure to vote. That is my experience, and I am quite sure that it is the experience of others. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) said that we must not slander people under privilege. Well, him, I think I am not accustomed, practice, to use my privilege in Parliato disregard its disciplinary rules. ment to slander others. I am conscious that I regularly do that. .the contrary, I think that, speaking the responsibilty of a member of Parapologize, liament, I avoid, as one is required avoid, extravagant statements, reflecting upon others. But I find that this plaint is made, amongst others, by newssponding papers, in some cases enjoying a circulaslander tion of 120,000 daily, or, at least; claiming to do so, which, perhaps, is a different io mark down the slanderer thing. Well, I would venture to point out that these newspapers, which make When this complaint against members of public, enjoy a privilege which, in fact, can never be overtaken, under which reputations of individuals are constantly assailed, and numbers of others outside 1 2121 the Parliament, who do not even enjoy the slight protection that members enjoy, are slandered vilely and to the utmost. Yet editors make these strident complaints in the columns of the daily press against members of Parliament, because they, it is said., slander other individuals to whom no opportunity to reply is vouchsafed. Members of Parliament, are subject to very strict rules as to their conduct, and those rules are often applied in a summary manner, A single vote on the part of the majority of the House can turn any honourable member out of this chamber. A single vote on the part of the majority of the House can suspend an honourable member and deprive him of the privileges which he has won at the ballot-box. In a number of ways, although apparently a member of the Queensland Parliament seems to have been .able to dodge such treatment, honourable members are subject to various forms of discipline. I have been long enough in this House to remember an honourable member being expelled, unjustly, I think ; but he was ejected nevertheless. And, although the requirements of democracy are that such an honourable member may still submit himself to the electors, it is historic that in many cases- I mention, for instance, Wilkes and Bradlaugh-h e has been obliged to submit himself repeatedly for re-election before he established his undoubted democratic rights, because the like term of a parliament is not such as a as to encourage honourable members. I not have sometimes succeeded professionally On in marking down the newspaper slanderer with and have required him to withdraw and a fact of which I am not a little < to proud. It is very seldom that one finds 'the withdrawal, or the apology, compublished in a position even correto that in which the itself was published; but the fact remains that one is able sometimes and require him to make tardy amends. he does attempt to make the amends he does so with very bad grace, and I have had occasion to point this out to many of my newspaper friends. Newspapers employ men of different types in their work of circulating news and, like members of Parliament, some of tbese men are scrupulous whilst some are utterly unscrupulous. speak as one who has had a long experience of the newspaper world, and I have found that newspapers are not always particular, but I hope that the time will never come, and I ask honourable members opposite to support me in the view that it should never come, when the ages-old and very important privilege of Parliament shall be destroyed. This privilege lies at the base of popular rights. It rests upon the rights of individuals to come to the Parliament, where alone they may utter the thing that is in them because of the right which they draw from the people. The individual is returned to the Parliament, and it is his proud privilege, but not so proud as it might appear, to say in the Parliament what he cannot under any circumstances say in any other place. As I said, that right is drawn from popular rights. Sometimes the individual says something that may be unjust, but, in all circumstances, it is much better that he should say the thing which is unjust than . that he should be prevented from saying it. He says the thing-in my opinion, very properly-that he thinks should be said. Sometimes, perhaps, the statement should not be made, but the fact remains that he, at that time, considered that it should be made, and it is better that he should say it in Parliament rather than that he should bottle it up and say it privately to individuals because that might do more harm than the original publication in the Parliament would do. The opposition to this bill has a political motive. The purpose of honourable gentlemen opposite is to stall off the' broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings with the true and certain knowledge that they will get consideration in the daily press. That seems to be the general view. The press of the metropolis and the country districts gives to them a much better deal than it habitually gives to members of the Labour party. The Opposition derives much more support electorally from the press than do honourable members on this side of the chamber. Wealth is on their side. I remember the extraordinary propaganda inflicted on the Mr Brennan. people which resulted in my never-to-beforgotten defeat. I Mr Archie CAMERON - Never-to be-regretted !",39
125,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member was himself so conspicuously near to defeat that I thought he was gone, and because of his genius for making quips on occasions I was almost ready to regret his political passing.",41
126,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Order ! I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the bill.,41
127,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I am satisfied that honourable members opposite wish to stall the bill for the purpose of working up newspaper support for the elections. I do not promise them a great measure of success in that direction.,41
128,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,We shall hold our own over the system.,41
129,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Judgin g by the cohorts at the back of me who generally support the views which I present for the acceptance of the House, the honourable member will hold his own only until the election. Mr SPEAKER:-Order ! I again ask the honourable member to address the bill.",41
130,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The bill should he generally acceptable. It is acceptable to me and I address myself to it judicially, I - hope, and with discrimination and moderation. Mr MCEwENi-And vituperation!",41
131,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Oh , no. The individual who comes into this Parliament and abuses parliamentary privilege should be dealt with by the Parliament and the electors. . I certainly do not believe that the newspapers, which in the past enjoyed a larger measure of privilege than is accorded to members of this Parliament, should be permitted to continue to enjoy that privilege unchecked. The Parliament would do well to see that the privilege of its members in respect of the words spoken in the Parliament is retained. I say this because I have heard of 'some cases in which members of the Parliament have been denied the right to express their views. I support the bill!",41
132,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Barker) [8.49] - In studying this bill some events come to one's mind; two of which are comparatively recent. During this debate we have heard a lot about parliamentary privilege; yet when we returned here on the 18th June we found that, without any prior consultation in the Parliament, all sorts of arrangements had been made inside this chamber for the broadcasting of the debates. If ever there was a serious and prehensible breach of the privilege of Parliament it was the action of the Government in setting up these microphones we now see before us. No authority whatever has been given by this Parliament, either to the Government or to anybody else, to install this equipment. The next event happened in the Senate today. The matter that I want to canvass is the reliability of the news broadcasts of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament by the Australian Broadcasting Commission today. I have been informed that one of the best speeches ever made on a certain aspect of foreign relations, whether one agreed with it or not, was made today in the Senate by Senator Armstrong. Yet, apparently because the honourable senator made bold to make certain critical remarks in regard to the handling of the Spanish, situation by the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt), not one reference to the speech was made in the 1 o'clock news broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to-night.",41
133,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Order ! The honourable member is well enough acquainted with the Standing Orders to know that he must not allude to any debate of the current session in the Senate.,42
134,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,We are debating broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament.,42
135,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Quite clearly, the honourable gentleman was referring to a debate that took' place in the Senate today. In fact, he cited an honourable senator's speech. He must desist.",42
136,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"What was omitted from ""the news broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to-night provides some justification for a closer acquaintance by the electorate with what is taking place in this Parliament. I am not opposed to broadcasting the proceedings of this House. I believe that the more closely acquainted the electors become with the truth of the position in this House, the better will it be for good and sane government. But I am not able to convince myself, and nothing that I have heard from the other side has helped to convince me, that the elector will be better informed by partial broadre- casts of the proceedings of each House of the Parliament. I stand firmly in support of the contention of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden), that, if the electorate is to be fully informed, or is to have the right fully to inform itself, either the whole of the proceedings, or none at all, should be broadcast. I see no half-way house.",42
137,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Does the honourable gentleman .mean that the proceedings of each House ought to be broadcast fully?,42
138,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I see no alternative. Under the Australian Consituation, the two Houses rank as equal in all matters.",42
139,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The honourable gentleman would have both broadcasts made simultaneously? ',42
140,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I see no reason why they should not be made simultaneously, the people having their choice as to whether they shall listen to the House of Representatives or the Senate. The debates in the two Houses are of equal importance. The members of the Senate, unlike the members of the Legislative Councils of the Australian States and New Zealand, the Senate in Canada, and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, are elected.by the same people as elect members to the House of Representatives. Consequently, the electorate is entitled to be fully informed in regard to the proceedings in both Houses. But under this bill it will not be. A committee is to be set up. Doubtless the members of at will go very carefully into the time that should be allotted to each House, and, in their wisdom, with the aid of that redoubtable "" Mr Majority "", who decides so many questions in this world, will determine when broadcasts shall he made of the debates in the House of Representatives, and when they shall be made of the debates in the Senate. It may be that certain debates will be initiated in this House, but will not be concluded before fbe switch-over is made, with the result that listener's will b'e deprived of their right to hear' subsequent speeches oh a' matter in which they arc interested. The Government is .not able to c'anva'ss the matter of expense, which does not scent to worry it in' the slightest degree. We have had before us other bills, one of which provided for the expenditure of ,a mere £S00;000 on a national university which I am quite sure is n6t needed and will never be used. If the Government is prepared to incure the expense of broadcasting the proceedings of this House little additional expense would be involved in broadcasting also the proceedings of the Senate, particularly as that chamber is known to sit on fewer days and for shorter periods than does the House of Representatives. In these modern times we hear a lot about democracy. Not a very good set of definitions of democracy is available. There was a time, when democracy, in other parts of the world,- functioned in a way very different from that in which it functions here. In those days the free men of .the tribe met and decided, by argument if possible and, if not, by more forceful methods, what was to be done.",42
141,Mr CONELAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It has never been practised by the honourable member.,43
142,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Does the honourable member refer to forceful methods? The law does not permit them to be used; otherwise; many decisions might be made much more quickly than they are made by argument. Those days' are gone, perhaps never to return, at all events iii our time. We have reached the stage at which, with the spread of population, the great units of which democratic countries are composed today demand some form of representative government. It is only meet and just that the people who are governed from Canberra, for whom laws are made and in whose supposed interests they are administered by nineteen Ministers^ should know just how this Parliament and those Ministers approach the problems with which they are confronted. My desire is that the people should becomebetter acquainted with the doings of this Parliament, if that be possible. But, against that I - put thisi: The interests of the people, their : BroadcastingBiU 1946. tastes an'd their views, a're very diverse; 1 consequently,' the parliamentary broadcasts will have to compete with other broadcasts. Competition will be met from both the national stations and the commercialstations'. I should say that the commercial stations will be by far the raoTe formidable competitors, because they broadcast such items' as the ""Quiz K i d s"" and radio plays-to whichi I seldom listen except under duress; I have not heard olle in which there was not a murder at least every half-hour, to. say nothing of a little gun-running, and other odds and ends of adventure. Musical people will, of Gourse, adhere to the programmes that cater for their tastes. Is it likely that a very large percentage of the electorate will desire to listen to parliamentary debates? That' is the first question we have to resolve - The second is whether it is likely that a very large percentage of that small percentage will be able^ and willing if able} to listen to_ a debate to its conclusion; They will he in no different condition from others who pick up a volume of Hansard, or who happen to visit . this House, coming"" in and going out wbeii they like. I suspect that there will be occasions on which the elector will be Only too happy to turn the knob, cutting off his or her reception of the parliamentary broadcast and getting on to something that is more interesting and congenial. Furthermore, whatever may be their desires, a great part of the electorate will not be able to afford the time to listen for lengthy periods to'what the Parliament is doing in regard to any important matter. Much as we may desire to have our debates broadcast, the taxpayers have certain rights, but I doubt whether, under the present governmental set-up, they are considered at all. Therefore, we should be well advised to postpone this proposal until after the general elections. It would' not be a"" good thing if our debates were put over the air for the first time just as the present Parliament is about to expire. The scheme if acceptablej should commence when the new Parliament assembles. The closing days of the session will riot afford the electorate the best idea of h'ow Parliament functions. There is bound to be a rush of business towards the end. In some parliaments the 'end is rather sudden and, perhaps, undignified. It may be so on this occasion. There may be disappointment on the part of the people, if they regard this Parliament as a forum where only first-class Orators may find a place. ""Wlien our debates goon the air-, no doubt the electors will have their minds disabused of that idea. I agree with the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), that the Parliament cannot be much better than the people who elect it. I remember one member saying to me that in his view no 'Cabinet could function successfully if more than one-third of its members were - first-rate men. In the case of the present Ministry, nothing like one-third fall within that category, and the best seem to be going overseas at an unprecedented rate. The surprising thing to me is that the Ministry faces the contest ahead of it with equanimity. A good deal may be said in favour of postponing the adoption of the scheme until television is in operation. If to the benefits of broadcasting we could only add those of television, the electors would be perfectly informed of the proceedings in this Parliament. Now and again, under the stress of circumstances, I move about the country a little, and I suspect that with television in operation it might be thought by the electors that they were setting a vision of some animal munching hay. It has been said that Hansard' dresses up our .speeches in such a way that' we ourselves cannot recognize them. With the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) I was listening to one of - my friend's opposite during a trial broadcast. He has a weak voice, but I assure honourable members that Hansard has never done to any member's speech a better job than the microphone did to the voice of my friend opposite. It sounded like that of a first-class orator, so he has nothing whatever to fear from broadcasting.",43
143,Mr BUENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The honourable member should not say such things. They are quite incorrect.,44
144,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"If the honourable member had heard the voice as it came through the microphone, he would have a different opinion. We have to answer one or two questions about this matter. The first is: Will 'the - broadcasting of 'parliamentary proceedings improve the s'tandard of debates ? I have listened to debates in - this chamber for twelve, years, and one of the things I have noticed ; is the increasing tendency on the part of honourable members practically to read speeches rather than deliver thorn. ",44
145,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member for Ballarat has a certain amount of brains. What he has to say is Usually said in committee, and he usually says it in a rather forthright, if somewhat challenging way. The whole subject of the standard of our debates is important. In many 'instances the debate here is spoiled because there is a tendency to deliver set speeches rather than for honourable members to deal with the statements cf the speakers preceding them.",44
146,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,What has the bill to do with the standard of debate?,44
147,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"It has a lot to do with it. What effect will this proposal have? If we do not consider that question, the electors will answer it for us. If the measure will lead to a better understanding of Parliament on the part of the electorate, and a - hetter appreciation of democratic institutions, and if it will instil into the people a much-needed respect for the rule of law, which is often discarded today, then the broadcasting of our debates will prove a great blessing to the community. - Mr BRENNAN - The honourable mem-' ber is begging the question.",44
148,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I would be begging an answer from the honourable member for Batman, but I am afraid that if I did I should not get one. The matters to which I have referred ought to be considered before the measure is approved. I doubt whether the Government had given to the bill, before its introduction, the consideration which the issues at stake demand. No sooner had the bill reached this chamber from the Senate than the Minister in charge of it forecast certain vital amendments relating to privilege. I believe in the maintenance of parliamentary privilege and the rights of honourable members, but I am doubtful whether on certain occasions during this Parliament the right course was taken. I can understand courts of law in British countries will accept the principle of parliamentary privilege, but the broadcasts of parliapresent mentary debates will be heard in than British countries. Once they put on the air they will be heard Dutch, French and American possessions very close to us.

156,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Balaclava) [9.13] favour the broadcasting of parliamentary debates-for better or for worse. liament is at present too remote from people, and the broadcasting of debates will bring it nearer to them. The tion of Canberra tends to create a false impression in the minds of the people garding what happens here. For instance, any one listening to the proceedings , . Broadcasting Bill 19io. that this chamber last Thursday night might be pardoned for thinking that they were taking place in a stadium. At the time, the reporting of Parliament other is dependent upon the press and are Hansard. The newspapers give to the in proceedings of Parliament as much space as they can afford, having regard to the posivarious items of interest which compete to say with parliamentary news. We may be that we are uttering here pearls of or wisdom, but the newspaper reports are in often very much condensed whilst an unseemly incident in the chamber will be to recorded at length and in overtones. That is a pity. On the other hand, the proceedings of Parliament are fully at reported by the Hansard staff which takes great pains' to record our speeches. the However, the circulation of Hansard is, I understand, only about 14,000, and I that all the people, whatever their political opinions may be, should be able to hear the debates. I do not often find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) ; but I believe with him that many persons despise Parliament, and criticize the in democratic way of life, because their opinion of Parliament is based on a misconception. They have not had an opportunity to see the Parliament at work, but n if they were able to listen to broadcasts of in proceedings they might form a better opinion of parliamentary institutions. Members of Parliament form a cross1 that the shortcomings and attributes of is posthe people. After all, Parliament does matter. It is the national forum, the value of which is, unfortunately, the limited by the fact that members cerof the Labour party are shackled by caucus discipline so that, in open ParliaI ment, they are not permitted to speak the freely. The government in office at any time is really an executive committee I appointed by the most powerful party. What it decides becomes law, and the laws Paraffect the well-being and happiness the of every person in the community. If there had been a democratic governmentisolain Germany in 1938-39, such as that which was set up after World War I . , rethe last war would probably never have occurred. We know that in Russia, in neither now nor at any time for the last 25 years, has there been democratic government. In the eyes of the Russians, their government is democratic, but there is no political liberty there .because no political opposition is tolerated, and in elections the people may vote for the candidates of only one party. In a democracy, on the other hand, the people may vote for whom they like, and their representatives in Parliament are free to say what they choose. Therefore, * it is important that the people should be provided with an opportunity to hear their representatives in Parliament. That is what will be achieved by the broadcasting of proceedings. In this instance it will 'represent the application of science for a beneficial purpose instead of, as so often happens, for destructive purposes. Judging by the experience in connection with broadcasting parliamentary debates in New Zealand, nothing but good can come of the innovation. Broadcasting should have the effect of raising the tone of debates in Parliament. A member will think twice before behaving in a disorderly manner when he knows that he can be heard by listeners all over Australia. The broadcasts should also have the effect of improving the diction of - honourable members. There are so many other things' for the radio listener to hear that he will not give his attention to members of Parliament who talk twaddle, or whose manner of speech he regards, as unbearable. I believe that, on balance, good will result from broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. Our national and commercial broadcasting stations are of good standing, as anybody knows who can compare them with overseas broadcasting services. It is the limitation that the Government is proposing to which I object. I do not see how the Government can possibly provide that only parts of debates shall be broadcast. Although I have a motion on the notice paper for tomorrow, I shall not be able to debate it then, because the House has resolved at the instance of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), that Government business . shall take precedence. Under the system that is developing in this chamber, as private members on both sides know, Ministers make long, wearying statements at the table. And it may be that their statements will take up most of the broadcasting time, with the result that the listening public will not hear the ebb and flow of debate, and will thus not be able to form their own conclusions. A thorough inquiry m was made into the proposal that the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament be broadcast, and the recommendation of the committee was that all the debates should be broadcast. For ten years all the debates in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been broadcast. The proceedings of the Upper House in N.ew Zealand are not, I concede, broadcast, but the set-up there is different from that of the Australian Senate, which is elected on the same. franchise as is the House of Representatives. You, Mr Speaker, suggested to the Broadcasting Committee that it recommend that the. proceedings in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament be broadcast, and to enable that to be done you proposed a simple arrangement of the programmes of both Houses in respect of the origination of legislation. Yet the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) declares that the proceedings in both Houses cannot be broadcast. ,",45
157,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The Broadcasting. Committee recommended against the simultaneous broadcasting of the proceedings in the two Houses.,46
158,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It did not.,46
159,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I think the Minister is wrong.,46
160,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"If the Minister says that the Broadcasting Committee recommended against the broadcasting of the proceedings in both Houses, it is evident that he has not read the report.",46
161,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I have, and I will read it to the House later.",46
162,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"At any rate, the Broadcasting Committee did recommend that the whole debate be broadcast, not just bits and pieces, as may be decided by the committee proposed to be set up under this bill.",46
163,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Nothin g of the sort!,46
164,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), who is a member of the Broadcasting Committee, tells me that it made that recommenda; tion, but the Minister says that it did not. The President of ithe.Senate ('Senator Brown) recommended the broadcasting of all the proceedings, and the Broadcasting Committee, on which the Labour party is represented strongly, recom-' mended it. Labour members of the committee are the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson)^ the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins). and Senator Nash and Senator Amour. They subscribed to the recommendation that the whole .debate be broadcast. Yet the ..Government brings down this bill, which runs counter to the recommendations of its own supporters on the ""Broadcasting Committee, Mr 'Speaker and the President of the Senate, and to the practice followed successfully for ten years in New Zealand. This' is an emasculated, inadequate proposal. What the Government proposes is that a committee shall say how much of the debate shall be broadcast and how many speakers shall - be broadcast.",46
165,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,How little and few!,47
166,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Yes . To broadcast only a part of the debate will be undepocratic. The people have a right to know what is happening here, but if a mere fraction of the debate is to be. broadcast or the vilification of an individual is to be broadcast without the reply to that vilification being cast, they will not be able to enjoy thatright and will be given only a distorted picture of the proceedings.",47
167,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Does the honourable member want the whole debate broadcast?,47
168,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Of course, I do. Does the honourable member not?",47
169,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,No .,47
170,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I cannot believe that ceedings shall be broadcast. the honourable member, a former Attorney-General, will be prepared to sit back in silence if he is elbowed off the air by others whom the proposed committee might think more worthy of the right to have their thoughts broadcast. Sooner or later, he will object if that happens. Parliamentary committees have not always been the success that they should have been. I concede that many of them work in earnest and produce good results, but if the proposed committee should decide that certain groups !of Ministers should monopolize the air at the expense-of other honourable members who have something important, not parochial, but national, to say to the electorate through the broadcas'.ing system, that would be most inappropriate. I appeal to the good sense of the Government to realise that the scheme put forward in this ibill is not . workable. Members of the proposed committee will not be able to agree on the subjects that should be broadcast or as to who should broadcast. Now is 'the time 'to put the service on a proper basis. I consider that honourable' members would unanimously approve . if the Government decided to have all the proceedings broad-"" cast. The troubles of Australia are man made - This nation escaped almost unscathed during the war. Blessed by all the resottrces of Providence, it has no real problem that cannot he - solved if only the political parties get together. If parties dropped their party bias and said, ""We will settle these problems "", what a subject that would be to broadcast, but, how narrow-mindedly, the Government says, "" No, all the proceedings will not be broadcast-jus t snippings, clippings and excerpts "". That is robbing the people of a part of their heritage. At the cost of, I believe, £10,000 a forest of microphones was installed in this chamber during the recess, indicating to honourable members that the Government intended to carry broadout the recommendations made to it by providing for the broadcasting of all the proceedings'; but this inadequate, bill, under which a committee will decide how little of the proceedings shall be broadcast, will cause the people to say that the money has been ill spent. I advise the Government to look into the matter again and to agree that the whole of the proNothing short of that will receive the approval of the people.",47
171,Mr BLAIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Northern Territory) [9.26] - This bill reminds me of the decision of Sir Roger de Coverley in. a famous judgment, immortalized by Addison in the Tatler. But, levity aside, there was much to be said on both sides. I am rather diffident about supporting this bill because, not being a gifted speaker, I should be at a great disadvantage in having my speeches broadcast in comparison with ,some honourable members, particularly men on the front Benches, natural orators, who would have a greater appeal to listeners. Butin addressing' myself to the bill I am fortified by the 1 knowledge that, although my electors will be delighted to. listen into the debates, the people generally are not §o interested in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings as honourable members imagine. I have very good reason to believe that they are not. That does not refer to my electorate, because the people""there are.politically minded. They have no legislature, no legislative council, not even a town council. They must be federally and politically minded, because they look to me, as their representative, to solve or try to solve, all their problems, whereas people in the - States have their State legislatures, municipal . councils, roads boards and so on to occupy their attention, and they will not be greatly interested in 90 per cent, of the purely domestic matters that are debated in this House. I admit that the "" hill-billys "" of Kings Cross, the Yarra Bank, the Sydney Domain and such places will be almost diving into their radio, sets to listen to the riotous matter that so often emanates from honourable gentlemen, but they will not be interested in the really sensible speeches that are never even reported in the press. I am delighted when my speeches are not reported, because I know that that indicates their excellence. I remember clearly that when the late Sir Littleton Groom was with me as an independent member of this Parliament he made, one morning, an excellent speech, one that was full of oratory and common sense, but not one word of it was reported in the press. He was disgusted. I mention this for the benefit of new members, and I advise tljem not to be surprised if the press does not report their speeches. Usually, that is a sign that an honourable member"" has made a good speech. If I had the oratory of Lord Rosebery, I should never be in difficulties. I could indulge in his mixed metaphor of which I call to mind the following example: "" I smell a rat. I see it floating in the air. I shall nip it in the bud "". And I am not ,able to emulate Charles Lamb in the use of the long sentence. If I . were, I should be worth listening to. Tbat master of para dox-, G. K. Chesterton, says, "" There are some people who look upon the big things as little things, but men mistake little things for big things "". That observation Gan. be applied in many respects to the Government. And I could quote that great lexicographer, Dr Johnson",47
172,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the bill.,48
173,Mr BLAIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"We are discussing privilege, and the reception of honourable members' voices over the air. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has said, the Government members will be able to dominate the times of broadcasting. They believe that this advantage will enable the Government to win the forthcoming elections. But Dr Johnson said, "" It is a great disadvantage when self-interest coincides with an exact proposition by no means proved "". I give that advice to the Government. Its proposition in this matter is not proved,"" nor is it likely to be proved. Much has been said about privilege, particularly by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan). I recall that when I exercised my right of privilege in this chamber in December, 1934, to expose crookedness in the mining industry in the Northern Territory, the honourable member was the very one to criticize me and my exercise of that very privilege he now professes to admire. On that occasion the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) came to my rescue, and saved the situation on my behalf.",48
174,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the bill.,48
175,Mr BLAIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"We should pay due regard to our privilege as members of the Parliament. We should refrain from abusing.it to the detriment of people outside who cannot speak for themselves. However, an honourable member fails in his duty if he does not exercise his privilege to expose some evil which he knows to exist. Any honourable member who fails in that respect does so because he, is not gifted with intestinal fortitude, hut has the - physiology of a snipe. I believe that the benefits to be derived from broadcasting proceedings in Parliament will not be commensurate with the expenditure involved. Serious-minded people, who would elect a sane government, prefer to read of parliamentary proceedings in Hansard. Honourable members are allowed a free issue of only 35 copies of Hansard. I should like to see that number increased even to 3,600. I do not believe that any honourable member would have any difficulty in distributing that number. Already, my list is full, and in addition I subscribe for copies which I make available to various people. If the Government, wished to induce seriousminded people to read Hansard, it would instead of broadcasting proceedings in this chamber in some hill-billy fashion, advertise the fact that - the yearly subscription to Hansard is 4s., and that Hansard may be obtained from the Government Printer, Canberra. I know of very many people who are hardly aware that Hansard exists. They certainly do . not know where to obtain it, and they do not know its price. If this Government were anxious to serve the needs of seriousminded people in this matter it would advertise Hansard and encourage the public generally to read it. The printed report of speeches in Parliament will always he more serviceable than the broadcasting of speeches, because radio listeners will receive muddled impressions of what happens in this chamber. Honourable member's opposite seem to be very anxious to confine the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliament to stations which serve the capital cities and more densely populated centres. I am astonished at the Government's objection to the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Fadden) that the regional station at Dalby should be used for this purpose. Apparently, no provision is to be made to enable residents of Moresby, Darwin, Alice Springs and the sparsely populated areas to the north of Australia to listen to these debates. I understand that the military authorities are about to relinquish control of eight stations at Darwin, Moresby and other northern centres, which they took over during the war. if the privilege of listening to proceedings in Parliament over the air is to be given to people in the more Mr Blain. densely populated areas, it is incumbent upon the Government to make similar facilities available to people in the outlying areas which I have mentioned - The Government, if necessary, should allow the people of Darwin to purchase the local station and operate it on a community basis as a regional station. The residents of New Guinea have no representative in this Parliament. They look to me to represent them, and to voice their needs in the difficult task of rehabilitating themselves after their awful experiences during the war. I urge the Government to provide a station at Darwin. It has been said that honourable members should say what they mean and mean what they say. If they follow that rule the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliamentmay be of some benefit to the public. However, having regard to the words often spoken in heat in the course of a debate, the written report of - proceedings is preferable to the broadcasting of speeches. Most of ns, I hope, will have something worth-while to say; and I hope that most of us will mean what we say. However, many honourable members opposite speak with their tongues in their cheek. From a national point of view I hope that they do; but from the point of view of party politics I hope that the reverse is the case, because out of their mouths will they be convicted.' I refer honourable members to Professor Walter Murdoch's delightful essay, entitled The Art of Writing. The Professor explained that for many years he had been delivering to university students lectures on the art of writing. He had advised them regarding the proper positions in a sentence of commas, semicolons, emphatic words, and the like. The idea of saying, what we mean, and meaning what we say, will have a direct bearing upon the desirability of broadcasting the debates of this Parliament. Professor Murdoch wroteSay what you mean-ho w easy it sounds, how hard it really is! It is, in fact, an ideal, never to be completely realized by mere mortals. Let me illustrate by a figure of speech which I may have thought of for myself or found in some book or other. (It seems too good to be mine.) There are various ways of getting eggs to market. One way is to put them in a basket and carry them; this is a slow and laborious method, though a fairly safe one. Another way, an up-to-date and expeditious way, would be to put them down the muzzle of a cannon, find the range accurately, take good aim, and shoot them to market. Assume, for the sake of argument, that they would arrive; but in what condition would they arrive? Well, the whole art of writing is the art of getting our eggs to market without breaking them; that is, of getting our ideas to the mind of the reader without changing them beyond recognition. If you can so write that your thought reaches the reader's mind exactly as it was when it was a,thought in your mind, you are the perfect writer. But there has never been a perfect writer. If the spirit of Shakespeare could look into our minds as we read Hamlet's soliloquy, he would say, ""No, no; that wasn't exactly what I meant; you've got it wrong! "" Broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament can serve only one useful purpose. The sooner the debates of the Senate and the House of Representatives are put on the air the better it will be, because I know that if the Government erects regional stations in various country districts Ministers will soon convict themselves out of their own mouths. Therefore, I say "" by all means let the proceedings of the Parliament be broadcast "".",48

Unfortunately, very early in the debate, the Opposition developed a very had attack of the "" jitters "". I do not know what was worrying them Mr MCLEOD. - The forthcoming elections.",50
177,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That must be the explanation. Honourable members opposite have not heen able to address themselves to the provisions of the bill with any sense of responsibility. The tower of Babel never heard more diverse tongues than those spoken on the Opposition benches on this bill. We witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of members of the Broadcasting Committee, which made recommendations on the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament, repudiating their own signatures. I shall hot allow those honourable gentlemen to escape so lightly as they hope. The vicechairman of the, committee is none other than the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis), who presented to this chamber the Eighth Report of the Broadcasting Committee.",50
178,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,And I read that report to the House this evening.,50
179,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member did not read it to the House this evening. He misread and misquoted portions of the report, and deliberately suppressed other portions of it . Another member of the committee is the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr G u y ) . He joined with the honourable member for Moreton in saying that the Broadcasting' Committee made a recommendation in favour of a simultaneous broadcast of both chambers.",50
180,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I did not.,50
181,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I challenged the honourable member on the point, and he did not deny it .",50
182,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I said "" full . broadcasts "".",50
183,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable gentleman spoke of a full broadcast of both chambers. Perhaps I cannot do better at this stage than read portions of the committee's report, and indicate the general tenor of it . The chairman of the committee is Senator S. K . Amour,' the vice-chairman is the honourable member for Moreton, and the other members are Senator .Nash, Senator Herbert Hays, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden), the honourable member for Wilmot, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers), the honourable member . for Bourke (Mr . Bryson), and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) . The committee went to considerable trouble to inform its mind on the proposal for the broadcasting of parliamentary debates. The terms of reference, which the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) gave to the committee, wereTo consider and report to Parliament(a) whether the broadcasting of parliamentary debates is desirable; and (6) if so, to what extent and in what manner should such broadcasts be undertaken. Nearly two years ago the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Smith) raised this matter at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party, .and .also in ithis 'chamber. The honourable member for Eawkner (M i . Holt ) also was very keen that the proceedings of :this Parliament should be broadcast. received its '.terms of reference,' the committee took evidence from representative persons., including the Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour party, a representative of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the High .Commissioner for New Zealand., the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Liberal party, the Leader of the Australian Country party, the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Commonwealth Solicitor General, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter at Canberra, the Acting Director-General, Posts and Telegraphs, the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting'Commission, the General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the former i.Controller of Commercial Broadcasting in New Zealand, the Chief Engineer, Postmaster-General's Departrnenit, and the Chief Inspector (Wireless)., Postmaster-General's Department. paragraphs 3-14 of the report, the experience of New Zealand in broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament of that dominion is recorded.",50
184,Mr BRENNAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Did the committee submit a unanimous report? . Mr Calwell - The report was exclusively unanimous with, the exception of one small but important reservation made by the honourable member for Wilmot, and provision covering that reservation has been included in the bill. The proposed Australian service is canvassed in para-. three graphs 15-17 of the report, the legalsecond aspects are considered in paragraphs 18-39. and the extent of the proposed Australian service is mentioned in paralisteners graphs 20-32. In paragraph 34 the .committee commenced to grapple with cial the problem. It stated that it had canvassed the possibility of using the whole of the 22 national stations for simultaneous broadcast of the proceedings 45 as follows :of both chambers, the course recommended by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), and other honourable gentlemen during this debate. 'The committee made the following observations :- Were it not' for the high expenditure involved, the ideal arrangement would be the Having provision of .a inetwork of ,22 national mediumwave istations >capable .of serving nearly all the populated ,portions of .Australia. Equipment alone, however., would entail expenditure in the nciglibouuhood of £500,000. But apart from the cost, there ar.e insuperable difficulties owing - to the shortage of radio channels, unless the .licences - of some commercial stations were not renewed at the expiration of their annualperiod of tenure, to enable their channels to be allocated for the purpose, or unless recourse is made-to the sharing of channels to-a greater extent than .at present, .with resultant degrading of service to listeners on account of the clash of simultaneous transmission fromstations operating on the same channel. That w.as the unanimous opinion of themembers of the Broadcasting Committee. When it w.as found that because of the insuperable difficulties encountered,' and the large expenditure involved, the proposal to use the 22 national stations was impracticable, the committee set out to discuss other .suggestions for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament. It mentioned a f if t h proposition. In Paragraph 3S-and ' again this was unanimously agreed to-reads A fifth proposition is to use the second national stations 'in the capital cities and ' Newcastle. This idea would result in the service being withheld from country districts which rely on - their local regional station for national broadcast reception. On the other hand, if these regional stations were included, listeners in areas which rely on such stations for broadcast service would not have an alternative national programme. a The Broadcasting Committee then proceeded to discuss the merits of a sixth proposition, involving a .combination of v is i b i l it i e s , viz., the use of the national stations in each capital city and Newcastle, the use of short-wave stations to augment the service for in the country and remote areas, and the use of selected country commerstations willin g to sell time. It rejected the sixth proposition however, and came back to the decision which it finally a reached which is reported in paragraph The only remaining proposition under present conditions is the use of the main national stations in the capital cities and there are in each of the capital cities, two national stations, one the main station, and the other an alternative stationand the national regional stations in the try districts supplemented by short-wave vice to remote areas. In framing this bill the Government effect to that in clause 4 which providesNotwithstanding anything contained in the Australian Broadcasting Act 1942', the Ausable tralian Broadcasting Commission shall broadservice cast the proceedings of the Senate or the House of Representatives from(a) a medium-wave national broadcasting station in the capital city in each State and in the city Of Newcastle in the State of New South Wales; and (6) such other national broadcasting stations (including short-wave national broadcasting stations) as are prescribed, upon such days dnring such periods as the commitregulations. tee determines. It was foreseen, at that stage, that over there would be a conflict as to the r i g the times during which the prothe ceedings of the Parliament could be P a r broadcast. It was accordingly decided j o in that a committee consisting of members of both Houses of the Parliament should be established. Provision for that is inspecify cluded in the bill. In his reservation to the report, the honourable member for which which, Wilmot suggested that in the case of the upon House of Representatives a committee consisting of the Speaker, the Prime Minister, another Minister nominated, by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the ""Leader of the AusParliament, tralian Country ' party should be appointed to determine matters relating broadcast. to the times of the broadcasts and other matters affecting the. privilege of members. The honourable gentleman also added this observationThe Senate no doubt would feel that some similarly constituted committee should be set up. The result should be a joint committee of the two Houses. That reservation was made by a Whip on the Opposition side of the House, and, as I have said, provision has been made in the bill to adopt his suggestion.",51
185,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,But no provision should be made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times.,52
186,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I shall deal with that illusion of the honourable gentleman presently. The Broadcasting Committee unanimously recommended all that is eontained in this bill, and the honourable member apparently does not know what counhe signed, has forgotten what he signed, seror does not care what he signed - And any one of these, is equally reprehensible. gives The honourable member also agreed to paragraph 50, which readsWe do not consider that, it would be advisat this stage to specify particulars of the in legislation, as experience may disclose a need for modification of the detailed arrangements initially decided upon. It would therefore be preferable, as regards this particular subject, to prescribe the details in regulations under section 107 of the Broadcasting Act, as they could be altered more readily by amended regulations than under the processes involved ' in. amending them if they were set out in the act. Any such modifications would ' still be subject to the sanction of Parliament and under the procedure laid down for making The Government has decided not to hand to anybody outside the P a r l i a m e n t h t to make regulations c o n t r o l l in g broadcasting of the debates of the l i a m e n t . It has decided to set up at committee of the P a r l i a m e n t for that purpose. Clause 12 of the bill provides(1.) The Committee shall consider and in a report presented to each House of the Parliament, the general principles upon there should be determined the days and the periods during which, the proceedings of - the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast. (2.) The Committee shall, in accordance with general principles specified by the Committee and adopted by each House of the determine the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be Thus honourable members will be given an opportunity to debate the principles recommended by the committee and if it is thought that the committee has recommended a procedure unacceptable to - the House, objections can be made. There is nothing to prevent the committee from deciding that once a bill is initiated in either chamber of the Parliament it shall be broadcast through all stages until the debate is concluded. There is nothing to justify the suggestion that there will be a partial debate or that some members will be given advantage over others. Before this bill came before the House, the Broadcasting Committee was in agreement with the general principles outlined in it, but some members of the committee apparently cannot understand the draftsman's way of interpreting their ideas; I assure them that what the Government has done in this h ill is even better than most of them desired.",52
187,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,-The h i ll apparently does not represent what the members of the committee had in mind.,53
188,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I ' am suggesting that'the provisions of the bill represent an improvement on what they had in mind. The members of the committee wanted to have these matters dealt with by regulation: the bill prescribes that that shall be left to the joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament. Paragraph 52 of the report reads:We suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned not in one chamber for the whole of the time to the exclusion of ""the other chambershould be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from the short-wave stations, except during the short periods when "" straight"" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air; . That is more likely of achievement through a committee than by any other means. How could the President of the Senate and Mr Speaker of the House of Representatives-and this was the weakness of the report-decid e the issue as to which proceedings should be broadcast if both chambers desired to have their proceedings broadcast taneously ?",53
189,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I suggest that the Minister read paragraph 53.,53
190,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I have no objection to reading it , though the honourable member himself declined to do so.",53
191,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I did not have a copy of the report at my disposal then.,53
192,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The paragraph readsWe are aware that in New Zealand doubts have been expressed in certain quarters as to the wisdom of broadcasting the whole of the proceedings, but we are of the opinion that in Australia complete broadcasts of the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset, leaving the question of modification for consideration in the light of experience. It was not contemplated that the proceedings of both Houses should be broadcast simultaneously.",53
193,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,No one has suggested that.,53
194,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The Leader of the Opposition suggested it , as also did the honourable members for Barker (Mr . Archie Cameron) and Richmond (Mr . Anthony). In paragraph 49 the Broadcasting Committee had this to sayThe difficulty of varying times could be overcome, where necessary, by recording the proceedings as they occur and broadcasting from the discs at the proper times, using land-lines, for transmission of the recordings to the local stations from which the broadcasts would be made. Most of the criticism has been in respect of re-broadcasts. It is feared by honourable members opposite that something - may be done, which will be detrimental to their interests. Yet the course mentioned was actually recommended. The members concerned did not know what they were doing, or they have now developed a fear complex in regard to the result of the elections. Strong protests have been made about clause 14, which providesNo action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Honourable gentlemen opposite have discovered in that provision a grave attack upon the privileges of members of Parliament, and a device whereby one political party will secure, an advantage over another. The honourable member for Moreton subscribed to the following recommendation' in paragraph 5 1 : simul- The introduction of legislation to provide for the application of absolute privilege to such broadcasts is also recommended",53
195,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,On the advice of the Attorney-General.,53
196,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am reading what the honourable member recommended, not his afterthought. The recommendation continuesas an extension of the privilege conferred by legislation passed in 1935 in respect of Hansard reports.",53
197,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That is in respect of a broadcast of the whole of the proceedings.,53
198,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"In paragraph 51, the committee recommended the introduction of legislation to provide for absolute privilege in respect of the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings, in the same way as the publication of Hansard is privileged. Let me show the way in which privilege is accorded to the publication of Hansard. Section 4 (1) of the Parliamentary Papers Act 190S-1935 providesNo action or .proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under the authority of the Senate or of the House of Representatives. Tn the bill, those words have been repeated where they apply. I shall read them againNo action or. proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person- Here is where the change occursfor broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. The Government has' done precisely what the committee recommended; yet some honourable members are still not satisfied!",53
199,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The Minister is evading the issue.,54
200,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That is a malicious statement. The provision made by the bill is identical with that made in respect of the publication of Hansard and other documents published under the authority of this Parliament. It was necessary to do that, in order to protect the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the performance of their duty as broadcasters of the proceedings of the Parliament. Mr BOWDEN,-That ' is all that we want.",54
201,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That is all that has been done. The provisions of clause 14 do not affect the privileges of this House. Those privileges are protected, not under any legislation of this Parliament but by section 49 of the Constitution, which readsThe powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and of the House of .Representatives, and of the members of the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and its members and committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth. That is the source from which we derive our privileges. No parliament of the Commonwealth, from the first to the seventeenth, has passed any legislation to give to this legislature any greater powers than are enjoyed by the members of the House of Commons. This Parliament has not sought to take away the privileges given by section 49 of the Constitution, nor has it sought to take to itself additional privileges. Therefore, all this talk about the privileges of members being affected by clause 14 is merely a part of the hyperbolical nonsense to which we have been listening for two days.",54
202,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Accordin g to my understanding, when privilege is extended to cover any person, it covers every person.",54
203,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"An y person engaged in broadcasting the proceedings of this Parliament, just as the persons who record, print or publish what is contained in the documents of this Parliament are privileged and protected against any action in any court.",54
204,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,When the privilege refers to the broadcasting of any portion there is no limitation.,54
205,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"A limitation on the power to broadcast anything is imposed by the relevant sections of the AustralianBroadcasting Act. Section 63 of that act covers the matter in part, and so does section 92. I am giving to honourable gentlemen opposite a lot of cheap legal advise, and I hope that they will benefit from it . Section 63 of the Australian Broadcasting Act providesThe licensee of a commercial broadcasting station shall not relay or broadcast any part, of the programme of any other broadcasting station, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere, without the consent of the owner or licensee of the originating station and the approval of the Minister. That at least answers the arguments of those who fear that-something sinister is being attempted under this legislation. Section 93 makes this provisionA person shall not, without the consent of the owner or licensee of the station and the approval of the Minister, publish in any manner whatsoever any portion of the text of an item transmitted by a broadcasting station, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere. That would prevent any newspaper or person from taking a note of a broadcast of the proceedings of this Parliament, and subsequently publishing it ; consequently, the danger of partiality, which honourable gentlemen: opposite have convinced themselves exists, has substance only in their own disordered imaginations.",54
206,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The Minister cannot convince me that "" any. person "" means other than "" any person "".",55
207,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,If the honourable member is so easily convinced I am astounded that' any electorate should send him to this Parliament.,55
208,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"May I interrupt the Minister, in order to put a question to him ?",55
209,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"No . The privilege granted by the Constitution, which protects the members of this Parliament, is a privilege that ' has existed from the earliest days of colonial legislation. In the legislation of the parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Ausa tralia there are provisions somewhat simiwhich lar to that which appears in the Ausing tralian Constitution; but - they give members of the State legislatures protection than is accorded to members the House of Commons. It has remained foran honourable member, who is not here to-night to move his amendment in committee, to rise in his place in this ParliaThis ment to suggest during the earlier stages of the bill, that the privileges which have existed in this country under all forms representative government for over years - should now be diminished. honourable member for Warringah (M - Spender), in making his contribution the debate, said thisI have for a long time been convinced that quite apart from the aspect of broadcasting, there is a need for the establishment committee of privileges, consisting - of Speaker, the Leader of the Government the Leader of the Opposition, which, upon an honourable member rising in his place claiming that parliamentary privilege has been abused, should have power to discipline the offending member, and, in extreme cases, to impose ""penalties even as drastic as suspension from the service of this House for a. long period. . . . The absolute privilege which applies in this House springs from ancient times. It springs from the necessity that men charged with legislating for the country shall be entitled speak without fear or favour, and T can understand that. ""However, I believe that absolute privilege does require remodelling in the of .present-day circumstances. That is what Hitle r said, and what every dictator has said. It is always said by those who desire to whittle down the privileges of the Parliament so that wealth may bestride this country and dominate it . Honourable members are sent here by the common people, and they are protected in anything they say for the comnion good; but, if the honourable member for Warringah had his way, there would be no protection ""at all, and certainly not for members of the Labour party. There are people in this country who think that it is a breach, of privilege to say that the present system of society is based on the lie that every citizen can get social justice and economic security. Certain honourable members opposite have developed strange ideas about privilege. The Leader of the Opposition said that the proper way to correct certain matter affecting' privilege to he had referred was "" not by removthe privilege of the Parliament. That to would be a tremendous step and a no more very dangerous step"". - The honourable of member for Warringah remarked. I see no reason why the privilege extended to honourable members in this House should be unlimited. is not a bill in which to make any .alteration of the privilege of members of this Parliament, because the measure will of be administered by the Postmaster90 General (Senator Cameron). He is not The the Minister to deal with questions of r . members' privileges - Therefore, much to that the honourable member for Warringah has said in his - contribution to the debate will probably not be considered by the House at all. He has foreof a shadowed an amendment which full y Mr complies with a definition given by the and late Alfred Deakin, in describing a and speech made by one of his political opponents, when he said, "" It consists of a necklace ofnegatives"". I have no doubt that the honourable member's amendment will be rejected at a later stage. I have quoted from paragraphs 43 to .49 of the report of the Broadcasting Committee, to which the honourable member for Moreton referred, and have pointed to out that the signature of the honourable member was appended to the report. I light quoted the appropriate reference in the. report regarding the privilege which should be given to the members of the committee to be established under the bill and any other persons engaged in broadcasting the debates. That covers the employees of the commercial stations and. any,' short-wave stationswhich broadcast speeches made i a this, or the other House of the Parliament from the floor, of. the House. I hope later, that we may . have a. joint sitting, of. both branches of the legislature to hear the Prime Minister of Great. Biit'ain,. Mr A-ttlee. Perhaps, honourable members opposite will object to. that.",55

The protection is; not. extended to any person at all, but to any person engaged in the work of broadcasting the, proceedings in Parliament. Mr G u v - I desire to make a personal explanation. I have been grossly misrepresented by the Minister for I m migration (Mr Calwell). that I had repudiated the signature which-1, as' a member of a the Broadcasting. Committee,' had attached to its report. It is true that the committee cam vassed all possibilities of broadcasting the proceedings of this. Parliament, and the Minister took up most of his time in reading the comments of the committee. But the recommendations rather than the comments are the meat of this report. The committee was charged with the responsibility of inquiring whether the broadcasting of parliamentary debates is desirable, and', if so, to what extent should' such broadcasts be undertaken. In answer to that I turn to the recommendation which I claim is meat and not comment. The recommendation of the committee to which I consented readsThat during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations, and from theregional stations,, as well as the. short-wave stations, except during the short periods when ""straight"" news sessions are normally on the air.. That no provision should be. made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" straight"" broadcasts of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of Parliamentary business, with the qualification that during divisions and such like intervals, an appropriate official (who should be an officer of the Commission)- should broadcast an impartial description of what is taking place. Needless to say, the facilities should not be used for other purposes when Parliament is in recess. Paragraph5'3' is as follows*?We are aware that in New Zealand' doubts have been expressed in certain quarters as. to the! wisdomof broadcasting the whole of. the proceedings, but we are of the. opinion that in Australia complete broadcasts of the actual proceedings should be tried at the - outset, 1 leaving the question of: modification for consideration in the light of experience. Bearing those recommendations in mind ,. 1 I can only assume that the Minister is unable tounderstand English. I cannot provide hi m with the capacity tograsp the facts, and if hecannot understand straightforward language I must leave him in his colossal ignorance. Mr GAXWEM , - I desire to make a personal explanation. I have not misrepresented any one. I quoted from paragraph 45 of the report the following passage ?He said The only remaining proposition under present conditions is the use of the main national stations in the capital cities and the national regional stations in the country districts, supplemented by short wave service to remote areas . . .",56
213,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That is the comment of the committee, not its recommendation.",57
214,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That is what the bill, in fact, provides for. The incidental things are left for determination by the committee which is to be set up accordingly to the recommendation signed by the honourable member himself. I have stated the facts, and I now leave it to those unrepentant penitents who sit opposite to extricate themselves as best they can from the horns of their own dilemma. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 3 .agreed to. Clause 4' Notwithstanding anything contained in the Australian Broadcasting Act 1942, the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall broadcast the proceedings of the Senate or the House of Representatives from(a) a medium-wave national broadcasting station in the capital city .State and in the city of Newcastle in the State of New South Wales; and (6) such other national broadcasting stations (including short-wavje national broadcasting stations) as are prescribed, upon such days and .during such periods as the Committee determines.",57

I do so for the reasons advanced by myself and other honourable members during the second-reading debate. The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the whole of the proceedings of this House or of the Senate shall be broadcast, instead of only part of the proceedings as proposed in the bill. I submit that to make a broadcast of only part of the proceedings would be a waste of money, and would not achieve the purpose which we have in mind.",57
216,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Watson) [10.27] The point to 'be considered is whether the broadcast shall represent a fair and substantial account of the proceedings of the Parliament. As it is intended to broadcast proceedings for' some hours each day, this requirement will be fulfilled.",57

218,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I have no doubt that the committee, when appointed, will ensure that in the broadcasts a fair and substantial account of the proceedings is given. Therefore, it will be unnecessary to expend money on broadcasting the whole of the proceedings. Moreover, the committee has advised that technical difficulties in the way of such broadcasts are insuperable.",57
219,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.30] - The amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) raises in a neat form one of the two principal matters debated on this bill. I have risen not merely to repeat what I said on the second reading, but to say in each that when the debate began I was under the impression that this was a non-party measure, that it concerned the relation of outside public authorities to - the Parliament, and I therefore express my profound disappointment that we should have been treated at the end of the second reading debate to a purely party political outburst on the subject. The question before the committee is not to be determined'by arguing about what the Broadcasting Committee said. Its views are the in print, and we all have had the opportunity of reading them and we know what they are. The question involved in this clause is whether we should broadcast the whole or only a part of the proceedings of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Some attempt has been made to suggest that honourable members on this side do not want to have the proceedings of the Parliament broadcast. Why honourable gentlemen opposite should deem this to be so I do not know. For one, I am very keen on having the proceedings of the Parliament broadcast, and I do not imagine that any more harm will come to one side than to the other as the result of - their being broadcast. But the real question, to my mind, is whether we are to broadcast only a part of the proceedings. That is a matter which concerns all honourable members, regardless of the party to which they belong. It is not a matter of government or opposition. If only a part of the debate is broadcast, we are conceding that the public may receive one side of an argument or one side of an exchange, and not the other.",57

221,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am glad the honourable member said that, because here is the distinction. I , for one, believe that it is the simple duty, not only in law but in common fairness, of the newspapers to publish both sides.",58
222,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,If newspaper reporting was factual it would be all right; but it is interpretive.,58
223,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,If a newspaper published what one honourable member of this Parliament said in a defamatory way about another and did not publish the reply that newspaper would forfeit its protection.,58

225,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I assure the Minister that if the plaintiff pursues-his action the newspaper will forfeit its privilege, not just theoretically.",58

227,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The man who has not money enough to pursue it should not be grandiose in starting it. That is the feature of the essential distinction. cannot take this proposal for a partial broadcast of the Parliament and treat it completely in a water-tight compartment, because we know that it has attached it a privilege in absolute terms by a later clause.",58
228,Mr FALSTEIN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,What the right honorformation) able gentleman is ignoring is that a newspaper report is not necessarily statement' of the facts; but when the broadcast of the proceedings is being made the broadcast is factual.,58
229,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I have been a memtime ber, of Parliament for a long time and know all about that. I have had some experience of it both ways. While the Minister was speaking I endeavoured to ask him a question, but I was treated with the usual discourtesy.",58

I suggest to the Government that it should have the Parliamentary Draftsman have a look at that. It does not matter for the purposes of this bill;. but it may involve an amendment of the Australian Broadcasting Act, because, on the face, it looks as if debates that arebroadcast will be items transmitted by a broadcasting station, and, being items transmitted by a broadcasting station,, they cannot be reported by a newspaper.

237,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for In [10.35] - We have come early to the matter that divides the committee, a the matter of whether the proceedingsof both Houses of the Parliament shall be broadcast or whether there shall be the broadcast of the one House at oneand of' the other at another time. I In the opinion of the Broadcasting Committee, there are insuperable technical difficulties in the way of broadcastingthe proceedings of both Houses at theone time, and the cost of such an experiment would be about £500,000. The Government cannot accept an amendment which, purports to override .the insuperable. Nor can it incur the expenditure of £500j000 in tying ,up 22 national broadcasting stations, because that is what is involved, instead of six national stations, one in each capital city, and a seventh in Newcastle, and - such other regional or short-wave stations as the - Joint Committee on the. Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings decides. It has been suggested that the short-wave and regional stations are not to be used for the broadcasting of parliamentary . proceedings. No one has. any authority to say that. The committee will decide that, and if I understand the temper - of 'honourable members arightj it is almost unanimously desired that the regional stations, as well as the national stations 'in the capital cities .and in Newcastle, shall be given the opportunity of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. We must start somewhere, and we .are making this experiment in .the way in which the Broadcasting Committee itself recommended. The amendment - cuts right across - what is recommended, and the Government cannot accept it.",58
238,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Wentworth) [10.38.]. - The Minister has .departed from his - contention that the Broadcasting Committee did not recommend that the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings should be in full, and 'now argues fhat tihe proceedings .cannot be broadcast in full because - of 'the costs. The matter before us concerns not. only whether the - proceedings should be 'fully or partially 'broadcast, but also whether partial - casting will give immunity 'to the Australian 'Broadcasting Commission. In his >second-reading speech, the Leader of - the 'Opposition (Mr Menzies) .said .that there was an obligation on the newspapers to publish .a fair and '.accurate ireport of the proceedings in .the 'Parliapoint ment, but .what will be .the .position of the Australian .Broadcasting Commission, which will be broadcasting - only a part - of .the proceedings:? Will the commission have the necessary privilege conferred - upon it to broadcast only part of a debate;? Libelous statements may be made . and the broadcast stopped before they can be'replied to. It may happen that only one side of - a debate would bebroadcast. That 'would not be a fair presentation of the .cases presented in the House. The Government seeks to meet that point by providing immunity to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In my second reading speech I raised the point .as to whether a special .privilege should b.e granted to one section of the community in respect of 'the broadcasting of speeches in the Parliament. It .is unjustifiable to grant immunity in respect of a broadcast which covers only part of a debate. The Minister, seeking to rely on privilege in this respect said that Hansard, under .a special act, enjoyed immunity; but Hansar'd reports cover - the whole of the proceedings in the Parliament. Therefore, the immunity enjoyed by Hansard is fair; it cannot be compared-with the immunity to be provided in respect of the broadcast of only portion of the proceedings, 'which might contain libelous statements to 'which replies made in. the Parliament are not broadcast also. This matter involves more than the point as to whether proceedings in the Parliament should be broadcast for the benefit of ithe people generally, or whether the whole, or. .only part, of the proceedings should be broadcast. .Under .this pro; vision the Australian Broadcasting .Commission is tto be given the privilege of broadcasting only a portion of .proceedings which might be libelous. That' is a privilege that is not enjoyed by the press. Any newspaper which published only portion of prioceedings which contained libelous.statements and failed to publish the whole of the proceedings, would lay itsel f open. to. action for damages for libel. This broad- provision is fundamental to the whole proposal. As .the .amendment seeks to rectify the position I have indicated, I support it.",59

241,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Wbe n _ the Minister raises technical considerations as reasons why. the Government cannot accept the amendment, he is putting the emphasis in the wrong place. Earlier in the debate he said that the Broadcasting Committee had never agreed that all of the proceedings in Parliament should he broadcast; and in support of that statement he quoted extensively from.the committee's report. However, the Minister cannot have studied the committee's recommendations thoroughly because in paragraph 53 of its report it states. . . but wo are of the opinion that in Australia complete broadcastsof the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset, ing the question of modification for consideration in the light of experience. All of the members of the committee were parties to that recommendation, and in view of the Minister's statement. I wonder whether Cabinet realizes that he is acting counter to what was recommended by the Labour members of the committee. Has he told caucus the whole story? Is he trying to .mislead honourable members in hisquotations from the committee's report? The Minister could achieve unanimity with respect to this measure by accepting the amendment. I can see no reason why he should not do so. Mr Francis' (Moreton) [10.45] - I ask the Minister to read carefully paragraph 52 of the report of the Broadcasting Committee. . . that no provision should be made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" straight"" broadcasts of the proceedingsexactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business. . . . Mir. Speaker; when giving evidence before the committee, said that if parliamentary debatesare to be broadcast it would be preferable to alternate the initiation of legislation between the two Houses rather than to divide the time. He argued that that would maintain, interest in the proceedings in each chamber.",59
242,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The amendment does not propose that; it says that the whole of the proceedings in both chambers should be broadcast. Mr Francis:- I .appreciate the. difficulty, because of shortage of material, in the way of broadcasting' the whole of the proceedings in. each ' chamber. However, the Government should implement the. recommendation of theBroadcasting Committee that proceedings should be broadcast exactly as they 'occurin the normal transaction of parliamentary business, that is, proceedings in each chamber should bebroadcast from start to finish.",60
243,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Dalley) [10.47] The honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) cited the evidence which I gave before the Broadcasting Committee. I do not retract that evidence. I said that there are. two Houses of theleavParliam'ent, and consideration should-be given to broadcasting proceedings in both Houses. I suggested that in' order to facilitate this course being followed, more legislation should he initiated in the Senate, thus giving that chamber legisla^ tion to deal with before it became stalebecause it had been debated in this chamber: I also said that means might be found to alternate the introduction of legislation between the Senate and the House of Representatives.",60
244,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"And that full debates in each House should be broadcast. Mr..ROSEVEAR - Yes;.and I take it that the honourable member agrees that proceedings in each. House should be'-, broadcast alternately? If that is his view, he should be careful not to vote for the amendment, because it proposes that the. whole of the proceedings) not the proceedings on any one day; in the Senate and the House of Representatives should be broadcast. The only way to broadcast the whole of the proceedings in each, chamber is to commence broadcasting from the moment the session opens to the closing minute of the session. Therefore, the amendment which proposes that'the whole of the proceedings in the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast means that the whole of the proceedings in both Houseswould have to be broadcast simultaneously, that is, from the moment each House met until it adjourned. The. committee did not. make that recommendation. Some comment has been passed, about the expenditure to date upon the arrangements forbroadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament;. hut; I invite-hono-rable' members to heed the observations of: the committee about thetechnical. difficulties which the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Eadden) has apparently overlooked.",60
245,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I read them to the Leader, of the Australian Country party.",61
246,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I shall read them again in order to make sure that the right honourable gentleman understands them. The committee statedWere it not for the high expenditure involved, the ideal arrangement would be the provision of a network ""of 22 national medium wave stations capable of serving nearly all populated portion of Australia. Equipment alone, however, would .entail expenditure in the neighbourhood of £500,000. I have heard comment to the effect that the expenditure of £10,000 upon the present arrangements is exorbitant, and represents a waste of public money. But according to the committee's report, the proposal of the Leader of the Australian Country party would entail the provision of a network of 22 national mediumwave stations at a cost of £500,000.",61
247,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,For what purpose?,61
248,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,To broadcast the whole of the proceedings of the Parliament.,61
249,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"No , to cover the whole of Australia.",61
250,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The honourable member for Dalley is going from the sublime to the ridiculous.,61
251,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Member s of the Opposition will not confuse me with their loud shouts. * Mr GCY - The honourable member should read the report.,61
252,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Probably some members of the committee did not read the report before they signed it. The cost of a network of 22 national medium-wave stations would be approximately £500,000. However, there are .other difficulties, as the report, showsBut apart from the cost, there are insuperable difficulties owing to the shortage of radio channels, . . . The Leader of the Australian Country party would not support this proposal. . . unless the licences of some commercial, stations were not renewed at the expiration of their annual period of tenure . -. If we propose to broadcast simultaneously the whole of the proceedings of both - chambers, as suggested by the Leader of the Australian Country party, the cost will be approximately £500,000, and a number of commercial broadcasting stations will be compelled to cease operations.",61
253,Mr GUY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That is misleading.,61
254,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"It is not. The information appears in black and white for every one to see. The report continues The only remaining proposition under present conditions is the use of the main national stations in the capital cities and the national the regional stations in the country districts, supplemented by short-wave service to remote areas. This would mean the substitution of parliamentary broadcasts in place of entertainment, commentaries on current affairs, and other items normally broadcast from these stations during the period involved. Therefore, the committee recommendedWe suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from - their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations. and from the regional stations, as well as from the shortwave stations, except during the short periods when "" s t r a i g h t "" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air. Obviously, the committee recommended exactly what the bill now provides. I should like to see whether those members of the committee who signed the report will now support the amendment which is entirely opposed not only to the reasoning in the document but also to the recommendations. If we adopt the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party we shall be. obliged to broadcast the whole of the proceedings of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I could understand the reasoning of the right honourable gentleman if he contended that the broadcasting of a debate, once commenced, should be continued until its conclusion, but the amendment provides, as I stated, for the broadcast of the whole of the proceedings of both chambers. That proposal is opposed entirely to the recommendations of the committee. If we adopt the proposed amendment the whole of the system of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament as now proposed will be abandoned, and the suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party will be substituted for it. That will involve an expenditure of £500,000 and will cause an unspecified number of commercial broadcasting continuance stations to cease to function.",61
255,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Indi) [10.56] Throughout this discussion no honourable member has opposed the principle of broadcasting the proceedings of the liament. That point is clear, and the attitude of honourable members on this side of the chamber cannot he misunderpicture stood. For technical reasons, however, it is easier for us to agree upon the ciple than upon the actual broadcasting arrangements. The Minister for Immitended gration (Mr Calwell), the honourable member for Bailey (Mr Rosevear) the report have made it clear that, at juncture, the whole of the debates of both chambers cannot be broadcast - simultaneously.",62
256,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Unles s we incur expenditure of £500,0*00.",62
257,Mr MCEWEK,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Eve n the honourable member for Dalley has misread the report. For the expenditure of £500,000 we should have a complete cover of the whole of Australia on one channel. cost of a complete cover on two channels would be nearly £1,000,000. Therefore, the Parliament is really driven to early decide whether we shall concur in the' broadcasting of a part of the parliamentary proceedings. The test there - is not whether we desire the whole or a part of the debates to be broadcast, but whether we want to achieve for the people of Australia by a partial broadcast a fair presentation of the just debates. Throughout the history of the institution of Parliament meticulous attention has been given to ensure that, once individuals have been elected to Parliament and have assembled, each shall have an equal and unrestricted opportunity to express himself on every issue that arises. Now, the purpose this bill is to embrace within the audience practically the whole populaSeuate tion of Australia. If it is proper to provide this privilege for every honourable member within the ParSuppose liament, the same principle must apply when the representatives of. the people address themselves to the wider audience. Every honourable member can recall occasite sions when a certain impression would have been left with listeners if a debate [78 ] had ceased at a particular point; but the of the debate, and replies to the earlier remarks completely changed the impression that had been created. All honourable members have heard persons in the Parliament and outside it Parmaligned and traduced, and quite frequently we have heard their names cleared by subsequent speeches. That is the of the Parliament functioning freely, as it is intended to do. If this princlause be agreed to in its present form, these deliberations will be exto an audience consisting of practically the whole nation, but the and broadcasts will cease at a certain this stage - of the debate. Every one of us knows that if that occurs there will very frequently be left an impression in the minds of the listening audience which an would have been changed had they had an opportunity to hear the subsequent portion of the debate. We all know that only too frequently the reputations of persons are besmirched in this Parliament, but that the imputations against The them are withdrawn by subsequent explanations. If such explanations do not reach the audience which listened to the part of the debate a grave injustice is done. Surely none of us is prepared to support that state of affairs. Whilst I proclaim myself openly in favour of the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings, if I am confronted with the"" choice as to whether I approve of this partial broadcast with the results I have pictured, or, alternatively, of having no broadcast at all, I have no hesitation in saying that I distinctly favour the latter. Again, if I were asked to make the a choice as to whether I would have no .broadcast at all, or broadcasts of the proceedings of only one house of the Parliament, I should unhesitatingly of choose the former. I remind honourable members opposite that not long ago the comprised 33 supporters of the then anti-Labour government and three representatives of the Labour Opposition. we have a repetition of that state of affairs and the debates on a certain issue are to be broadcast only from the Senate. . Would honourable members oppothen feel the same about it? Would they agree to permit a state of affairs to continue in which 33 members were permitted to put the case for one side and only three to put the case for the other? It therefore becomes obvious that in order fairly to convey the deliberations of this Parliament to - the listening public of Australia it is necessary to broadcast fully the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. But this is both financially and physically impracticable at the present time. The proposal now before us is immature; it has been brought before us at a time when the Government can not afford to do the fair thing financially nor is the country able to do it physically. I wish to make it quite clear that if the amendment moved bymy leader be carried I am under no illusion that that would result in both Houses of the Parliament being broadcast simultaneously. I know only too well that, for the time being, there would be no broadcasts at all. I want to be perfectly straight-forward in this matter. If I am confronted with thechoice between no broadcasts and a distorted broadcast-becaus e a partial broadcast could be nothing but a distorted broadcast-the n I am against broadcasting altogether, and I support the amendment moved by my leader.",62
258,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [11.5] - The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) put the case admirably when he stated that the matter boiled down to a question whether there should be a partial broadcast, with all its imperfections, ineffectiveness and consequent waste of money, or a full broadoast of the proceedings of both Houses when money and facilities are available. That is exactly what I had in mind. The present is not an opportune time to incur the enormous expenditure that would be necessary for a completely effective broadcast of the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. On the other hand, I am firmly of the opinion that money should not be extracted from the public purse for what must obviously be merely a partial broadcast, with all its imperfections and mechaever, nical disabilities. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) went from the sublime to the ridiculous when he drew attention to the fact that the Broadcasting Committee stated that the ideal arrange-. ment would be the. provision of a network of 22 additional national medium-wave stations capable of serving nearly all populated portions of Australia, the equipment for which alone would entail expenditure of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £500,000. That envisages the most complete and perfect system of full broadcasting of the parliamentary debates of which Australia is capable. The Broadcasting Committee did not contemplate such a grandiose scheme in the initial stages of parliamentary broadcasting. Such a proposal envisages serving the whole population of Australia. The proposal now before us does not go nearly as far as that. I have already pointed out that there are many people in remote' parts of Australia, including those in the electorates of Kennedy and Wilmot, who will never have an opportunity to listen to the partial broadcasts proposed by 'the Government. And even the broadcasting of the proceedings of both Houses fully would not, in the initial stages, necessitate the utilization of the 22 additional stations. These were envisaged by the Broadcasting Committee as necessary only to ensure a complete and perfect system.",63
259,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Melbourne!-Minister for - Immigration and Minister for Information) [11.8] - In order to be clear as to what we mean when we speak about partial broadcasts we should have a clear definition of our terms. I take it that the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) would regard the alternate broadcast of the full proceedings of each House as a partial broadcast.,63
260,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I would, in the circumstances. The people should have an opportunity to tune into the proceedings of either.House of the Parliament.",63
261,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am glad the right honourable gentleman has clarified the position as far as his party is concerned and, maybe, as far as the Opposition' generally is concerned. There are, howcertain honourable gentlemen opposite who have said that, unless the whole of the proceedings of each House were broadcast during the time allotted to the broadcasting of the proceedings of that House, that would be but a partial broadcast. You cannot have two partial broadcasts.",63
262,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,What does the Government propose?,64
263,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The amendment proposes 'the simultaneous broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings of both Houses, and has been concurred in by the honourable members for Balaclava (Mr. White) and Wentworth (Mr Harrison) ; but the honourable members for Moreton (Mr Francis) and Wilmot (Mr Guy) do not agree with that, neither does the honourable member for Gipp3land (Mr. Bowden) i. Let us take a division to ascerthe tain the will of the committee.",64
264,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,What is the Government's proposal?,64
265,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"-The Government's proposal is that there shall be broadcasts of the proceedings of each House at specified times to be determined by a joint committee. The report of that committee will be presented to, and, if necessary, debated ' in this House. The honourable member for Moreton has drawn attention to the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee that no provision should be made for any prearranged selection of speakers at particular times, that there should be ""straight"" broadcasts of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business, with the qualification that during divisions and such-like intervals an appropriate official, who should be an officer of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, should broadcast an impartial description of what is taking place. The honourable gentleman has also pointed out that the Broadcasting Committee recommended, further, that the facilities should not be used for any other purposes when Parliament is in recess.",64
266,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That is not what the Government proposes.,64
267,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable rendered gentleman is not entitled to say that it not the Government's proposal - The honourable member for Dalley (Mr read Rosevear), appearing before the Broadgraph casting Committee as Mr Speaker of the House of Representatives, stated that be his view; and by virtue of his office he will be a member of the proposed comGovernment mittee. I offer no objection to the recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee. But it is not for Ministers to impose their views when it is decided to set up a committee representing both' sides of each House, to determine the principles upon which the broadcasts shall be made and the times during which, and the day3 on which, they shall take place.",64
268,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,We could do without the committee.,64
269,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I do not think that we could do without the committee. Representatives of this chamber and of Senate would have to be brought to-, gether to arrange the important detail as to when the proceedings of the House of Representatives shall be broadcast and when those of the Senate shall be broadcast. The Government suggests that the committee will also arrange all the other details. I hope that honourable members will know precisely the proposal for which they are voting. The Leader of the Australian Country party . (Mr Fadden) has made his position demonstrably clear. If the whole of the proceedings of both Houses are not to be broadcast simultaneously, he wants no broadcast at all. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) does not want any broadcast. He said that the money proposed to be expended on such broadcasts should be applied to the erection of more national regional stations throughout Australia, and that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast when the whole of the programme of the Postmaster-General's Department has been completed. That was merely an attempt to sabotage the bill, just as the right honourable gentleman sabotaged the Commonwealth Bank years ago. I do notthink that the Government would accept such a proposal.",64
270,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Moreton) [11.12] The submission of the amendment has one good service to the comis mittee, in that it has caused the Minister , in charge of the bill (Mr Calwell) to for the first time to-night the parain the report of the Broadcasting Committee to which I have been referring to throughout the day.. He has side-stepped that issue until now. I have asked the to declare its intention, but it is not prepared to do that. I have asked the Minister many times to declare exactly - what the Government proposes under this legislation. I have sought from him the assurance that, a debate having been commenced in this chamber or in the Senate, it will be kept on the air until it has been concluded. The Minister will not intimate that he proposes to do that. - Mr Rosevear - That would be difficult.",64
271,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It would.not.,65
272,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Le t us suppose that an important measure was before the House, and the Leader of the Opposition secured the adjournment of the debate. If , on the following day, before the debate could be resumed, a motion for the adjournment of the House was moved, would it not be unfair to switch over to the 'Senate and leave the Leader of the Opposition in mid-air?",65
273,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That demonstrates bow unfair partial broadcasts would be.,65
274,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"What has been put by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) can be answered very simply. If the Government proposes to broadcast the whole of a debate, arrangements to that end can be made. If it were decided that the debate on an amendment which was likely to last for some time should not be broadcast,. the Australian 'Broadcasting Commission could easily carry on with alternative programmes in the meantime. If the Government had made' up its mind to broadcast the whole of a debate from the beginning to the end of a bill, so that everybody would have an equal right to participate in the broadcast, and to treat the Senate similarly on a future occasion, I should be in favour of the bill. That is the recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee, of which I am a member. But if the Government will not give that assurance, then I take my stand with the Leader of the Australian Country party. If the Minister desires to secure my vote, let him give me an unqualified undertaking that he will do what the Broadcasting Committee has recommended-that no provision will be made"" for any pre-arrangement of speakers for any time, and that there will be a "" straight"" broadcast of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business. If he will not do that, I shall have no faith in the bill and shall support the amendment.",65
275,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Dalley) [11.16] The honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) has been a member of this Parliament long enough to know that it would be impossible for the Minister to give the assurance that he seeks. The honourable gentleman has said that unless the Minister assures him that a debate having been started in this chamber it will be continued to its conclusion, he cannot support the bill. The honourable gentleman has had long parliamentary experience, *and knows that no committee could forecast when a debate will conclude in this chamber and be commenced in the Senate. Frequently, a second-reading debate appears likely to finish before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, but a new line of - argument arouses other thoughts, with the result that the debate is continued and at the end of the day has to be adjourned until the following sitting. In order to give the assurance desired by the honourable gentleman, the whole of the proceedings would have to be conducted to a timetable.",65
276,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,No .,65
277,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Of course they would. Let us suppose that the committee _ met this morning and said, "" The debate on this bill is going to finish in the House of Representatives to-night"".",65
278,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"It should not do that, because it would be contrary to the recom1 mendation of the Broadcasting Committee.",65
279,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am trying to prove that it would be impossible for the Minister to give the assurance which the honourable gentleman seeks, because this legislation is not - yet in operation. I challenge anybody to furnish proof to the contrary. If the legislation were in operation, and the committee, having met this morning, said that a certain bill before the House would be passed to-night",65
280,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It would not have any right to say that.,65
281,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"If it did say so, and added, ""A new debate will be initiated in the Senate tomorrow. It will go right through, and the bill will be brought back to the House of Representatives what then ? It would be impossible to give such an undertaking. All that can he done is to choose a committee of fair-minded persons who will be prepared to do what is best for both sides. Any attempt to forecast at this stage what is likely to happen, would be doomed to failure. I have had a lot of experience in this chamber. . I thought that the second-reading debate on this bill would be concluded last Friday, but it did not conclude until 10 o'clock to-night. What chance would a committee, meeting last Friday morning, have had of determining what the programme would be. this week in both chambers?",65
282,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"If the Government will not agree to my proposal, how can it carry out the recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee that there shall be no choice of speakers and no prearrangement of speeches, and that there shall be a ""straight"" broadcast of the proceedings?",66
283,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I tell the honourable member, as I told the Broadcasting Committee, that the order in which speakers are called rests with Mr. Speaker, not with any party or a committee of any ,party. If it were sought to give to the proposed committee the right to tell Mr Speaker that he should call upon a certain number of speakers from each side, the Standing Orders would have to be altered very considerably. The question of the choice of speakers does not arise. The bill provides for the closest possible approach to the report which the honourable member has signed, and in order to induce him to vote for the measure I wish to convince him of the absolute impossibility of the Minister giving such an undertaking as that asked for by the honourable member. .The duties of the 'committee will have to be most elastic-. It must be capable of being easily called together in order to fix a programme of broadcasts in' both branches of the legislature, perhaps from hour to hour. To attempt to forecast at present exactly what would happen would resemble optimism on the - jazz.",66
284,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Balaclava) [12.21] Surely the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) has raised unnecessary difficulties. He has omitted to mention that there will be a compere watching the proceedings and that he will take his cue from Mr Speaker. The public can follow the debates in the newspapers, and . surely they will be able to follow them as the result of the broadcasts. The honourable member for Dalley spoke of the expenditure of £500,000 being necessary for a complete broadcasting service for Australia in respect of parliamentary proceedings, but we have witnessed the expenditure of much larger sums for purposes of less value to the people. I suggest that we should consent to a complete broadcast of our proceedings with such facilities as are available. We cannot force the people to listen to the proposed broadcasts. Many do not wish to hear them, but those who desire to follow the debates intelligently, and do not get all the information they want from the newspapers, should be able to hear the debates broadcast over the various networks. One can well imagine the unseemly jostling that would occur around the forest of microphones, under the proposal contemplated in the bill. If the proposed committee were abolished the scheme could be approved unanimously.",66
285,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Indi) [11.24] - The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) sought to give us the benefit of his advice, as presiding officer in this chamber, as to how the system would function. If I had need of further argument to convince me that I should oppose the partial broadcasting of the debates, his speech provided it. He pictured a committee which would not be bound by regular hours of broadcasting, or any predetermined schedule, but which Would decide from time to time when the debates were to be broadcast and for what period. It is quite impossible to decide such matters as that without bearing in mind whose speeches are to be broadcast. The parliamentary system which we all claim to cherish has its whole virtue in the conir pletely unfettered freedom of every honourable member to speak,- bound only by the Standing Orders, as and when he thinks fit. He should be able to avail himself of the forms of the House and formally move the adjournment of the House in order to direct attention to urgent matters of public importance. I submit to tbose honourable members who claim to be guardians of our system of parliamentary government that under this bill an important step is proposed in the direction of destroying that system. It will inevitably lead, if not to regimentation in the chamber-and the honourable member for Dalley has told us that Mr Speaker will have a free choice in saying who shall speak-regimentatio n of honourable members in their party rooms.",66
286,Mr BAKNABD,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The honourable member is playing on his imagination.,67
287,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"No . Take a broadcast in which a Minister had stated a case for the Government and the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country party had secured the adjournment of the debate till the next day. Then, a3 a result' of some act of governmental ""administration, a private member desired to avail himself of the forms of the House in order to direct the beam of publicity on some act of policy, which is an. inherent right of honourable members under our parliamentary system. Unless that privilege is to he preserved we may as well have a general election to decide who is to govern the country and then let the government continue without an opposition until the next election - In the circumstances of which I speak, imagine the pressure that would be put on a private member who desired, perhaps, to move the adjournment of the House.. Every honourable member knows that if this, system were introduced it would lead to pressure being imposed on private members in party rooms to limit their freedom fit action in the chamber. That, .would he a most deplorable attack on the principal virtues of the parliamentary system.",67
288,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It is a form of censorship.,67
289,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That is what the effect would be. Some honourable members would he regarded as better able to state a case than others and they would remain seated to enable the speeches of .others to be broadcast. That would not be satisfactory to the honourable member upon whom pressure was used to induce him to refrain from an attempt to catch Mr Speaker's eye. If I needed anything further to convince me that partial broadcasts of the debates would constitute a deadly attack on the free use of our parliamentary system, the speech of the honourable member for Dalley.provided it. I appeal to the Government to try to - understand what a serious step it proposes to take, and how it will affect the working of the Parliament. Amendment negatived.",67

That the followingproviso be added to the clause:-""Provide d that such periods shall be equally divided between the members of the Government for the time being and members of recognized Opposition parties "". I do so for the reasons so ably advanced by the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen). The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) gave honourable members his idea of how the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings would be carried out, and this prompted the honourable member for Indi to point out how the system could be manipulated to the advantage of the party in power. Since it is proposed to limit the time available for broadcasts, I maintain that it is only fair that' the time should be divided equally between the Government and the Opposition parties.",67
291,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [11.33] - This matter should properly be left for determination by the committee of control. If the right honourable member's amendment were accepted, the Opposition would, in proportion to its numbers, have twice the time on the air that Government members would have, because in the present House of Representatives the Government has 49 whereas the Opposition has only 26."" If the purpose is. to prevent the Government from participating fairly in the broadcasts, the amendment certainly achieves it. It would effectively counter and frustrate the decision'of the people at the last elections, and the Government cannot agree to that. No such proposal was recommended by the report of the Broadcasting Committee, to which the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden), the honourable member for Wilmot (M i \ Guy), and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) affixed their signatures.",67
292,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,They did not realise that only part of the proceedings of Parliament would be broadcast.,68
293,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The Opposition will be represented on the committee which will make arrangements for the broadcasting of debates, just as it had representation on the Broadcasting Committee itself, which framed the recommendation upon which this bill is based. Honourable members opposite seem to have something weighing heavily on their minds. They would not divide the committee on the question of broadcasting both Houses of Parliament simultaneously, although' I had hoped they would, because I was curious to see how many of them would support the proposal. The present amendment, if accepted, would destroy the whole purpose of the bill, and would prevent two-thirds of the .members of this Parliament from being heard over the air. We are not going to help the Opposition to destroy our bill, nor to achieve anything so undemocratic as is proposed in the amendment. The amendment was not circulated before the committee met. It was an afterthought, and the Government cannot accept it.",68
294,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Balaclava) [11.36] The committee has before it an ill-conceived and ill-digested measure. We have been told that the bill is based on the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, but none of the Government members on that committee has anything to say about it. It appears that the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell), who is in charge of the bill, has not even read the report of' the committee. Nevertheless, we arc asked to accept his say-so, and he and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), arc the only two on the Government side who have given any explanation of the hill at all. I suggest to the Minister that he should report progress now, and consult caucus about the bill tomorrow. He should say, ""Look, boys, I forgot to tell you about this committee that it is proposed to appoint"". But for this obnoxious provision the Government might well have had the bill before this.",68

I pointed out that the things which honourable members opposite seem to fear will not take place because the Standing Orders will prevent it. Because I said this, the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) said that myspeech convinced him that the bill was designed as an attaek upon - the privileges of honourable members. Although the honourable member for Indi and his leader (Mr Fadden) sleep in the same bed, they do not dream the same dreams. The honourable member for Indi is concerned about the rights of private members. He expressed the fear that the tendency would be for parties to select speakers to state their case while Parliament was on the air; that pressure would be brought to bear on other members not to speak during those times. The honourable member for Indi was afraid £<)v democracy and demanded that every member of every party should have equal right to be heard, but now his leader moves an amendment, the purpose of which is the exclusion from the air of one-half of the Government supporters.",68
296,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Not at all.,68
297,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"First , it was claimed that if the broadcast of a debate was started, it should be continued till it finished. "" I know of no standing order or provision of this measure that says that when the Opposition side runs out of speakers the Government's side shall not be allowed further speakers. At the last general elections 26 members were returned on the Opposition side; 49 were elected to this side. Now the Australian Country party says that, once the broadcast of a debate starts, that debate must be broadcast through, to the end",68

304,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Does it w.ant the debate to conclude when the Opposition runs out of steam? That is apparently the position.,69
305,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Not at all.,69
306,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member for Indi talked about the rights of individual members. Everything in the bill is viewed with suspicion. Members are to be gagged. They are to have pressure placed on them. Therefore he fears this bill. Yet his own leader has moved, not that members be gagged by their own leaders, but that, when the Opposition side runs out of steam, we must also run out of steam. I do not call that democracy.",69
307,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Gippsland) [11.42] When I first looked at this amendment,. I agreed with the Minister in charge of the bill (Mr Calwell) and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear). If this measure provided for the full-time broadcasting of the proceedings of this Parliament the honourable gentlemen would be correct. But their contentions now distort the facts, because the broadcast is to be only a partial broadcast of four hours a day, and it is impossible for 75 men to speak in that time.",69
308,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Who said that the broadcasts were to be limited to four hours a day?,69
309,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,A few minutes ago the committee decided that the broadcast should alternate between the two Houses.,69
310,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,At the discretion of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.,69
311,Mr BOWDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,'The amendment proposes sharing equally the few hours in which the proceedings of the Parliament will be broadcast.,69
312,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information [11.47] - The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) indicates that his party, is working on the assumption that the proceedings' of the Parliament will be broadcast for only about four hours or some other limited time each day. There is no justification for that assumption. It will be possible for the proposed committee to decide that the proceedings of the House of Representatives should be broadcast for a whole day or two days. The Senate does not sit so frequently as does the House of Representatives. The proceedings in the House of Representatives must be broadcast all the time the Senate is not sitting. The Australian Country party's proposal is that the proceedings shall be broadcast for a certain length of time, and that thereafter the Labour party speakers shall go off the air. That is absurd. First, the Australian Country party argued for a complete broadcast of both Houses. The amendment means that the Australian Country party does not want all the proceedings of the House of Representatives broadcast during, say, a week when the Senate is not sitting. They say now "" Oh, well, we have changed our minds. Although we can have the House of Representatives on the air all the time it is sitting and the Senate is not sitting, we do not want it, and the Government supporters can have only a portion of the time "".",69
313,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,1 3 it intended to broadcast the proceedings in the House of Representatives for the whole day when it is in session?,69
314,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The committee will make a decision and report to the Parliament, and if honourable members then want to broadcast all day they will, be able to alter the report, if necessary, to read that way.",69
315,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Why then does the Minister not accept the amendment which asks for that? .,69
316,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"If the right honourable gentleman wants to do the right thing, let him do it the right way, and not get muddled-headed about things.",69
317,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL, Order !,69
318,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,All I ask is V at honourable members opposite trust the Parliament in this matter.,70
319,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The Minister will not take us into his confidence.,70
320,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I shall propose amendments later to restore the joint committee to nine members, the strength originally proposed, and the representatives of all parties on that committee will decide points of the kind raised by the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden).",70
321,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The crux of the matter is the period of the broadcasts, and the Minister has not taken us into his confidence on that point.",70
322,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That will be a matter to be decided by the joint committee. I do not know who the members of that committee will be. It may not convince the Parliament of its views; but if the members of it act as reasonably as members of the Broadcasting Committee have acted in this matter, it should be able to bring in unanimous reports. Mr Speaker and the President will be members of the joint committee, and the Leaders of the Opposition parties in each chamber, or their deputies, will also be members of it. I ask honourable members to facilitate the establishment of the joint committee and thus enable it to get to work. It will be time enough, when that committee presents its report, to raise the matters of the kind now raised by honourable members opposite. The right honourable member for Darling Downs said that the Government was putting up "" Aunt Sallies "" ; but that is exactly what he is doing. His proposal lacks' merit. This is the first time in the history of the Parliament that government supporters have been asked to stultify themselves in order to suit the whims of members of the Opposition when they could not carry a proposition which, because of its impracticability and the fact that it involved excessive cost, was rejected by the Broadcasting Committee on which the'Opposition parties have four representatives out of a total personnel of nine members.",70
323,Mr FRANCIS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Moreton) [11.53] The remarks just made by the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) convince me that he does not understand the sure. He said that-he does not know what proposals will be put before the joint committee. The Broadcasting Committee recommended that full debates should be broadcast. That proposal has been rejected by the Minister in favour of broadcasts of only portion of the proceedings. That being so, the right honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) has moved an amendment with the object of dividing the time allotted to these partial broadcasts equally between Government supporters and Opposition members. That is the amendment in a nutshell, and any one who believes in-fair play should support it. The Minister has said that he does not know how much time will be allotted to the broadcasts. That' is another reason why the amendment should be carried. If the broadcasts are to last for, say five or ten hours the time should be divided equally between Government supporters and members of the Opposition parties; but, in the case of full-time broadcasts, honourable members should he given such ti-nie as they consider necessary to enable them to deal fully with the particular subject under consideration. The Government has refused our requests for full-time-broadcasts and proposes to have partial broadcasts; but the Minister cannot tell us what the duration of those broadcasts will be. In these circumstances, it is the duty of all honourable members to urge the Government to be fair by dividing the time equally between Government supporters and members of the Opposition parties.",70
324,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Wimmera) [11.55]. I have an open mind on this matter. I have listened with interest to the remarks of all honourable members who have spoken upon it, but I wish the Minister to clarify one point. It has been stated by some honourable members opposite that the normal procedure will be followed during the period of broadcasting. The normal procedure as I have observed it since I have been a member of this chamber is that, when a bill is before the chamber, Mr - Speaker calls upon honourable members alternately from the Government side and the Opposition side, and the debate proceeds until the Minister in charge of the measure sums up after the last speaker has addressed the House. meaThe honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) has implied that that procedure will not be followed in respect of debates being broadcast, .but that Mr Speaker will continue to call speakers from Government side.",70
325,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,No .,71
326,Mr TURNBULL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"If that is not correct, Mr Speaker may call two speakers in succession from one side of the chamber.",71
327,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"On many, occasions three honourable members from one get the call in succession.",71
328,Mr TURNBTJ LL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The normal properiod cedure is that Mr Speaker calls an orable member from one side and then an be. honourable member from the other side the chamber. Three, or four, members from the one side are called in succession only when no honourable member on the other side of the chamber rises. one will deny that that is the normal procedure. But in. respect of debates to he broadcast the call will be given under a different system. That is the crux of this difficulty. If the Minister assures me that the normal procedure we understand it will be followed, the period of the broadcasts will be equally divided between Government supporters and the members of the Opposition. Thursday, 4 July, 1946.",71
329,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Indi) [12 midnight]. - The issue is simple. The Leader the Australian Country ' party (Mr. Eadden) contended that if any attempt is to be made to broadcast the debates the whole of the proceedings of the and the House of Representatives should be put on the air. .We recognize that the Government has 50 members and Opposition has 25 members, the Government should derive the full advantage of its numbers. We have never to. resist that. We have always been in favour of it. However, the committee rejected that proposal and decided that . the proceedings of the Parliament shall for be broadcast for only a limited period and on selected occasions. In the circumhis department. stances of this extraordinary and novel decision, the Leader of the Australian Country party contended that we should insert in this legislation a provision ensure that the Government and Opposiproceedings tion shall share equally the period allotted 0 for broadcasting in order to present their views. That is all. As soon as the Leader the of the Australian Country party moved his amendment, the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) interjected that the proposal would destroy the whole purpose of the bill.",71
330,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The whole democratic purpose.,71
331,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The whole purpose of the bill, as envisaged by the Labour .side caucus. The Minister spoke of the meetings of the committee to decide the of broadcasting. In his innocence, i honhe does not know what the period will It has never crossed his mind. of He does not know who will be appointed to the committee, but he knows that its decisions will be fair to the Government and Opposition. I do not believe it. I No am quite sure that when the Labour caucus decided that the Government should introduce this bill; it had before it a clear picture of the political effect on the Labour party. Having regard to its political background, I am not so innoas cent as to believe that the Labour party, would agree to. the introduction of this kind of legislation without having examined minutely the possible political repercussions. With that thought in my mind, I join with my leader in attempting to insert in the bill a precaution to ensure that both sides shall have equal access to the air. When a division is taken, of we shall see who are prepared to cast a vote to ensure, as the rejection of the amendment will ensure, that the Government shall have a partial Senate monopoly of the air tobroadcast its political propaganda""*. We seek no advani f tage. ' We ask merely for an equal the opportunity to state our case.",71
332,Mr DEDMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"How can one have a attempted "" partial monopoly "" ?",71
333,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The people did not give the Opposition equal, opportunity.",71
334,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I refer the Minister Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) to some-of the professors in Some people have defined queerer things than a "" partial monopoly "". However, the issue is clear. We shall expose those who, having to already decided that only a part of the shall be broadcast, will reject a proposal to ensure that Government and Opposition shall have equal opportunity to state their views.",71
335,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Bourke) [12.4 a.m.] I am surprised at the attitude which the Opposition is adopting. The clause is clear. It provides that the proceedings of the Parliament shall be broadcast. All honourable members know that under the existing system of broadcasting in Australia, the whole of the proceedings of both chambers cannot be broadcast simultaneously. This bill provides that as much of the proceedings of both chambers shall be broadcast as is possible with the existing equipment. The suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) is so much eye-wash. The right honourable gentleman began by raising all sorts of objections to the bill. He then read evidence which he had given to the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. It contradicted the speech that he was then making. He turned somersaults, and attempted with one amendment to provide that the whole of the proceedings of both chambers shall be broadcast simultaneously. .Of course, he is aware that at present it is impossible to carry out such a proposal. When that amendment was defeated, as he knew it would be, he submitted the proposal now under consideration. He is attempting to show that the Government is trying to "" put over"" some trick to gag the Opposition in debates. If the proceedings of this chamber are broadcast for four hours, six hours or twelve hours in any one day and the rules of debate are observed as they have been in the past, the Opposition will always have its opportunity to be heard. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have listened to considerably more speeches from members of the Opposition than from honourable members on this side of the chamber. In my opinion, the object of the Leader of the Australian Country party is not to improve the bill in any way but to obstruct its passage, and attempt, as far as he can, to make it unworkable. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) reveals a similar attitude. Earlier, he was whole-heartedly in favour of the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, and signed a recommendation to that effect. Since coming into this chamber this evening, he has changed his mind about eight times, and has reached the stage when he does not know whether he is standing or sitting. He is so muddle-headed about the whole matter that he has forgotten what the purport of the bill is.",72
336,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member for Moreton stated that if we could convince him, he would support us.",72
337,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"He cannot be convinced, as I know from experience during the last two years. This clause provides for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament. Other clauses provide the method whereby those broadcasts, shall take place. There are no tricks in the bill. We have not put up any ""Aunt Sallies."" The legislation is clear and straightforward, and the only reason why the Leader of the Australian Country party is persisting with amendments is to obstruct its passage, and, if possible, make it unworkable. . Mr WHITE (Balaclava) [12.7 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson) did not hear the earlier discussions, but I remind him that he signed the committee's report containing the following recommendation:That no provision should be made for any pre-arranged selection of speakers at particular times, that is to say, there should be "" straight"" broadcasts of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transactions of Parliamentary business. Although he signed that report, he now makes all kinds of ridiculous utterances and attacks the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis). The bill was thrown upon the table of the House, and apparently the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) did not inform' Cabinet or caucus about this rather sinister committee. The Opposition's proposal that all the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast has been rejected. Now, we 'desire to ensure that the practice of Mr Speaker of calling alternately speakers from the Government and Opposition sides of the chamber shall be observed during the broadcasting of debates. Apparently, a departure is to be made from that practice.",72
338,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,It is not.,73
339,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Then the honourable member should support the amendment, which provides that Government and Opposition shall have equal opportunity to state their views. Is the honourable member for Bourke able to support that?'",73
340,Mr BRYSON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,No .,73
341,Mr WHITE,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member . is not capable of reasoning. amendment will test the sincerity of the Government. The Minister can accept it without loss of prestige, although he stated that it would destroy the purpose of the bill. I was prepared to accept this as a half-baked but reasonably fair bill to bring the Parliament closer to the people. To the Minister for Information, who claims that the proposed amendment will destroy the purpose of the bill, I can only say that if that be so its purpose is one of ill-intent. Let us put the amendment to a vote and thus provide an opportunity to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite.",73
342,Mr CONELAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Griffith) .[12.11 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) frankly admitted that the whole purpose of the amendment was to destroy the bill.,73
343,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,That is a misrepresentation.,73
344,Mr CONELAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The honourable member openly admitted that that was the purpose of the amendment.,73
345,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Not to destroy the bill but to destroy the intention of caucus.,73
346,Mr CONELAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"It is obvious that honourable members opposite are suffering from a bad attack of pre-election jitters. The Broadcasting Committee as a whole approved of certain recommendations upon whioh this bill is based. But since the bill has been before us it, has become increasingly obvious that the whips have been cracked over the heads of those honourable members opposite who put their signature to the Broadcasting Committee's report. Can there be any other explanation of their hostility to the bill? It is admitted on all sides that a full and complete broadcast of the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament is impossible at the present time. Therefore the object of the amendment can be no other than to destroy the bill.",73
347,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I repeat that its purpose is to defeat the intention of caucus.,73
348,Mr CONELAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"At the last election the people of Australia were asked to decide to what party they should entrust the reins of Government, and by their votes they returned to this Parliament twice as many representatives of the Labour party as of the parties in Opposition. Honourable members opposite, howThis mentary debates will not alter the procedure normally adopted by the Chair ever, have the audacity to claim that despite their numerical inferiority speakers for the anti-Labour parties' should be allotted broadcast time equal to that allotted to members who sit on this side of the chamber. I pointed out that the broadcasting of the Parliain calling members alternately from the Government and Opposition sides as far as it is practicable to do so. It does no$ always happen, however, that members of the three parties represented in this chamber are alternately called. I recollect that during a recent debate in this chamber the honourable members for Maranoa (Mr Adermann),"" Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) and Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) successively received the call from the Chair. I have invariably found that more speakers rise from the Opposition than from the Government side: I fail to see any merit in the amendment, and I shall vote against it.

The purpose of the amendment is restore the committee to the number which provision was made when the was introduced in the Senate. The mittee will consist of the President the Senate, Mr Speaker of the House Representatives, and seven other bers. NOES. Mr MCEWEN (Indi ) [12.23 a.m.] It is well to realise'that there is a certain significance in this proposal. The bill 33 it now stands provides for equal representation of both Houses of the Parliament on the committee that is to be appointed to consider and report upon certain matters. Under the British bicameral system of government, the fundamental principle has been accepted that there shall be no subordination of one branch of the legislature to the other. I am sure that none of the existing procedural processes of the Commonwealth Parliament would enable one chamber to exercise authority over the other. I PAIRS. understand the purpose of the amendment to be to restore - the constitution of the committee to that which was provided for in the bill when it was introduced in the Senate. The Senate, taking the attitude that it should not in any circumstances be subordinated to the House of Representatives by having a minority representation on a joint parliamentary committee, insisted upon having equal representation. I am prepared to uphold the important principle of equality of the two Houses in our parliamentary system. The Government should not submit an amendment designed to give to the House of Representatives majorit y representation on a joint parliamentary committee, the purpose of' which is to - exercise authority in respect of a matter affecting the, two Houses, It is taking a serious and an unprecedented step in pursuing such a course ",74
350,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Dalley) [12.25 a.m.] - I accept my share of the responsibility for the proposal to ask the Senate to amend its decision in regard to the composition of the proposed committee. I do not accept the view put forward by the honourable member for Indi (Mr . MCEwen) that equality of representation thereof of the two Houses on parliamentary committees has always been an accepted to principle. Let us consider the composifo r tion of the joint committees appointed bill by the Senate and the House of Reprecomsentatives. The Broadcasting Committee, of upon' whose report largely this legislation of was based, is composed of three senators memand six members of the House of Representatives. A motion, proposing that representation was passed by botb Houses without protest in either. . The Public Works Committee consists of three members of the Senate and six members of the House of Representatives. I have not heard of any protest having been made by the Senate in regard to its representation on that very important body.",74
351,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The money powers of the Senate are very limited.,75
352,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am not questioning that. The Public Works Committee examines works projects of the Commonwealth Government, and makes recommendations to both Houses of the Parliament in relation thereto. The Social Security Committee, upon whose recommendations most, of the social services legislation of this Government and the last Administration was based, consists of three members of the Senate and four members of the House of Representatives. The War Expenditure Committee has on it, two member's of the Senate and .five members of the House of Representatives. Those are the only Parliamentary committees that are now in existence. They have made importantrecommendations to different governments, and I ' have not heard of any protest regarding inequality of representation. Equality of representation of the two chambers has never been an accepted principle. I stated in evidence to the Broadcasting Committee that it would have to make up its mind as to whether the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings were to be regarded as having entertainment or educational value. The number of members of the House of Representatives is more than double the number of senators, consequently, this chamber ought to have greater representation on committees than has the other chamber. Those who sincerely believe that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast must admit, that the broadcasts should be made of the proceedings of that House which will most appeal to listeners. In making that statement, I am not saying anything derogatory of the Senate. The interest displayed by visitors and residents of Canberra is a true criterion of the appeal that is made. Whenever there is an important, debate in the House of Representatives, its galleries are to overflowing, whereas the galleries ""reserved for strangers in, the Senate chamber are invariably empty. That is generally the position. Politically minded people who will listen to parliamentary proceedings will be guided by the interest taken in the respective Houses in the past, and I consider that this chamber is entitled to the representation sought. I object to the argument advanced by the honourable member for Indi as to the right of the two branches of the legislature to equality of representation. In the selection of members of important parliamentary committees the two Houses have never had equality of representation ",75
353,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Indi ) ' [12.31 a.m.] We do not frequently hear the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) and we are reminded that he is no mean antagonist in debate. I recall that, when the Labour party was in opposition, he showed much skill in debate, and he has now demonstrated that he has not lost the art and some of the artifices of debate. One of the oldest tricks which he has presented is that of replying to a point which his opponent has not made. I claim that there is no precedent for any machinery, committee, or regulation enabling one branch of the legislature to exercise authority over the other on procedural matters. The honourable member for Dalley has shrewdly pointed out that the House of Representatives has a majority of members on the Social Ser-' vices Committee, the Public Works Commitiee, and the War Expenditure Committee, but those committees have nothing to do with the procedural conduct of debates in this Parliament. Had I not replied to the honourable member he might have ""got away with "" a shrewd trick; but, it is not difficult to expose the fallacy, of his argument. He cannot challenge my contention that there is nothing in our parliamentary practice which enables one House to exercise authority over the other in the procedural conduct of its affairs. . '",75
354,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,To which committee does the honourable member refer as having equal representation of both chambers ?,75
355,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I do not know of filled any such committee. The honourable member for Dalley makes the purpose of the hill doubly clear when he says that there is greater interest in the proceedings of the House of Representatives than in those of the Senate. For what purpose does he want this chamber to have the greater representation on the proposed committee other than to ensure that it shall get more time.on the air than the Senate?,75
356,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The leaders of the three political parties are members of this House.,76
357,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That is a statement of fact, but not a good argument in reply to my contention. It is abundantly clear that the purpose is to reduce the Senate to a subordinate position in the eyes of the people of Australia, thus getting nearer to realization of the policy indicated by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Pollard) yesterday, who interjected that the Senate should be abolished. One step nearer.home! But the honourable member lacked the courage to come out with a forthright policy.",76
358,Mr CONELAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Griffith) [12.37 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) has admitted that he knows of no committee of this Parliament that has equal representation of the two chambers. As Mr Speaker and each of the leaders of the three political parties in this cham* her will no doubt be members of the proposed committee, there will probably be at least four members of this chamber on it. Surely the honourable member for Indi does not suggest that the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) should be left off the committee. He wishes to depart from the recognized practice,. which is founded on the fact that the House of Representatives, having more than twice as many members as the Senate, should have greater representation than the other chamber on all committees.

361,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Barker) [12.44 a.m.] - Will the committee be authorized to sit after Parliament is dissolved? This is important in view of another amendment which the Minister proposes to move later.,77
362,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I imagine that when Parliament is dissolved all parliamentary committees will automatically go out of ' existence. No committee of Parliament can exist if Parliament itself has ceased to exist.,77

364,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The difficulty conjured up by the honourable member may well be left for discussion when the proposed committee makes its first report to Parliament.,77
365,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The statement of the Minister is cold comfort to anyone interested in the matter. Once this bill becomes law, the committee will - be authorized to act in the manner prescribed, and no comment by me or anyone else can affect it.",77
366,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister . for Immigration and Minister for Information) [12.46 a.m.] - No broadcast of Parliament can take place until the » committee has submitted its report, and Parliament has adopted it. The appointment of the committee will not mean that the whole matter of broadcasting is handed over to it , and that Parliament will have no more control of it.",77
367,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,But Parliament will not be sitting during a recess or after a dissolution. I want the position of the committee during such periods to be made clear.,77
368,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The honourable member can have the matter cleared up when the committee presents its first report to Parliament, which will be before any broadcasts take place. - Mr BERNARD CORSER (Wide Bay) [12.47 a.m.] - I do not like the proposal to delegate the powers of the committee to a sub-committee consisting of two senators and two members of the House of Representatives. This seems to me to be a hole-and-corner way of doing things. We have restored the provision that the committee shall consist of nine members, and the present proposal seems to be.an attempt to go back to the principle of equal representation of both Houses as provided in the Senate's amendment. The clause provides that the committee "" m a y "" delegate power to a sub-committee, but we know that the "" m a y "" will become "" shall"" at the wish of the Government majority on the committee. It will be most unfair if a sub-committee consisting of four is authorized to make decisions which will, in effect, be regarded as the decisions of the whole committee.",77
369,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [12.4S .a.m.] - It is necessary to provide that the committee shall be able to delegate its functions to a subcommittee. Clause 12 provides that the committee .shall consider and specify in a report presented to each House of Parliament the general principles upon, which there should be determined the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast. In clause 13, the committee is given power to appoint a sub-committee which shall have power to determine the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House of Parliament shall be broadcast. That, and that only, is the power to be delegated to the sub-committee ",77
370,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,What other duty has the committee itself to perform?,77
371,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,The committee' has the right and duty to lay down general principles and to report to Parliament regarding them. The minor duty of allocating days and times for broadcasting will be delegated to the subcommittee.,77
372,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,And.an y determination reached by the. sub-committee shall be deemed to be the decision of the committee.,77
373,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Yes , in respect of the limited range of matters with which the sub-cornmittee will be competent to deal.",78
374,Mr BERNARD CORSER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,And members of' the sub-committee shall form a quorum.,78
375,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Yes , The purpose of that is to allow the committee to function when the Senate is not sitting. Therefore, two honourable representing the House of Representatives may for m a quorum of the subcommittee of four. That does not say that the sub-committee shall be the same members always. The whole committee may refer to representatives of the House of Representatives the matter of determining day3 on which and times at which the proceedings of the House of .Representatives shall be broadcast, when the Senate is not sitting, and it is provided that two of the five persons from the House of Representatives shall for m a quorum. The whole thing is obvious and is quite workable. I assure honourable members that the plan w i ll not f all down because of the provision in the amendment. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 14No action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament.",78
376,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Wentworth) [12.51 a.m.] - In the absence of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), I move on his behalfThat the clause be left out and that in lieu thereof the following new clause be inserted:""14 - (1.) No action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees, for broadcasting or rebroadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. "" (2.) No action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any member' of either House of Parliament for any defamatory matter spoken or imputation made by him and broadcast or re-broadcast in accordance with this act unless such matter or imputation be untrue in fact, in which event the immunity hereby conferred shall not apply if the matter were spoken or imputation made by such member maliciously or with knowledge v that it was false."".",78
377,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Koo.ypng-Leade r of the Opposition) [12.52 a.m.] - The amendment falls into two parts, and I any two should like to vote' on them separately. Sub-clause 1 is, I think, a proper protection to give to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, assuming that we accept the principle of giving privilege to partial broadcasts. I have said what I wanted to say on that subject. If that principle members is accepted, the amendment seems to be .reasonable. But the second part of the amendment, which is designed to alter the privilege of members of Parliament in relation to debate, is not one that can command my support. I should perhaps add a word to what has been said on this question of privilege, which is very important. There has been some confusion about it in the course of the consideration of this bill. The problem is not one of the privilege of the member of Parliament. As I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the privilege of the Parliament rests on an entirely different basis, one that this bill does not touch. Whether an honourable member, is reported in a newspaper or in Hansard or is broadcast, it is still true that what he says in the chamber cannot be made the subject-matter, or cause of action against him. So the privilege of a member of Parliament we can set on one side. It is not touched. All that the bill proposes to do under clause 14 is to give a new privilege to a new publishing medium, the broadcasting medium. I pointed out before that the basic distinction is a distinction between, on the one hand, the qualified privilege that we give to the newspaper, a privilege attaching to only a fair and accurate report, which, in the case of attack and counter-attack, must be balanced if it is to enjoy that protection, and, on the other hand, the absolute privilege now proposed to be conferred upon the partial broadcast of parliamentary debates. I take the greatest exception to conferring the latter form of privilege. This does not concern members, except insofar as the creation of this privilege may actually damage a member. It may have the result of conferring on the Australian Broadcasting .Commission privilege for the transmission to the public of a defamatory statement which, in other circumstances, would enjoy no privilege at all.",78
378,Mr ROS,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,EVEAR - And any other broadcasting station could get a recording of the original broadcast for re-broadcasting.,79
379,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I was coming , to that."" I am taking the matter in two steps. This requires a great deal of thought. ""We are creating this new absolute privilege for the broadcasting of - only a portion of a debate. The Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) has foreshadowed an amendment to insert the word "" re-broadcasting"" in clause 14 after the word ""broadcasting"". So absolute privilege will attach not only to the original broadcast but to a re-broadcast of a portion of a debate, and the re-broadcast, of course, need not be a reproduction of all the matter in the original broadcast. It may he a re-broadcast of one speech or a fraction of a speech, and we are attaching abso-' lute privilege to that. That seems to me most unsound. The only protection would be that conferred in ' the foreshadowed new clause13A - (1.) The committee shall have power to determine the conditions in accordance with which a re-broadcast may be made of any portion of the proceedings of .either House the Parliament. (2.) No re-broadcast shall be made portion of the proceedings of either House the Parliament otherwise than in accordance with the conditions so determined. All that means is that we are putting into the hands of a committee the right to say under what circumstances a fragshould ment of a debate broadcast tomorrow be re-broadcast perhaps six months hence. I put it to this committee that interstate services. there is no' occasion whatever for rebroadcasts except for the purpose of alinement of times on the interstate service. If the purpose is to provide, example, that Western Australians shall be able to listen to the debates at reasonable hour as if the State were eastern State, that would be appropriate, separately. but, apart from the need to meet the convenience of listeners in that way, I see no reason why anybody should be given be a good idea.. permission to take a part of a partial broadcast and re-broadcast it. But whether that is done in whole or in part today or six months hence, it will utill enjoy absolute privilege. I say, with great respect to everything that has been said, that that is something about - which every honourable gentleman should think. It is not for ' the Parliament to - whittle away the privileges of ' the Parliament, but it is for the Parliament to protect its rights, and one of those rights is that its members shall be reported, if reported at all, fairly and accurately. It is no answer to say that some newspapers do not do that. Of course they do not. It is no answer to that to say that the qualified privilege enjoyed by newspaper reporters has been abused; of course, it has. But privilege is well defined in point of law, and they lose their privilege unless they exercise it according to the law. And that exists for our protection and the protection of the Parliament just as much as for the protection of the public. What we are doing here is abandoning that protection by saying, in a rather light-hearted way I am afraid, that there will be absolute protection for the original broadcast, or for any re-brdadcasts, of whatever section of the parliamentary debate is broadcast, or any fragment of it that may then be of selected and approved. For that reason whilst I would support the first of any portion of the amendment as a second of line of defence, my first protection is that clause 14 itself should be omitted, or, at the very least, that the privilege created by' it should be confined to the broadcasting of Parliament and not extend to any re-broadcast may other than that broadcast within a few hours for the purpose of synchronizing",79
380,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Inforfor mation) [1.1 a.m.] - I suggest that in order to facilitate discussion of the proa position contained in the amendment we an should take the two proposed sub-clauses,79
381,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I think that that would,79
382,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Sub-e l ause 1 of the amendment proposes that no action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees, for broadcasting or re-broadeasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Clause 14 of the hill provides that no action, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Whilst the amendment seeks to provide that, the privilege shall be enjoyed only by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees, the clause itself gives a protection to any person who broadcasts the proceedings of the Parliament. An amendment which I propose to move later will extend the privilege to rebroadcasts of proceedings of the Parliament. It may he thought that at some time some commercial station should be allowed to broadcast a portion of the proceedings of the Parliament, for instance, a speech by the British Prime Minister during his visit to Australia. If the clause is limited to the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission only, protection is not given to employees of any commercial station who may broadcast a portion of the proceedings of the Parliament. I desire to cover the whole position, and I suggest that honourable members agree to the clause which provides that any person employed in the work of broadcasting the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be protected.",80
383,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Wentworth) [1.5 n.m.'J - The honourable member for Warringah (Mi . Spender), in framing his 1 amendment, took into consideration the fact that the clause extended protection to any person, whilst the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) explained that the amendment would prevent a commercial station from re-broadcasting proceedings of the Parliament. ' Mr CALVTHLI - No .",80
384,Mr HARRISON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The Minister mentioned that the amendment would not extend protection to a eomraercial station which might broadcast, for instance, a speech by the British Prime Minister in this building. The amendment is designed to place a responsibility upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission which is responsible to the Parliament by virtue of the .fact that it will originate the broadcasts. But if the provision is left in the broadest terms to cover arty person, there will be nothing whatever to prevent a commercial station at some stage from extracting some portion of a speech and re-broadcasting it with complete immunity. We object to making the provision so wide. The point is that protection should be extended to a body which is responsible to the Parliament, but not to a commercial' broadcasting station that may broadcast some part of a speech made six months previously.",80
385,Mr ROSEVEAR,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Dalley) [1.7 a.m.] This clause has given me a great deal of anxiety, particularly in relation tu the privileges of honourable members. I listened carefully to the speech made by the honourable member fo:- Warringah (Mr Spender). I heard his criticism and his alternative, and from my study of parliamentary privilege,. I should say that no proposition more damaging to parliamentary privilege has been made than that contained - in the amendment ' forecast and circulated by the honourable member when he spoke to the second reading. I note now that the honourable member has introduced another subclause into his proposition. I agree with everything that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) said with regard to the danger of the. clause as it stands in the bill. The clause makes it possible for anybody, .not necessarily, perhaps, any bona fide commercial station, to tune in with a recording instrument to an "" A "" class station broadcast, if forewarned to do so by somebody who intended to make a dangerous, or malicious attack, and by mechanical means extract from that broadcast the more malicious part of it and rebroadcast it from any other station as often as he chose. He might even rebroadcast it between the time that Parliament was prorogued prior to an election and until polling day, and the person attacked would have no opportunity to defend himself on level terms. I have the greatest misgiving as to ""what could happen in cases of that description. As the Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed out, there is certain privilege in the publication of reports of Parliamenary proceedings; but when anything malicious is contained in the speech reported there is no privilege if the press, or pamphleteer, publishes the defamatory portion of the speech, or the wholeof it containing defamatory matter, and does not at the same time, publish the reply. No privilege at all applies' to such a lication. May's Parliamentary Practice cites many cases, particularly in Great Britain, of people having been mulct in heavy damages, notably newspaper proprietors and pamphleteers who used the method employed in those days to defame persons, namely by getting a member of Parliament to make a defamatory speech which they later published. No privilege attaches to that, but no limit is imposed upon the licence contained in the clause in its present form. An individual who is attacked has no means of protecting himself. Therefore, I viewed with grave misgivings the clause in its original form. I repeat that the purpose of the bill is to confer privilege upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees. It does not confer privilege upon members of Parliament, because that"" is already provided. T,he proposal of the honourable member for ""Warringah is a strange mixture of ideas. First, he endeavours to introduce into the bill, which does not purport to deal with the privileges of members of Parliament, a matter entirely foreign to the intentions of the measure. He seeks to. overcome the danger which might result from broadcasting and re-broadcasting. Secondly, he introduces the matter of the individual privilege of members of Parliament. With me, this is not a personal matter, but if any honourable member has studied closely the subject of. parliamentary privilege, he will agree that this proposal makes one of the worse possible attacks on it. The Parliament itself decides a question of privilege if the occasion arises. Members of Parliament are privileged; but if , in the opinion-of the House, an individual member is guilty of Mr Rosevear. a breach of those privileges, it may sit in judgment to determine, whether he has committed a breach of privilege, and, if so, the penalty for it. No one has ever recognized the authority of even the highest tribunal in the land outside of the Parliament to deal with the offending member. That right has always been jealously preserved by the Parliament. This Parliament has gone even further than that. On one occasion, it dealt with a member of the House for statements that he made outside the Parliament. pub- Because it adjudged him guilty of a breach of privilege, it expelled him, and he never returned. The second proposal of the honourable - member for Warringah is inconsistent with the purposes of the clause, which confers privilege on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees engaged in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The honourable member proposes to. abandon the privilege which the Parliament has always jealously guarded, namely, the right to deal with its own members for breaches of privilege. A perusal of the amendment will reveal that the intention is to make an honourable member liable to the jurisdiction of some authority outside the Parliament. The honourable member for Warringah would deprive honourable members of the privilege that they enjoy today, and allow some judicial authority to decide whether a breach of privilege had been committed. If that view were to prevail, the freedom of speech which honourable members now enjoy would be restricted by the fear that their statements in this chamber, which they thought were based upon excellentauthority and yet were untrue, would make them subject to the authority of a tribunal outside the Parliament. Their immunity from proceedings for statements made in this chamber would be removed. Briefly, the proposal of the honourable member for Warringah,' if adopted, will deprive the Parliament of the right to determine privilege and exact a penalty for any breach. The honourable member is prepared to withdraw the amendment if a special committee- a ""triumvirateconsisting of Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister and. the Leader of the Opposition, is constituted to determine what the House should determine, namely, whether an honourable member has committed a breach of privilege, and the penalty for it. In view of all the circumstances, I believe that that part of the amendment should not he tolerated for a moment. It represents the worse attack that I have ever known on the accepted principles of parliamentary privilege and the.manner of dealing with it.",80
386,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I should like a direction from the Chair in . dealing with this matter. Earlier, I indicated that I could not support .sub-clause 2 of the amendment for reasons similar to those which have been stated, hut I am in accord with the principle of sub-clause 1. In fact,. I prepared an amendment, suggesting that the words "" any person "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" the Australian Broadcasting Commission or any employee thereof acting within the scope of his authority "". If the amendment is rejected, shall I then be in order in moving the amendment I have just indicated?",82
387,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL, If the amendment now before the Chair is negatived the right honourable gentleman will then be in order in moving his proposed amendment.,82
388,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for In formation) [1.21 a.m.] - Because of the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), I did not expect that the second portion of the amendment would be discussed. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) would take us back to the days before the last of the Stuarts left the throne of England. As I said earlier, our rights and privileges as determined by the Constitution, are those laid down for the House of Commons unless and until such time as the Parliament otherwise determines. The Parliament has never otherwise determined, and so we enjoy the rights and privileges of members of the British House of Commons. The privilege of freedom .of speech is declared in the 9th Article of the Bill of Rights ""in 16SS to be That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or . place out of Parliament. No other Parliament has ever adopted the principle which the honourable membe has proposed.",82
389,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,When it suits their purpose members of the Government do not hesitate to take refuge in a etatute passed in the reign of William and Mary.,82
390,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That would be a comparatively modern period of time, having regard to the political ideology of the honourable gentleman from Warringah. At the commencement of every British Parliament since the reign of Henry VIII . , it has been the custom for the Speaker to lay claim to the ancient and undoubted rights of the members of the House of Commons, particularly that their persons, estates and servants, may be free from arrests and all molestations, that they may enjoy liberty of speech in all their debates'; may have access to His Majesty's royal person whenever occasion' shall require; and that all their proceedings may receive from His Majesty the most favourable construction. I do not believe thai, forty-six years after the establishment of federation, this Parliament will agree to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah, nor do I believe that such a proposition should be considered during the debate on a bill which establishes the right of Parliament to broadcast its proceedings and which vests in the Postmaster General the authority to broadcast such proceedings. The Postmaster-General is not the proper authority to deal with the question of privilege. As a matter of fact the whole amendment might very well be ruled out of order. Amendment negatived.",82
391,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [1.25 a.m.] - I move That the words "" any person"" be left out and the following words be inserted in lieu thereof:- "" the Australian Broadcasting Commission or any employee thereof acting within the scope of his authority "". Honourable members will find that clause 4 provides that the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall broadcast the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is the only body upon which a duty is imposed to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament; certainly no right is conferred upon any other body to do so. That is why it is rather curious to find that, having provided in clause 4 that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to be the broadcaster of our debates, clause 14 then provides that no action shall lie against "" any person "" for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings. I believe that the giving of a privilege to a partial broadcast is wrong. I shall not labour that, as I have already stated my view; but if privilege is to attach it should attach only to the commission and its servants. It should not be given to people who are outside the commission. I see no reason why there should be re-broadcasts of portions of the debates in this House by commercial concerns. I do not understand that. If this bill is designed as a means of acquainting people with what is being transacted in the Parliament, then the national broadcasting systemshould broadcast the debates to the people, and consequently my amendment is designed to confine the privilege to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the people who are carrying out the work for it. That, I believe, puts some limitation on the privilege conferred. seems eminently reasonable and from my point of view it is the next best thing to having no privilege at all. I do not know whether it is contemplated seriously that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to make the broadcasts of Parliament available to commercial stations so that they may re-broadcast little bits of the debates as it suits them. I was under the impression that the idea was that wn provide direct broadcasts of the debates in the Parliament. In fact I do no! know why the word "" broadcasting"" does not cover the making of records and their replaying. The words "" broadcast "" and ""re-broadcast"" are not technical terms. We are using them in the loose sense; but there is little doubt that the whole broadcast itself might be made from records. If that were done it would still be a broadcast - The real point is that it should be done only by a body which has direct _ responsibility, as has' the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Consequently, failing in my desire to see clause 14 omitted altogether, I propose Mr Menzies. the amendment in order to confine theprivilege to the commission and to itsemployees.",82
392,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information) [1.29 a.m.] - There has been a long-standing argument between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission as to wherethe responsibility of one begins and that of the other ends. If it could, the commission would acquire the control of all of the technical side of broadcasting; but up to datethe Postmaster General's Department has been able to establish with every government its claim that its authority extends right up to the microphone and that the authority of the Australian Broadcasting Commission begins only at the microphone. When the matter is one of re-broadcasting and the provision of land-lines, the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department become involved both directly and indirectly in the actual work of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. It is true that only the Australian Broadcasting Commission is named in the bill as the authority that will broadcast It the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. That was necessary because the Australian Broadcasting Commission is an independent authority which could refuse a ministerial direction to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Australian Broadcasting Commission offered to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. But the Government considered that the Parliament should not be dependent upon the favour of'an instrumentality of its own creation, and decided instead to introduce a bill which would enable a direction to be given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to do certain things, and to apply compulsion should that body refuse to do what the Government and the Parliament wanted to have done. The officers of the Postmaster-General's Department are in a entirely different category. They are employees of the Crown, and, as such, can be directed to do certain things; consequeutly, there was no necessity to make any provision in relation to them or the department except in the matter of privilege and immunity from punishment. The words "" any person"" were used to cover - all the persons who could be legitimately employed in broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. The proposal of the honourable member for - Warringah (Mr Spender) so to narrow privilege as to embrace only the officers and agents of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is, in substance, what is now proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). The Government considers that everybody associated with the broadcasts should be given the same immunity and the same protection-no t merely those who name the speakers and do other things incidental to malting the broadcasts possible, but also all other people who collaborate throughout the length and breadth of Australia in taking broadcasts or rebroadcasts into the homes of the nation. What the bill proposes is in accord with the provisions of the act of this Parliament, which grants immunity to those who record, print and publish the debates of the Parliament, as well as those who print and publish every other document that is issued under the authority of the Parliament.",83
393,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"That relates to whole of the debate, or the whole document.",84
394,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"What the right honourable gentleman says is correct. But there is"" no inconsistency between that provision and the provision that any person associated with broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament, whether they be partial .or complete, should be granted immunity in respect of what he does under the direction of the Government. I hope it is not considered likely that there will ever be an abuse of authority by any of the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission or of the Postmaster-General's Department. There may be technical faults. Climatic or other conditions may cause a breakdown of the broadcasting service, and that is a contingency against which we cannot guard against. Honourable members need have no fear of any abuse under this clause. It will be for the committee which the bill proposes shall be sat up to determine how many or how few broadcasts shall take place. I do not think that any honourable member desires that the clause shall be abused, and I am sure that the committee that is to be set up Avill not allow it to be abused.  a.m.] - The Minister (Mr Calwell) has made it plain that to extend privilege in connection with broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament merely to the Australian Broadcasting Commission would not be sufficient, because the Postmaster-General's Department also will be associated with the broadcasts. I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman ha.*' given very careful consideration to the possible effect of the clause as it stands. Provision for the protection of those who will he engaged in the broadcasts authorized* by the Parliament is essential. So long as the Minister is satisfied that the clause as drafted does not go much farther than that, and confer on commercial broadcasting stations who make an unauthorized re-broadcast of portions of a debate, a licence to broadcast selected defamatory sentences, with complete privilege and immunity from punishment, then it will be all right.",84
395,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The clause, as the amended, of itself, would not do that; but it would if taken in conjunction with proposed new clause 13A.",84
396,Mr FRASER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am interested in proposed new clause 13A, because it aims to give to the committee the power to determine the conditions under which - a re-broadcast may be made. So long as the Minister is satisfied that there will be power to punish a commercial station that is known to have re-broadcast one or two defamatory sentences, or defamatory portions of a speech, after the Parliament has been prorogued and while an election campaign is in progress, the bill is satisfactory.",84
397,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,I assure the honourable gentleman that under the Australian Broadcasting Act the Postmaster-General would have the power to revoke the licence of such a broadcasting station. There is one example of a Minister having put a broadcasting station off the air.,84
398,Mr FRASER,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"I am glad to have that assurance from' the Minister, because I regard this as an extremely important matter. The complete protection of those who are engaged in making the broadcasts authorized by the Parliament is essential. It is equally important that protection should'not'be afforded to who broadcast any portion, of the proceedings of the Parliament, greater than is afforded to a newspaper or any other recorder of the proceedings of the Parliament. Such protection is given only when, the report is fair, and covers all phases of a debate. I accept the Minister's assurance.",84
399,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Kooyong-Leade r the Opposition) [1.40 a.m.] - We have just heard an extraordinary argument, and I do not profess to understand it. Are we to be told that the words "" any person "" are needed instead of a reference to the Australian Broadcasting Commishis department? sion, because some employee of the Postmaster-General's Department may be held responsible for defamation if he lays a land-line or provides are some piece of plant? I might well be told that a newspaper comsion. pany could involve a person who supplied it with newsprint in liability for an action for damages. The newsboy does not furnish such a good example, because he publishes the libel by selling the paper, but I have not heard it suggested that the person who supplies a newspaper with printer's ink may be held responsible for libels. Let us assume that the department supplies the equipment which makes this chamber resemble I a petrified forest. Am I to be told that the operator of the equipment makes himself liable for what is spoken afterwards? The broadcasting of the debates will be done not by the Postnot master-General's Department but by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its servants. The department will merely attend to the mechanical equipment. The commission will say, "" Here is microphone; we shall distribute .the debates to the listeners "". The privilege must be confined to those who would otherwise be liable, and they are the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees. It is all very well - for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Eraser) to say that he will be fied by a ministerial assurance, but if he agrees with me he will have an opportunity shortly to vote against the clause.",85
400,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Melbourne-Minister those for Immigration and Minister for In formation) [1.44 a.m.] - We have no assurance that what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has said is correct. Who can tell what the courts would decide? Nobody can forecast the judgment of the courts in these matters, and it is best to provide against every possibility. It might be held by the courts that the responsibility rests not of merely on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but is a joint responsibility of the department and the commission.",85
401,Mr MENZIES,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,Why not include the Postmaster-General and the members of,85
402,Mr CALWELL,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"What is the objection to including any person who broadcasts any portion of the debates? They all subject to the authority of either as the Postmaster-General or the commisThe original provision in the bill was copied, as far as it could be, from the relevant portion of the act, relating to the distribution of Hansard, and is in accordance with the recommendation newsof the committee that privilege should be extended to the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings in the same way as it is extended to Hansard. I urge the committee to vote against the-amendment, and to accept an amendment which intend to move-later to provide for the power to re-broadcast. Proposed new clause 13A meets the objection of those who see the possibility that privilege might he enjoyed by persons entitled to it. It is true that the man who supplies newsprint to newspaper proprietors does not know to what use the material will be put, but the Postmaster-General knows that when he pro- . the vides equipment for the commission it will be used for the purpose intended. He knows that things may be said which would be held by some people to be defamatory. We might get some extraordinary judgments from the courts based on the provisions of the measure if it is amended in the way the Leader of the satisOpposition desires. . What honourable members have thought to be clear in respect of other legislation has provided an opportunity for the highest courts in the land to divide themselves and render judgments which seem to he beyond the comprehension of laymen. This clause was drafted by the legal advisers of the Government, who do not see the dangers feared by members of the Opposition, and there is no reason why the Government should reject the legal advice tendered to it . Extraordinary powers are possessed by the Postmaster-General to put stations off the air when he considers it necessary to do so,, and he has the right to - keep them off the air for. many months. That was done during the war in respect of the station controlled by the Jehovah Witnesses organization, without reasons being given. That proved that any station which attempted to flout the law when Parliament was not sitting could be quickly penalized.",85
403,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"Barker) [1.39 a.m..] - The statement that the Postmaster-General has the power to put stations off the air is not quite - correct, as the powers previously exercised are now to be modified in certain important particulars. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) showed conclusively that for the protection of the privileges of ^the Parliament the amendment foreshadowed by the - Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) should be accepted. Shortly afterwards the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Eraser) took a similar stand. When two of the most acute minds on the Government side support the case presented by the Opposition, there are two courses. open to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). I prefer that he should tell the Minister in charge of the bill not to be so dogmatic-to be, now and again, a little more reasonable. A further suggestion is that he should refer the matter back to caucus for further consideration. If this clause goes through in spite of the case made out against it by some of the Government's own supporters, the purpose of this committee will be stultified. When in committee we should consider measures, not in a party spirit, but in a desire to do what is right in the circumstances. Question putThat the amendment (Mr MENZTES'S) be agreed to.

405,Mr DEDMAN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The Supply ruiid Shipping has supplied the following answers:1. Apart from wives, dependants and fiancees of Australian servicemen it is underhigh stood that there are some 3,000 to 4,000 tralians in the United Kingdom awaiting passages to Australia. The number who have .applied for priority passages on compassionate grounds is not known here. All applications for priority passages and the allotment of passages are dealt with by the Australian High Commissioner's Office, London. A contively siderable number of wives, dependants and ""fiancees of Australian servicemen already been transported to Australia due the efforts of the Resident Minister in London, who was successful in securing - allocation of S00 berths per month.

Before incurring further expenditure on this department this financial year, will he order a searching investigation into its activities with a view to a drastic reduction of expenditure? ' Mr CJIIFLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Government has decided as a matter of policy that the work of the Department of Minister for Information should be continued and it is not the practice to discuss government policy i i i reply to questions. It will be evident, however, to honourable members that the Department of - Information is carrying out work of national importance by making Australia Ausmore favourably known abroad with a consequential stimulation of the demand for our primary and secondary produce, by interesting potential migrants in Australia as their future home and by advertising the Commonwealth as a field for the investment of oversea capital. To carry out this programme effeci t has been necessary to establish and maintain writing, short wave, film and photohave graphic sections of the department in Austo tralia and also publicity representatives at. eleven oversea points, in spite of which the an Commonwealth's national publicity service The costs considerably less' per head of population - than those of any other progressive nation. 2.

Every effort is being made to ensure the importation of a maximum number of tractors. The limiting factor is the inability of American manufacturers to supply Australia's tractor needs. 5. There are approximately 60,000 tractors in Australia located on rural holdings. I am not aware of the number of tractors engaged in industrial undertakings. AGRICULTURA LMACHINERY POOLS.",90
417,Mr FADDEN,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice- 1. What were the profits or losses on machinery pools for the years 1943-44, 1944-45 and 1945-46 to the latest available date, grouped according to States? 2. What are the reasons for these losses and for their increase (if any) ? 3. Have any remedial measures been taken and with what results?",90
418,Mr SCULLY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:- 1. Nine Commonwealth comprehensive machinery pools have been in operation in four States, viz:-Ne w South Wales, 5; Questions. 2171 South Australia, 1; Western Australia, 1; Tasmania, 2. The financial results of the activities, of these pools have been as follows:New South Western Tas- South Australia. Aus- mania.

(Thesefiguresdo not allow for depreciation on plant and machinery.)' In addition approximately 230 hire-purchase machinery pools have been operating in-the States of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Under this scheme - machinery to the value of over £150,000 was allocated on a hire-purchase basis and repayments of the purchase values are being made satisfactorily. 2. The comprehensive pools were established in concentrated areas with prolific production potentials. The objective was the maximum production of foodstuffs for the fighting services to fill urgent demands which otherwise could not have been met. Much of the machinery was entirely new to Australian farmers and Australian conditions and a considerable amount of demonstration work was essential. Moreover, in order to induce farmers to use the machinery it became necessary to fix hiring charges at levels which would otherwise have been higher. Further, the acute shortage of mechanical labour and repair facilities made it necessary to employ operators and mechanics for the whole year instead of on a seasonal basis. 3. Yes. In 1945, the hiring charges for the comprehensive pools in New South Waleswere increased by approximately 33& per cent. The results of this increase have not been apparent because of the Government's decision, following upon the easing of the heavy Service demands for vegetables and potatoes, toterminate its direct interest in these pools. The machinery in some of the pools has already been disposed of and action is being taken in respect of the remainder.",90
419,Mr ANTHONY,MEAT INDUSTRY CONTROL,"the Minister for - Commerce and A g r i c u l t u r e , upon notice I. Is it a fact that, about three months ago, the Government approved a plan for far m mechanization and machinery pooling? 2. Is it a fact that approval was given for the mechanization of small farms which, in the past, have been limited in development and production by the amount of machinery they could afford? 3. If so, what action has been taken to give effect to the Government's decision? 4. If no action has yet been taken, when is it intended to do so? Mr SCULLY . : - The answers to the honourable member's questions are follows:1. Yes. 2. On 2(itli March the Government approved of the provision, of £50,000 to 30th June, 1940, to provide mechanization on a hire-purchase - basis-(a ) For groups of small farms, whose individual crop operations arc too small for power mechanization, and; (6) through contractors in rural districts for special work which it is not economic or reasonable for - farmers' to do with power mechanization owned by themselves. In ' all cases evidence must be provided that a group of farmers require this service. 3 and 4. The hire-purchase machinery pooling system has been in operation since early 1944,"" and has developed strongly in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, and to a lesser degree in South Australia. The New South Wales and Queensland Governments, have instituted their own machinery pooling schemes and have not participated in the system established by the Commonwealth - Government. Following upon the Commonwealth. Government's approval of 26th March, 1940, the New South Wales and Queensland - Governments have, been given a further opportunity to join in the scheme, but have not - so far signified their intention to do so. The additional funds provided by the Commonwealth Government in. March were for the purpose of ensuring continuity of the hire purchase machinery pooling scheme already - in operation ponding the development of a - long term plan tobo agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the States. These funds have been expended by way of advances to contractors in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania to enable the purchase of approved machinery to be used on a pooling basis aud the Government will shortly be giving consideration to the - question of the further extension of the scheme. In March the Government also approved of - a three-year programme for the development - of new types of agricultural machinery and the fostering of farm mechanization. Preliminary surveys have already been under'taken in respect of a number of mechanization problems, and in addition the Director-Generalof Agriculture (Mr Bulcock) who is at present overseas representing the Commonwealth Government at international food .conferences, will ' be taking advantage of the - opportunity to investigate some of the phases - of agricultural mechanization - countries. NA",90
420,Mr FADDEN,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"the Minister for ^Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. What was the total cost, to the latest - available date, of the Government vegetable - farms at Home Hill , Queensland? 2. What was the value, to the latest available date, of products (a) supplied direct to as the services, (6) sold through the Committee of Direction of F r u it Marketing, Townsville, and (o) sold through channels other than the above ? 3. Are these farms at present in operation? 4. If not, when did production cease? 5. Were there any vegetable farms of a similar nature elsewhere in Australia? 0. If so, (a) where, (b) what was the total expenditure to the latest available date, and (e) what were the receipts for products supplied by such farms to the latest available date?'",91
421,Mr SCULLY,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"The answers to the r i g h t honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The total gross expenditure to 24th June, 1940, on Commonwealth vegetable farms in north Queensland was £157,731. This amount includes capital expenditure on establishment of the projects, including farm buildings and accommodation for workers (including prisoner-of-war labour), also machinery and farm equipment, irrigation facilities, etc., in addition to operating expenses, wages, materials, fuel, etc., much of this expenditure was necessary in order to 'bring qxiickly into large scale production of vegetables some extensive areas which were not previously equipped for such production. 2. Receipts for products .supplied from these farms to'- the termination of activities at the end of October, 1-945, totalled £23,882. The figures have not been dissected to the extent desired by the honourable member but it can. be stated that the bulk of the produce from these farms was supplied to the services in north Queensland either directly or through the Committee of Direction of F r u it Marketing, which organization acted as the agent of the Comniouwealth for the purpose. 3. No. 4. 31st October, 1945. 5. and 0. These farms were established in 1943 at a time of special-emergency in north Queensland in order to produce locally a proportion of the fresh vegetables required by Australian and Allied forces based on north Queensland. At the time shipping and land transport facilities were overtaxed and the establishment of the Commonwealth projects in other was undertaken at the direct request of the fighting services concerned. There were no Commonwealth vegetable farms of a similar nature elsewhere in Australia, although it is understood that the Army grew vegetables at a number of points in north Queensland and FARMS. ^Torthcrn Australia, and later in New Guinea and the islands. Further, by agreement with the New South Wales Government, the Department of the Army and my department cooperated with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in the large-scale production with prisoner-of-war labour of vegetables sit the Blvcrina Welfare Farm, Yanco, the produce being. mainly processed for the use of. the services. My department is not in possession of the figures of final expenditure and receipts for projects other than the north Queensland farms. FILM ' QUOTAS.",91
422,Mr ABBOTT,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"the Minister represuggest. senting the Minister for T r a d e Customs, upon not i c e 1. Does the Commonwealth film quota proin vide that each exhibitor shall screen a certain number of British films each month; if so, what is the number? 2. Are country as well as city exhibitors required to conform with the quota profact visions?",92
423,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"The Minister for Trade tralia and Customs has supplied the following answer:The Commonwealth Government has no ports power to legislate concerning the exhibition of films, which is a matter coming within the province of the State governments. Only the Now South Wales Government has so far fresh passed legislation providing for the exhibition of a certain quota of British films. The New South Wales Act lays down that, of films hibited by every city and country theatre New South Wales during any financial 15 per cent, shall bo British. IMPORTED NEWSPAPER MATERIAL. - Mr BERNARD CORSER asked the P r i m e Minister, upon notice 1. In view of the Government's concern save dollar exchange, can he explain why certain leading Sydney newspapers are allowed free use of trashy American comics in what are described as children's supplements? 2. If the Government is concerned, with advancement of Australian culture to the preservation of dollar exchange, why are these newspapers allowed to use these syndicated comics, which, together with newsprint for their publication, must b.e - purchased from dollar sources? 3. In view of the recent banning of books by Australian authors on the grounds that they might corrupt the morals of adult readers, will the Government consider some check on the comics featuring crime and foreign jargon which arc published by certain reputable newspapers for juvenile readers?",92
424,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"The Minister for Trado and Customs has supplied the following answers:1. The newsprint rationing scheme does not go so far as to lay down a policy as to the matter which a newspaper proprietor shall, or shall not publish. That is a question for the newspaper proprietor himself, provided he keeps within the law to which, he is subject. If all the subscribers to the newspapers to which the honourable member refers take the same view of these strips as he does, it is. probable that newspaper proprietors ^yollld at least consider whether they were acting wisely in continuing to.publish them. I understand that the imported comic strips are being published throughout Australia, and not only in Sydney as the honourable member would The principal conditions which apply and when a newsprint allocation is granted to a newspaper proprietor are that it shall be used the production of the newspaper and shall not be exceeded. As regards the questionraised concerning expenditure of dollar exchange on comic, strips produced abroad and used in Australia, it should not be overlooked that their distribution is world-wide and thisgreatly reduces their cost to the individual publishers. Generally speaking, the cost of these imported strips is met in Ausin Australian currency and the proceeds used on services and goods acquired in Australia. Occasionally dollar remittances areapproved for small amounts in respect of imof comic strips received prior to theperiod of control. The aggregate amount would not be material. As a rule the imported: - strips are re-drawn by Australian artists and printing blocks are niade before they areused in Australia. Comic strips produced in Australia by Australian artists are likewiseexdistributed in the United Kingdom and the in United States and those countries share the year, cost of their production. 2. Sec answer to question No. 1. 3. See answer to question No. 1. In view thereof, it is not considered that the publication of these comic strips calls for a n y special restrictive measures by the Commonwealth Government. At the present time their to importation is controlled by the Customs (Import Licensing) Regulations but there isnothing to prevent the importation of copies -- of the overseas newspapers in which thesecomic strips appear and from which they could the be copied in Australia by arrangement with in addition the overseas publishers.

CONFERENCES ABROAD : COMMUNIS T DELEGATES.",93
428,Mr CHIFLEY,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"On the 19th June, the honourable member for N e w E n g l and (Mr . A b b o t t ) asked the following question:I ask the Prime Minister whether various Communists like Mr Thornton have from time to time been sent abroad to represent Australia at international conferences, and whether their expenses have been paid by the Government ? The answer to the honourable member's question is. as f o l l o w s : For the most part, trade union delegates travelling abroad have been sent as representatives to International Labour Organiztion conferences or committees. The general practice which has been followed for workers' representatives in such cases is to compensate them on the basis of wages actually lost during the period of absence from Australia on the business of the conference or committee, or £10 per week, whichever is the less. Under the constitution of the International Labour Organization, each member government is responsible for the travelling and subsistence expenses of its country's delegates. However, for delegates to industrial 'committees, as distinct from conferences, the International Labour Organization bears the cost of travelling and subsistence expenses for both employers' and employees' representatives. The member government bears only the expenses of the government representatives. In addition, all governments have from time to time made some contributions towards the expenses of trade union and other representativestravelling abroad to attend important international conferences. As regards Mr Thornton, this Government paid his fare when he attended the first World Trade Union Conference in London as one of two Australasian Council of Trade Unions delegates. All other expenses were met by 'the delegates. For the second World Trade Union Conference, which Mr Thornton attended in Paris towards the end of 1945, as an Australasian Council of Trade Unions representative, no payments of any kind were made by the Commonwealth.

431,Mr DEDMAN,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"On the 2Sth June, the honourable member for Wakefield control. (Mr Smith) asked a question ooncering - the continuation of the petrol pool by the oil companies. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following answer:Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited was formed as a wartime storage aud distribution measure at the request of the Commonwealth with a view to the most effective use being made of bulk storages and as a means of conserving man-power and transport. The agreement then entered into provided that the "" pool "" should continue until six months after the cessation of active hostilities, which meant that the arrangement should have ended normally as at 31st March, 194G. Because of difficulties then associated with the reversion to a system of competitive trading the member companies of Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited decided to extend the life of the "" p o o l "" until 30th Juno, 1946; the companies have recently re-examined the position and in the light of continued difficulty with, drum supplies, transport, etc. the companies have decided upon a further extension to 31st December.. 1946, with provision foi termination of "" pool"" at an earlier date upon due notice of such intention being given by any member company. The decision to continue "" pool"" trading ; was one for determination solely by the oil companies and was taken by them alone. The industry did, however, give the Minister [79] . for Supply and Shipping advance notice of such decision and the reasons there for; the reasons advanced in support of the decision to extend "" pool"" trading are regarded as an valid ones and it is not felt that the continuato tion of "" p o o l "" is resulting in any disfor advantage to the public. Whether "". pool"" continues or is abolished has no bearing whatever ' on petrol rationing, which is a matter for Government decision solely and is con-, sidered in the light of the supply position alone. ' The current prices of petroleum products have been based on a system of "" pool "" trading and I feel satisfied that 'the Prices Commissioner, who is in close touch with the oil industry, will have full regard to the present of "" pool"" trading in considering the price structure.",94

WOOLLEN TEXTILES: EXPORTS.",94
433,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT VEGETABLE,"Eecentl y the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) asked a question concerning the export of woollen material to Russia. The honourable member suggested that excessive exports were causing a .local shortage of woollen clothing. The Minister for Trade and Customs has now supplied the following information :The great bulk of exports' to Russia, have been made by Unrra and have been destined for the Ukraine. In addition to Unrra shipments, the published figures include surplus army material which has been rejected as unsuitable both by the local trade and by Unrra. It should be remembered that the figures for gross exports include woollen materials of all kinds, most of which are quite unsuitable for local clothing ' requirements. In the financial year 1945-4C, for example, of 3,000,000 square yards already recorded as having been exported during 1945-46, approximately 2,000,000 square yards went to Unrra.
