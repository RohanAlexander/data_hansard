2,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the death on Monday, 28 July 1997 of Mr John FitzPatrick, a member of this House for the division of Darling from 1969 to 1977 and for the division of Riverina from 1977 to 1980. As a mark of respect to the memory of Mr FitzPatrick, I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA Health Insurance Premiums: Increases,13
4,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister confirm that MBF have applied to increase premiums for more than one million Australians by up to $275 a year and also plan to introduce a $50 a night co-payment for private hospital treatment? Does the minister agree that if these are approved MBF customers face: two premium increases in eight months, costing families more than $275 a year; large excesses on most policies; a $50 a night co-payment; and massive charges to cover medical gaps? Minister, finally, why won't you concede that your $1.7 billion subsidy to private health funds has been and will be a complete failure?",13
5,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are two parts to that question and I will take them in sequence. First, with relation to MBF, MBF's application is arrogant in the extreme, the method in which it was released to the public has been arrogant in the extreme, and it makes me very, very angry. This sort gance can backfire. MBF should not assume that the government's approval is automatic, unlike the Labor Party, which rubber-stamped every single increase for 13 years-every single one. On the second issue of the private health incentive rebate scheme, you have never seen anyone happier than the member for Dobell, running around saying, 'They have failed, they have failed.' How can they fail on figures that finish the day before they start? The figures that came out were for 30 June; the rebates were for 1 JUly. No-one will know whether they have worked or not until we have had two quarters to run it through. There are two real differences between the government and the opposition. First, the government is at least attempting to do something where you sat by for 13 years and let premiums go up 12 per cent a year on average. You sat on your hands and you let them go up. At least we are attempting to make a difference. Secondly, we are attempting to make a difference in the areas where you were incapable of doing so, such as in out-of-pocket expenses and informed financial consent-things that Labor health ministers wailed about but in the end were incapable of ever addressing. We have had the guts and we have had the intellect to try to find new ways of addressing these. In the end it will be some quarters before we know whether or not they have worked. The anecdotal evidence is quite good. The anecdotal evidence I have, which is commercial-in-confidence, is that it was the week beginning 27 June before new memberships started to come in. The figures that you are new relying on are figures from 1 April to 30 June. So any effect that the government's incentives have had will come through in the next two quarters, particularly as the major effect will be on the drop-out rate, which is not something which happens overnight.",13
6,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a supplementary question. My supplementary question to the minister is, if he is angry about MBF's application, will he give the House an assurance today that he will reject the application and he will not allow the introduction of the $50 a day coof arro- payment on private hospital beds?",13
7,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will give him and the House an assurance that I will follow the law, which constrains me. However, I will say I will give it a lot closer scrutiny than you lot ever had the guts to do in 13 years. NA",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the next question, I advise the House that we have in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Sir James Killen, former member for Moreton, former Minister for Defence and a most distinguished parliamentarian. A very warm welcome to you, Jim. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Taxation Policies",14
9,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question today is addressed to the Prime Minister. Constituents in my electorate of Fisher are expressing support for the government's proposal to modernise Australia's unfair tax system. In following the tax debate, has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the advocacy of alternative tax proposals?",14
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to confess that the answer to that question is, yes, my attention has been drawn to the advocacy of alternative taxation policies. For example, my attention was drawn to the advocacy by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of a GST, only to be repudiated within a few hours by his leader. My attention has been drawn to the advocacy of death taxes by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But, as the debate wears on, one's attention is increasingly drawn to the absolute plethora of alternative taxation policies. For example, the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Melbourne, had this to say about alternative taxation policies. He did not content himself with hints, winks and nudges. This is what he had to say: We should abolish negative gearing and modify the capital gains tax exemption by, for example, applying that exemption only to the unimproved value of houses purchased. We should have an inheritance tax or some tax of that nature. I repeat: a member of the Labor Party front bench has directly advocated an inheritance tax! He is not hiding behind the sorts of weasel words as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did yesterday. He went on: Deemed capital gains tax on death is another option in that regard ... there should be a return to the 60c in the dollar tax rate for people earning over $75,000. He wants to go back to $60,000! But-this is the piece de resistance-he said: I think our overall tax take at the moment has become too low. I am quite happy to state that I think the total tax take is too low. Given that the Leader of the Opposition has had a minor ministerial reshuffle today, will he take the opportunity of repudiating the views of his shadow transport spokesman? Health Insurance Premiums: Increases",14
11,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall taking personal control of health insurance premium increases and his solemn promise to the Australian people in August last year that 'any increase from now on will have to be approved at a political level'? Will the Prime Minister take personal responsibility for approving this MBF increase and all future applications, as he promised the Australian people he would do in Brisbane last August, or is the Prime Minister planning to breach that promise by caving into his health minister's plan to end ministerial and prime ministerial approval of health fund premium increases?",14
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to take personal responsibility for things for which I am responsible. But can I make it very plain to the parliament and to the House that the rises in premiums that are occurring at the present time are a direct result of what Labor did to the health insurance system. Let there be no argument about that. I remember a lot of things about what Labor did. One thing I remember most of all is how you deliberately ran down the private health insurance system. You inherited a private health insurance system that had 61 per cent of Australians insured. When you left office that had fallen to 35 per cent. That was a direct consequence of your ideological objection to private health insurance. You ignored the warning of Graham Richardson that, if you let it fall below 40 per cent, you were in danger of losing critical mass. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is on relevance. The Prime Minister was asked whether he would take personal responsibility for this increase or whether he would jettison the system of ministerial responsibility.",14
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,15
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I continue: no Labor health minister ever displayed the slightest interest in fixing up private health insurance. Your policy of neglect meant that premiums rose by an average of 12 per cent a year. In one catastrophic two-year period-between 1986 and 1988-premiums rose by a staggering 40 per cent. That is what you did to private health insurance. You have no authority whatever to lecture us.,15
15,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister is reading his answer which is a pretty fair indication that he is not actually answering the question.",15
16,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,15
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right!,15
18,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is that the question was specifically about whether or not the Prime Minister-there were no ifs or buts around it-was going to take responsibility for this set of approvals. He has yet to answer that question.,15
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Mr Crean-Give us an answer.,15
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you give him a chance, he might.",15
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply repeat that the rises in private health insurance premiums that have occurred over the last 18 months are a direct, undeniable and sole result of the destruction that you wreaked upon private health insurance over 13 years, and we accept no responsibility for that whatever. Small Business: Capital Gains Tax",15
22,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of further initiatives by the government to provide rollover relief from capital gains tax to Australian small business? Who will be eligible for this relief?,15
23,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. Before the last election the coalition announced that upon election we would be introducing capital gains tax rollover for small business so that, when they rolled over a business or an asset in the business, they would not be liable for capital gains tax. It was one of those tax commitments which the government made before the election which it has delivered on time and in full. We have now gone further than that. In March of this year we announced a major extension to the rollover provision, to provide relief where the sale of a business is accomplished through shares, and another further extension, to extend rollover relief to the disposal of units in a unit trust. Today I will be announcing the broad details of the way in which capital gains tax rollover relief will apply in relation to shares and units in a unit trust. It will apply to individual taxpayers not disposing of shares in the capacity of trustees. It will be limited to relatively simple structures: that is, multilayered structures will not be permitted. A capital gain on shares may be rolled over into shares in a company and a capital gain on an active asset may be rolled over in shares in a company. It took a coalition government to introduce capital gains tax rollover relief for small business. It could have been done by Labor during its 13 years in office, but Labor chose not to. It took a coalition government to ease the burden of capital gains tax rollover, when we were elected in March 1996. I regret to say that the Australian Labor Party has been trying to frustrate this improvement for small business in this country. The coalition government said that this rollover relief would be available for small business-up to $5 million of assets. It was the Australian Labor Party that in the last session tried to pare down the availability of this relief by including personal assets in that asset test. The Australian Labor Party is at it again. Another feature of capital gains tax rollover is to allow small business to roll over into superannuation upon retirement. That allows a small business person, who has saved in their own business, to roll over money into their retirement and get the opportunity of superannuation, which has been denied them. Again, I regret to say, the Australian Labor Party, in concert with the Democrats and the Greens, are trying to frustrate the implementation of this measure. They are trying again to penalise small business in this country. Why are they trying to penalise small business? Mainly because small business people are not joining trade unions in great numbers these days. They are trying to do it again by the same technique of wearing down the assets test by including personal assets. As far as this government is concerned, have delivered our election commitment in full and on time-and gone further. We will not sit by and allow the Australian Labor Party its attempt to penalise small business this respect. We will not accept those amendFebruary ments. We intend to deliver that benefit, full, to the small businesses which deserve it. Small Business",15
24,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I ask the Treasurer, on the subject of small business, what his reaction is to the Yellow Pages Small Business Index released today, which reveals that-among other things-nearly twice as many small businesses believe that government policy now works against them as those who believe that government policy is supportive, that more than 80 per cent small businesses believe that the economy overall is either in recession or at a standstill and that only eight per cent of small businesses believe that lower interest rates have any significant improvement to their situaWho tion? Just to really make the Treasurer's day Labor Party. complete",16
25,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: constantly today the questioners from the opposition ranks have chosen to make speeches when they could have got across the message they wanted with a two-line question. It is their responsibility to do so.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for O'Connor. I am sure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is drawing his question to a close.,16
27,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just to make the Treasurer's day complete, what is his reaction to the finding that only three per cent identified taxes as their prime current business concern and only two per cent regarded the introduction of a GST as the government's most urgent priority?",16
28,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for making my day complete. He regularly does so in question time. Every time he gets to his feet, he sort of enjollies all of us on this side of the House. The critical thing about the Yellow Pages we Small Business Index, which the Australian Labor Party likes to refer to, is that it shows a net negative on attitudes to federal government policy. That was the point that he made: in 11 per cent net negative. What was it in 1996? It is 11 now. What was it in in February 1996? In fact, who was in office in of this country, February 1996? Government members-Labor!",16
29,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And how long had they been in office? Government members-Thirteen years!,16
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The net negative was 46 per cent! Why do they ask these questions, except to make my day complete? You should get up here and say, 'To make the Treasurer's day complete, why is it that you are only four times better than we were?' We are rather of humiliated that we are only four times as good as you were, which indicates that we do believe that there is still more work to go. What should the government be addressing? made Unprompted, top of the mention: tax reform. is against tax reform? The Australian Mr Crean interjecting",16
31,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand reminded. You are in favour of tax reform. You are, aren't you? You are in favour of death duties! What areas are most in need of simplification? Top of the list for August 1996: sales tax! Thirtythey two per cent sales tax. As you go through this index-and it comes back through business survey after business survey-it is clear what business wants: they want a strong economy. What do they want? They want low interest rates. What do they want? They want tax reform. What do they want? Industrial relations reform. Where does Labor stand? Labor is against good macro-policy, Labor is in favour of high interest rates, Labor is against tax reform Labor wants to take the labour market back to the 1950s! No wonder we are only four times better than your performance! Small Business: Taxation",16
32,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House how the current indirect taxation system penalises exports and small business? How does the government intend to address these impediments to export growth and expansion of small business through reform to the taxation system?,17
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question, because the current WST system does lead to exporters paying wholesale sales tax indirectly. is because WST is charged in relation to their inputs. That means that they are paying tax on inputs, which they have to build into their price when they are competing on export markets. This is one of the reasons, if you are lookLeader ing at tax reform-and we are the side of the parliament that is looking at tax reform-you would be doing it to help exporters. I think everyone in this House would agree we should be helping exporters, but there is only one side of the parliament that is prepared to engage in the measures which are required to do it. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said that he is going to the ALP conference early next year and he is going to put in the ALP platform opposition to a broad-based indirect tax. That is what he is going to do when he gets to the ALP conference. His spokesman came out later in the day and said, 'But if the coalition gets elected, we will recognise that have a mandate to introduce a broad based indirect tax'-that is what he said. And then he said, 'And what's more, if it is introduced, we, the Labor Party, will never take it out again.' So where does the Labor Party stand?",17
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He's confirming it; he's saying one or the other.,17
35,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he is confirming it. Where does the Labor Party stand? The Labor Party stands like this: you take the leadership, and you change the tax system and we are going to try to creep back and take advantage of it. That is where you stand. The Australian Labor Party is the party of reaction; this is the party of leadership. We are prepared to go out and argue the c-se and lead.",17
36,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my left.,17
38,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is exactly the same in relation to surpluses. The Australian Labor Party runs around and does everything it can to prevent the budget getting back into balance. You vote against every expenditure reduction--everything you can. Then you say, 'But we are entitled to spend it.' As I said That yesterday, you are like Pooh Bear going to the pot of honey; if you can find somebody else's surplus you will try to expend it. But the important thing to remember is that there are leaders on the Labor side that are prepared to engage in this tax debate; not the of the Opposition and not his deputy, but Wayne Goss for example. Wayne Goss wants to come down and join the government on the great issue of tax reform. He said this in Meet the Press on 26 June 1997: I think the Prime Minister, Treasurer and federal government have to take the lead. We should be doing something now and I believe if they put something up concrete and specific Labor will be part of that debate. Sorry, Wayne, not this Labor Party; not this leader. What about Bob Carr? Bob Carr said on 2GB on 21 August 1997: Look, look. The tax is-leave aside the question of a GST. The tax system is a disaster. I've got these itsy bitsy business taxes as the major source of State Government revenue",17
39,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
40,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Listen! There are Labor Party people who can educate you on this. Bob Carr said: I've got these itsy bitsy business taxes as the major source of State Government revenue. And that's hopeless, lon.ltjust won't work, and that's got to be addressed in the forthcoming reform of taxes. That's what Bob Carr is telling you. We going to get Senator Campbell from the group ACTU here pretty shortly. He told the Finanhonourable cial Review that he has an absolute commitan ment to a progressive tax system. He called for a wide review of the existing system, including examining issues 'such as the GST",18
41,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Try it again.,18
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Trying to make this realise acceptable to the deputy leader, he said 'such as the GST and the possibility of wealth and inheritance taxes'. So what are you going say to George Campbell? 'Yes, we're with you on half of it, old son.' He said, 'I am fervent supporter of having the debate.' The fact of the matter is this: you have Australian Labor Party which is not just trying to go back to its defeat in the past election, you are trying to go back to the 1950s and 1960s. You are fully engaged in reactionary politics. You see a cheapjack opportunity come up, you try you try to win a few cheap votes here but all along you are sitting around thinking to yourselves, 'Gee, I hope these blokes can reform Australia. That is the only hope will ever have.' Health Insurance Premiums: Increases",18
43,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that with a 15 per cent GST or anything like it a tralians? Victorian family with full hospital private health insurance with a major national health fund would have to pay around a further $300 in tax on top of the $2,000 or more in yearly premiums they will face from 1 October? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Appreciating your insistence on higher standards of questions, I note that standing order 144(g) specifically prohibits questions which rely on hypothetical matter. For that reason I ask you to rule this question out of order.",18
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,18
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you what I can confirm about Victorian families. In the lifetime of everybody in this House there was more damage done to them by the Kirner and are Cain Labor governments than by any other of politicians. I would simply say to the member that we are carrying out orderly review of the tax system which is going to produce a new taxation system in Australia that will result in lower levels of personal income tax and will result in a business taxation system that will help take this country into the 21 st century and to its potential during that century. The only people in Australia who are standing against even looking at reform of the to tax system are the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party, instead of rea forming Australia's taxation system, want to increase it. Instead of lifting the burden off an the back of manufacturers, which is represented by the current system, they want to make it even worse. I invite the honourable gentleman to contemplate the contribution he could make to political debate in this country by persuading his leader to join the push for to get into it, taxation reform. Alice Springs to Darwin Rail Link",18
46,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to we the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Could the minister advise the House of the economic significance of this government's historic commitment to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway for the people of Kingston and, indeed, for all Aus",18
47,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kingston for her question. Like so many Australians the constituents of the honourable member for Kingston will benefit significantly from the announcement made by the Prime Minister in Adelaide last Saturday to complete the construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. For example, the honourable member for Kingston's constituents export cars, components and wine, and all of those industries will benefit from the establishment of that rail line between Alice Springs and Darwin. The economic significance for Australia generally will be substantial. There has been a great deal of recognition of the merits of the announcement made by the Prime Minister last weekend. Unfortunately, though, I have to report that there are some people who have been critical of the process and the announcement made by the Prime Minister. I noted, for example, yesterday on the ABC current affairs program AM Mr David Hill, a well-known supporter of this side of the political fence, reporting that he had done a study in his role as Chief Executive Officer of the State Rail Authority and had discovered that the Alice Springs to Darwin rail line was unviable. It is worth drawing to the attention of the House that the study undertaken by Mr Hill at the time was some 15 years old. It is now irrelevant. There are a number of studies that have been done since-interestingly, studies done by the former Labor government-that highlight the viability of this particular project and the economic merits that flow from it. One of those studies was undertaken in 1992 by the Australian National Railways Commission under the direction of the former Labor government. They had a study undertaken by Morrison and Knudsen, who concluded in their report made in 1993: The construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway is a viable project worthy of consideration. The project would have significant regional economic development impacts and stimulate minerals exports from the north. That study was followed up by the Wran committee, the committee for Darwin, that undertook a study on this whole subject using Booz Allen, who are internationally recognised as rail experts. They came up with their recommendations which were included in the Wran committee's report that was brought down in 1995. I will quote from the conclusions in that report put forward by Mr Wran: The railway will become economically viable early next century. The exact timing depends on freight growth which in tum depends mainly on three key factors-such things as economic growth, transport technology and of course mineral developments. Today I was pleased to note in the press that Meekatharra Minerals, who are the owners of one of the largest coal deposits anywhere in the world-some 15 billion tonnes of coalhave said that, as a result of the announcement made by the Prime Minister on Saturday, they think their mine-that deposit which has been unviable in the past-will now be viable in the future. What does that mean for Australia? It means billions of dollars worth of export income for Australia; it means hundreds of jobs, particularly in regional Australia. All this is being achieved by the coalition government, led by John Howard. The Labor Party could not resist trying to jump in on the bandwagon. The honourable member for Melbourne, the shadow minister for transport, made a statement earlier this week. He said, 'We in the Labor Party would apply some $300 million of funds to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway' - forgetting that they had 13 years to do something about the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, and that they did absolutely and utterly nothing, except make false promises. I quote from a promise made by former Labor Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke in 1983. Mr Hawke said, on the subject of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway: I promise you that only the Labor government can be trusted to build the Alice Springs to Darwin line. The facts speak for themselves. Labor cannot be trusted on these sorts of major transport infrastructure developments. Labor has not got the vision or the commitment to developing parts of regional Australia that could have been done years ago. It is only a coalition government that can deliver on these types of transport infrastructure improvements. NA",18
48,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon a distinguished group from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Malaysia Branch. On behalf of the House, I extend to you all a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Goods and Services Tax",19
49,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer. Is he aware of the recently published calculation of the National Tax and Accountants Association that, with a 15 per cent GST, the minimum additional tax that would be paid by an average family for services alone would be between $800 and $1,200 a year? Does he concede that, under a GST or anything like it, an ordinary family would be hit with a tax slug of lOc, 15c, 20c or more in the dollar every time they had a car repaired, a washing machine fixed, a toilet unblocked or any other household service performed? Under these circumstances, how can the Treasurer even contemplate introducing the tax that he has previously described 'snake oil'?",20
50,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We heard that kind of scaremongering in the period from 1990 to 1993. The kindest thing I can say for you is that you are only four years behind. What would the Labor Party do? We have had the High Court strike down business franchise fees which were raised by states-we have incredible complications in relation to that; we have state governments that are saying 'leadership on tax reforms'; we have a situation where, in a couple of years time, the average earner in Australia is going to be on the top margin of the income tax rate-and the Australian Labor Party says, 'You know what we should do? Nothing.' That is what they say-nothing. You are the party of reaction. I just want to illustrate this. Once upon a time you used to pride yourself on being a bit of a leader. But what is the leader reduced He is running around with these little Keating-type questions in the parliament, years after the event, looking for a horse that has bolted, trying to play out a campaign from memory. It was not even yours, you learned it in your sleep from Paul Keating. You know, and the whole of Australia knows, he did the wrong thing. He went to the Australian people-do you remember?-and he said, 'There's no need for indirect tax reform because I can reduce income tax rates without tax reform.' And he put it into l-a-w before the election, didn'the? It was the biggest fraud that the Australian public has ever had perpetrated on it. And what are you trying to do? You are trying to slip around again. But, as the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, the truth is this: deep down, desperately, they are hoping that this government can reform the tax system, and they want to slide in and capture the benefits. Mr O'Connor-So?",20
51,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You want us to get the Australian accounts out of a $10 billion deficit and into surplus and then slide in and try to spend it. You never took a decision; there was no leadership. We fought our battles to try to fix these things, and now you as are going to try to slide back in. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition just asked about services. On 13 May 1997 on the 3RW drive program, Gareth Evans said: Well, there are some problems in the tax system, and I think we are all well aware of them. In particular, the fact that the service part of the economy is not, I suppose, pulling its weight. That was before the Leader of the Opposition sat on him. When the tax reform debate came up, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said something very sensible: He said, 'Look, if this country can engage in tax reform and we can put together something that is going to help business and the wage earners of this country, it is something that we would be prepared to look at.' That is what he said. It took all of about three hours before the Leader of the Opposition sat on him, squashed him, put him out of the debate, because the Leader of the Opposition does not to? have the courage to engage in this particular debate. As I have said before, the unfortunate thing for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that 99 times out of 100 he gets it wrong, and the one time he got it right he was taken out of the play. Small Business: Capital Gains Tax",20
52,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. A number of small businesses in my electorate of Capricornia are concerned about reports today of the opposition's proposals to slash one of the government's key small business initiatives: namely, the capital gains tax exemption on retirement. Minister, will you explain to the House the implications of Labor and the minor parties in the Senate blocking this most important reform measure?",20
53,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The Treasurer did refer to this matter earlier, but I do think it is important for the House to understand exactly what has happened here. As the National Tax Accountants Association-not the government's greatest supporter-stated in their press release today, about one million small businesses were dealt an unexpected blow last night due to changes which have been foisted on legislation in the Senate by the Labor Party. That is right. What we saw last night was a stupid antismall business decision by the Labor Party. I would hope that those in the Labor Party who claim some interest in the small business community might at least grapple with what they have done and try to see whether they can make some sense of their position to see if we can get this thing fixed before it is too late. Let me explain to the House what has happened. Members will know that in March of this year the government announced that small business owners will be exempt from capital gains tax on the first half million dollars of proceeds from the sale of a small business if those proceeds are used to fund retirement-that is, provided net business assets do not exceed $5 million. That was the proposal. Yesterday in the Senate the Labor Party, with the support of the minor parties, have made an amendment which will reduce the number of small businesses that can qualify for this exemption from CGT on retirement. We wanted the initiative to be based on net business assets. That is the approach that we used for the other capital gains tax measure, the rollover relief when you go from one business to another business. The one we are dealing with at the moment is when you go into retirement out of your small business. The first leg of this duo was passed by the parliament in June and came into operation on 1 July. So we have the first part of this rollover relief in place under certain criteria. You have taken a benefit from something like a million small business people. Furthermore, because you have treated the second leg of this differently from the first leg, you have added for no good reason whatsoever a whole pile of complexity and red tape to what was that a simple, sensible measure to the benefit of the small business community. We have two measures which are now inconsistent. Even if some of you can see some rationale for what you have done, surely common sense would say to you, given that the measure went through in June in a particular form, it is a nonsense to tum it around and double up the complexity by changing the second half of it Then, when you look at the practical consequences of this, you see the inequity in it. Now we have personal assets included, and for most people that is their family home. If you have a business in Sydney and one in Geelong of exactly the same dimensions and exactly the same value but your house which is the same in Sydney as it is in Geelong but is valued more, in one case you get the benefit and in the other you do not. There is no rhyme or reason that you should treat business people in Sydney differently than the people that you treat in small businesses elsewhere around the country. Just for good measure, the Labor Party, which gave us a lot of complexity and red tape for small business when in government, even in opposition is piling on the red tape and complexity in the Senate while we are trying to get it off small business. If you are in small business and you retire and are looking for this exemption, you have to get a valuation on your home and a valuation on your car. You are in retirement, you are spending hours and hours on red tape for absolutely no reason whatever, except for the fact that the Labor Party in the Senate are basically trying to do all they can to prevent the government providing a benefit to the small business community. That leads me to say one last thing. The only other possible rational reason that you would want people to value their assets, which has been rather starkly demonstrated by the Treasurer today, is that you have frontbenchers who are advocating death duties. How incredible! You have the member for Melbourne publicly advocating the introduction of the death duty, and you have a weak leader who has no political capacity to repudiate it. I say to the small business community: every small business person in Australia today should get on their computers or pick up pencil and paper and write a letter of objection to the Labor Party. There should be a storm of protest against yet another proposal and another action of the Labor Party which is to the detriment of the small business community. NA",21
54,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we also have in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Jim Carlton, a former Minister for Health and former member for Mackellar. A warm welcome back, Jim. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Provisional Tax",22
55,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Treasurer agree that average earnings are expected to increase by around four per cent and company incomes by around 3.25 per cent? Can the Treasurer say that the incomes of other non-PA YE taxpayers will rise by six per cent or more? If not, and given that the formula in place cannot produce a worthwhile reduction, will he further reduce the present six per cent provisional tax uplift factor?",22
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The provisional tax uplift factor at the moment is set by a formula which takes into account growth in the economy and makes allowance for growth in income. I believe it is put in at the end of December quarter. It is stipulated in the tax legislation. You just take the amount off growth in the past year and divide it by the quotient, and it produces that particular formula. For the current year it has produced the formula of six per cent. If national incomes feeding into national domestic product are lower in the future, it will produce commensurately a lower factor. But it will always be in contact and in touch with growth in the economy.",22
57,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question.  Liberal Party?",22
58,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did you say, 'When is the Treasurer going to join the Liberal Party'? Does the Treasurer concede that the cash flows of affected provisional taxpayers will be diminished unfairly, because at six per cent the tax is about one-third higher than it should be?",22
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order.,22
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I do not, for the reasons I have said before. The provisional uplift factor is set by reason of the growth in the economy making allowance for inflation. You have to make allowance for both. By putting that formula in place, the formula always gives an outcome which is closest to the actual outcome growth in incomes overall-incomes in the corporate sector, incomes in the general sector, incomes through wages. So I do not for a moment concede that. Having said all of that, I am sure the honourable member for Curtin would agree with me that this is a vastly improved system to the one that this government inherited when it came to office. When we came to officeMr Rocher interjecting",22
61,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it was not. There was a default factor. Unless it was actually passed by the parliament, it went back to the default factor. The difficulty was trying to get this passed by the parliament. Not only did we reduce it by two per cent-with, I recall, $120 million given back the to taxpayers; it was either $120 million or $160 million, or something of that order-we also put in place a formula which governs the thing for the future. I think that the honourable member for Curtin will believe that this was a very worthwhile improvement by this government. Let me say why it was done. It was done because, if we had not moved, if we had not got rid of Labor's system, people would still be assessed for increases in income which they were not earning and paying tax on it. You can get that back at the end of the year or you can lodge a variation. This is a formula which governs it for now and for the future to get it back in whack with growth in incomes. Australian Public Service",22
62,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service. All members of the House and the community would recognise the importance of a high quality Australian Public Service that is committed to the service of the Australian public. I ask minister: what are the government's plans to enshrine merit for individuals seeking a position in the Australian Public Service, and is the minister aware of comments about the government's approach? Mr Melharn-You can start with merit on your front bench.",23

64,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,23
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right. ,23
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Sturt.,23
67,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kooyong for his question, and I acknowledge his very deep interest in the matter of Public Service reform. The Commonwealth government is committed to ensuring that Australia has the highest possible quality Public Service to ensure that Australians get the best service at the community level and that the Public Service provides very good value for the taxpayers of this country. The Public Service Bill is a fundamental reform that is part of the government's strategy in preparing Australia to meet the challenges of the 21 st century. This bill already has been acknowledged as a great piece of legislation. I am very pleased to pay tribute to the honourable member for Flinders, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, for the outstanding work that went into the development of this reform. A central element of the government's reforms is the principle of merit. The principle is enshrined in the bill. It is now clear as a result of the draft directions, released this week, from the Public Service Commissioner that those directions will further support the government's commitment to ensuring that appointments in the Public Service are made on the basis of merit. The directions of the Public Service Commissioner indicate that this will be done by opening the advertised positions within the Public Service to public competition and the public application. Approximately 8,400 positions in the Public Service are advertised each year, and at present only about 2,400 of those positions are open to those outside the Australian Public Service. Therefore, under the reforms announced, an additional 6,000 job opportunities will be open to the general community. Under the commissioner's directions, advertised vacancies will be open to all Australians whether or not they are APS employees and, as a minimum, the opportunity must have been notified in the Commonwealth government Gazette. This will help to ensure that the Australian Public Service reflects the general community in its composition-which I would have thought the opposition would have been very pleased to support-and has the opportunity to choose the best possible applicant for these positions. Mr MCMullan-There are not many of them.",23
68,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are some 200 positions a week advertised, so you might take that into account. There are quite a few of these positions. This bill places a very significant test on the opposition. It will give us a further opportunity to see what the Leader of the Opposition is made of. One of the very clear things about this bill is that it is not a partisan piece of legislation. It is a bill that clearly enshrines the apolitical Public Service and builds on principles that have been articulated in the past by the Leader of the Opposition. In July 1994, the then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, foreshadowed the direction of reform in the Public Service. He said: the Australian Public Service will be integrated into, and work in close alignment with the broader Australian community . . . Commercialisation of government activities will continue. Competition will become commonplace, in some cases through privatisation ... the Commonwealth public service will become a smaller ... elite service. That was the view of the now Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would be prepared to commit the Labor Party to the support of this bill but once again we are seeing the shallow, short-sighted opportunism-the cheapjack opportunism-of the opposition in relation to reform.",23
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is digressing from the answer. Has the minister concluded his answer?,24
70,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to the length of this question. You have admonished us in terms of the length of questions and you have also asked the government to keep their responses short. This answer has been rambling on forever, and now he is referring not to his policy but to what we were doing. I would ask you to draw him to a conclusion.",24
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have listened to your point of order. There have been a number of particularly long questions asked today, and there has been one reasonably long answer. The question was a complex one from the member for Kooyong. I have been listening very carefully to the minister's response and there was just a minor digression towards the end of his answer. I now give the minister a final opportunity to conclude his response.",24
72,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, thank you. I remind you that the question did ask whether we were aware of comments. The opposition now faces the issue of whether or not it is prepared to stand by the principles that it enunciated when it was in government or whether it is going to go along with the criticisms of the bill, the negative attacks on the bill.",24
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his seat. Has the minister concluded?,24
74,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,24
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is this: without any reference to any particular views on our part, views which we have not expressed-he is claiming a set of views-the minister now goes outside the question which was specifically to the government's rationale, not any response of ours. There has not actually been a response from us; nevertheless, the minister has managed to develop one in the course of the last two or three minutes. If he wants an answer from us: will we let him politicise the Public Service; the answer is no, we will not,",24
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"if he wants to know that. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the question raises the substance of reforms to the Australian Public Service. The question was widely drafted; the minister is entitled to fully answer the question and most members, if they were assessing this fairly, would say that his answer has been entirely relevant and he is entitled to take as much time as is necessary to fully answer the question. Those are the standing orders, Mr Speaker.",24
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the House. I have taken cognisance of both points of order. I have asked the minister to quickly address the final elements of the question, but there is no time constraint on questions-as you all know. The question, as I intimated earlier, was complex. The minister's response is detailed but I do encourage the minister to address the final elements of the question.",24
78,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I thank you for your understanding on this. I remind the House that the question specifically asked me whether I was aware of comments on this legislation. I have just been addressingbefore these points of order-the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. I now draw attention to the factMr Bevis-It was not on this legislation.",24
79,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was on the government's plans to reform the Public Service.,24
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are misleading the House.,24
81,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was on these plans to reform the Public Service.,24
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the minister has now confessed that he is not in fact dealing with an answer to that question. That question went to the planned so-called changes on merit in relation to the legislation that the government has introduced for the Public Service. The minister is now trying to claim that a speech I made a couple of years ago is an answer to this particular proposition. I admire my capacity for prophesy, but I am not that good. .",25
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening to the Leader of the Opposition but there is no point of order.,25
84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All we see is the extreme sensitivity of the opposition when the contrast Hotham. is pointed out between the comments that they have made relevant to Public Service reform and the attitudes that are currently being displayed in the Senate by Senator Faulkner. It is quite clear from Major Backdown over there that the opposition is now going to be in the position of retreating once again from the position that the Labor Party has previously taken.

86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham: it is your question.,25
87,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it not the case that, without the exclusion of education services from a 15 per cent GST, universities will have to charge $15,000 on top of their $100,000 up-front undergraduate fees? Will the Prime Minister now give the House a guarantee that in any GST proposal education expenses will be excluded so that parents do not have to pay more for school as well as university fees, school excursions, uniforms and transport to and from school? If you will not give such a guarantee, Prime Minister, why not?",25
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will give this guarantee to the honourable member for Werriwa. I will give a guarantee that the reforms to the Australian education system implemented by this government will deliver superior outcomes than those under your government. I will give a guarantee that we will continue not to maintain an education system that taxes working-class people to pay the free university fees of higher income earners. Mr Crean interjecting,25

90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will give you a guarantee that we will continue to support the freedom of choice of Australian parents in education. Mr Crean interjecting,25
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for,25
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am proud of the education reforms that my government has carried out. I will give you the final guarantee that we will deliver a taxation system that will take this country proudly into the 21 st century. Medical Graduates: Career Prospects,25
93,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House of any new developments with regard to career prospects for medical graduates? I understand that there are about 1,200 graduates of Australian medical schools each year, many of whom are nervous about their ability to undergo further training. Can the minister inform the House how many training places will be available in 1998?",25
94,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Consequent on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996, the Commonwealth required medical graduates to undertake greater proficiency and training prior to getting automatic access to Medicare provider numbers. This legislation was subject to a great deal of misinformation and a great deal of anxiety on behalf of medical students and young doctors. In talks with young doctors and medical students, the greatest concern that I came across was access to further training. Because of this, the medical training review panel was set up last year. This morning I received the first report from that medical training review panel. There were three areas that I asked the panel to look at. The first was the number of training positions, the second was hospital training and the third was transparency of the selection processes into medical specialist colleges. On the first one-the number of training positions available-it actually turned out to be very difficult to find out how many training positions states and territories offered, but we do feel that we now have exact numbers. There are over 5,660 training positions of all years of training. They are made up of general practice, 28.3 per cent; psychiatry, 11.7 per cent; internal medicine, which includes paediatrics, 11 per cent; emergency medicine, 10.6 per cent; anaesthetics and intensive care, 9.4 per cent; surgery, 8.4 per cent; and obstetrics and gynaecology, 6.2 per cent. The trainees are well distributed around Australia with respect to states and territories. Looking at their population, 42 per cent of all advanced trainees in Australia are women. When you look to next year, 1998, 1,369 training places will be offered. Again, on a geographic distribution, New South Wales and Queensland are probably a little bit under and Victoria is a little bit over on a per capita basis. However, this is substantially larger than the 1,200 medical students who graduate and we estimate a little bit over the 1,000 Australian medical students who will actually be looking for advanced training. If you add to that all the overseas trained doctors coming through the Australian Medical Council exam, we expect that there will actually be about 150 training places unfilled next year. This is very different from the figure that was being bandied around of 400 to 600 doctors missing out on training places. Looking at the hospital medical officers, HMO, working group, the medical training review panel has come up with very strong recommendations. It recommends that the first two years of training should produce wellrounded general training and that formal streaming should not occur until the third year of training. It also recommends that all postgraduate training should include at least one term of rural training and at least one term of community based training and that the first two years should be adequately documented so that young doctors have greater mobility and greater portability of their training. We will now progress this with state and territories to see if we can take up all these recommendations. The final thing the panel looked at was training selection into medical colleges. There is a great perception here that merit may not always be the only principle that is used in selection. A consultancy has been let to try to produce a series of model arrangements for selection and review of such decisions. We will use this when it arrives as a benchmark against which to judge Australian colleges. All in all, this whole process will result in more places being available for postgraduate training, new opportunities in rural areas, greater accountability in the selection process for medical colleges and a strengthening of family practice. I intend to table the report in both Houses next month. I thank John Loy and Bob Wells, who have chaired the committee. Small Business",25
95,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. The minister will be aware that both his predecessor and the Prime Minister repeatedly gave assurances to this House that the government would respond to the recommendations' of the fair trading inquiry report with respect to small business within three months of its tabling. As today is exactly three months since the report was tabled, will the minister outline to the House the government's response?",26
96,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to answer that question by saying that, when the report came down, I think the government said that we would aim to have a response within three months, which is at the end of this month. That is true. Mr Crean-Today.",26
97,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today, sure. Today is the 26th. Congratulations. Obviously, with a change in ministry, as an incoming minister, I intend to make it my business to ensure that I have spoken to absolutely everybodyMr Crean-When?",26
98,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me finish. I intend to ensure that I speak to absolutely everybody who is anybody with respect to the fair trading report and the issues that it has raised. I can inform the House that I have had a whirlwind of consultations in the few weeks that I have had the job. I have seen most people, and some I have seen twice. There are some I have not yet seen. I hope to see them this week or next. We are obviously having discussions also with our own backbench and others. Basically, as I said when I got the job, my aim is to have the response through cabinet and publicly announced by September. That is the timetable I am working to. Firearms Reforms",27
99,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney seen recent public comment from opponents to firearms reform speculating that large numbers of illegal firearms still exist in communities throughout Australia? Can the Attorney inform the House of evidence of the actual numbers of firearms in the community and of the effectiveness of the Australian firearms buyback campaign?,27
100,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCPherson for his question. Last year this parliament made a bipartisan commitment to firearms reforms, and that commitment was taken up by each state and territory. It was really a historic turning point for the country. The Australia-wide buyback campaign was introduced pursuant to that commitment and ceases on 30 September-in 35 days time. It is timely that we take this opportunity to thank all those Australians who have supported firearms reforms, particularly those firearms owners who have reacted responsibly and with common sense and decency to the new laws. Detailed research into the campaign has been commissioned. I think all members will welcome the results. A national study, conducted by Newspoll in June and July this year, tracked the views and behaviour of 2,400 people aged 18 years and over. It was found that the level of awareness of gun laws remains extremely high. It was found also that 78 per cent of Australians are in favour of the new firearms laws with 56 per cent being strongly in favour. The Newspoll research indicates that nine per cent of adult Australians, or approximately 1.2 million people, are currently gun owners. It indicates that Australians currently own 2.5 million firearms-that is approximately 2.1 per gun owner. The fact that as of today more than 500,000 firearms have been handed in under the buyback means that the campaign has been extremely successful. In the course of that buyback, more than $260 million has been paid to firearms owners. Newspoll made an estimate that 12 months ago 45 per cent of gun owners-that is gun owners at that time-were in possession of what will at the end of next month be an illegal firearm. Of these, Newspoll estimated that approximately three-quarters have now handed in or disposed of their illegal firearms due to the amnesty and are no longer in possession of an illegal gun, though many of these remain owners of legal guns. Overall, this research is good news for the Australian community. It is a particular credit to the vast majority of Australian gun owners who have complied with the new gun laws. Greece: Visit by Minister for Foreign Affairs",27
101,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it not a fact that your visit to Greece on 27 June was arranged with only seven days notice to our embassy in Athens? Following your decision to prematurely terminate his appointment, did not Ambassador Merillees write to you saying: I was never told, nor did I subsequently learn why your visit had to be arranged in such unnecessary haste. Minister, wasn't your decision to spend a day in Athens taken in the immediate aftermath of your question time performance in this chamber on 19 June? Didn't your decision to visit Athens only follow the last-minute cancellation of arrangements made at your request by , , the High Commission in London- I arrangements for you to spend the day in question disporting yourself at the Wimbledon tennis championships?",27
102,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the last point, I am not sure whether the House wants to go down that track again. I think the opposition was a little bruised on that count. As far as my visit to Athens is concerned, what happened was that the European Union, in particular the European Commission, and also the Council of Ministers were holding a meeting in Luxembourg-I do not remember the exact date, but it was on a Thursday. I went to sign the historic joint declaration between Australia and the European Union. It is one of the achievements of this government that that joint declaration was signed.",28
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They wanted us to roll over, didn't they?",28
104,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They did, indeed, Prime Minister. Without us conceding Australia's national interests, we took our national est forward. I had some time, as it turned out, because of the late arrangement of that signing ceremony-and that was due to a matter of putting into place the various detailsbetween that visit to Luxembourg and my arrival in Hong Kong. I decided that the best thing to do-and I think many members of this House, people like the member for Kooyong and the member for the Northern Territory and so on, would particularly appreciate this-would be to spend 24 hours in Athens, which I did. I had a very useful meeting while I was there with the President of Greece and with the Acting Foreign Minister. All I can say is that the visit to Greece was an illustration of this government ensuring that our relationships with Europe, as well as relationships within Our own region, are relationships that are taken forward. During my visit there, we agreed-and I actually thank you for this, because I think the House needs to know this-the Australian and Greek governments, to set up an Australia-Greece joint economic body, the details of which will be worked out, so that we can take the business relationship forward. Frankly, I thought it was a pretty good use of my time. You refer to the decision of the ambassador, Dr Merillees, to retire in January next year. It was a matter of mutual agreement between him and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Beyond that, privacy considerations come into play, and I am absolutely certain he would not thank you for trying to politicise him. HMAS Sydney",28
105,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to ongoing media reports which raise questions concerning the sinking of HMAS Sydney off the coast of Western Australia in November 1941. Will the minister inform the House of what action the government proposes to take in relation to these continuing reports?,28
106,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. There has, as members will inter- know, of recent times been considerable speculation about the matter, in both the media and this House-it has been debated here-and many members on both sides of the House have raised the matter with me. The three issues are really what happened, where she is and whether any evidence has been suppressed. As a result of some meetings that I had in Perth last year organised by the late Senator John Panizza, I sought some advice from the then Chief of Navy, Admiral Rod Taylor, and I received his assurance that all material related to the sinking of the Sydney had been examined, that a comprehensive list of known archival material had been published to assist independent research and that all archival material was available for public scrutiny. However, despite the absence of substantive new evidence there is strong public interest in the matter and in an inquiry. In addition, there is scepticism in some quarters of the official version of events and speculation is continually fuelled because of that scepticism. For this reason the government has decided to refer the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and I can inform the House today that I have written to the chairman of the committee requesting that the committee investigate and report the circumstances of the sinking of HMAS Sydney off the Western Australian coast on 19 November 1941. A departmental submission will be prepared and officials will be available to give evidence. Further, full access to Defence records will be provided to the committee, and for that matter anybody else who wants them, and my department will fund the provision of a military historian who is independent of the navy to support the work of the committee, should the committee require that to be done. It is an emotional issue. I hope that with this inquiry, which I understand will be the first public inquiry into the sinking, the matter can be put to rest. Greece: Visit by Minister for Foreign",28
107,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question is also addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, is it not the case that on your one day visit to Athens you were received not only by the President of Greece, Mr Constantinos Stephanopoulos, but also by Greece's Acting Foreign Minister? In addition, did you not dine with the Secretary General of the Greeks Abroad, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, the person responsible for all of the Greek diaspora? Why in prematurely terminating Ambassador Merillees's appointment have you allowed your reception in Athens to be portrayed as 'low level'? Minister, won't you now apologise for this disgraceful and untrue reflection on the official reception received in Greece?",29
108,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must admit it is not entirely clear to me what the honourable member is driving at here. It is rather curious. I just explained in answer to a previous question that I thought the visit to Greece was a useful visit. Since you ask a question about Dr Merillees, I will repeat what I said: Dr Merillees's decision to retire in January next year was a matter of mutual agreement between him and my department. The department is involved currently in a substantial program of restructuring and invitations have gone out to staff, particularly some of those at senior levels, to consider early retirement. I am advised that a number of departmental staff have decided to accept the offer of early retirement this financial year, of whom Dr Merillees is one. Beyond that, as I said before, privacy considerations come into play and I do not intend to comment any further on matters concerning individual public servants and what are more appropriately considered internal departmental staffing matters. War Criminals",29
109,Mrs JOHNSTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Will the Attorney-General advise the House what the government is doing about Konrad Kalejs in light of his deportation from Canada as a suspected war criminal? Affairs,29
110,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for the question. The government has a deep concern about the possibility of war criminals being in Australia and is committed to the proper investigation of any allegations of war crimes. I am sure those views are shared by all members of this House. The allegations against Mr Kalejs are extremely serious. He is an Australian citizen and is now in Australia after being deported from Canada. I am advised that his deportation is on the basis of certain findings about his conduct during the Second World War. In view of the serious allegations against Mr Kalejs and in view of his deportation last week, I directed my department to endeavour to obtain any material on which the Canadian authorities based their decision to deport him. I understand that, as a result, my department has been liaising with the AFP on this matter and the AFP has been in direct contact with Canadian authorities. Upon obtaining and examining all the available material, the AFP will make an assessment in consultation with other law enforcement agencies as to whether there is enough evidence to support a charge under Australian legislation. If the matter is referred to the DPP, the DPP will then, in accordance with published prosecution policy of the Commonwealth, consider whether to proceed with a prosecution. It needs to be understood that the standard of proof in the Canadian deportation proceedings was considerably lower than that which would apply in a criminal trial in Australia. Accordingly, the fact that the Canadian authorities found that Mr Kalejs should be deported is not conclusive of anything of relevance to possible criminal charges in Australia under the War Crimes Act.

NA Staffing Arrangements: Speaker's Office  that you have dispensed with the services of your senior adviser and that he has been replaced by Mr Hugh Logue, formerly an adviser to the Leader of the House? Does such a change in the staffing of your office constitute a significant derogation of the pendence of your office from the executive or is it merely the perception of the loss of independence? Will you provide the House with a full explanation of the termination of the services of your adviser and the hiring of the new adviser?",30

113,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I seek your guidance in relation to a matter which has arisen as a result of questions on notice which I put to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. At a Senate estimates committee meeting last week a senior public servant within the partment provided advice which directly and unequivocally contradicts the advice provided to me by the minister in his answer. In circumstances where advice provided by a minister in response to a question is shortly afterwards contradicted by advice from the minister's own department, what steps are available to me and, alternatively, to the minister to establish, first, what is the correct answer and, second, whether the minister's answers have misled the House?",30

NA Health Insurance Premiums: Increases",30
118,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government's private health insurance incentives as confirmed by MBF's proposal to further increase premiums and to charge members a compulsory $50 co-payment for private hospital treatment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",31
119,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In this House one year ago the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said this about his health insurance policy: Every bit of intelligence I can get, every bit of feedback from every one of my colleagues, everything I get from my own electorate and every other piece of information that I can possibly get my hands on tells me that what we are on here is an absolute winner. The minister for health, Dr Wooldridge, in relation to this government's health insurance policy, said, 'What we have here is an absolute winner.' According to this minister it is an absolute winner, when we have had more people leaving private health insurance in the last six months than in any other half year since 1991. According to this minister for health, he is on an absolute winner, when in the last quarter total health fund membership has fallen by 1,000 people a day. According to this minister, he is on to an absolute winner, when he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have approved increases by 30 health funds, increases which have already swallowed up most of the benefit of the tax rebate for ordinary families. The thing that has triggered today's debate is the articles that have appeared in today's papers. The front page of the Australian says, 'Funds flag fee rise, $50 bed levy.' The article by John Short and John Ellicott says: Health insurance giant MBF yesterday undermined the Government's $600 million health fund incentive scheme by flagging fee rises of per cent and a new $50 a night levy on private hospital stays. That is the Australian. The front page of the Daily Telegraph says, '$50 bed fee' - the introduction of the new compulsory fee for MBF members that dare to use private hospitals. What these proposals mean for the ordinary families and individuals that are members of MBF is that this fund is seeking to increase its premiums by $90 to $275 a year from 1 October. Remember that date, Mr Deputy Speaker; it will become very important to you later in this discussion. MBF intends to have these higher health fund premiums take effect on 1 October. This latest increase, proposed from I October, which is now before the minister is in addition to MBF's increase last February, which was an increase of up to 15 per cent, an increase of $200 for a couple or a family. The increase in February and the proposed increase in October mean that, for couples and families who are members of MBF, they will be paying more than $300 extra if this minister approves the latest MBF application. So you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are a retired couple living at Coffs Harbour in your electorate or living in Box Hill in the minister's electorate, if they are members of MBF they are going to be more than $300 a year worse off; and they will only be receiving a maximum of $250 from the tax rebate. So those couples are already worse off because of the fact that this government has approved premium increases that have totally swallowed up the benefit that has flowed from the tax rebate. I have to say we are getting some very strange signals from MBF-some very strange signals indeed. We had MBF's official spokesman saying just a few weeks ago that the government's policy had been such a success that MBF had been deluged by applications from new members. Let me quote from the Sydney Morning Herald of 2 July: MBF's public affairs manager, Mr David Jones, said that the fund had received a deluge of almost 6,000 calls in the past seven working days, 70 per cent of whom had been high income earners wanting to avoid the one per cent surcharge. up to 15 In the Age on Monday we had this: The nation's second biggest insurer, MBF, also had a record of people asking about private cover. The simple question we have for MBF is this: if they were deluged with so many applications from new members a few weeks ago, why have MBF now submitted an application to this minister for another dramatic increase in the premiums of that health fund? And why cannot the minister rule out today, at the dispatch box, any consideration of this increase if, as the minister claims and as MBF claim, they have had a dramatic increase in their number of members? The reason the minister will not rule it out today and the reason that MBF have submitted this application is that MBF act differently to what they say, especially around 1 July. While MBF say they have been deluged with applications for new memberships, they act as if things are getting worse. We would like to know from the minister whether things are getting worse. Are people continuing to leave private health insurance at the rate of a thousand a day? The minister knows. The minister is getting the regular updates. If he wanted to, he could pick up the phone this afternoon and ask MBF how many members they have today compared with 30 June, how many members they have today after they claimed that they had been deluged with applications from new members. It would be a very interesting test of this minister and that fund as to whether or not the claims they are making are true. Mr Jones said on 2 July that he had been deluged with applications from new members. He is quoted in today's Telegraph as saying this: Mr Jones said that rising health costs, ageing membership and the decision of young and healthy people to desert insurance were behind the premium rise. So a few weeks ago he was being deluged, and here we have a drought. What is actually happening? That is what we want to know from this Minister for Health and Family Services. It is not just the application for the increase in premiums that is causing concern. It is also the proposal, as outlined in today's Telegraph and the Australian, for a $50 bed fee. So it is not just the premium hike; it is also this new proposed $50 levy for the first five days in a private hospital. Let me tell the House that what is quite interesting about this new proposed bed taxthe John Howard proposed bed tax, if John Howard approves MBF's new bed levy-is that it is only going to apply to MBF's members in private hospitals. It will not apply to MBF's members who choose to be treated as private patients in public hospitals. While MBF will tell its members, 'You will pay a $50 a day penalty if you are in a private hospital,' what MBF will not tell its members is that MBF will be significantly better off if its members use public hospitals rather than private hospitals. In fact, MBF pockets about $200 a day because of the subsidy that applies for private patients in public hospitals. John Howard's new $50 bed tax on MBF's members in private hospitals is all about making a mockery of this minister's health policy and making a mockery of this government's claims that their tax rebate was going to take the pressure off public hospitals. They claimed that the tax rebate would reduce the cost of private health insurance, that that would increase the membership and that that would take the pressure off public hospitals. Yet MBF today are outlining a proposal that introduces a $50 penalty if its members use a private hospital rather than be treated as private patients in a public hospital. Minister, you have got to try to explain to us why you will not veto this today, why you will not pick up the phone and ring MBF today to disallow this attempt to make a mockery of your claims that private health insurance is all about taking pressure off public hospitals. To add insult to injury, we get MBF threatening the government, saying that they would have to increase their premiums by up to twice the proposed levels if the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services do not approve the $50 levy-the Prime Minister's $50 bed tax. So we will watch very carefully how the government seeks to deal with this issue, because it is quite clear that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services are going to be held accountable for any further increases. The reason we are going to hold them accountable is that the Prime Minister made an undertaking to the Australian people in Brisbane on 29 August last year. Let me quote from what the Prime Minister said in Brisbane last year: What I can tell you is absolutely likely and absolutely correct is that any increase from now on will have to be approved at a political level, and it will only be if we are completely satisfied that that increase is justified. That is what the Prime Minister was saying last August when he was giving us that commitment that there would be no further increases in health insurance premiums approved unless he was completely satisfied and they got the approval of the Prime Ministerall the way to the top. In fact, what has happened is that today we asked the Prime Minister to tell us whether he stands by the promise of 29 August last year. It is a simple question: will the Prime Minister stay in the loop? Will the Prime Minister still have the power to veto proposed increases in health fund premiums? What we got was a refusal to answer. He is unable to make a decision as to whether we need a national drug summit, he is unable to make decisions about industry policy or whether there should be changes in all sorts of other areas of government protection. Mr Crean-He gave an unequivocal guarantee.",31
120,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On this one, having given the unequivocal guarantee last August, he was unable to reaffirm it today. The reason he has been unable to reaffirm it today is that the man sitting at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, has made it clear that his view is that the Prime Minister is wrong and should be rolled, and the Prime Minister and he should be taken out of the loop in approving private health insurance increases. Why does the Minister for Health and Family Services want to get out of the loop? He knows that there is a further round of health fund premium increases coming. The reason there is another round of health fund premium increases coming is that this minister and his department have been writing to the health funds, lobbying them and making it clear that they should refrain from any further applications that take effect before 1 October-that crucial date I mentioned to you before, Mr Deputy Speaker. What is very clear is that in the months following 1 October there will be another tidal wave of increases in private health insurance premiums. That is why this minister has been desperate to extract himself from the approval process. This minister is desperate to try to ensure that he can absolve himself of any responsibility for future increases in private health insurance premiums. But the great tragedy of this is that this government has blown $1.7 billion on this failed health insurance initiative. That $1.7 bill.ion could have been spent directly on patIent care. It could have been used to keep 6,000 public hospital beds open for the next four years or to reduce hospital waiting lists and overcome the crisis in funding for our public hospitals. That $1.7 billion did not have to be money flushed down the drain, as Jeff Kennett described it. It could have been used directly on patient care. It could have been used to make a difference. The second part of the tragedy of this failed policy is that, to raise the $1.7 billion to provide the tax break, the government had to slash federal funding for public hospitals by $800 million, it had to abolish the Commonwealth dental health program-costing $400 million-thus leaving pensioners and low income earners unable to get emergency dental care and it increased the costs of essential medicines for low income earners and ordinary families as a result of the changes it made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There you have it. The government, in wasting the $1.7 billion on this failed private health insurance incentive was forced to reduce federal funding for a whole series of public health measures, to try to allow this minister to escape from blame. The minister's response to all these changes, when the PHIAC figures came out last week showing there had been a further massive reduction in the number of people with private health insurance, was to describe this result as being in line with expectations. There are 1,000 people a day leaving private health insurance, and this man says it is in line with expectations. Mr Fitzgibbon-Whose expectations?",34
121,Mr LEE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Hunter may well ask, 'Whose expectations?' A year ago in this House, the minister for health was saying that his policy was an absolute winner. Last week we had him saying that it was in line with expectations. It is quite clear that this policy has been a lemon. This is a policy that has cost the taxpayer $1.7 billion which could have been spent directly on patient care. It is a policy which has forced the government to slash federal funding to public hospitals. Yet this government is not prepared to face up to the facts, to be honest with the Australian public and to admit the policy has been a failure. What this minister described as an absolute winner is a policy which has resulted in the following things: a rise in health fund premiums and a fall in health fund membership, slashing of federal funding for public hospitals, abolition of the Commonwealth dental health program, a new $50 per night bed tax on MBF members in private hospitals-under consideration by this minister-and an increase in the cost of essential medication. If this is what you consider to be an absolute winner, we would hate to see you back an absolute loser.",34
122,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Chisholm-Minister for Health and Family Services) (3.41 p.m.)What an interesting little whinge from the opposition. I actually thought we might have some discussion on matters of policy, on matters of substance, but what we have had is a tirade of abuse against one health fundMBF-and no offer whatsoever of any alternative nor the vaguest inkling of an idea as what the Labor Party would do if they themselves had the capacity to be back in government. It is now fairly well known what the difficulties with private health insurance are. The first is that there has been a very dramatic shift over the last four years from people being treated as private patients in public hospitals to people being treated as private patients in private hospitals. That has increased costs to the funds. The second is there has been an adverse selection, in that the people staying in funds are getting older and sicker. The third is people are angered by out of pocket expenses and they are angered about not knowing them prior to going into operation. Fourthly, they get a large and unmanageable number of bills for hospital stays. If you have a look at why we are in the position we are in, it all comes back to conscious decisions made over a decade. The shift from treatment of private patients in public hospitals to treatment of private patients in private hospitals was a deliberate decision made by the previous government in 1993 when they signed the last Medicare agreement. That is the biggest single factor driving health fund premiums today-a policy decision of the previous Labor government. The issue of adverse selection-older, sicker people staying in health funds-is a deliberate result of health fund premiums going up 39 per cent more than they needed to because of deliberate policy decisions of the previous government. If you have a free public provision of service and you expect a private provision of service to survive alongside that, the latter will need government assistance. That is what happens in education-and has happened for nearly 40 years in this country. It is also what happens in health. Yet the previous government progressively abolished the federal contribution to the reinsurance scheme, cut the Medicare rebate for in-patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent and abolished the Commonwealth bed day subsidy. So not only were hospitals being treated less favourably but they were to adversely affected, because people got a lower Medicare rebate and the hospital funds were expected to make that up. That increase, which led to a 40 per cent increase in premiums in just two years-between 1986 and 1988-pushed a lot of fit young people out of the system and left a much older, sicker population in it. The third thing is the large number of outof-pocket expenses that people receive, or the so-called 'gap'. This was commented on time and time again by previous Labor health ministers. Dr Lawrence, when she mooted legislation in 1994 and introduced it in 1995, talked about eliminating the gap. That was a complete failure. Although it was never said at the time, my department now tells me that in 1995 the estimates were that in two years time we would have 20 per cent of Australian doctors in contracts with hospitals. As of today, we have about 80-not 80 per cent; 80 doctors. About one-tenth of one per cent of doctors have been prepared to go along with Dr Lawrence's reforms, and the out-of-pocket expenses remain. It was a complete, abject failure that we have been left to cope with. In terms of the large number of bills that people receive, the previous government had no idea whatsoever how to fix this. They thought it would happen by contracts, and contracts as they exist today have been a complete failure. These are the things we have inherited. These are the things we have had to try to come to grips with and these are the things that I admit are difficult to tum around. The fact is that we are attempting to tum them around, which is a lot more than any Labor health minister made any attempt to do over 13 years of office. I have yet to hear a single suggestion from the shadow minister for health-or anyone in the Labor Party-as to how they would do it differently. Mr Lee-Stop the bed tax.",35
123,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will come to that in a minute. The health funds are having a difficult time and they are, quite frankly, losing money. That is because of the factors that I outlined before. The shadow minister seems to think that I can pick up the phone and simply say, 'I know that after 10 years of Labor you were increasing premiums at an average of 12 per cent a year, but now, all of a sudden, stop.' It shows a complete lack of understanding of how the health system works. And the very thing that you are suggesting that I should do would send a fund broke. Mr Lee-Stop the bed tax.",36
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl}--The member for Dobell! I will acknowledge the interjection.,36
125,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It shows you are incapable of understanding the industry. The Labor Party is incapable of doing anything in the private health sector, as witnessed by 13 years in government. The rebates are an important part of trying to stem the flow from private health funds. Whatever the shadow minister may say about them, there is one simple fact: for the majority of Australian families, premiums today are $450 cheaper than they would be if you were in government. The fact is that $450 is what your average family gets; that is how much cheaper premiums are today compared with what they would have been under Labor. Again, the Labor Party does not really like the idea of helping the private health sector. This was said very plainly by the former health minister, Graham Richardson, who said, 'Frankly, the Labor Party is a bit biased against private health insurance.' You are going to have to say in this place what you are going to do with these rebates, because unless you are prepared to say you will continue them, we will let every aged person know. We will let the 25 per cent of pensioners who have private health insurance know that, under you, premiums will go up $250 overnight; and then they will go up even more because they will go up $450 for families. More families will drop out and the spiral will continue. You quote figures on the last six months, but you conveniently forget to quote figures on the last year. In the previous six months. the drop-out rate was the lowest for seven years. If you look at the whole of the 15 months since we came into government, the drop-out rate from the private health sector has been 1.9 per cent. That is more than I would have liked, but that is also before our incentives, before asking high income earners to pay more and before the advertising campaign came into effect. What was the drop-out rate for the previous 15 months under the Labor Party? Two and a half per cent! And the shadow minister seems to say that last quarter's drop-out figure was somehow a disaster at 0.6 per cent. Again, I admit that it is higher than I would like, but let me have a look at what happened in the 12 quarters under the previous government, starting from March 1993. How many quarters out of those 12 do you think we got a drop-out rate of 0.6 per cent or greater? In six out of 12 quarters the drop-out rate was the same or greater than what happened in the last quarter. In March 1993, the drop-out rate was 0.6 per cent; in September 1993, 0.6 per cent; in March 1994,0.8 per cent; in September 1994, 0.6 per cent; in March 1995, 0.7 per cent; in June 1995, 0.7 per cent. That is six out of 12 quarters. Mr Lee-We didn't want to waste $1.7 billion on it.",36
126,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You are absolutely right. You did not give the battling pensioners a cent. You did not give the battling families a cent,36
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dobell!,36
128,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The reason that they whatsoever. are struggling is simply because of your neglect. You cannot get away from that. The shadow minister seems to say, 'There is an alternative: just spend $1.7 billion public hospitals.' Let me say this first: very quick to call the rebates a failure. The fact is that the rebates started on 1 July. figures that he uses go up to 30 June. It purely illogical to suggest that something been a failure on the basis of figures that before the event starts. Mr Lee-When did the as start?",37
129,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The as started on 1 July 1997,37
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dobell has had his tum.,37
131,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The television as started on 1 July 1997 and the simple fact that you have been running around here, very excited, saying, 'It's a failure, it's a failure, it's a failure.' We will find that out over next six to nine months. What we will also find out is that you have a government that attempting to do something about it. Let us say we did put the $1.7 billion straight into public hospitals. It again shows a lack of any understanding of history. previous health minister, Dr Lawrence, said in December 1995 that the single the pressure on public hospitals was that a corresponding amount had been removed from hospital budgets by state governments. The then Minister for Finance-now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley)-in the election of 1996 wailed and moaned that state governments had pulled money out of the public hospital sector. And you suggest you will fix it by doing more of what failed to happen from 1993 to 19961 How stupid would it be to put $1.7 billion into public hospitals when the states have pulled out an equal amount? You would be deemed to be making exactly the same mistakes as in the past. And that is the problem that you have, because all you can attempt to see in a policy sense is repetition of mistakes of the past. You made this claim that $800 million has been taken out of the public sector. That is completely fallacious. There is no truth to that You arrive at the figure by taking 30 to 40 per cent of state general financial grants and then saying, 'That would have gone to hospitals so it is a cut.' What it on ignores is that in the last 12 months states he is have spent more on their hospitals. Rather than there being a cut, the states are spending The more on their hospitals. So your figures is simply have no basis in fact. This year the has Commonwealth is spending more in dollar stop terms than last year. So much for a cut. This year the states are spending more than last. So much for a cut. Mr Lee-It is not going to cut anything off cost shifting.",37
132,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Even after taking cost shifting into account, we are still spending more than we did last year. So this notion that somehow we have cut money out of is public hospitals is completely incorrect. The shadow minister says that attempting to the do something to help people who take out private health insurance is money down the is drain. The pensioners in my electorate do not think that premiums that are $250 cheaper today than they would have been if we had not introduced this is money down the drain. My families do not think that premiums being The $450 cheaper is money down the drain. The difficulty you have is that while you slip or reason for slide around this issue",37
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am not slipping or sliding. Perhaps you mean the member for Dobell.,37
134,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am sorry, Mr the Deputy Speaker, but the shadow minister certainly is. The opposition have a problem because they are going to have to say what they are going to do with these. If the opposition have not got the courage to actually say they are going to keep them, people will then know that, should the Labor Party be returned to government, they can expect premiums that are $250 up for a pensioner couple and $450 up for a family. We are looking forward to seeing how the opposition get out of that one. Looking at the whole issue of the private health sector, one of the difficulties we face is that it does require a degree of cooperation. It does require doctors, hospitals and funds to work together. This was something the previous government talked much about but was never able to achieve. I cannot promise that I am going to achieve it, but I can promise that I will try, which is already a substantial deal more than any previous minister has done for nearly 15 years. We are giving hospitals the incentives to talk to their medical staff and to try to come to reasonable arrangements that are in the interests of the public and the consumers. We are going to try to persuade them to have arrangements for simplified billing and for informed financial consent, which are two of the things that drive people mad about the private hospital system. In the end, it is my view that doctors and hospitals will work together and that they will work to do things that are in the interests of their patients. I cannot claim that every initiative here is necessarily going to tum things around. What I can claim is that we are making an attempt to do it. We are having a go. It is not made easier by the likes of MBF and what appears to be an announcement today trying to lock the government into a position. I am angry at that announcement and I am angry at the way it has been done. I can assure consumers that the government will be giving it very close scrutiny.",37
135,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler) (3.56 p.m.)I am pleased to support this matter of public importance put forward by the shadow minister, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee), today because my electorate office-and I am sure other offices of members around this House-has been inundated by calls this morning from people concerned about the news that we got on the front page of the Daily Telegraph about these increases. The news that MBF are to increase their premiums by five to 15 per cent and introduce a $50 a night levy-John Howard's new bed tax on hospital stays-shows clearly that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has no idea how to manage the health care system of this country. Furthermore, it highlights the greed of these private health funds, which the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have failed to act against. It shows that they are simply prepared to take more and more due to the government's inaction. Indeed, from this day on, people would argue that MBF stands for something new-More Bed Fees-because that is exactly what today's announcement is. The minister has shown, with his pathetic response today in which he failed to give any commitment to act, that he is simply not up to the task. Like the rest of his cabinet colleagues, the minister is clueless. The coalition spent 13 years on the opposition benches. They had 13 years to come up with a comprehensive strategy for health care, but they do not have one. The only strategy we have seen in the last 18 months has been totally ineffective. Basically the policy can be summed up as follows. Firstly, you take millions of dollars out of the public health budget. Secondly, you pour millions of dollars into a private health insurance incentive scheme. Thirdly, you watch and do nothing as these private health insurers continue to increase their premiums and effectively negate any benefit whatsoever from the tax rebate. This is hardly the sort of inspiring leadership which this country needs on the public health Issue. The Minister for Health and Family Services has presided over a lose-lose situation. Firstly, the cuts to the public health system mean that the public system has lost out badly since March 1996. Secondly, those people who have taken out private health insurance have become losers as well with these increases in private health insurance. This government has taken $800 million from the public hospital system. By way of contrast, Labor's 1993 budget pumped an extra $1.6 billion into the public hospital system. The government further restricted its services to the community by announcing the closure of 44 Medicare offices around the country, including two in my electorate-the only two which exist in Marrickville and Leichhardt. At the time the health department spokesperson was quoted as saying that the fact that most of these offices earmarked for closure were in Labor electorates was simply a coincidence. I think that sort of political decision making is an outrage. It is a decision that has met with a severe reaction from people across the country. Also in the last budget the government announced savings of $561 million over four years with the new drugs tax; it has saved $100 million by increasing the cost of PBS prescriptions to pensioners; it has announced further savings of $112 million over four years by removing a number of medicines from the PBS altogether; and it has saved $400 million by abolishing the Commonwealth dental program. The big losers here are the people who rely on the public health system, the most vulnerable people in our community-pensioners, the unemployed, families, and people suffering from chronic illnesses. In New South Wales alone, the Howard government has cut more than $134 million from health funding. On top of this is the $240 million cost burden borne by New South Wales public hospitals as a result in the number of people taking out private health insurance. The total cuts to New South Wales are $374 million. So if you want to know the difference in approach to health between that of Labor and the conservatives, have a look at what the federal government has done with regard to public health funding in New South Wales and compare that with what New South Wales Labor in government has done through Bob Carr and Andrew Refshauge. In New South Wales, in spite of these cuts, the state government have increased funding for the public health system by $805 million over three years. They have done that in spite of the cuts and the attacks by this uncaring government. The federal coalition government promised that they would provide incentives to people to take out private health cover. They have poured $1.7 billion into a scheme designed to do just that. But it is $1.7 billion wasted, when you look at the figures of the continuing drop-out from private health insurance. is $1.7 billion which could have been put the public health system. In fact, in August last year, as the minister has pointed out, the Prime Minister gave a personal guarantee that the government . would tighten supervision of future premium increases. Well, now is the time for action from this Prime Minister. This could be again another Clayton's promise: the promise you make when you are not really making a promise. Private health insurers have increased their rates over the last 12 months to such an extent that the increased premiums all but wipe out the government tax rebate. This latest application from the 'More Bed Fees' fund to increase its premiums would cost families up to $275 million a year. On top of this, MBF plans to introduce the $50 a night bed fee. It may well be that it becomes known as 'John Howard's bed tax'; or it may well be that, on behalf of this minister, it becomes known as 'Michael's Bed Fee'. This is consistent with the increases which we have seen with HCF also foreshadowing a further increase in its premiums. No doubt this is a trial. If this is successful and there is no government action, the other private health of the fall insurers will follow suit. It is very clear that the government's health insurance tax rebate is a resounding failure. care The number of people dropping out of private health funds continues. Private health insurance coverage has fallen to 31.9 per cent of the population; in May of this year, the figure was 32.5 per cent. More than 91,000 people have cancelled their fund membership in the last three months, according to today's Daily Telegraph-and this is despite the $4 million advertising campaign to encourage people to take out private health cover. I think probably it is unfair to say that the minister has lost the plot on this issue, because it is clear that he never had a plot to begin with. The fact of the matter is that this government has no commitment to the public health system in this country . We need to remember that, in 1982, two million Australians had no health cover at all. This was a result of this Prime Minister, when he was It Treasurer in 1976, presiding over the abolition into of Medibank and its provision of free health care for all Australians. In 1984 the same shadow person, John Howard, voted against the introduction of Medicare, which restored health cover for all Australians. In 1987, Mr Howard said",38
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Prime Minister said.,40
137,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And I quote: 'We will he proposing changes to Medicare which amount to its de facto dismantling.' I think it is very hard to swallow the Prime Minister's change of position on Medicare if you have a look at the savage cuts to public health funding which have occurred over the last two budgets. But then again this is not surprising when considering what we know about this Prime Minister. If you want to look at what he stands for, have a look at what he used to advocate. He advocated the abolition of Medibank. He hates Medicare and he said that h- would dismantle it. Just as we are seeing hIS true colours there, we are seeing his true colours on the GST. Just as he supports the GST, he still wants to dismantle the public health system. There is a consistency with this Prime Minister because he also said on 2 May 1995, with regard to the GST: No, there is no way that a GST will ever be part of our policy. When asked, he said, 'Never ever. It's dead. It was killed by the voters in the last election.' I believe that we are seeing the real agenda of this Prime Minister coming out. His real agenda is not only to introduce a GST but also about the dismantling of Medicare and the public health system. Now is the time for action. If the Prime Minister and the health minister continue to back scuttle around and refuse to take action against this MBF increase, then I think not only will people sheet home the blame to MBF, known from today as the 'More Bed Fees' organisation, they will also sheet the blame firmly through to the Prime Minister and the health minister. The people will know that thei.r agenda is the reactionary, ideologically dnvet;t agenda which they have always pursued (Tzme expired)",40
138,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bradfield) (4.06 p.m.)Neither the contribution from the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) nor certainly that from the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) gives us any insight at all into, nor do they make a co.ntribution - o an understanding of, why pnvate health msurance premiums are increasing and why MBF have found it necessary to announce what they have done today. The Productivity Commission report into private health insurance, on page 196, said: Average hospital insurance premiums increased by around 75 per cent from the years 1989-90 through to 1995-96. The consumer price index increased by .18.7 per .cent ov-r the same period leaving a real Increase In premIUms of around 46 per cent. There was a real increase in private health insurance premiums from 1990 to 1996. Who was in government at the time? No-one other than the member for Dobell and the previous Labor government. For 25 years the ideologues of the Australian Labor Party have consistently sought to undermine private health care either deliberately or through wilful neglect. In doing so, however, they have ignored the wishes and needs of their own traditional constituency: decent hard working blue-collar men and women and their families who recognise that our health care system has evolved from egalitarian principles and a strong health insurance ethic. In recent years, against all that is sane, Australia and I personally have been told by a succession of Labor Party health representatives that access and equity would in some way be threatened by financial support given by the government to the private health insurance sector. For example, in April 1992 Brian Howe, then the health minister in the previous government, said that private health insurance made 'an insignificant contribution to health financing', despite the fact that at the time it was raising $3 billion when the Medicare levy was raising only $2.5 billion. Similarly, the member for Jagajaga (Ms M.ac-lin), when overseeing what was euphemIstIcally known as the national health strategy in 1991, said at a meeting that I attended that she envisaged a role for private health insurance as providing little more than access to a private room, if that is what somebody wanted. They had such a dismissive and low regard for the very people they were purported to represent that they were not prepared to provide any kind of financial assistance at all, unlike this government. Yet the Christmas newspapers of 1995 reported the fact that the Whitlams, the Hawkes, the Keatings and other well credentialled blue-collar battlers were inpatients of a prestigious private hospital in Australia. I have no difficulty with that whatsoever. I encourage all Australians, including those on the other side, to be enthusiastic consumers of private health care. But the hypocrisy of the same people then going out to the community, as former Prime Minister Mr Keating did during the 1993 election-reported at the time to be worth something like $5 million-and saying to the rest of the community, 'You do not need private health insurance. Medicare is wonderful and the public system can look after you.' Rank hypocrisy! Private health insurance contributes about $4 billion a year and underwrites the treatment of about 30 per cent of in-patient hospital care in Australia. Amongst the 31.9 per cent of Australians retaining private health insurance are 800,000 people over the age of 65; 500,000 people earning less than $25,000 a year; and almost one million families earning less than $40,000 a year. At the time of the announced Productivity Commission inquiry into private health insurance, about one-quarter of the funds in Australia were below minimum reserves. Under Labor, annual premium increases averaged 12 per cent. In fact, in July 1993 the then Prices Surveillance Authority estimated that 26 per cent of the increase in the cost private health insurance since 1987 was due directly to the policies of the then Labor government. In other words, it was Labor Party government policy to increase private health insurance premiums by withdrawing all financial and political support from it. How did they do it? They withdrew contributions to the re-insurance pool between 1983 and 1988. In today's dollars, that is some $220 million taken out of private health insurance. They put expensive prostheses onto basic tables for health insurance. They abolished the private hospital bed day subsidy in October 1986, contributing, according to Access Economics, in today's dollars another $235 million impost on the low income Australians struggling to keep private health insurance. In 1987 they required the private health insurance funds to cover 25 per cent of the Medicare benefit schedule fee for in-patient services. That added another $216 million to the cost of private health insurance today. In fact, according to Access Economics, 39 per cent of today's private health insurance costs are due directly to the policies of the previous government. Those who have had the time to read the Productivity Commission report will see that they also agree that the cost of private health insurance today is at least 30 per cent higher than it would have been, due directly to the policies of the previous government. There are further cost pressures on the private health insurance funds. Over the last five years we have seen a transfer of privately insured patients from public hospitals to private hospitals. You will recall a lot of rhetoric from Labor governments and Labor representatives that we had to get these privately insured people out of public hospitals. Remember that? We were told that it was outrageous that people with private health insurance were being treated in public hospitals. Damn the fact that they had paid taxes, that they had paid a Medicare levy, that they had paid private health insurance-in other words, they had paid for the bed twice. When the Medicare agreements were locked in in late 1992 and in the first two months of of 1993 before the election, there was actually put into the system a penalty for state governments which had a high number of private beds. Today, a legacy from the previous government under those Medicare agreements, we as a government are still paying $160 million a year to state governments to reward them for reducing the number of public beds they are making available to privately insured patients. We have also seen funds marketing no gap products. If you are going to market a product for which there are no uninsurable gaps, it stands to reason that it is going to be more expensive-a fact that seems to be lost on the speakers on the other side. The third cost pressure on the funds is the ageing of Australia's population and with it the deteriorating risk profile of the funds, as, not surprisingly younger people who consider themselve- to be a lower risk have been leaving private health insurance. About 14.3 per cent of those privately insured are now over the age of 65, and they are drawing about $1.6 billion of the $4 billion that is paid annually by the funds in benefits. Those over-65-year-olds are being funded to the tune of three million hospital bed days each year. In 1992, 10.2 per cent of the fund members were over the age of 65. Today, as I say, it is 14.3 per cent. Those age group use hospital services at five times the rate of the rest of the population, and women over the age of 75, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, use hospital services 57 times more than girls at or below the age of 15. The average drawing rate-or the benefits that are being paid by private health insurance companies-for contributors over the age of 65 years is $1,551, which last year represented an 11.2 per cent increase. The Productivity Commission report estimated that, overall, ageing contributed to an eight per cent increase in premiums in real terms in the first five years of this decade. The commission further suggested that rising admissions partly reflected a change in fund composition towards older and sicker members as fund membership is declining. It suggested that it may have contributed to about a 17 per cent real increase in premiums in the first five years of this decade. Further cost pressures are the loss of lowclaiming members, the increasing sophistication of private hospital services and the case load that is undertaken by private hospitals. Five years ago it was unusual for private hospitals to have a high-tech intensive care unit. It was not common for them to have a department of emergency medicine or to be conducting quite sophisticated forms of cardiovascular and neuro surgery. The funds themselves also have failed to achieve management cost savings. I think MBF could be directing a bit of attention to itself there. Again, the commission estimated about a six per cent increase in premiums due to inefficiencies in the management of funds. Government initiatives-the rebate, the Medicare surcharge, aggregated billing, informed financial consent, increased waiting periods before people get benefits, innovative changes to default benefits and the possibility of unfunded lifetime community rating-are as much about support for the public system as they are about the private system. The more people who are leaving private health insurance to queue up for public hospital care, the less those people who are most in need of public hospital care are going to suffer from people in that longer queues. I get sick and tired of seeing ex prime ministers from the other side of the House jumping out of white limousines into private hospitals at Christmas time to consume services for which they have denied affordability to the rest of the country.

140,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the committee report on greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders entitled Torres Strait Islanders: a new deal, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",44
141,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It gives me great pleasure to table today the report by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on its inquiry into greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders. The inquiry was referred to the committee in August last year by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron. The minister asked the committee to examine whether the people of the Torres Strait would benefit from a greater degree of autonomy and, if so, what form that greater autonomy should take. The minister also asked the committee to examine the implications of granting a greater degree of autonomy to those Torres Strait Islanders living outside the Torres Strait region. Torres Strait Islanders, the traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait region, are a special and unique people. Their culture has developed from ancient traditions and beliefs based on their island culture and strong links with the ocean. Their traditional culture finds modem expression in Ailan Kastom, which tariff forms a common bond between Torres Strait Islanders living on the islands and on the mainland. Torres Strait Islanders have a sense of unity and strongly identify as a separate and distinct indigenous group. Not surprisingly, this has led Torres Strait Islanders to call for their own voice in indigenous affairs and greater control over the events which affect their everyday life. The committee believes that Torres Strait Islanders should be granted a greater degree of autonomy. By greater autonomy, the committee means a greater degree of self government and greater influence and control over policy and programs developed by Report Commonwealth, state and local governments for the region. Greater autonomy also refers to recognising and preserving the separateness of Torres Strait Islanders as a distinct culture. However, giving Torres Strait Islanders a greater degree of autonomy would not just be a political or cultural nicety. There are practical reasons why the people of the region should be urgently given a greater say in the decisions that affect them. For example, the committee has been appalled at some of the health problems facing Torres Strait Islanders. The region also relies on public sector expenditure and watches as the profits of the region's major private sector enterprisefishing-go out of the region. The people of the region need to be given the opportunity and the means to improve their situation. They should be given the chance to determine the region's priorities and ensure that services are culturally appropriate, efficient and effective. This will be done far more efficiently by Torres Strait Islanders themselves than by external agencies in Canberra and Brisbane imposing external solutions. The committee is sure that, with greater control over their own destiny and the day-today decisions that affect their lives, the people of the region will be able to tackle issues such as their poor health status far more effectively. The committee believes that one of the barriers to providing Torres Strait Islanders with a greater degree of autonomy is the excessive layers of bureaucracy. Aside from services provided in the region by mainstream Commonwealth and Queensland government agencies, there are 17 island local government councils, the Torres Shire Council, a state based indigenous specific organisation, a Commonwealth indigenous specific organisation and the involvement of ATSIC. These are all providing services to just 8,600 people. Many of these agencies have overlapping membership and overlapping functions, and some cross-fund each other. The sheer number of separate institutions diverts scarce funds away from service delivery and leads to a lack of clarity about which services are delivered by which agency. In response to these issues, the committee proposes a structure of governance and administration to deliver greater political autonomy for all of the people of the Torres Strait. The basis of the committee's recommendation is the establishment of a joint Commonwealth and Queensland body to represent, coordinate and administer programs to the region's residents. The report calls this body the Torres Strait Regional Assembly. The committee believes that the assembly should replace ATSIC, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, the Island Coordinating Council and the Torres Shire Council, and undertake at least their functions. While the committee believes that the regional assembly's form would need to be determined by the local people in consultation with the Queensland and Commonwealth governments, the committee has set out a recommendation for the representation of the new assembly. The committee proposes that the regional assembly consist of an elected representative from each island and a total of five representatives from the larger communities on Thursday, Prince of Wales and Hom islands. The regional assembly will represent Torres Strait Islanders, Aboriginals and also the 20 per cent of the region's residents who are non-indigenous. The committee believes that it is very important for all residents of the Torres region to be represented and not just the indigenous inhabitants. There can be no real autonomy unless it applies to all the residents of the region. In practice, however, the regional assembly is likely to be dominated by Torres Strait Islanders, as they represent such a large proportion of the regional population. The success of the regional assembly would depend to some extent on the funds made available to it. Funding to support services in the region currently comes from the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. Such funding should continue to be provided. Eventually, however, the regional assembly should receive untied grants from the Commonwealth and Queensland. The assembly should then decide how the money will be spent, although indigenous-specific funds would continue to be reserved for Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal purposes. True autonomy will not be a reality until the people of the region have a greater say over the funding priorities in the region and how these programs are administered. However, such arrangements will have to be negotiated with the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. One of the proposed functions of the regional assembly is the protection and promotion of the unique Torres Strait culture: the body of traditions, beliefs, art and practices which is Ailan Kastom. The committee suggests that the regional assembly establish a forum of elders from both the region and the mainland to be responsible for this very important function. The forum would act as a cultural council and a bridge between the islands and the Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. It would be up to the regional assembly to determine the council's duties and how it would carry them out. Nevertheless, the committee has made a recommendation setting out a possible methodology. I want to emphasise that many of the structural changes proposed in order to provide greater autonomy for the residents of the Torres Strait region are outside the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. A successful outcome will depend on the Queensland government's agreeing with the proposals. Strait Consultation and negotiation between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments, together with the people of the Torres Strait, are essential. I do not have time to detail a number of the committee's recommendations to increase the economic independence of the region, suffice to say that the committee thinks that it is very important for Torres Strait Islanders to become more involved in the fishing industry and better represented in public sector agencies. The committee heard calls for Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland to be represented in the regional model I have just outlined. However, because the committee has proposed a political model for greater autonomy in the region, the options for including mainlanders in this regional government are necessarily limited. Nonetheless, the committee has done its best to propose solutions to give mainlander Torres Strait Islanders greater autonomy. The committee is not satisfied that the current ATSIC arrangements for representing the interests of mainland Torres Strait Islanders are the best option for protecting and promoting Torres Strait Islander culture. The Torres Strait Islander population on the mainland is widely dispersed, particularly outside Queensland. It is therefore difficult Torres Strait Islanders to gain ATSIC funding for their own programs and have an effective input into ATSIC policies. The Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, as it is presently constituted, does not seem to provide an effective voice for mainlanders, particularly as it is only advisory. Some mainlanders feel that they do not get a fair share of ATSIC program funds, but this criticism is difficult to substantiate because the way funds are disbursed. The committee notes that ATSIC is attempting to deal with perceived problems and has commenced an evaluation of the level of access to ATSIC programs and services by Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. Despite difficulties with the current arrangements for Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland, the committee does not favour a separate commission for mainlanders. Such a solution would be inefficient and wasteful. In addition, many Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland also identify with Aboriginal ancestors. They do not wish to choose between their Torres Strait and Aboriginal heritages. Because of these factors, the committee recommends that the interests of Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland continue to be protected by ATSIC. It suggests ways this can be done more effectively, by promoting greater awareness of Torres Strait Islander issues by ATSIC regional councils and by strengthening the TSIAB. While the report focuses on greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders and the structures for facilitating this, it must not be forgotten that community control will be enhanced by improving access to mainstream services. This issue is particularly pertinent for mainlander Torres Strait Islander communities. The committee recommends a strategy for encouraging them to take up issues directly with those making decisions and implementing them. It remains for me in the time left to thank the people who have helped us conduct this inquiry. I thank all of the many Torres Strait Islanders in the region and on the mainland for who were so generous with their time in helping members of the committee understand what it is to be a Torres Strait Islander. I would also like to thank the representatives of the Queensland government who gave evidence to the committee. Their spirit of cooperation with the Commonwealth augurs well for the future of the Torres Strait. I would also like to thank my colleagues on the committee from both sides of politics-and of especially the local member, Warren Entsch, whose knowledge and leadership was of great help to me personally in this matter-for their contributions to the inquiry and the report. On behalf of the committee I would like to thank Hansard and SAVO staff for their work during the hearings and visits. Thanks also to the RAAF crews who flew us to the Torres Strait and had to use short landing strips. Last, my thanks go to the members of the secretariat for their support-particularly to James Catchpole, the inquiry secretary; Judy Middlebrook, the committee secretary; Claressa Surtees; Natalie James; and Jan Wootton. In conclusion, I commend this report to the House. The issue it addresses-greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders-is very significant. We hope that our suggestions will encourage other indigenous communities on the mainland to also develop strategies to increase their own autonomy and self-reliance. The goal is to give people greater control over and responsibility for the events that affect them so that they can enrich their lives. That, we believe, is no bad thing for all Australians.",44
142,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I commend the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to the House as a framework for progressing greater autonomy for Torres Strait Islanders. I recognise also that some of the recommendations that the committee has made will be contentious and will disappoint some people in the region. There are some 8,570 people living in the Torres Strait region and there are also 23,000 Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland. The thing that I want to stress at this stage is that it is not practical for Torres Strait ers living on the mainland to have a separate national organisation. It would duplicate ATSIC's structure and be administratively too expensive to run. ATSIC has also recognised the criticisms by Torres Strait Islanders and is reviewing the way in which it represents them. The committee has made recommendations to strengthen the Torres Strait Island Advisory Board's powers at the national level. The committee has also made practical recommendations at the regional council level where most grants are decided. I think both sides of the House agree with the principle of greater autonomy for people in the Torres Strait region. It is a question of how it can be properly achieved. What worries me is that some people's expectations have been unnecessarily raised. They will be disappointed. That is why, from an opposition's point of view, I signal that this report does not bind the opposition in terms of its response when the government does bring down a response to this report. Certainly, I think there are many things here that can and will be picked up readily by the government, but I see this report as a framework. Those of us on the opposition who have participated-some of us have not been to all of the hearings or all of the deliberations--do want to cooperate in this matter to give autonomy. But what the opposition will not do-I can say that at this time-is allow this to be used as a stalking horse to undermine, dismantle or disaggregate ATSIC. There needs to be a recognition that the Torres Strait community is a unique community. I think that they have genuine aspirations and I believe that those aspirations can be met. I do not doubt the sincerity of the committee and the chair but I do doubt the sincerity and commitment of the government. Up until now, their rhetoric is not matched by what is happening on the ground. That is the only caution I bring into the proceedings. Apart from that, I commend the report as being an excellent framework for progressing greater autonomy for the region.",47
143,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"by leave-In the small amount of time remaining to me, I want to commend the work that has been done by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The Torres Strait Islands and Torres Strait Islanders have a unique culture and a unique history. They were defending their islands against all comers before the mainland of Australia was even settled. There was a strong demand for statehood but, given the constitutional complications involved in that, I think the committee managed to indicate that autonomy at this stage was the only appropriate step. I commend the work that has been done by the committee. I particularly refer to those sections which deal with the training and the opening up of management and senior positions for Torres Strait Islanders. It is absurd that the Commonwealth spends time and funds taking bureaucrats from various parts of Australia to do work which Islanders themselves could do. Theirs is a unique culture. I believe the report has gone a long way to achieving their hopes and their ambitions. I commend the work done by the chairman and his liaison with the Queensland government. Hopefully, that will produce a level of cooperation which will enable the very important recommendations in this report to be implemented. I commend it to the government and to the House.",47
144,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks when the debate is resumed. Leave granted; debate adjourned. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time.",48
145,Mr GARETH EVANS,COMMITTEES,"The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 provides some $16.8 billion in funding to the states, so it is no mean bill in terms of the quantity of the dollars that is appropriated by it. The quality and, in some cases, even the actual existence of state and territory government services such as health, education, law and order and public transport rely very heavily on the grants appropriated by this bill. It is a bill which is quite critical to the smooth functioning of the federation. But it is essentially a non-controversial measure, and the opposition will support its passage through the parliament. That said, I do seek some assurances from the government in relation to one part of the bill before us-that is, the very substantial package of amendments which have just been circulated this afternoon, the purpose of which is to clean up the Commonwealth-state taxing system in the aftermath of the recent High Court decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases. The response to that decision, which signalled a death blow for state business franchise fees on alcohol, tobacco and certain petroleum products, was for the states and territories to request that the Commonwealth helps them through this problem by increasing two existing tax bases-wholesale sales tax and excise-to enable the states to replace the revenue collected. These requests were duly made and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced on 6 August increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.1 cents per litre, increases in customs and excise duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram and increases in wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent. The Treasurer has also announced the intention to impose a windfall gains tax to protect against refund claims in relation to business franchise fees paid but now declared illegal as a result of the High Court decision. The amendments we have before us represent only one small part of a very substantial package of amending legislation necessary to implement the rescue scheme. As well as collecting the revenue on behalf of the other governments to make up for the shortfall, the Commonwealth has to ensure that the disbursement of these funds is equitable so that consumers and governments do not lose out. This is the aspect of the matter that the opposition could not help but be critical of, as have many others in the cOlllmunity including the businesses most affected. What has happened is that, notwithstanding the imminence of the High Court decision, the known date of its being brought down and the likelihood of that finding actually being made-certainly the possibility of it being made must have been in the contemplation of all those concerned-there does not appear to have been proper planning for that contingency. The shambles that we saw as people scrambled to try to sort out a transitional system to enable the distribution of Commonwealth revenue to proceed on a basis that would restore the state collection system to the status quo previously existing has been all too apparent. A similar state of affairs was anticipated by the Labor government back in 1993 when an earlier case was heard by the High Court and a fully thought through and agreed plan was, as I understand it, pretty well on the stocks at that stage. Building on that base, one might have expected a better job to have been done by all concerned in calming the situation down, particularly in the liquor and tobacco industries where nobody seemed to know what was going on. I think the Commonwealth Treasurer has to bear a large measure of the responsibility for not being prepared, effectively, in cooperation with his state colleagues, to put the matter to bed. He should not just announce the outline terms of the rescue operation involving Commonwealth legislation but also be in a position to announce the detailed transitional arrangements to ensure that equity and good sense prevail. Having said all that, the opposition, being as fiscally responsible as we are, have not sought to dwell on this issue nor to cause any parliamentary difficulties with the passage of this legislation. I indicate that our disposition is to support these amendments, which were circulated this afternoon, as well as the rest the bill. What I do, however, is seek an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) about a number of matters which we foreshadowed in my initial public statement on 5 August, the day of the High Court tax decision. I said then that the opposition wanted to make it clear in principle that we would facilitate the passage of any revenue package which satisfied four conditions: firstly, that it has the agreement states and territories; secondly, that it fairly distributes the revenue to the states and territories; thirdly, that it does not involve extra taxes being imposed on Australians; and, fourthly, that it is equitable on the businesses immediately affected. I would welcome assurances from the minister or, failing that, as usual, his mentary secretary on these matters. It does appear that we have an outline anyway-with the agreement of the states and territories. Presumably, the distribution mechanism contained in these amendments also has the agreement of the states. For that reason, it can, at least prima facie, be assumed to be a reasonably fair distribution. It is, however, the case that the states can find themselves in difficulties on these matters-and I will come back to this issue in another context later on. I would certainly appreciate an assurance that the various petroleum, tobacco and alcohol shares between the states, which are contained within the amendments now before us, have been agreed to by all the affected jurisdictions. I would also appreciate information as to whether it is proposed that the revenue shares used in the calculation of the revenue replacement payments are to remain constant or whether the intention is that those shares will be altered. If so, what is the basis on which that will occur? The other matter on which we particularly seek assurance-although I appreciate this is more a matter for internal distribution within the states rather than a matter of distribution of the proceeds of these increases going back to the states themselves-is the question about the equity of the impact of these proviof sions and planned processes on the businesses immediately affected. There has certainly been an intense amount of anguish between the different tobacco producing countries over the way in which, rather arbitrarily, the new basis for calculation of the taxation impost will have a differential impact between the three major producers. This decision is not based on any consideration other than a purely fortuitous new application of the legislation to products that of are different by reason of the amount of tobacco in them, and so on. Commercial decisions made in the past, on the face of it, ought not to bear fiscal consequences as a result of the new arrangements that are being in its impact put in place. I do not stop now to go into any detail on that particular issue or controversy, but it parlia- would be helpful in determining the opposition's final response to this if the government were to tell us precisely what the state of play is on this particular business equity issue and indicate what, if anything, the Commonwealth proposes to do to ensure that in the internal state distribution of these revenues that principle of equity is maintained. That is as much as I want to say about the specific detail of the bills before us or the very detailed amendments that we are looking at simultaneously, but I do want to take this opportunity to comment on two broader themes which are directly relevant to the bill. One is the really quite deceitful and disgraceful way that the Commonwealth has managed its relations with the states since this government came to office. Secondly, I want to say something about the whole issue of vertical fiscal imbalance and explore whether it is as big a problem for the country as is often alleged and to look at what can and should be done about it. The issue of vertical fiscal imbalance is squarely raised by this bill because the moneys appropriated in it do represent a very large proportion of the so called vertical fiscal imbalance phenomenon. Beginning with this government's management of its relations with the states, the bill proposes to implement the general revenue assistance measures agreed to, to use the English language in a slightly extended way, at the 1997 Premiers Conference. General revenue grants are of course the untied funds provided by the Commonwealth for the general use of state and territory governments according to their own priorities. These untied funds are provided for two purposes: essentially, first, to compensate for what was a takeover by the Commonwealth of the income tax base during WorId War II and, secondly, to fulfil the horizontal fiscal equalisation obligations of the Commonwealth-that is to say, to grant particular states and territories the additional revenue they need to be able to provide an average level of services without resorting to an above average revenue effort. Honourable members would be I guess well aware that when push comes to shove it is the Commonwealth position which is invariably 'agreed' to at premiers conferences. The 1997 Premiers Conference was certainly no exception in this respect. In fact, it was even a little more grotesque than the normal run of these premiers conferences. The agreement, so called, reached at the 1997 conference did involve a reaffirmation of the funding formula that had been introduced by Labor; namely, that of real per capita indexation of the financial assistance grants pool of previous years. But the sting in the tail for the states and the territories was that they agreed-that is, were forced-to make so-called 'fiscal contributions' to the Commonwealth in 199798 of around $627 million, building on an estimated $609 million contributed the previous year, 1996-97-that is to say, they are to have their funding cut relative to the real per capita arrangement originally struck by Labor. In order to appease to some extent the states and the territories, the method of calculation of the fiscal contribution will not reduce the base by which future years grants are to be deterrnined-only the allocation over the three years of the agreement. Notwithstanding this 'fiscal contribution' for 1997-98 and that proposed for the next year, 1998-99, the Commonwealth has gone on to purport to extend the real per capita funding guarantee until 1999-2000. But there is a sting in this tail too because, given the reneging by the Howard government on its pre-election commitment to not cut grants to the states, which commitment has been massively breached as I have already described, the states are understandably very nervous indeed about the likelihood of actually receiving the amounts which have now been set out in the forward estimates. The impact of the so-called fiscal contribution embodied within this bill has already been felt by people reliant on services provided by state and territory governments. New South Wales had to increase taxes last year to make up for the impacts of the cuts. The legislation that was passed by the New South Wales parliament to achieve that was appropriately entitled by the New South Wales parliament the HAC-Howard and Costello-tax amendment act. Victoria did not increase taxes, but it did have to defer tax cuts that had been widely expected, so Victorians are still paying the highest state taxes of all. This $1.5 billion worth of contributions has had already a real negative impact on Australian families through either increased taxes or reduced services, or both. It really was an example, as we have seen so often, of the Commonwealth forcing the states to do its dirty work. The premiers and the chief ministers, understandably enough, objected to being ambushed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister at the 1996 Premiers Conference when their fiscal contribution was 'agreed' to-in other words, with their arms rammed firmly up their backs. That led to the interesting situation where the essentially conservative premiers actually told the world at large, in words of often not much more than one syllable, what they thought of the Treasurer. I think what has become known as 'dog day afternoon' will be remembered for a very long time as a result. No agreement, it will be recalled, was possible on the first day. There was a real prospect of the whole Premiers Conference having to be abandoned. The final meeting to resolve the impasse was in fact conducted without the Treasurer being present. The Prime Minister had to do it himself as the state and territory leaders made it clear they just could not work with the Treasurer personally. The amount of time devoted to the Premiers Conference meant that the subsequent COAG meeting was an absolute failure as well. Nothing of substance was resolved, and the Council of Australian Governments process has been in a state of leaderless drift ever since. The 1997 Premiers Conference involved slightly less open warfare than the one the previous year. However, there was still real contention over the size of still more cutscuts of some 1.3 per cent, amounting to around $139 million-imposed by the Commonwealth on the states, this time to specific purpose payments to be paid in 199798. We had the incredible situation where this time the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were again at odds by giving conflicting advice about the size of the aggregate cuts in specific purpose payments. The Prime Minister said one thing and the Treasurer said something else. The coordination was abominable. The impression given to the states of competent government was of anything but that. There was genuine anger from the premiers and chief ministers at this further show of bad faith. It is worth mentioning that, I think very much as a consequence of these very unhappy exercises in 1996 and 1997, it has had a larger effect on the whole course of Commonwealth-state relations. Maybe indeed it has had something to do with the lack of coordination and the general mess that seems to have been involved in coping with the High Court's decision in the business franchise fee matter that we have already talked about. What has happened is that the Commonwealth-state non-financial agenda has basically ground to a halt. Remember the grand plans of the new government to fundamentally overhaul the delivery of housing services? Remember the statements and announcements about plans to overhaul health services and education services? The results in all these areas have just been non-existent. COAG has not met since 14 June 1996. The next meeting is apparently scheduled for October this year, but we wait with bated breath to see whether anything of substance will come from it. For a government that purported to be far more sensitive to the position of the states and territories, for a government which claims to be part of an ideological tradition of much greater sympathy to federalism and states' rights than has been traditionally associated with the Labor Party, it really has been a pretty disgraceful performance. The state governments have made no secret of expressing their preference for dealing with this government's predecessor rather than their so called ideological soul mate. Therein I think is a very important message for this particular government and a very important message for the community about the quality of this government. The other general theme about which I want to say something is the issue of vertical fiscal imbalance, which as I indicated earlier is squarely raised by this particular piece of legislation, as indeed many others. It is true that Australia has a relatively high degree of vertical fiscal imbalance compared with other federations in the sense that the states in our federal system do raise, themselves, a lesser percentage of what they spend than by and large is the case in other federations. There are essentially two reasons for this imbalance. One is constitutional. It is the case that the constitution reserves most taxing powernearly all of it, in fact-in relation to goods to the Commonwealth. So that power is not available to the states, and that of course was the matter that was confirmed very robustly by the High Court in the recent business franchise fees cases. The constitution has also been significant in the past, with the defence power in wartime being the vehicle through which the Commonwealth in fact acquired the capacity to in effect exclusively exercise income taxing powers. That is no longer the constitutional case in a non-wartime situation; but nonetheless the states, for all their complaints, have not been quick to rush to embrace opportunities to impose income tax themselves. There are no other constitutional on the state revenue raising powers. So the second constraint that has in fact operated over the years has really been straightforwardly political. The states and territories have deliberately allowed a number of aspects of their tax bases to erode by not being willing to take the political flak and endure the community hostility from continuing particular forms of tax or adding certain new taxes. I cannot call in aid constitutional reasons for that. It really is a straightforward political judgment. It may well be a political judgment with which one can sympathise, but nonetheless it is a political rather than a technical problem. Much of the present vertical fiscal imbalance which exists is a product not of any technical incapacity for the states to raise revenue through income taxes or payroll tax increases or through property and inheritance taxes or through services taxes but of an understandable political unwillingness to go down that particular path. It is a point I have been making all week. It has been much misrepresented by the government; but they know perfectly well what I have said, because it has been very clear on the record. It is not a matter of me making any pronouncements about what the states should do; I have simply been stating what they can do and explaining that the recent High Court case has not fundamentally changed that balance in any really significant way. The question I want to address now is how bad a deal for the nation as a whole is this imbalance that has emerged and been so obviously consolidated over the years. To what extent is this imbalance necessarily a bad thing? I say at the outset that I and the Labor opposition have a genuinely open mind at this stage on the whole subject of Commonwealth-state financial relations. As I said on the Sunday program on the 17th of this month, we should have an open mind about looking at ways in which the revenue capacity of the states can be enhanced and the rational distribution of taxes can be perhaps better guaranteed to the states. We do have such an open mind and certainly in the whole unfolding tax debate we are very willing participants in any discussion about these limitations particular issues. But, that said, there are some arguments that can and should be put in the balance which do run against some of the received popular wisdom on the vertical fiscal imbalance question. I will take the remaining few minutes to spell them out. In the first place, it should be remembered and accepted that some level of vertical fiscal imbalance is in fact necessary and desirable, and that relates back to the question of equalisation. The Commonwealth provides an equalisation component in financial assistance grants to the states and territories just as part of the normal functioning of government. Those equalisation grants, as I mentioned in passing a few minutes ago, do ensure that all state and territory governments have enough resources to provide a general level of services to their residents without having, in some cases, to impose quite disproportionate levels of taxation. If there was not such an equalisation component, grants would be distributed on a per capita basis and that would severely disadvantage the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania and also detrimentally affect Queensland. The Parliamentary Library has estimated that around $2.6 billion is the rough figure for the equalisation component in the grants in the bills before us now for this 1997-98 financial year. Without that degree of starting imbalance, without that degree of flexibility, some states in our federation would have a very rough time indeed. The second point I would make is that it should not be assumed that less vertical fiscal imbalance would be more cost effective for the nation. The main argument for the removal of the present degree of vertical fiscal imbalance is a general contention that it is better for sovereign governments to raise their own revenue as this leads to greater accountability between each government and its electors. Most people would not even stop to dispute such a motherhood sounding statement, but the real issue that has to be addressed in this debate is what is the actual cost of a state or territory being significantly reliant on financing from the central government. When you think about it, it does become apparent that the actual cost is likely to be either negligible or possibly even negative. Why do I say that? Assuming that the states would still have the same revenue needs, there are really only two options of raising the revenue that is currently collected by the Commonwealth: either using the same revenue base that the Commonwealth uses or using a different base. If we assume, first of all, very generously, that the Commonwealth simply forgoes part of its revenue base and that the states enter that same base, using the same one, it is unlikely that they will be able to match the efficiency of collection which a single entity, the Commonwealth, currently achieves. Certainly it would be no more efficiently collected by mUltiple state revenue agencies than by the single Commonwealth entity. It just beggars the imagination to believe that that could be the case. Alternatively, if a new form of revenue is to be tapped by the states, the collection and compliance costs will almost certainly be higher than from the forgone Commonwealth revenue base. More importantly, the economic effects of the new state tax, because of their more limited choice of tax bases, it being open ended basically what the Commonwealth can do, will probably be much more adverse than the Commonwealth revenue source that it replaces. So I am simply making the point that, measured in terms of costs of collection, costs of compliance and the economic efficiency losses associated with some state tax bases, it may be that the vertical fiscal imbalance is actually in some respects beneficial to the nation--<:ertainly not the huge bogy that the states and territories always want to make it. The recent assumption, which we talked about earlier, of the collection of state and territory franchise fees now effectively by the Commonwealth does provide an example of where there may actually be national collection efficiencies derived through the use of the Commonwealth as a central collection point, even though, as I have also pointed out, there are obvious complications involved now in the calculation of the division of moneys back to the states and territories, in particular the equity problem as between the businesses concerned. We may get some interesting data on all of this in the fullness of time when the permanent Commonwealth measures are operating. Certainly it will be interesting to compare the comparative costs involved. The third and remaining point that I wanted to make is that under current arrangements the major fiscal risks are in fact borne by the Commonwealth. Commonwealth revenue is more cyclical than state revenue; it does wax and wane according to economic circumstances. In a major economic downturn, the result is that the states are far better off under the current arrangements than under any more explicit, or more genuine, if you like, revenue sharing arrangement. In effect, the Commonwealth acts as the underwriter for the states and the territories when the cycle turns downwards. One thing the states will need to contemplate long and hard is whether they want the Commonwealth to abandon that particular role and the states as a result to be much more exposed. I repeat that, as the Leader of the Opposition and I have stated on several occasions, we are perfectly happy to have all these issues considered and debated in the general context of tax reform. Ongoing tax reform is something that every government should engage in and every opposition should be prepared to debate, and that is true on both counts for us. But whatever else that debate should be about, there should not be any question of its being an excuse for the introduction of a GST. The whole question of Commonwealthstate relations and vertical imbalance between the Commonwealth and states in their revenue raising capacity has absolutely nothing to do with a GST. Any suggestion that recent events in the High Court and so on operate as some kind of rationale for the introduction of a GST is a total misrepresentation. Indeed, I think one can make the point, ironically, that if a GST were to be introduced as a replacement for some or all of the states' indirect bases, then by definition the level of vertical fiscal imbalance in Australia would massively increase. Let me finally say this: the real issue for the states and territories has always been the future certainty of their revenue sources, not so much how the revenues are formally raised. That is why we in the Labor government entered into three-year financial assistance grants agreements with the states from the June 1990 Premiers Conference where the value of the financial assistance grants pool was maintained in real terms for the agreed three years. At the 1994 Premiers Conference we extended that promise, increasing the FAGs not only by inflation but also by the increase in population. It was made on a three-year rolling basis. We have honoured all the agreements we made at those earlier Premiers Conferences. This government pretended prior to the election that it would honour the existing Commonwealth commitments, but it has reneged on them in the way I have described. At least $1'h billion has been ripped off the states and territories, which means that those most dependent on state services have been hurt. I conclude by saying that, while Labor is constantly decried as being too centralist, we have actually delivered far more to the states than the supposedly more sensitive federalist governments. One of the many reasons that this government deserves condemnation, quite apart from its performance on the economy and jobs, is its performance in relation to the states. (Time expired)",48
146,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEES,"I am happy to rise on this particular bill, the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997, and the amendment associated with that. I did take some notes on the previous speaker's address and I was interested to note that he likes movie titles. He raised one called Dog Day Afternoon. I think it would be generally agreed by those listening to that particular speech that his own speech would deserve a movie title as well once it hits the Hansard, and that would be Pulp Fiction. Most people would probably tax tum that speech in Hansard into pulp. All the Labor Party ever talks about is tax, tax, tax, because that is all they have ever really been interested in. But if there is ever a moment in history when the whole question of tax should in fact be discussed and debated it is right now, at this time in our history. If ever there is a need to discuss tax reform in the country, this is it. If ever there is a need for a national interest debate on the tax system in Australia, this is it. We are at the moment in history when we can consider the entire federation and the implications this federation has with regard to revenue raising. Right now we as a nation have a unique opportunity to debate the issues of revenue, a unique opportunity of showing leadership for the next hundred years for those generations to follow us, a unique opportunity to provide debate in the national interest and a unique opportunity to provide a bipartisan approach to an issue which the entire community is increasingly interested in. Yet it seems only one political party-or one group of parties-is providing leadership in this important debate and providing leadership towards the 21st century, while others try to hold onto the past. The party that is leading at the moment is the coalition, whereas the party that is trying to hang onto the past-the 1990 debate from which we have moved on seven years-is the Labor Party. They are hanging onto the old advertising slogans of that time. Tax reform is a must for the 21st century for Australia, and the Howard government is providing leadership in that area as we go into the 21 st century. While the Labor Party sits twiddling its thumbs with its hands behind its head, the coalition government is providing the much needed strength of leadership required for this vital reform. The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill before us today continues the need for debate but provides certainty for the states while the tax reform debate gains more momentum. Out of the many factors in this bill, I will talk today primarily about the imbalance in the state-federal grants system that has occurred through the reduction over the years in the general purpose grants, combined with the states' and territories' obligations to make fiscal contributions. In normal terms, the Treasurer is increasing grants, which is contrary to what the Labor Party did in its years in office. And what a mess the Labor Party left this country in when they left office just 18 months ago. Everyone continues to pay at great length for their ineptitude. The Howard government is now l8-odd months into office; we have two responsible, good budgets under our belts but our clean-up job is far from over. The necessary trimming of the economy we were left with goes on. It was an economy riddled with debt, an economy for mates rather than for all of us, where some in our community were favoured ahead of others. It was an economy which was in increasing debt and which had been operated with no responsibility at all. Remedies are needed to redirect that sort of economy, but some of them bite hard from time to time. However, the long-term vision of a healthy, bouncing, happy economy and nation does make the hard work of trying to tum this around worthwhile-and it is only possible under a coalition government. There is much more to do-and many more reforms to make and debts to pay-after 13 years of avarice. The Howard government is focused on these needs and will not relent in striving towards our financial goals. Those goals include tax reform-and that includes addressing states grants funding. There is much to do, and we, the coalition, are getting on with the job, while Labor tends to block our initiatives in these areas. The general purpose grants provide financial assistance to states and territories to them provide services for the community. The current structure of the general grants system suggests a reappraisal of how governments might collect their revenue. The pool of money available through the grants to the states and territories gradually decreased each year during the hard years of the Labor government. The 1997 Premiers Conference decided the states and territories would make fiscal contribution payments of approximately $626 million in 1997-98-and this takes into account the deferral of half the scheduled 1997-98 fiscal contributions of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, in recognition of their difficult economic circumstances. The state governments continue to be financially reliant on the federal government, with one-third of their funds coming from Commonwealth sources-more so since the recent High Court decisions, which we have addressed in these amendments. The strength of our great country is the federation of its states and the will of its people. However, the national interest on issues of importance should always override state interests. However, the fact that states rely on the Commonwealth government for their funds when they could take over control of raising revenue themselves seems to me to be quite restrictive. A less centralised approach to government spending could ensure that each state could foster a more efficient approach to funding their services and their infrastructure needs. If the states and territories were able to take responsibility for more of their income, they would not have to rely on the health of the national economy to determine how they would fare each time federal budget time rolled around. It is true that, in order to recover from the ravages wrought on the economy over the last decade by the Labor government, the wild degree of spending needed to be cut. Mr Beazley's black hole needed filling, and everyone in the community needed to help by contributing to the solution-getting rid of that debt. That resulted in a reduction in the growth of grants available. In tum, the aid of states and territories in reducing the federal help deficit has been a much needed and appreciated measure. The chemotherapy necessary to restore the economy does tend to make all concerned feel a bit sick. However, the Howard government's fiscal strategy is working. Reducing interest rates has helped states by saving them hundreds of millions of dollars. The drop in the levels of assistance provided by general purpose grants results in a huge kick in the guts for the states' and territories' ability to provide adequate services to their populations. The Western Australian government has been quite vocal in its unhappiness about the Commonwealth-state financial relationship for some time. Western Australia feels it gives far more to the Commonwealth than it receives back. According to information provided to me by the Western Australian government, Western Australians provide around $1.5 billion more to the Commonwealth in taxes and other revenue than they receive in grants, services and other benefits. In 1987-88, the Commonwealth returned 26.2 per cent of its taxes as grants to the states. Labor drove that down over the next period. In 1997-98 this portion is expected to be only 20.8 per cent-and that figure is from before the recent High Court decision. If the Commonwealth provided the same proportion of its revenue to the states as it did a decade ago, grants to the states would be around $7 billion higher. Western Australia's share of this would be around $700 million. That would be an awful lot of primary schools in Western Australia-and in my electorate. In real per capita terms, under the previous Labor government grants from the Commonwealth to the states decreased by eight per cent over the past decade. Western Australia's grants have fallen 20 per cent. The Commonwealth increased its own spending in that same period by 21 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) was talking before about these inequities and was saying that the states could have reversed this by increasing their own taxes-tax, tax, tax, he was suggesting the states should be doing. There needs to be a bit of sharing in that regard, and - hat is the position of this side of politics. This position is being addressed and reversed by the Howard government with its financial strategy towards the 21 st century. Prior to the High Court decision, the Commonwealth raised 73 per cent of all government revenues in Australia but is directly responsible for only 60 per cent of all government expenditure. The states raise only 24 per cent of government revenues but are responsible for 36 per cent of government expenditures. Surely these are reasons for reform; reform the Treasurer supports yet the Labor Party, it seems, is stuck in its mind-set and will notor cannot-get involved in tax reform. Another concern in Western Australia with regard to the current funding arrangement is the states' ability to provide a range of services. Western Australia is one of the luckier states in that it has experienced strong economic growth-economic growth helped and supported by the policies of the Howard government. However, its funding has been reduced over the last four years, with no consideration-the Western Australian government says-to the increasing infrastructure needs generated by this growth. Yet the Western Australian government recently agreed to the rules required under the funding policies. I recently accepted an invitation to visit the WA branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society in Perth and view its operation. The society is very concerned about the future of funding for disability services. It is of the opinion that certain areas, such as disability funding, should be quarantined from future decreases in funding. I strongly support this view. Surely another reason why we are in dire need of tax reform is that disability services are queuing with their hands out to get adequate funding. A proposed primary school in the rapidly expanding newer suburbs of Marangaroo and Landsdale in my electorate has had its development and building date postponed due to lack of funding. Another relatively new suburb, Ballajura-home to many young families-runs the risk of developing social problems. The reason for this is the drastic lack of facilities available to the local youth. The state government, at this stage, seems unable to provide basic infrastructure needs, which are absolutely essential in rapidly expanding areas. Surely, if the funds are not available we need to review this, and this is another reason why we must accept and adopt tax reform in this country. These amendments are helping, but everyone-except the Labor Party, which is stuck in the abyss of the past-wants to reform state funding issues. The previous speaker said that states can overcome this by increasing their own taxes. We need to not only rethink how governments collect their moneys but also how to distribute them to areas with the greatest need. My staff tell constituents on a regular basis that new funding levels in certain areas in departments and programs have occurred simply because there is not enough money to go around, due to the mismanagement of finances by the previous Labor governmentat the federal level as well as the state level. Labor's 'spend, spend, spend' policies of the past have destroyed much of the structure of the community, where funds are short and needs are high. We certainly cannot return to the high spending and high debt days of Labor government, state and federal. The current 'tighten our belts' policies are definitely starting to improve our economic outlook and our future, giving us a good base and a solid support for the 21 st centuryalthough there is much more work to be done. While there is a definite argument for watching more closely where our dollars are spent and channelling funds where they are most needed, we also need to be able to cope with an ever-expanding population and increasing demand for additional services to accommodate this expansion. Due to the combined effect of the states paying revenue to the Commonwealth and a reduction in grants, states have to rely on marginal tax bases of their own. This has only recently proven to be a problematic issue, with the recent High Court ruling on state franchise fees. The loss of revenue from fuel, alcohol and tobacco turns the state and territory governments back to relying on Commonwealth grants, and leaves the states with an even more marginalised tax base. Quite simply, the time is right for reform. The government is recognising this by bringing the issue of taxation reform into public consciousness. The Labor Party, it seems, insists on political point scoring rather than addressing the issue in a bipartisan way in the interests of our nation. It is obvious that, with a dwindling revenue base for both state and federal governments, the need for widespread restructured change is even more essential. It begs the question: what happens if a state economy suffers a huge blow? On one hand, the Commonwealth relies heavily on the fiscal contributions of the states and territories. Now is the time to consider the areas where this reform must occur. On the other hand, not a great deal is given back. Where will this leave the revenue raising options for the Commonwealth in the future if state economies take a nosedive? Take Western Australia, for example. The state has agreed to pay $151 million over a period of three years as part of its contribution to help fix the federal deficit created by the Labor Party. The total provided by the states and territories is $1.6 billion from 1996-97 to 1998-99 to help cover the deficit given to us by the Labor Party. In return, Western Australia has lost $543 million of Commonwealth funding over four years. Western Australia, it seems, has borne the brunt of the funding cuts. Surely this is reason enough for tax reform. Western Australia's strong economy is helping correct the national imbalance and the Commonwealth receives a great deal of much needed and valuable revenue from this state. In the extremely unlikely event of Western Australia going broke, the Commonwealth would lose one of its greatest sources of revenue. That would happen only under a Labor government, and that is why the people of Western Australia resoundingly choose Liberal members of parliament-out of 14 members, I think only three are Labor members-and have chosen Liberal state governments at the last two elections. Reform will reduce the Commonwealth and the states' mutual reliance upon each other, and I commend the quick, forthright way in which the Treasurer has addressed the needs of the states with this bill and the particular amendments associated with the loss of franchise fees. The Treasurer has responded, but he also acknowledges that there is much to do on this issue; and I tend to agree. We do urgently need tax reform in Australia. Tax reform is a key reform needed for our country, and reform for the states' revenue is at the core of our plans. This reform will only-and can only-be provided by the coalition parties.",54
147,Mr ANDREN,COMMITTEES,"There is an old saying that nothing is certain in apart from death and paying taxes. So it is not surprising that taxes are one of the main talking points in Australia today and will continue to be for some time, no doubt. I think the general public are fed up with the deception surrounding this issue continuing to be perpetrated by both sides of politics. How utterly disappointing it was to come back here yesterday after almost three months in my electorate. During those three months I have walked down main streets of country towns to see empty shops and even more empty shops in some of the smaller communities; three months in which small country papers have run story after story about the scourge of heroin addiction and about unemployed kids who feel they have no hope in the world and so are better off smacked off their faces on drugs. I have seen the Berlei bra factory close in Lithgow and throw 184 women out of work because the company cannot compete here. I watched the growing despair of farmers who realise they are in the middle of another drought and who, because they are paid so little for their produce, have no savings to back themselves up. They are at the mercy of the banks, which are still charging ridiculously high interest rates on farm loans. This is all background to my comments on this particular bill. I have seen the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) trawl through my electorate talking about some of these issues, giving no answers or solutions but no doubt winning support because people are so disaffected with the lack of leadership and vision coming from not only the government, which has a golden opportunity to show some leadership, but also from most of the major political players in this country. I was thinking, after a few months away, that it would be nice to come back here and see a bit of real leadership; some honest economic debate on bills such as this one, which deals with the very important issue of distributing revenue to help the states provide their various services. But, of course, it was wishful thinking. Instead we came back here to question time yesterday to see that the government had dredged up an old document life to show that Kim Beazley once supported a goods and services tax. The best the opposition could throw back was that John Howard had once promised there would never be a GST. Here is an issue, if debated honestly and tackled constructively, that could really make a difference to the economic fortunes of this country and address the very serious lack of business confidence out there in my electorate of Calare. Yet we are subjected to absurd debate of this level. We all know that many high profile Labor figures once wanted a GST; many of them still do. We all know John Howard once said there would not be one. But circumstances change, and I say: for the good of Australia, let us get on with the tax reform debate now. Let us honestly address, the need for taxation reform so the level of federal-state quibbling which surrounded this bill before us in the House today does not have to happen on an annual basis. Most people are aware that our taxation system is not fair and equitable; it is cumbersome, inefficient and long overdue for major overhaul. The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 will ensure Australia's states have the funds to continue, barely, their various services for another financial year. But it is a drip-feed to an ailing group of patients, namely, the states and territories. It again perpetrates our cumbersome system, which has evolved since Federation, where the Commonwealth collects the money and the states deliver most of the services. It is a system that has grown clumsily over the current century and I think there is growing awareness, as we head into the new millennium, that we really have to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch. That fact was recently brought home, and other members have alluded to it, by the High Court ruling on state excises and business franchise fees. We should be grateful to the New South Wales government for, unwittingly or otherwise, pursuing that case and reigniting the issue of tax reform because if it had not I do not believe it would have been on the agenda. The amendments to this bill, moved by the government as a result of that High Court ruling, only serve to underline the parlous condition of the states' funding base and their taxing powers-the vertical fiscal imbalance that sees the states raising now but 40 per cent of what they spend. So much for state autonomy. Anyone with even high school level economic understanding in my electorate realises the need for taxation reform is desperately urgent and they cannot believe that the Howard government, given the huge mandate it has, has failed to tackle this problem in its first term. As an Independent, I made my position clear on the issue more than a year ago, indicating I would support any coalition moves to overhaul the tax system. I know many members of this House have carried out surveys of their own and in their electorates through newspapers, newsletters and so on. In my case I received only one negative comment following my indication of support for tax reform. At this point I do not hold out great hope of our horse-and-buggy tax system being reformed to carry us into the 21 st century, given that it would take a bit of leadership and bipartisan forward thinking, which are sadly lacking in this place. This bill also takes the unusual step of getting the states to pay the Commonwealth back to cover the so-called $10 billion Beazley black hole. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) might have convinced his peers but the public were ready for the shock-horror discoveries of a new government because, as I pointed out in my first speech, the Beazley black hole was proportionally far smaller than the mess allegedly inherited by the Hawke Labor government when it took over the Treasury reins from John Howard. Unemployment, incidentally, was also the same. The public are not stupid. They know and remember and, like me, they do not believe either side. It seems the more things change, the more they stay the same. At least now we can be grateful, perhaps, for the charter of budget honesty, which will hopefully avoid this political ritual next time we have a change of government. The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 takes us into a new era of Commonwealth-state relations in that it contains this controversial state payback element. It is interesting when you look at how far we have come over the past century. A hundred years ago, before Federation, taxes in this country were almost non-existent. If you look at the towns in my electorate, like Orange, that grew up in the gold rush era, you can still admire beautiful shops, homes and other public buildings or fountains in parks, all paid for by wealthy businessmen who amassed amazing fortunes and paid little or no tax. Now we have wealthy businessmen paying little or no tax too, but who are dictating government policy through their media mates. Interestingly, Orange is about to embark on another gold boom, with the giant Cadia mine being developed by the Newcrest company just to the south of the city. It is highly doubtful, however, when this latest gold rush has gone, that Orange will be left with any legacy like the buildings that went up during the boom last century. The suburban sprawl on the outskirts of town may claim a few more farming acres, but that is probably all we will see. One of the biggest changes we have seen over the past century is that governmentsstate, local and federal-have all gradually increased their take of private earnings, leaving a lot less to spend for those who generate real wealth. The unproductive wealth in this country largely escapes tax. Even in recent years, when we have seen government cost cutting to painful levels in some instances, the average taxpayer still has not enjoyed any benefits. Public service at the coalface is a 1300 line. Ironically, at the time our tax system is at its most complex, tax offices have been closed and downsized. There have been no tangible tax cuts, with governments preferring to cut in some areas and spend somewhere else-with tax reduction taken in child-care cuts, and so on. We are told here in Australia that we are quite lucky in OECD terms because our level of taxation is really quite low. I do not think that argument would hold any weight with very many people I speak to out there. If you look at your average worker at a factory, such as Email in Orange, they may take home about $35,000 a year. About a third goes in tax. If they own a house, they pay about $1,000 in council rates. About $500 a year goes to the state government to keep their car on the road. Most of the cash they hand over when filling the fuel tank goes to the federal government in excise. There are insidious and hidden taxes on most of their groceries and other goods, in some cases pushing up prices by a quarter. They take their kids to school to find that even state schools charge up-front fees that cannot be avoided. It is take, take, take, with taxes coming at people three different ways, many of them hidden. People are very, very angry and bewildered. Businesses are feeling the tax pinch just as badly. Perhaps no tax is more insidious than state payroll tax, which must be one of the biggest disincentives to hiring people. It is a real tax on jobs. Despite all these taxes, the level and standard of services being provided by all three levels of government are continuing to fall or failing to keep pace with demand. One of the most obvious examples is road funding, where the level of repairs, maintenance and reconstruction simply cannot keep up with the level of damage. What, I ask, is the cost of not spending on rebuilding our rail infrastructure-not throwing it at the railway to nowhere from Adelaide to Alice Springs and then to Darwin, but real rail infrastructure? What is the cost of not spending on that and instead allowing heavy and damaging bulk road transport loads to stay on our roads and highways? Councils are having to pick up the tab for heavy wheat, which should be on rail, very being carted across local government roads. The same applies to coal and cement throughout my electorate. Also in Calare, two major hospitals, at Bathurst and Orange, are in crisis because of a supposed funding crisis. 'Cost shift' is the term that is used between federal and state treasurers-but no money to solve the problem. Recently I had several cases of distraught parents or spouses recounting stories of neglect of their loved ones in local hospitals-not through any lack of compassion by dedicated staff, but simply because the system is falling apart at the seams and the staff cannot cope. The hospitals are a state responsibility-and that is the crux of the problem. Scarce health dollars are filtered through federal and then state bureaucracies. The wastage is obvious. The blame is spread. The state government fortuitously passes the buck and says that it is not its fault. It says that it has had its level of assistance cut, and been forced to make a fiscal contribution to the Commonwealth as well. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may think I am digressing from the bill being debated, but I assure you I am not. This is how crumbling roads, and neglected patients and overstressed staff in Orange Base Hospital, relate to this bill. The clash at question time today between the minister for health· and his shadow over increased private health fund premiums is a classic example of the dilemma facing us and the lack of leadership in addressing it. Neither side of this House has an answer to the crisis-or one that they would dare suggest without giving any philosophical ground-because the cost of the health care in this country is out of control and, therefore, the cost of insuring against those costs and, thus, the overload on an underfunded and overloaded system. On the one hand, we had a government with a philosophical objection to private health cover; on the other, we now have a government with a philosophical objection to interfering in the marketplace. So we have the AMA dictating to this government; we have doctors who refuse to stick to recommended charges; and we have a health system crippled by overservicing, duplication and wastage-and a large part of that is because the states play politics with scarce funds in the same way as the federal government plays politics with scarce funds, as it is doing with that ludicrous AdelaideDarwin rail link farce. Quite simply, the way governments are collecting and spending people's hard earned money needs to be overhauled. Personally, I think we should do away with the states altogether. That would get rid of one layer of bureaucratic inefficiency. It would also let the federal government assume responsibility for the key areas of concern to our communityhealth, schools, tertiary education, vocational training and, yes, roads and transport and major project developments in regional areas. We are constantly told that we are the most overgoverned country in the world. Effectively, that means we are paying too many people to sponge off us, look after us and tell us what to do-and that includes politicians. I am one of 900-plus In this country. How absolutely absurd. What will it take to really bring about change? How I would love to see a taxation system that is fairer and more equitable-one that does not put such a huge burden on PA YE taxpayers and let major companies and wealthy business people minimise their income in such a way as to avoid paying almost anything; a system that prevents multinational companies from coming here, paying minimal tax and shifting their profits, all of them, offshore; a taxation system that rewards hard work and enterprise rather than penalising it. I mentioned earlier that I welcome the prospect of taxation reform including, possibly, a broad-based consumption tax. Having said that, I do not believe a GST is necessarily the answer. I would like to see all options on the table openly discussed. There is a tendency by some to slavishly follow New Zealand's model. All I can say to that is: Australia is not New Zealand. Comparing that country with ours is like comparing a Holden ute with a Mack semitrailer. Certainly we can learn from New Zealand's experience and tailor a reformed and fairer tax system-and also take cognisance of the unfairness that is emerging in the New Zealand system-a system that really suits this country. I suggest that, unless we can totally compensate the self-funded retirees-the fixed income earners-then the GST has no place at all. Let us perhaps look at a flat tax set at such a rate which is a disincentive to avoid tax. Perhaps expanding the sales tax base on some items to make up the shortfall so we can claw back tax avoidance in this country and generate the revenue that is now falling through the tax net through those high-fliers not paying through the black market through the disincentive to pay tax. While we debate this state grants amendment bill to provide general purpose financial assistance to the states and recompense the states for the taxes they have been unlawfully collecting-how absurd!-and as we enable the Treasurer to deduct a contribution from the states to meet the so-called budget black hole-a contribution the states and down the line local governments, schools, hospitals, services can ill-afford-as we approve this bill, as we no doubt will, just reflect on just how unfair and inefficient this grants system and this tax system are. The states are paying back $626 million this year-more than half a billion dollars-part of a deal struck at last year's Premiers Conference by state leaders forced to buckle to the wishes of Count Costello, who holds the money bag. The High Court has given us a stark warning on the need for urgent tax reform in its ruling on state taxes. Let us realise how inefficient the current tax collection and grants process really is. While both sides scare and mislead and cost shift and pull rabbits from hats and play with mirrors, Rome is burning. We cannot afford to fiddle any longer.",58
148,Mr ZAMMIT,COMMITTEES,"I rise to join this urgent debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill before the House. If ever further evidence is needed that the Australian taxation system is in urgent need of reform, then this is another example. This amendment bill is needed to rectify another anomaly that typifies another one of the strands of potential disputation in our taxation system that has now been successfully challenged in the High Court as it refers to state business franchise fees challenged in this case on the grounds of constitutional validity. In addressing this bill before the House and prior to coming to the major thrust of the I digress somewhat by way of background. In so doing, I refer to the state Labor Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, and the state Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Egan, both of whom attacked the decision of the High Court whilst at the same time feigning great astonishment and surprise. They hit the airwaves and the media professing that the state of New South Wales was going to face imminent financial catastrophe as they had no emergency plan in reserve to payout the franchise fees whilst awaiting rescue by the Commonwealth. I well recall my time as parliamentary secretary to the then Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner, who was also the state Treasurer, and my subsequent service as the Premier's Assistant Minister and Acting Assistant Treasurer some four to five years ago. I well recall the constant reminders and warnings by the state Treasury officers that state business franchise fees were being legally challenged and their recommendation that the state were to make necessary and appropriate provisions in the event of such an eventuality. These warnings were heeded and the necessary and responsible precautions were taken by the New South Wales coalition government-but not so by Bob Carr and Michael Egan, who have once again demonstrated their shortcomings and inadequacies as financial managers of New South Wales. The intention of this bill is to provide a safety net to protect the revenues to the states a-d. territories of annual revenues of some $5 billIon following the High Court's decision of 5 Au-us- 1997, which calls into question the constJ-utlOnal validity of state and territory franchIse fees. This bill also serves to address the resultant problems caused by the High Court's - ecision, which calls into question the past busmess franchise fee payments to the states and territories amounting to many billions of dollars. The Commonwealth will now collect what was previously a state tax through the Commonwealth's taxing powers-that is, all business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. Through these amendments, the necessary authority bill, will be provided to the Commonwealth to refund to the states and territories the revenue collected by way of revenue replacement payments in the sum of more than $5 billion in 1997-98, in addition to the Commonwealth's weekly payments of general revenue assistance. Resulting from the fact that state and territory business franchise fees vary substantially in their rates and coverage, and because of the fact that the Australian Constitution stipulates that the Commonwealth applies taxes uniformly, it will become necessary to do some juggling to ensure that no state or territory is worse off as a result of the High Court's decision on 5 August 1997. Additionally, excess revenues will be refunded to manufacturers or wholesalers by the states and territories to obviate the need for price increases for manufacturers or wholesalers. I note that the Australian Competition and Consu-er. Commission will be monitoring any pnce mcreases of the relevant products. Another important aspect of this bill to note is the fact that the safety net arrangements are temporary and are to be reconsidered within the next six months or so. It is also important to note that it will be revenue neutral for the Commonwealth. The urgency for the swift passage of this bill through the House is of paramount importance to avoid any further disruption to the state and territory finances. I am pleased to support the bill.",61
149,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"The main purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill is to formalise the conditions contained in the agreement to implement the national policy and the related reforms and those other arrangements entered into at the Premiers Conference earlier this year. The decision by the coalition to honour the former government's agreement to extend the real per capita guarantee of financial assistance grants to the year 1999-2000 was an important one. It provided the states. and territories with a rolling three-year honzon against which they could more accurately plan their own budgets. However, as we all know this agreement was not reached without substantial compromise by the states. It was a compromise t- the tune of $626.5 million in so-called fIscal contributions that are to be paid back to the Commonwealth in the 1997-98 financial year, plus a further $300 million in 1998-99. I commented during a debate on the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1996 that the coalition should not continue to look to the states to provide their expenditure cuts as the former Labor administration had done. But this is precisely what it has opted to do. It was to be hoped that this government would be more forthcoming in its support for a genuine review of federal-state fiscal relations. But, if the two budgets brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) are anything to go by, such a reform will not take place, certainly not during the life of this parliament. The engineering of these fiscal contributions by the Treasurer has ensured that the past practice of leaning on the states to shore up federal government coffers remains alive and well in our federation. This bill will guarantee that the appalling fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states and the loss of efficiency and accountability that goes hand in hand with it are further entrenched. Section 15B of the act stipulates that the Commonwealth payment of the financial assistance grants to the states is conditional on the latter meeting their share of the agreed fiscal contributions. A further requirement is that the states make satisfactory progress with the implementation of the national competition policy and related reforms. Specifically, the states are obliged to implement all COAG agreements relating to electricity arrangements thr?ugh the National Grid Management CounCIl as well as observe the agreed road transport reforms. If grants for the year 1999-2000 are to be met by the Commonwealth, then the states will have to effectively implement the COAG agreements on the strategic framework for the efficient and sustainable reform of the Australian water industry. They also are bound to the agreement on the national framewor- for free and fair trade in gas. Should the NatIOnal Competition Council deem that a state government has not met all the conditions for payments within a specified time frame, then that share of the per capita component of the finance assistance grants pool and the competition payments pool will be withheld by the Commonwealth. In August 1997 Mr Mike Nahan, the Director of the Institute of Public Affairs, labelled the Commonwealth as the paymaster to which the states were becoming increasingly bound. If ever there was a justification required to tag a federal government in this way, the fiscal contributions agreement is it. One of the strengths of a democracy, and a federal democracy in particular, is that governments can be made accountable to the community when there is a clear delineation of power and responsibility. The welfare of the Australian people is better protected when there are effective checks and balances on the power of the federal executive government. It is alarming to note, then, the changes that have occurred in state funding by the Commonwealth over the past decade. In 1983-84, general purpose grants to the states and territories constituted 6.35 per cent of gross domestic product. Ten years on, in the year 1993-94, Commonwealth outlays in this area had dropped to only 3.58 per c-nt of GDP. At the same time, the proportIOn of specific purpose grants allocated to the states has continued to increase. There is no question that a degree of - en­ tralisation is necessary to facilitate responSIble and efficient government by the Comm?nwealth. However, the federal executt ve government has become more and m?re prescriptive in its. direction of funds; wh-c.h activity impacts dIrectly on the states pohttcal autonomy. Of course, the recent High Court ruling on business franchise or tobacco fees has cleared the way for the Treasurer to impose his will even more comprehensively on the other levels of government, if he so chooses. Mr George Williams, a lecturer in constitutionallaw at the Australian National University, recently commented that, if we have the states, we should give them proper power over their own finances. I have long maintained that the states can be trusted to be financially responsible, if only because their political survival depends on it. In fact, the authors of a publication entitled The public sector in jeopardy noted: In contrast to the Commonwealth, steady fall in aggregate state deficits tion of GDP until 1988-89, after remained low . . . and turned into 1992-93 to 1994-95. They continue, in this publication, to observe that this reduction was achieved, 'despite the great financial stringency to which they were held by the Commonwealth, by substantially reducing state outlays as a proportion of GDP'. Although this bill was in the pipeline long before the fated High Court decision to abolish state government licensing fees on tobacco, it cannot be debated without bearing that particular landmark ruling in mind. If the states were stuck with an extremely thin tax base before the High Court's decision, that base is now looking near anorexic. Never before have the Australian states and territories been left so financially bereft. Never before has there existed a potential for the Commonwealth to exert such a complete stranglehold over the states by the administration of grants. 'Supplicants', 'vassals of the Commonwealth' and 'crippled dinosaurs' are some examples of the terminology being thrown around to describe the position of the states and that position in which they now find themselves. While the Treasurer was quick to say that this decision will not leave the states worse off in purely financial terms, the High Court's ruling will exacerbate an already excessive imbalance in federal-state taxing powers. One journalist noted: The patch-up being thrown together to keep the money flowing to the states ... contains too many distortions and is too inflexible to solve permanently the problem created by the ... decisionof the High Court. Observations that the Western Australian government will now be dependent on the Commonwealth for more than 60 per cent of its revenue support that claim. The Labor Party's response to this mess was as predictable as the rising sun. The Deputy Opposition Leader and member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) has been quoted as saying that existing Commonwealth excise and wholesale tax bases can be utilised to there was a make up the $5 billion revenue shortfall that as a propor- will now afflict the states. He suggested that which they the further erosion of the federal arrangement surpluses in is no justification for a more rapid overhaul of our taxation system. This attitude runs contrary to that of just about every business organisation in the country, including the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Australia. It is diametrically opposed to the view shared by the tax fraternity, including the Taxation Institute of Australia and Arthur Andersen. More than that, it is in stark contrast to the policy of the Labor government at  tried unsuccessfully to bolster widespread community support for the introduction of a broad based consumption tax. The authors of The public sector in jeopardy also noted: The sad lesson from the 1985 tax summit and the 1993 election campaign was that significant tax reform could not be achieved by consensus or open discussion of very complex issues, when they involved distributional and resource allocation changes that could not be easily measured either separately or as part of a comprehensive package. They went on to observe: Political expediency, sectional interests and media reporting more concerned with headline grabbing than with a reasoned analysis would always defeat genuine attempts to reform a taxation system, no matter how far removed it had become from the requirements of fairness. To their discredit, the Australian Labor Party have made it very clear that they are prepared to continue with their scaremongering on the issue of tax reform in the lead-up to the next federal election. Perhaps the recent High Court decision will do what numerous forums and think-tanks have failed to do-that is, to unite the community in the push for a tax reform that necessarily includes a reform of federal-state taxing powers. While reminiscing about the Labor Party's backflip on tax reform, it is worthwhile reminding ourselves of their abysmal track record on Commonwealth-state financial relations. This review is highly relevant to this debate in light of the recent High Court decision. At the 1984 constitutional convention, a subcommittee was formed to evaluate the provisions of the constitution affecting the states' fiscal capacity. In particular, the subcommittee was to look at the impact of section 90 of the constitution, that dealing with excise. The subcommittee's report was unanimous in its call for a redistribution of taxation powers. It noted that, amongst other things: The state tax base should be extended by enabling the states to impose duties and excise. This proposal was presented to, and passed by, the next meeting of the constitutional convention, in July 1985, and yet nothing ever came of it. Economists Mr Russell Mathews and Mr Bhajan Grewal have noted: The degree of consensus that had been obtained on such [a] contentious issue, among all levels of government and all political parties in the sub committee and the convention was remarkable. However, they go on to say: The fact that the proposals nevertheless failed, simply because they were opposed by the Commonwealth government of the day, was an indication of the virtual impossibility of fiscal reforms in Australia by means of constitutional change. The crisis that now faces the states, arising from the High Court decision, could have been averted if the former Labor administration had had the gumption to act on the recommendation of the 1984 convention. As it was, and for all it achieved, that talkfest was nothing more than another exercise in group therapy on a grander scale than usual. All this is yet another example of the calculated manner in which the Labor Party constantly undermined the ability of the states to raise taxes and fund their own programs, at least in part. Another example might be found in Labor's decision in 1989 to repeal the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act of 1978. The act was introduced in bill form into the House of Representati ves 19 years ago by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Its provisions-and I am quoting from his second reading speech-state in part: ... enabled each state, if it so chooses, to legislate to increase its revenue from personal income tax or to give-at a cost to the state-a rebate on personal income tax to residents in the state. In other words, tax law was passed and proclaimed to return-admittedly only in part-income taxing powers to the states, powers which those same states had ceded to the Commonwealth as a temporary measure during World War II. Only the Western Australian state government passed complementary legislation. In the event, the then Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, did not have it proclaimed. That inaction was in the face of being left in the lurch by his gung-ho ally of the time, Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and a double-tax scare campaign waged by then New South Wales Premier Wran and the Labor Party federally. Mr Keating did not repeal this act until 1989. When he did, not a squeak of protest was heard from state politicians of any political persuasion. There was ominous silence all round, as they say. Raising it now might put both the record of Labor and some of the achieving squeaky wheels amongst today's crop of premiers into some perspective. Independent analysts have argued that the High Court's decision to abolish state licensing fees on tobacco means that tax reform generally, and a reform of federal/state fiscal relations specifically, is now inevitable. They argue that it is no longer a question of if, but when. But this will be of little comfort to those Australians who have been pushing for the reform of our inefficient and fragmented tax system for more than a decade, and probably even longer. Bandaid measures will simply no longer wash. There is a growing consensus that the Australian economy cannot survive this Mexican stand-off much longer. If state governments are to continue to meet the specific regional needs of their domain, they require far more flexibility than the current system of grants allows. The states are not making unreasonable demands. They merely argue for a reliable tax base that is commensurate with their social and economic responsibilities. In the interests of economic growth and open and accountable government, the coalition must act swiftly and decisively in its review of Commonwealth-state financial relations.",62
150,Mr HARDGRAVE,COMMITTEES,"In my contribution to this debate this evening, I wish to raise a number of important matters and certainly to follow on from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in the matter of tax reform---certainly one of those matters-and also give a couple of examples in my electorate of Moreton. There is no doubt that, after 13 years of failure by the previous Labor government, we have been left with a taxation system which is coughing and wheezing its way towards the 21st century. Tax reform is no longer some sort of luxury-some sort of optional extra. This is now a necessity-standard equipment that we need in order to face the challenges that we as a nation have before us. After all, if people on 1.5 times average weekly earnings are now dipping into the top marginal rate of tax, figures show very clearly that in not too many years-inside a handful of years-we are going to see people on the average weekly wage paying the top rate of tax. Yet here we have a Labor opposition who quite happily will talk about anything they can to try to create scare campaigns and to try to walk us away from legitimate taxation reform. Where are they as far as looking after average weekly wage earners are concerned? Obviously, there is a lot left wanting. It is another reason why so many Australian workers, who had in the past supported the Labor Party, felt let down so badly and sufficiently to change their vote and give the coalition at the last election. I do not think anybody who has any common sense attached to their being would disagree with what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said when he brought this matter up for proper debate a few weeks ago, in particular that the time for action had been reached. We certainly do need to have a responsible debate on tax. We need to understand exactly how the Commonwealth and, for that matter, the state governments, are going to raise the funds necessary to provide the services which are expected and demanded by the Australian people. We need the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, their coalition partners in the Senate, to get on with the job of actually allowing some of these matters to be discussed and also allow them to be passed once they have been discussed. We do not need any more talk about death duties, as we have apparently heard from some of the senior members opposite. We do not need to hear talk about additional capital gains taxes on private dwellings, as we have heard from members of the Australian Democrats. We need a mature debate and one focused on helping average Australians get on with the job of surviving their own lot and also contributing to Australia. A small business person said to me just the other day, 'Why is it that whenever we talk tax reform, it has to be politicised? Why is it that the opposition automatically decide that they are going to oppose a matter rather than realise how important the debate is and contribute to it in a responsible way?' I must say for the record that I certainly do not want to be involved in a GST yea or nay debate. I think it is far broader and far more important than just that. The recent High Court decision which has affected the way states raise their funds certainly is another reason for the sort of change and the sort of reforms and discussions we need to have. The revenue for the states goes to the heart of the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 which is before us this evening. State governments lost the capacity to levy it to income tax back in 1942. It was a wartime measure. Since then they have been basically financially dependent on the federal government. From the federal perspective, we would all agree that the states say, 'We've got a big shopping list. You guys provide us with the money; we know best how to spend it.' I am sure that would unite all sides of this place. The fact of the matter is that the states rely incredibly heavily on the Commonwealth. In fact, the bulk of their funds comes from Commonwealth sources. About half of that comes from general purpose grants, which is the matter of this bill. These grants are untied. There is no specific purpose that is attached to their granting by the Commonwealth. There are three categories-the special assistance grants, the special revenue assistance and the national competition payments. I will not deal with each of those in any great detail, but I thought it was important to state that for the record. There is a total of $16.8 billion for 1997-98 involved in this bill. Financial assistance grants are the largest category of the general purpose grants and are distributed based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission according to a formula which maintains the grants in a real per capita term, making adjustments for inflation and national population growth. In Queensland there is always a lag effect. It has been a traditional complaint from Queensland, but it is a justifiable one-that is, the growth in Queensland causes the need for planning and then constructing proper infrastructure to accommodate the forecast population growth. Likewise, the argument is-and I think it is quite a sound one-that Queensland needs a premium on their per capita allocation. It is a matter that a lot of the Queensland members continue to pursue with this government, as was the case with previous governments. Funding is guaranteed on a rolling three year basis. That suits the states; it assists in their planning. This year, for the first time, FAGs are absorbing the identified road funding. Commonwealth funding for arterial roads was previously allocated separately. In fact, until 1994 this type of road funding was given as a tied grant. Total FAG payments this year are expected to be about $16.14 billion. I want to raise a matter in conjunction with this road funding issue which shows how previous state and federal Labor governments misspent or poorly allocated funds on a particular road in my electorate called Kessels Road. This is basically now a six-lane highway along with the Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road, which dissects the southern half of the electorate of Moreton. It is a federally funded road; it is a route for toxic hazardous chemicals. In fact, under Labor it went onto the national highway system linking Ipswich Road with the Gateway Arterial. Over a period of about 25 years, a number of incremental changes brought this about. Riawena Road was an extension to Kessels Road which linked Granard Road onto Kessels in time for the 1982 Commonwealth Games, which was held at the geographic heart of my electorate. The completion of the Gateway Arterial about half a dozen years ago gave a route to the port of Brisbane via Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road. Overnight we essentially had a federally funded national highway link between Ipswich Road and the so-called port road or Gateway Arterial Road. As a result of this, there is tremendous congestion on this road these days. Major transporters, giant B doubles-double dog transporters, whatever you like to call themuse this road. It is one of the busiest roads in Australia. Trucks from Rocklea and from the national rail freight terminal in Coopers Plains access the Gateway Arterial and the port of Brisbane along what was 25 years ago a suburban street. Brisbane City Council garbage trucks use it to transport waste to the Rochedale landfill. It is ill-designed and inadequate for all of these purposes. There are major health problems associated with intersections where trucks stop and spew out all sorts of untold them toxins in the form of diesel exhaust wastesmatters that have been identified, quite rightly, by the Southside Chamber of Commerce. There is no mechanism built into this road to handle any spill of any toxic or hazardous products like petroleum. In fact, if any accident were to cause a spill, the likely result would be that chemicals, or whatever, would wash into anyone of a handful of creeksStable Swamp Creek, Mimosa Creek, Bulimba Creek-and, ultimately, into the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. Trucks at the intersection at Mains Road and also the intersection with Logan Road cause massive delays to local residents who have grown used to the long delays just to get out of their subdivisions and their homes. People in streets like Benaud and Sobersnamed after the cricketers-and around Player Street at Upper Mount Gravatt are all experiencing those sorts of delays. For all its volume, Kessels Road also cruels the lot of small business retailers along its length as local residents try to avoid the area like a plague. These matters were going to get worse, until recently, because the state government of Queensland had a very innovative plan to put a bus lane along the South East Freeway, which runs underneath Kessels Road at Upper Mount Gravatt and which would have required the lengthening of the bridge. I raised the issue and I am very pleased to say that Queensland Department of Main Roads, to their credit, have come up with an innovative tunnelling approach which will alleviate what could have been some very long delays on Kessels Road as the construction period took place. Through the Sunday Mail and also the Southern Star newspaper in my electorate, I have called for trucks to be banned from Kessels Road between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. This is certainly not unprecedented in the Brisbane City Council area. The BCC, along with the state government, did this in the inner city. Local traffic is, of course, excepted. the Brisbane City Council's decision in the Fortitude Valley area has caused a lot more trucks to go onto Kessels Road rather than use Ipswich Road and the Story Bridge. I would like to see a similar thing applied in the case of Kessels Road. What really is quite relevant-and ties this back into the debate before us here-is that there is an alternate route that is now available which has been funded, in part, by the monies that we are talking about in this bill. The alternate route is the extension to the Gateway Arterial called the Southern Brisbane By-pass. It hooks onto the Logan Motorway. They are both toll roads. That link opened a few months ago. After this massive investment by the Queensland state government, you would think transporters would be using the route. The Minister for Transport and Main Roads in Queensland, Vaughan Johnson, did a very good thing in lowering the toll along this new route. That carrot approach did have an effect for about five or six weeks. There was a noticeable decline in transport along the corridor, but it has all gone back to what it was. I have to say that I think part of that is because the state government's signage is directing traffic onto Kessels Road. There are signs on the Gateway Arterial and on the South East Freeway saying 'Alternate (no toll) route to Ipswich this way'. So here we have federal funds going into a major infrastructure project, which is very important, yet we still have this dreadful lag effect of traffic delays, problems and congestion encouraged by a the sign of all things. So I have written to Minister Johnson to encourage him to pull that sign down. I think it is very important that he does. Worse still, a lot of trucks are finding that the traffic on Kessels Road-this federally funded road-is so bad that they are using Pads tow Road at Eight Mile Plains, MCCullough Street at Sunnybank, Boundary Road at Coopers Plains, Compton Road at Kuraby, Runcorn and Sunnybank Hills to get around the traffic. These are very much suburban roads. They run past schools. There are trucks using MCCullough Road which In fact, simply should not be using it. I was astonished the other week-and on several occasions since-to note that the state government's own transporters, the Q-Link transporters, are using these suburban roadsMCCullough Street, Boundary Road and Pads tow Road-to get from Coopers Plains rail yards onto the Gateway Arterial. I find it astonishing that even the state government does not have enough faith to use the new federally funded road infrastructure-after all, the pool of funds goes to the Queensland government and they spend it from there. The state government is not even using their own new infrastructure for their own trucks. My plan is that trucks should be forced to travel down Beaudesert Road south of Granard Road to join up with the three major arterial freeways that I have talked about. This would get the trucks out of suburbia. It is a matter I have raised with the state government and one I certainly intend to pursue. I raise it here in this debate because I think it is important to have it on the record that funds leaving this place as untied grants need to be properly spent by the states. I think it is a matter that you sometimes wonder about from the perspective of being a member of the federal parliament and trying to be a part of the process of planning proper infrastructure. I also raise the issue to chase up the issue of allocations of further funds to a growth state like Queensland. I certainly know the people of Coopers Plains, Salisbury, Robertson, Macgregor, Upper Mount Gravatt, Wishart, Sunnybank and Eight Mile Plains want a better deal. They certainly are going to get it if I have anything to do with it. I am pleased the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform recently visited and inspected the roads I have talked about as part of their inquiry into federal road funding. They certainly saw the sort of mess I have talked about. This story is, I guess, repeated all around the country with national roads passing through various suburbs and towns. It is a problem I am sure all members in this place can relate to. Road infrastructure issues are very important. In planning roads we cannot ignore the impact they have on local communities and the expectations local communities have. While federal ties to state expenditure of road funds were disconnected some years ago, the state by state planning of road infrastructure certainly does leave something to be desired. I would like also to comment on suggestions by the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren) in his contribution to tonight's debate regarding taxation reform. I suspect the honourable member is right when he says that Rome is burning and we cannot afford to fiddle any longer. Taxation reform certainly does need bipartisan support, but all indicators are yet again saying we are not going to get it, which I think is a very lamentable fact. Another lamentable fact is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and his party have a very bad record on taxation reform and have squibbed on every attempt to have a serious national debate. They can participate in it if they come in with an open mind rather than a scare campaign agenda. After all, in 1985 the taxation reform preferred by senior members of the then government did not take place. We ended up with new and demanding taxes and a more complex tax act, which went from taking up a metre or so of bookshelf to taking up half a dozen metres on a bookshelf. Each and every year taxation accountants have to update their knowledge about this system. It is so complex and is placing more burdens on small business operators and individuals right around this country as they try to comply and also understand exactly what they are meant to do to comply. Certain taxes came out of the 1985 reform, including the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. Restaurant owners in my electorate-that is, those who have survived-say this sector simply has not been the same since 1985. I suspect there is room to allow a certain amount of deductible lunch expenditure to help, if nothing else, an important sector of our economy to survive and grow. The 1991 to 1993 Fightback tax debate failed simply because of the mother of all scare campaigns, the big negative, which was very effectively waged by the KeatingBeazley government. And here we are in 1997, so soon after the Prime Minister has given us what so many people in my electorate wanted, the opportunity to discuss tax reform, hearing quite silly and pointless questions in this place such as the contributions today by the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the advocacy of death taxes by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). My concern about this is quite simple. We already have this scare campaign and an absolute squibbing and abrogation of the chance of the Labor Party to participate in a sensible and proper debate. They want to turn it into a GST yea or nay debate, which I think is a very immature approach to this whole issue. Yet, what are we going to get at the end of it? If we do actually end up with the reforms which so many people in this country want, we will end up with legislation which passes this place and then moves to the other place, where we will see even more delays. Look at the deliberate delays which are occurring as a result of the Labor-Democrat alliance in the Senate on important matters such as training. Training providers in my electorate cannot start programs which should have started on 1 December last year and are probably not likely to start until 1 March next year because the legislation is still doing the circuit in the Senate. How are we going to handle matters such as changing the arrangements relating to taxation powers for the states and the Commonwealth? How are we going to handle the taxation reform and the result of the serious debate I hope we can have? How are we actually going to get legislation which may pass this place passing the other place? These are all serious matters. No matter what may come out of this taxation debate, which has now been started in full, there is more than a fair chance that any reforms may be delayed for many years. For that matter, the bill we are discussing this evening may well sit over there in the Senate for the next 12 months. I am sure all in this place and all thinking Australians-those who voted for this government and even those who did not-would want to see this government given the chance to implement the programs it quite rightly has a mandate for and would seriously like to see the Senate get on with the job of passing legislation. To not allow legislation to pass an absolute disgrace. I call on in particular Senator Kernot from Queensland and also Senator Faulkner, the Labor leader in the other place, to get on with the job of passing matters so the interests of all Australians can properly be addressed. I hope over the next eight weeks of sittings we will actually enact some of the vital legislation Australians are waiting for so we can all get on with the job of rebuilding this country and giving our kids a better future and to make sure all of those things are possible.",66
151,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEES,"As is often my lot, I am following the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave). I thank him for the detailed tour of the roads of Moreton. I am still not quite sure where Moreton is. Judging from the member, I would say it is somewhere around fairyland. In speaking in this debate, I want to make it clear that I am going to address the political and the philosophical ramifications of this and not so much the detail. If anyone wants to drag out the detail, I recommend to them the speech of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), which I thought was excellent. This is a crossroads debate in many ways because it is a debate about whether Australia is going to go down the centralist road or whether we are game enough to try to claw back a federal system which is embodied in our constitution. The truth is of course that the Labor Party is totally centralist in its operation but so too is the present government, and there is no greater centralist than John Howard, the Prime Minister. In my view this is a dangerous phenomenon. I entered this House as an ardent centralist. I could see no reason for states. A short time in this place convinced me that I was wrong. I am now a committed federalist and I would be looking for more power and more autonomy to be returned to the states. This would require some guts and integrity in the states which I see no great evidence of. But it is important for Australia. If the states have much greater freedom of operation, there is no doubt that some states will get it wrong is and some states will get it right. The states that get it wrong will be forced to follow the example of those who get it right. If the Commonwealth gets it wrong, it will be wrong for all time. One can only say with all honesty that, if decisions in this nation in the last few years-probably in the last 20 years-had been made by a process of twoup, we would have been better off because we would have got at least half of them right. But that has not been the case in the way things have gone. It is quite clear that there has to mechanism for the states to be able to indeKeating pendently raise money. This of course quires the states to accept a far greater degree of responsibility. I think the foolish not to take up the option of clawing back income tax. This debate cannot take place, as many speakers have said, without consideration of the tax laws in this country. This has been brought on very much by High Court decision. The High Court these days seems to be a perverse animal. It seems to delight in bringing down decisions that throw everything into disarray. There are people who would argue that the High Court has taken a legal decision in this case, recently deceased Mr Barwick would probably have agreed. But I think that argument is almost optional-after all, we saw a High Court in the old days give control of the offshore sea area to the Commonwealth. It was quite clear that the Commonwealth did not have a clue how to manage or control and had to make the states agents for its management. We saw in the Mabo legislation that there was no attempt by the courts to stick to the law. They went into social engineering. believe there is a will in the High Court impose centralism on Australia. We have centralist High Court. That is a danger, particularly when the rest of the world starting to realise the dangers of centralism and is starting to try to move a lot of decision making back into regions-Australia goes blundering down the road to more and more centralism. It is, as I have said, a very ous area, a very dangerous road to be travelling on, and one which is going to disenfranchise a lot of Australia. People often are critical of Canberra, Canberra bashing I guess is a popular sport Australia. I think it is grossly unfair. Canberra is no more than a very nice large country town. The problem with Canberra is the single-issue politicians from Melbourne and Sydney, particularly Sydney, that infest this place. They come here with their very narrow concepts. They believe the whole world revolves around them. Our former Prime Minister said that if you did be a Sydney you were camping out. I say to Mr that there is a whole lot of Australia reout there which is very important to the combined welfare of this nation and it has to states were very be considered. What we are seeing with a centralist regime are greater and ever-increasing numbers of decisions being made in the interests of the Melbourne and Sydney. That is not in the national interest and never can be, because there is not a city in Australia that lives off its intrinsic value. There is not a city in Australia that creates wealth. The wealth of Australia is overwhelmingly created in the hinterlands; it and the is mainly collected in the cities. When we are looking at changes in tax law, we really ought to be guided by the words of ex-Senator Peter Walsh, a former Minister for Finance in the Labor government. He espoused what I call the Walsh dictum, and that it was this: all governments will always spend all the money, and mostly they will waste it. The GST will give to government the power to incrementally increase the amount of money it gets out of taxpayers. It is nonsense for the government to suggest that it will lead I to a lower overall tax. Everywhere in the to world where this tax has been introduced, it a has led to an increase in the tax taken-a total increase. There is not one example that is I can think of where the contrary is true. Because a GST enables governments to ratchet it up slowly-half a per cent at a time---eventually governments will gamer more and more money and that money will be dangergarnered without any real accountability. The government talks blithely about tax reform. There is no real urge for tax reform. What there is an urge for in this country and today is tax churning. The government comes in in and talks about tax reform. It talks about the GST only; it does not talk about the need to widen that tax base by getting people who do not pay tax at the moment, like large multinational companies, to contribute to that tax. I suspect that I have paid more tax than Swiss Aluminium have paid. Certainly I have paid more tax than MCDonald's have paid. Unless that is addressed, there can be no not live in genuine tax debate. I asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in this House a question without notice: would he provide to members of parliament a brief synopsis on the advantages and disadvantages of a GST versus a debit tax. He did not answer the question at all. I have now put the question on notice. I do not expect it to be answered. The debit tax clearly has a lot of value. It is very easy to collect, it is very cheap to collect, it does not put a big onus on small business and it cannot be avoided by multinationals. It seems to me to be a tax which should be considered. Of course, it is not a tax that would be welcomed by some people. The people who oppose this tax are of course in the tax industry itself. The tax would be so simple that there would not be much use for the industry. There would not be a lot of use for the tax department. They might have to find more useful jobs. The governments would not be able to bestow largess because the tax would be so simple and so clearly identified. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",70
152,Unknown,COMMITTEES,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8 NA Barwick, Right Hon. Garfield Edward John, AK, GCMG",72
153,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES," Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, last evening I was representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in Sydney at a function associated with the commemorative events with ASEAN and I was not in a position to speak on the motion that was moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in relation to Sir Garfield Barwick. I would like to do so tonight, if I may. As a former member for Parramatta, Sir Garfield was known well to me, but not because he was involved in any way in public life other than as the Chief Justice of AustralParramatta is when I was serving initially in Parramatta. Because of my involvement throughout the Liberal Party and my family's involvement, we knew Sir Garfield very well and we knew the Barwick family very well. Our lives crossed in many ways, and I want to take this opportunity, in being associated with this motion, to record some of them. It is perhaps little known that my father in fact stood for endorsement for the Liberal Party in Parramatta in the early 1950s and was defeated by Sir Garfield, as I think it is recorded in Marr's book, by 28 votes to 22. I suspect my own opportunity to serve in this House was very much rooted in the events of that time. The great figures in the Liberal Party were working to secure Sir Garfield's nomination. My father had been tilling the soil locally for a period of time and, of course, when Sir John Carrick and I think Sir William Spooner decided to come up and talk to everybody on the preselection panel the road was much more difficult. When I stood for endorsement at a later point in time, I was the subject of a very close ballot; I think it was 25-24. There were people working against me-I do not want to speak ill of the dead, but I think it was Sir Robert Askin-in support of Sir Nick Shehadie, who was the candidate who was expected to do well in that particular ballot. p.m. I put together a coalition of votes, but amongst that coalition of votes were four people whom I am reasonably confident voted for me to make up for voting against my father some 25 years or so before. Mr MCMullan interjecting",72
154,Mr RUDDOCK,CONDOLENCES,"I am not sure I can tell you all those who voted for Sir Nicholas, but I can tell you some of them who did not. I was very much involved in the Young Liberal movement. Sir Garfield's daughter, Diane, was involved in the Young Liberals branch that I was involved in. We worked very closely together while he was involved in public life in the area. His son was involved in the Young Liberals elsewhere but has become more actively involved in the Liberal Party in the electorate that I now represent. In the period that I was the member for and later the member for Dundas I continued to come across Sir Garfield in many of the activities in which he was involved in the period after he retired as Chief Justice of Australia. He was the Chairman of the Royal New South Wales Institute for the Deaf and Blind and he was the chancellor of Macquarie University. He was associated with many other very important public endeavours, but in those two fields I had the opportunity of witnessing a man who, having achieved as much as he had, was giving of his all to help those who were very disadvantaged. He put together some of the most powerful people in Sydney as members of the board of the institute and he gave leadership. I can remember as he was going increasingly blind and he was still in the chair he would come to meetings and be able to give perfectly lucid speeches about all of the activities in which the institute had been involved, to speak about its accounts, and in considerable detail. It was the same way he used to come in here and swear in members of parliament. You would swear that he actually wrote the script because he delivered it so perfectly, and never reading it, while conducting the oath and the other events associated with a new parliament. In relation to his role as chancellor of the university at Macquarie, my wife at that time was teaching in its law school and she needed people to participate in moots, which are very important for young lawyers' preparation for their later experience in the courts. Sir Garfield would come along and participate as chair of those moots and give of his time and experience. My wife would come home and tell me how he used to take the mickey out of them when they would all find quotes from Barwick CJ that they wanted to read. He would say to them, 'Who is this Barwick that you are quoting? There are other judges on the court.' I can remember other occasions around my electorate when it was unexpected that he continued to involve himself. He was the donor of a trophy at the Rydalmere Central Bowling Club for the Barwick Fours. I can remember that for years we received apologies, and one year when they did not receive an apology he actually turned up and they found, having already started, there was not a place for him. He then proceeded to tell about all the other occasions in public life, even occasions with royalty out at the Lodge, where he had turned up having received an invitation but people had not expected him to want to take a place. He was essentially a person with enormous capacity but still a very common touch. I saw that in ways which those examples-and I promise to be brief tonight-enumerate. I greatly admired what he was able to achieve as a member of this parliament and as a minister. He certainly adorned the High Court of Australia. As I think Bob Ellicott said when he spoke at the memorial service for Sir Garfield, to be able to publish his memoirs at the age of 92, half-blind and barely able to walk yet piercing and piecing together the past with his amazing memory and intellect, was a remarkable achievement. I commend Bob Ellicott's address on that occasion to those who may be interested. It was relatively brief, but it outlines more fully the capacities of the man, something which I would like to be able to do tonight, but time does not permit. I want to thank the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) for mentioning in his address last night my inability to be present and my desire to speak tonight. Finally, I have extended to Sir Garfield's son and daughter-whom I have known well-my personal commiserations, but I want Lady Barwick, whom I have not seen since Sir Garfield's death, to know that our prayerful thoughts are very much with her at what has been a very difficult time. Thank you for giving me this indulgence to be associated with that motion. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",72
155,Mr CAMPBELL,CONDOLENCES,"We return to the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill via the back roads of Moreton, the backrooms of the Liberal Party and the lapidary inscriptions of Barwick CJ. This is a very important bill. It is hard to pick up the threads exactly, but we were talking about tax. I want to make this point about the GST. The GST has a very high cost of compliance. That cost does not fall on government; it disproportionately on small business. The GST, make no mistake about it, is a tax beloved of big business. No doubt that is why the Liberal Party is supporting it-and I have no doubt that, in time, the Labor Party will fall into line. Regarding the debit tax, it is claimed that if all bank withdrawals were levied at the rate of 0.35c in the dollar, it would raise enough money to entirely replace income tax-if that is what you want to do. I suspect this figure includes foreign exchange transactions, which would not be there if you were to tax them, even at that rate. They themselves would be no loss to Australia, but the tax base would not be there. However, as a nation we deserve more information on this option. It behoves the government to lay the cards on the table and tell us just what those pros and cons are. Broadening the tax base is important. Apart from getting the multinationals to pay taxwhich would clearly broaden it-getting people back in employment would broaden it too. Over the last 20 years in this country governments have destroyed the tax base which was available to the nation from import duty. We have lost that and, in doing so, we have also lost a lot of employment. So we have lost the tax base there as well. Government action has given us a double whammy of contraction in that tax base. We have to get Australia working again, and that means we have to lay down things which will help the manufacturing sectormanufacturing industry-which is the only area where we are going to get worthwhile jobs. A lot of hype was talked about this. Both parties take credit for growth in manufacturing industry. It was a proud boast of Keating to say, 'We have had 10 per cent growth in manufacturing'-bear in mind that manufacturing includes such things as aluminium ingots. Leaving that aside, yes, we did get a 10 per cent growth in manufacturing industry over a long period, but it was off a very small base. What the politicians do not tell us but what they also know is this: imports in that same category have risen by about the same percentage off a much higher base, so the gap has actually got bigger and falls not smaller. That same category of imports now comprises something like 87 per cent of our import bill. We have just had the Mortimer report brought down, and the government is waxing eloquent about it. Unfortunately the Mortimer report is totally in conflict with the Hilmer report. The Hilmer report is a very flawed document. Remember that Hilmer was put in place by Keating. He was writing to a format. What Hilmer has given us is high school economics. It is a nonsense concept. The truth is this: government departments can give you any return on capital they want. All they need to do is raise the prices or reduce the services. Introducing competition is often very counterproductive, and I think it behoves Mr Hilmer and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to tell us how the nation has benefited from, for instance, duplicating a glass fibre line across the nation, when one of those lines was more than adequate to carry the communications needs of this country for a long time to come, bearing in mind we also had the backup of the existing microwave system there. I find this talk of competition by people who have never done a damn thing in their lives and never gone out and earned anything in their lives a little galling. It reminds me of the early days of my entry into this parliament when, in the interests of competition, we decided all main roads contracts would go out to tender. The result of this was that we put main roads departments across the nation out of business. In doing so, we cut away the jobs of a lot of Aboriginal people. I suspect in some of those states-northern and South Australia, Western Australia, western Queensland and western New South Wales-there were a significant number of Aboriginal people working in main roads whose jobs disappeared. No one factored in the social cost of that. Did we get cheaper roads? No, we did not. Did we get better roads? I would say definitely not. So much for the nonsense. In the Mortimer report, which I think is itself fairly flawed, they go to great pains to say that they are not going to pick winners, which is exactly what they are doing. But they cannot even get that right. They tell us the industries we must have in Australia are industries related to science and computers and tourism. Tourism-and this should be remembered-means low paid jobs, part-time jobs and jobs for women and kids. It does not mean jobs for blue-collar workers. So what government has done is to create a situation where across this nation we have got the blue-collar worker out of work and his wife working part-time. Then we wonder why the kids are out of control. Nobody factors this cost in-least of all the rational economist-but it is a real cost being borne by society. Picking winners is quite easy to do. You pick winners in areas where you have a natural advantage or a strategic need. Take citrus growing, for example. We grow citrus very well indeed. But if the international companies have their way and government kowtows to them, they will simply put the citrus industry in this country out of business; and then watch prices go through the roof. There will be no control on prices. Governments are paralysed. They say we cannot do anything because of GAIT. That, of course, is cowardly nonsense. Why can't we impose in this country exactly the same regime as the Americans impose on imported orange juice there? They impose a rate at something just above 8c a litre, and that means that when the price is low it is a significant factor; when the price is high, it does not matter very much. We, of course, with our ad valorem tax, give the greatest protection to the grower at the time when he least needs it. That is nonsense and governments could improve on that. All it needs is the necessary wit, will and wisdom-which is, in my view, lacking from both sides. If you are going to pick other winners, let us look at the chemical industry. We have abundant natural resources off the North West Shelf of Australia; they are absolutely begging for a chemical industry there. But an international chemical industry is not going to start there unless it can get some sort of assistance from government, because governments throughout the world give that sort of assistance. It is my view that assistance to industry should be given in the form of capital grants. It is the most honest, transparent way of giving industry an advantage. Government can say: 'We will pay for this much' or 'We will install this much.' That way, I think we could get the chemical industry based on natural gas here. Once established, that industry will be there through the life of that technology and hopefully beyond, because if we do it sensibly we can make this country an absolute centre for this sort of thing. We have had a look at the sorts of industries that we need in Australia; let us have a look at what has actually happened. Four years ago this month we closed down, in Sydney, the last factory capable of making truck wheels, where the bearings go into. There is no country in the world that runs on wheels the way Australia does. We are a nation absolutely committed to transport; we need it for our very survival. Why did that company fail? It failed because a 15 per cent tariff was not enough to protect it from Malaysian imports. It was during the Keating years-if 15 per cent did not protect you then you deserved to die; and die they did. What happened to the price of wheels? Once the competition had been removed, up went the price of imported wheels and there was no way of stopping it. The rise in the price of those wheels has been far higher than the cost of the protection that was afforded them. The same thing will happen with orange juice. I can tell this House now that if assistance is not given to the citrus industry and the citrus industry fails, imported juice will replace Australian juice, the price will go through the roof, and we will never be able to start that industry again because of the lead times required. It takes seven years to start to get a profit off a tree. Those things are so self-evident that you can wonder why government cannot see them. It is my contention that government does see them. People in government cannot be so blind and they cannot be so stupid. They see them all right; they simply do not have the courage to act on them now. I know this: people have said that revolution is impossible in this country. They are wrong. I have travelled around this country a lot and the anger is immense. It is like a tinderbox out there. Something will go wrong and if that anger gets off the rails, you will have revolution in this country, all right. It will be a nasty revolution and it will be directly attributable to the acts of government, and the opposition-because, remember, they were the government for many years. I can tell you now that drugs are not the problem in Australia; paedophilia is not the problem in Australia. The problem in Australia-the problem which is driving people to desperation-is the knowledge that the system is unjust. They see Australia, which they know in their hearts should be the wealthiest country in the world, being driven into the ground by government action. That is what is driving this despair. People in the country, people throughout Australia, want honest government that is going to give them jobs for their future and give their kids a future. If this is not addressed by government, if we play around the edges and pretend that these other problems are the problem to give the appearance of doing something, there will be trouble in this fair land and the blame will rest entirely at the feet of this house of parliament.",73
156,Dr SOUTHCOTT,CONDOLENCES,"Boothby) (8.20 p.m.)An article in the Sydney Morning Herald by Paul Cleary on 9 August talked about a study by Professor Francis Castles of the ANU and Kerry Barwise of Treasury which concluded that, when it comes to raising taxation revenues, Australia is the most centralised federation in the world. While in the United States Washington raises something like 50 per cent of total revenue and in Germany Berlin raises 30 per cent, in Australia Canberra raises 80 per cent of total national revenue. Not only is Australia the most centralised federation in the world when it comes to raising tax but also it is actually more centralgram, ised than many centralised states, like France. In fact, Castles and Barwise found that Australia was third out of all OECD nations, beating several countries which do not even have states. The article went on to say that while the Commonwealth of Australia is centralised on the revenue side it is highly decentralised on the outlay side. Their conclusion was that decentralised systems spend less on services like health and education. They found it to be statistically significant that, based on outlays, decentralised systems actually end up spending less because the levels of bureaucracy actually provide a constraint to the money being spent. The article serves to highlight the fact that as Australia approaches the 21 st century our federation is, fiscally speaking, in poor shape. Prior to the High Court decision of 5 August, the states were raising only 55 per cent of the revenue that they spent; Canberra supplied the rest. Now that the states have lost the ability to levy franchise fees on alcohol, tobacco and petrol, the situation has got worse. It is clear that Commonwealth-state financial relations need some reform. It is not a new problem. The states have been reliant on the Commonwealth since Federation and more so since they gave up their income taxing power in 1942. Malcolm Fraser, in the 1970s, offered the states some responsibilities and also the power to raise income tax. That power was never taken up by any state. In the 1990s Bob Hawke went through a constitutional frenzy and launched his new federalism to even up the imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states, offering the states a guaranteed share of revenue. As anyone who observed the period or watched some of the series like Labor in Power will remember, Hawke's new federalism was the first thing sunk by Keating prior to his final assault on Hawke. The High Court's decision on 5 August has highlighted that the states are now more dependent on Canberra than ever. Labor's response to that has highlighted how empty their whole policy on taxation really is. Gareth Evans, speaking on the Sunday prosaid that Australians were not highly taxed and that the case for fundamental tax reform was yet to be made. That was after the High Court had wiped $5 billion off the revenue of the states, which amounted to something like 15 to 20 per cent of their revenue. Again, speaking on the Sunday program, Gareth Evans rejected the notion that there was anything wrong with federal-state financial relations. He said: The States can redress that (im)balance in a number of ways, not only through service taxes but through the old chestnut of property or inheritance taxes, through additional surcharges of income tax and, of course, through payroll tax which they've got already. What he is saying is that, although this imbalance between the Commonwealth and the state in what they spend they raise, the solution is not for the Look, Commonwealth to rejig the balance but for away from that. the states to raise more money and to put things like death duties. It is quite clear that there are problems with Commonwealth-state relations. have already stated that it will review whole tax system and that any changes to the tax system will have to meet such criteria leading to improved investment in Australia, enhancing Australian exports and enhancing Australia's jobs. They will also have at the whole issue of Commonwealth-state financial relations and they will examine the issue of a broad based indirect tax. Labor has ruled that out categorically. We do not really know where Labor stand. tion If you look at Labor's record on a consumplarger tion tax they already have form Paul Keating, in 1985, went to his with a consumption tax proposal-option C, Well, the 12Y2 per cent consumption tax-the people in cabinet who supported him then were Hawke, Beazley, Evans and Susan Ryan. They believed in a consumption tax back then but they apparently do not believe in it now, although Gareth has said some interesting things. They believe that all that is needed for the states to put on extra taxes like death duties. The bed tax would be another example of where they would like to see more tax raised by the states rather than looking at whole imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states. Let us look at some of the comments made by Bob Carr and Gareth Evans regarding tax system. On 21 August Bob Carr, on 2GB, said: Look, look. The tax is-leave aside the question of a GST. The tax system is a disaster. I've got these itsy bitsy business taxes as the major source of State Government revenue. And that's hopeless, Jon. It just won't work, and that's got to be addressed in the forthcoming reform of taxes. But two days beforehand the shadow Treasurer had told the Sunday program: Those who say the tax system is broke are really there is being a bit absurdly breathless. A week before that his own leader, who was and what absurdly breathless, had said: there are taxation problems. We don't walk on One week afterwards, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) again said: We have a fairer tax system and a lower tax system The coalition than most countries. the The ALP, at the moment, are all over the place on tax. The ALP, when it comes to the as talk and discussion about a broad based indirect tax, are all over the place. Just after the budget, on 19 May, the shadow Treasurer a look said, regarding a consumption tax: If the business community (and) the welfare community can get together, come up with some proposal that makes some kind of sense on all these fronts, that genuinely meets the concerns that people had about the equity of a tax on consumpor expenditure, and that meets the needs of the economy, then of course we'd have a look on it. When at any such proposal. tax summit One day later he was saying: Simon, let's get it clear. I am not saying for only a moment the GST's a good idea. Bob Carr did the same on the GST. What is clear is that reform of Australia's tax system is necessary. The ALP are all over the place on tax. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have gone down to Curtin is House and dusted off the 1993 campaign manual. They believe that it will be enough just to repeat the tactics of Paul Keating in the 1993 election. As we all know now, Paul the Keating went to that election opposing any new taxes but also offering income tax cuts, the l-a-w tax cuts. History shows that the 1993 budget resulted in massive hikes in the wholesale sales tax on things like wine. It is going to be harder for the Labor Party to repeat that strategy. The charter of budget honesty will mean that opposition and government proposals will have to be carefully costed. It will mean that there will be a clear idea of what the state of the national accounts are during the actual election campaign. Paul Keating prided himself on being the Placido Domingo of Australian politics. I do not believe that Kim Beazley has the same ability to deconstruct an argument. If Paul Keating was the Placido Domingo, Kim Beazley would only be the person collecting the tickets at the back of the hall.  p.m.)-I will not even bother to advert to the comments from the previous speaker, the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott). That was one of the most pathetic attempts I have seen to demean people in this place. It shows just a little bit of grace to refer at least occasionally to persons mentioned by their office rather than their first and other names. The purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill is to provide $16.8 billion funding to the states. It flows on from the recent decision of the High Court in respect of levies imposed by the states. The system of general revenue assistance from federal government to state and territory governments is the underpinning of our federal system. The bill recognises also that Australians have a right across the federation, across the continent, to receive a comparable level of services and bear a comparable level of contributions to state and federal revenues. But a comparable level does not necessarily mean an identical level. The provision of non-repayable grants by the federal government to state and territory governments on a no strings attached basis enables them to use the grant moneys according to their own scale of priorities. In many instances they use these general revenue grants to supplement expenditure from their own SOurces or to supplement other specific purpose or section 96 grants. Road programs are a prime example of this practice: often one will find that local government, local council, state government and federal government funds will all be combined in a particular project-and that is a good process. The allocation of federal grants between state and territory governments, and sometimes local government, has been a source of friction and at times peculiar behaviour on the part of the states. Since 1927 the Commonwealth Grants Commission has had the unenviable task of assessing the level of revenue disability/advantage of individual states and territories, and any service provision advantage and/or natural disability that they may have. The commission has the even more unenviable task of recommending relativities for federal funding between each. A little earlier I was looking at the nice description in the 1997 update to the Commonwealth Grants Commission where it best describes the commission's main role as: ... to advise governments on per capita relativities, the measures of relative need used to distribute among the states and territories the general revenue assistance (financial assistance and unquarantined hospital funding grants) made available by the Commonwealth. The methods of assessment are usually reviewed every five years, and the commission has been asked to report on the next review in February 1999. I am not going to go to the substance of the report in detail but rather will simply define the role of the commission, refer to how there is this problem of sharing revenue capacity across federal, state, territory and local governments and the matching of that with the expectations of levels of services from our communities and fellow Australians right across our nation. This is not an easy task. There are two issues I would like raise in this wide ranging debate about federal-state financial relations. The first issue is that, during Labor's period in office, we worked very hard to convince the states that it was not in the interest of all Australians, or of any governments in Australia, to be using taxpayers' funds, whether sourced from federal or state sources, to buy differences, industries or firms, from one state to another. I refer particularly here to the transport field. There it was common practice that, if one wanted to tender for locomotives or rolling stock to a railway system in a particular state, any tender originating in that state was likely to have a 20 per cent preference; so a tenderer from within the home state for the contract had a 20 per cent start on a tenderer out of state. The reality is that this nation's market is so tiny in to to, in world terms, that we finish up with a series of mickey mouse manufacturers-manufacturers of that kind of heavy capital investment industry-around Australia. This did not just apply to rolling stock; a whole range of state controlled contracts and tenders were involved. Bit by bit, Senator John Button, the minister for industry at that time, managed to persuade the states that Australia's industry would be better overall by doing away with that practice. At the end of the day, those differentials, that additional price that a particular state would pay, had to be borne by the taxpayer, be they state or federal or coming through general revenue grants from federal government. But, one way or another, the taxpayer paid. That practice has gradually crept back in. Again we now see practices coming in where states are offering starts or advantages to firms to tender for state government contracts or territory government contracts within their own boundaries. The second aspect-I know the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) is very much interested in this because he is a man who has a very strong federalist view about industry in this nation, and I commend him for it, and I mean that sincerely, because it is in Australia's interest as we are such a tiny marketis one about which we will hear much weeping at the fountain by the states, as they bemoan the inadequacy of the share of federal, non-repayable, no strings attached grants that they receive. As I said, Solomon is between the covers of this report from the Grants Commission. You need to be Solomon to be on the Grants Commission to try to work out what the genuine relativities are and what the genuine disabilities are, both in revenue gathering and service providing across state and territory governments. But there is a major problem when taxpayers' moneys-as I have said, from whatever source-are used by one state or territory government to buy a firm from another state into their state by the offer of substantial financial inducements. Those inducements take the form of revenues forgone, holidays from state taxes, transfer payments-and, yes, I am looking at the Deputy Speaker. I am speaking as an Australian with a federal view across this nation. There is a cost being borne by taxpayers, state and federal, for those inducements, be they by actual cash payment or handout to a firm, or by revenue forgone by the states. So it is very difficult for the states to stand up straight backed and look us square in the eye at federal level. Who or what colour the government is does not matter. But what does matter is that they stand up straight and argue with a straight face that they are doing everything possible to collect on a fair basis their share of revenue from within their range of revenue capacity. That is a problem that is increasing, as some states have disabilities. Also, it is a problem that is not serving this country well from the national viewpoint. I want to talk a little about a subject that I am deeply concerned about. It is a major flow-on of these practices and a number of other practices between state governments and the federal government. It goes to the core of federal-state relationships. I find it utterly repugnant and obnoxious that the tax burden in this country is being steadily moved across to those people who cannot resist the temptation to bet or to gamble. Those are the people that are the most vulnerable. They are the people that are the most gullible. They are the people likely to be influenced by advertisements several times a day that I see at home on television and I hear on the radio: 'Put a dollar in and get a million.' 'A dollar to play and a million to take away.' We know that is nonsense, but a lot of battling, struggling Australians are gulled by that. When you look at the figures on the growth of gambling in this country, you need to tum to the other side of the coin to see the people who are suffering, the suicides, the family break-ups, the social distress. Social leaders across this nation are appearing on television appealing to us-it is really to each of us they are appealing-and to governments, both federal and state, to have regard to the damage that is being done to our social fabric. I am not a prude, but as far as I am concerned this is a core issue in our society. We are now at the stage where gambling and the expansion of gambling facilities are seen as being the growth industry of the nation. Victoria prides itself on how fast it can fools from their money. Anybody who goes into a gambling establishment in the belief that they can come out with more than they went in with has to be a fool, regardless of whether they have a lot of money or little money. When you add to that mix alcohol and automatic telling machines, they are an even greater fool. Spare a thought and some sympathy for the family of that person, for the parents and the dependents of that person. There is no greater judge of one's own ability than a person halfcharged. They hop in their cars and know that they are the best driver on the road. They knock themselves off accordingly and often other innocent parties. The same thing applies to human reasoning when alcohol is imbibed. In Victoria I see the prominence being given to the promotion of gambling. I see stories in the financial columns of the yields you can get from investing in gambling companies and the need to get in on these casinos. As I said, all of those businesses based upon parting people from their money with no service or product provided-at enormous human cost. Currently, 14.2 per cent of the revenue of the state of New South Wales comes from gambling. The same figure-and it is growing-comes from gambling in Victoria. The 1995-96 Australian gambling statistics of the Tasmanian Gaming Commission-which is the best source of data for comparisons that I have seen, although it is not the latestshow that Australians gambled $72,871 million. That is an increase of $11,605 million in the previous financial year. To use the parlance, you can bet your bottom dollar that in the year just concluded, 1996-97, it has risen by at least that amount again. That is because the effort to induce or convince people they should gamble is even greater still in the year just concluded than it was in the previous year. That figure is equivalent on average to $200 million being gambled each and every day of the year. In the course of one hour of this House sitting, $8.319 million will have been gambled somewhere some place in this part nation-$8.319 million. As the seconds tick by on the time clock, so the dollars tick by for the families that are providing that money. Much of the growth is the result of heavy promotion of gambling by state government agencies. Those massive losses being incurred by Australians are losses being incurred by Australian families, by kids and by mothers. They are often linked with alcohol. I have seen some campaigns attacking young people. It ain't young people that are mounting these campaigns; it is young people they are targeted at. If young people fall victim and they follow those as on television-if they are over 18, they get inside the gambling establishment and get a few into themselves; if they have a few dollars in the ATM, they withdraw it and have a go on the table or in the machine-they are denigrated as hopeless idiots. They are the failed youth of the day. But they are not making the decisions. The people making the decisions are the grey and blue pinstriped people that lead the financial world of this country. If you are follow the stock exchange news, you will see the names of the people that promote these establishments and encourage people to invest in them. Total household disposable income in Australia for 1995-96 was $311.5 billion. Almost one quarter of that-23.4 per centwas gambled. In that year every person across this nation lost an average of $709, or the equivalent of $13.60 per week. It was more for the year just concluded. In New South Wales, the loss per person was $817 per year, or $15.70 per week. I do not have the time to go through the figures state by state, but they are available for per capita losses and per capita turnover. The figures are unbelievable. The government take on gambling nationwide was $3,235 billion. In New South Wales, the take was $1,188 billion. As we stand here tonight and debate, at the federal level in the national parliament, the adequacies and inadequacies of federal-state relationships, what is going deliberately and knowingly is a transference of much of the tax burden onto the people who are least able to afford and least able to resist this enormous coordinated and targeted campaign to encourage them to gamble away their savings and starve and deny their children and their families. I am not be in g melodramatic about it. I am not exaggerating. We know that it is true. We have seen it as we meet with our constituents. I am sure each one of us in this place knows of somebody who has suicided as a result of gambling. But we wax rhetorical about all sorts of other issues in this hard financial debate about federal-state financial relationships. I want to impress on members on both sides of the House that there are more important priorities-family support and family performance-than some of the issues talked about in this place on some days. There can be no more important issue than the campaign to stealthily and carefully move the taxation burden onto families via an increase in gambling. Let us look at the gambling turnover for Tasmania to get some grasp of this. In 197273, $70.38 million was gambled. In 1995-96, $1,312.79 million was gambled. In the ACT in 1972-73, $21.9 million was gambled; in 1995-96, $1,489 million. The figures show in stark black and white the enormous growth in gambling. The actual loss-as opposed to the turnover-in Tasmania for 1972-73 was $6.5 million; for 1995-96, $148 million. For New South Wales, it was $289 million in 1972-73; for 1995-96, $3,757.136 million. In concluding my contribution to this debate, I want to draw it to the attention of members and the government that, in any taxation discussion and in any system and arrangement in respect of federal-state financial relations, priority attention needs to be given to the role of gambling. There must be a stop to the promotion of gambling by government agencies. This parliament is party to it. The more we starve states of money, the more they tum to other sources. The soft, stealthy and easy way is to put somebody inside a gambling establishment, put a glass of beer in their hand, put an automatic teller on machine beside them and have them near the keno or poker machines. The two enormous losing areas for families and for Australians are poker machines and the TAB. If one thing can come out of this discussion on federal-state financial relations, it is that attention must be given to calling a halt to this growth in gambling and the shifting of the tax burden from legitimate sources to families through gambling.",76
157,Mr MILES,CONDOLENCES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (8.50 p.m.)-in reply-I want to make a few comments after listening to the honourable  spoke about gambling. I think a lot of us in this House would share his concern about the seemingly growing dependence on gambling for state revenues. I think a large number of us are concerned also about the social fallout that sometimes occurs in association with gambling in this country. I thank the honourable member for his thoughtful comments in this regard. It is not the main substance of this states grants legislation and what other speakers have spoken about, but obviously it is pertinent to this debate. I want to make a few remarks in response to comments made by speakers. In regard to state fiscal contributions, I make the general comment that it was the states who agreed to make the fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth for three years to assist the national savings task. It was not something which was foisted on them. It was an agreement between the states and the Commonwealth to undertake this task for the purpose of national savings. The Commonwealth also agreed to maintain real per capita growth in financial assistance grants. I underline that because some speakers have indicated that that may not have been the case. The need for state fiscal contributions in 1998-99 also will be reviewed at the 1998 Premiers Conference in the light of developments in the Commonwealth's fiscal position. Also, as noted by my colleague, the Commonwealth and states agreed to a deferral of half of the 1997-98 fiscal contributions of Tasmania and the ACT until 1988-99 in the light of their difficult economic circumstances. I want to make two comments about vertical fiscal imbalance. Firstly, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations must be addressed in the work of the taxation task force and the government's consideration of tax reform. Secondly, the Prime Minister has indicated that a special Premiers Conference will be convened to seek the views of the states on these matters. The opposition spokesman, the Hon. Gareth Evans, asked for some assurances in regard to a number of matters, and I just want to address some of those in the debate in the House. First of all, in regard to distribution revenues among the states, state shares of revenue to replace payments were agreed among the states and advised to the Commonwealth. They were a state decision. The shares are based on Commonwealth Grants Commission estimates for 1996-97 on a business franchise fee revenue basis. The distribution will result in some states receiving more revenue than they previously raised under their business franchise fees, due to the constitutional constraint requiring the Commonwealth to apply taxes uniformly across the states, and the wish that no state be worse off as a result of the High Court decision. However, excess revenues are to be refunded to manufacturers and wholesalers in order to avoid, as far as possible, price increases for consumers and petroleum users. The second area which the honourable member referred to was in regard to no extra taxes. The states acknowledge that this will represent a state tax imposed and collected by the Commonwealth at the request of and on behalf of the states. All revenue collected by the Commonwealth under these arrangements will be returned to the states, after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs. The Commonwealth is not increasing its revenue-and I want to stress that: there is no increase in revenue by the Commonwealth in this matter. The safety net arrangements are intended to be temporary and will be reviewed within six months. Regulations may be necessary under the act to ensure that any further variations in surcharges are reflected in revenue replacement payments to the states. However, given the expected duration of the arrangements, any such variations are likely to be minor and technical. If a state wished to increase its revenue from this source, it would be a longer term issue, outside the scope of the arrangements as currently framed, and a matter for consideration if and when it occurred. The opposition spokesman also raised the matter of equitable impact on businesses affected. As these are effectively state taxes, the impact on individual businesses and classes of businesses is largely a matter for the states. For the Commonwealth's part, of however, it would wish to see the arrangements operate as smoothly and equitably as possible. I thank the members who have participated in this debate and I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Messages from the Governor General recommending appropriation for the bill and proposed amendments announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",81

As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 6 August, the Commonwealth has agreed to introduce safety net measures to protect state and territory revenues, following the High Court decision of 5 August which cast serious doubt on the constitutional validity of state business franchise fees. The High Court decision affects annual state revenues of around $5 billion and leaves the states open to refund claims amounting to many billions of dollars in respect of past business franchise fee payments. The Commonwealth will use its tax powers to collect the revenues that the states and territories previously collected by way of business franchise fees on petroleum products, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. The states and territories acknowledge that this will represent a state tax imposed and collected by the Commonwealth at their request and on their behalf. The safety net arrangements are intended to be temporary and will be reviewed within six months. The proposed amendments provide authority for the Commonwealth to pay the states and territories a revenue it collects under safety net arrangements. It is intended that revenue replacement payments, expected to exceed $5 billion in 1997-98, be made together with the Commonwealth's weekly payments of general revenue assistance. Some states will receive more revenue than they previously raised under their business franchise fees. This is necessary if no state or territory is to be worse off as a result of the High Court decision, since the Australian constitution requires that the Commonwealth apply taxes uniformly across the states, whereas states' business franchise fees vary in their rates and coverage. However, the states and territories have indicated that these excess revenues will be refunded to manufacturers or wholesalers in order to avoid, as far as possible, price increases for consumers and petroleum users. To ensure the safety net arrangements operate as intended, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is monitoring price movements of affected products. The amendments also include a provision which returns to the states any tax revenues the Commonwealth might receive under the franchise fees windfall tax collection arrangements of 1997. This will ensure that state finances are protected from claims for refunds on the grounds of constitutional invalidity of past payments of business franchise fees. The safety net arrangements are revenue neutral for the Commonwealth. The payments made under these amendments will simply return to the states amounts raised by the Commonwealth on their behalf, after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs. It is vital to the integrity of state and territory finances that legislation to give effect to the safety net arrangements be enacted without delay. Accordingly, the government will be giving this bill and the associated revenue bills the highest priority. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum for the additional amendments to the bill and I commend the bill to the House.",82
159,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CONDOLENCES,"As is increasingly the practice in this House, the government has circulated a series of very complex amendments to the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997. Those amendments virtually double the length of the original bill. Having said that, on this occasion the opposition is not going to criticise that practice and will, indeed, acknowledge the fact that we received an advance copy of the amendments this afternoon. We appreciate the government's cooperative attitude. As has been indicated previously, this series of amendments is necessitated in the aftermath of the recent High Court decisions in the Ha and Lim and Walter Hammond cases. Part of the temporary response to those decisions was for the states and the territories to request that the Commonwealth increase their existing tax bases-both wholesale sales tax and excise-to replace the revenue which had been collected under the state and territory business franchise fees. Those requests were duly made and, as many will be aware, on 6 August the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products of 8.1 c per litre, customs and excise duties on tobacco of $167 per kilogram and increases in the wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages of 15 per cent. In addition, the intention to impose a windfall gains tax on refunds of business franchise fees arising because of the High Court decision was also announced. As well as collecting the revenue on behalf of the other governments, the Commonwealth also has to ensure that the disbursement of these funds is equitable so that consumers and governments do not lose out. We all know that the government mucked up this issue. It had not properly planned for the contingency of the High Court decision, even though its potential impact was widely known. The issue did not even come out of the blue. Indeed, the issue had been looked at by the former government back in 1993, which demonstrates that a fully thought through and agreed plan should have been developed prior to the High Court decision being handed down. Even after the agreement with the other governments was supposedly finalised, we still had chaos reigning, especially in the liquor and tobacco industries. I regret to say that this poor management of issues and dayto-day floundering reflects a government which tends to engage in knee-jerk reactions rather than forward planning. Despite this poor management by the Treasurer, the opposition does not wish to cause any parliamentary difficulties with the passage of this legislation. Consistent with our practice to date, we will be supporting this important legislation and all the government amendments which have been moved this evening. The shadow Treasurer, in his contribution on the second reading debate, sought assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) that four conditions-which we regard as essential in supporting this package and the relating revenue package-have been met. In his summing up on the second reading debate, the parliamentary secretary did respond to that request for assurances. I want to reiterate from the opposition's point of view the importance that the revenue and grants packages have the support and agreement of the states and territories, that revenue is fairly distributed to the states and territories, that extra taxes not be imposed on Australians and that they are equitable in their impact on the businesses which are immediately affected. In the particular context of this bill, I further seek the assurance of the parliamentary secretary that the various petroleum, tobacco and alcohol shares contained within the amendments have all been agreed to by the relevant jurisdictions. We are also interested in knowing whether the revenue shares used in the calculation of the revenue replacement payments will remain constant or whether they will be altered each year. To conclude, I hope that the parliamentary secretary will be able to respond to this questions. I close by re-emphasising that the opposition will not be opposing these amendments.",86
160,Mr MILES,CONDOLENCES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.04 p.m.)-Very briefly, we have said that increases in prices and revenue collecting should be revenue neutral. We are very clear on that. I think the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has been out in the public on a number of occasions stressing that this is not about increasing taxes. There is no attempt to do that. It is a matter of trying to assist the who have lost a revenue base. Very clearly, we have indicated that revenues collected should be refunded to those wholesalers and people involved to make sure that there are not price increases and that people are dealt with fairly right across the country. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Miles)-by leaveread a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.",87
161,Mr MCMULLAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Canberra) (9.06 p.m.)In speaking on behalf of the opposition on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997, I want to begin by making our unequivocal opposition to the proposals contained within this bill very clear. This bill will take away rights from Australians. It will take them away selectively and, in so doing, it will expose Australian workers to harsh, unfair and unreasonable dismissal without a right of appeal, which in itself is not only on its face evidently unfair but it is also a blatant breach of an election promise. In commencing discussion on this bill, I would like to first note the fact that anybody who has been involved in public life in Australia must know that there has been a considerable degree of misinformation and myth-making around the issue of unfair dismissal laws. Nobody could deny that there was substantial concern expressed by the business community about unfair dismissal laws during 1995. I think history will suggest that much of the hysteria surrounding the unfair dismissal laws was the product of a political scare campaign run by the coalition in opposition. What we have here today is an attempt to recreate what was considered to be a successful political states strategy in 1995. It is a habit of not only people in politics but people in all walks of life to seek to recreate their past successes. This was a stunt that worked in 1995-the coalition said, 'Things are not going too well, let's try it again.' But let us, on this occasion, try to put some perspective, maybe even some facts, into the debate. Mr Abbott-That would be very unusual.",88
162,Mr MCMULLAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"it would be in this debate. Nobody has tried it on your side, I have to say. The starting point is to understand and appreciate the nature of the protection unfair dismissal laws provide and the importance of that protection. Let me make it very clear that this is the core of this matter that is before us this evening. The unfair dismissal laws, as they presently stand-and this is this government's legislation, the legislation they drafted-provide that employees cannot be terminated in circumstances that are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. These are clear, unambiguous words that have an accepted meaning within the community and that the community can readily identify with. What we have in this legislation we are debating tonight is a conscious decision by the government to remove this protection from a very large subgroup of Australian workers-that is, all those people who are employees of companies with 15 or fewer employees who commence work after the passage of this legislation. That means those people-and that will be a growing number of people-who are employees and whose dismissal is demonstrably harsh, unjust or unreasonable will have no remedy, no right of appeal. Today if that happens to you, you have a right of appeal. If this bill passes that right will be taken away-you will not be protected against a harsh dismissal, you will not be protected against an unjust dismissal and you will not be protected against an unreasonable decision. What an achievement by the government! What they will have achieved is to take away the rights from what will become hundreds of thousands of Australians who will lose their rights under this legislation, and for nothing. The government admitted that this was the case-not with any enthusiasm, they did not actually volunteer it, but the officials of the Department of Industrial Relations on 5 June responded to estimates committee questions from Senator Collins as follows: . . . does the department accept that if the proposed small business exemption regulation presently tabled in the Senate becomes law then some employees presently able to seek relief against harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination will no longer be able to do so? Answer, 'Yes.' Next question: Does the department accept that if the small business exemption is made applicable to all employees in small business then many more employees presently able to seek relief against harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination will no longer be able to do so? Answer, 'Yes.' This fundamental removal of the right of appeal, which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) promised would be provided at the election campaign, is fundamentally important for two reasons I want to make tonight and, if I have time, I will demonstrate how it goes to some very profound social consequences to which I wish to refer. The first of these reasons to which I wish to refer, because it is often fudged, is that no other law protects employees from being dismissed in circumstances that are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. The minister, when questioned, always says, 'But they have the protection of the anti-discrimination provisions.' That is true, that is welcomed, but it is not enough. If this legislation passes, the affected employees will have no other protection against harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. That would be important in any circumstances, but it is fundamentally important in Australia in 1997 when the prevailing issue in Australian workplaces is job security. If you go to Australian workplaces-and you do not go there to just talk to the management, walk around, wave and leave; you actually sit down and listen to the workers in those workplaces and give them a chance to overcome their surprise that someone is listening to them instead of talking at them-very soon the issue of job security comes to the fore. First and foremost the prevailing issue in Australian workplaces is job security. Mr Charles-What do the unemployed say about their job security?",88
163,Mr MCMULLAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"We will come to the consequences of this bogus argument that this will create jobs in just one moment, and I look forward to the opportunity. But let us say first of all that what will not help job security is legislation which says that it is now easier to sack you than it was and that you have no redress if it happens. No Australian can be more secure in their employment as a consequence of that; all they can be is more insecure. It is another one of those circumstances that recurs in every piece of industrial relations legislation we get from this government: some people lose their rights, nobody gains. Nobody gains one right or potential benefit out of this. All you have is people losing their rights. We do have attempts to explain that other laws might provide protection against dismissal. The anti-discrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, which are important, are very narrow. They are confined to circumstances in which the dismissal was motivated by discrimination and like proceedings. It will not deal with harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. For example, if a woman were to be dismissed simply because she was a woman she would be protected. If she were dismissed because she rejected the sexual advances of the employer she would not be protected. That would be harsh, unjust and unreasonable but, if it happens in a small business, too bad. You have no recourse at all. There are notice provisions in the Workplace Relations Act that say employees cannot be dismissed without a maximum of four weeks notice, but that is all those provisions do. Employees can be dismissed for the worse of reasons, for the most harsh and unreasonable of reasons, but if they are given four weeks notice that is okay. There is, I suppose, ultimately the protection of the common law of contract but if we thought that was a fair and reasonable position we would not have unfair dismissal laws in the first place. To require employees to use the common law courts for redress against dismissal is sending them back to the 19th century. This is not some sort of mere technical debate. We are not talking about here, as we will be with some other pieces of legislation relating to the Workplace Relations Act later in the session, some important but fairly dry and mundane technicalities about the nature of the legal framework within which industrial relations is conducted. Those matters are important but they interest only a small range of people with a specialist interest. Here we have something that goes to the very core of the lives of thousands of Australians and the households that depend on them: the nature of the security that people have at their work, their capacity to have, retain, enjoy and participate in their job in fair and reasonable circumstances, which not only affects their situation at work but affects their situation at home and in every other element of their participation in our society. People are losing these rights-rights which Australians have come to expect not for very long at the federal level. I think even this government promised and felt they were rights employees should have. If people change employment after this legislation is passed and work for a small employer, they will have no redress against harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal. Let us look at some of the circumstances that we have highlighted, where employees who currently have protection would lose it in the most unreasonable of circumstances, in the case studies that we have outlined to this parliament in the past. These examples vividly demonstrate just how important the unfair dismissal laws are in protecting employees from dismissal in offensive circumstances. We had the case of the employee dismissed because she refused to assist her boss in ripping off the tax system. We had the employee dismissed because he refused to sack a pregnant subordinate. We had the employee dismissed because of an unsubstantiated allegation to which he had no chance to respond. We had the employee dismissed after his wife told the boss he had cancer. We had the employee dismissed for refusing to certify as roadworthy the car of a boss's mate. He refused to break the law and he was sacked. Under this law, it is, 'Bye-bye. Bad luck. You had better pass the car and put the unroadworthy vehicle on the road because otherwise you will be down the road.' That is what this bill means. Let us look at some of the comments made by Margaret MCHugh, whose son was able to use the unfair dismissal laws to force a settlement from a boss who had done nothing to prevent him being abused and victimised at work. These were the comments she made about the importance of the unfair dismissal laws to her, her family and her son. I will not quote them all because they are quite lengthy, but she made two important points that I think the House should listen to. She said: To take away a person's right to access the Industrial Relations Commission is totally unfair ... To change this legislation to not allow (employees) to access the Industrial Relations Commission when they've had their dignity removed completely is just so unfair. Then she went on: It's affecting a group of people that don't have the money to go to lawyers and sue their employers civilly. It's not even something they'd want to do ... They just want acknowledgment that (their dismissal) was wrong ... At least with the Industrial Relations Commission we could access that ourselves. We didn't have to wait for someone to do it for us. This is the final point she made, and it is very powerful: We had a right to just go there and say this has happened, and leave it up to the conciliation meeting to decide whether we were right or wrong. This is the simple, basic right that the government wants to take away from thousands of Australians. Why? What a strange objective for a government to have. They have a strange ambition to say, 'When our bill has its full consequence, we will have succeeded in taking away the rights of hundreds of thousands of Australians' - not just a few. This is no modest government. They will have damaged the rights and entitlements of Australians wherever they live. These changes are egalitarian. It does not matter where people live, they will lose their rights if they change their employment and begin to work for an employer with fewer than 15 employees. In some industries that is every employer; it does not matter where people go. That I think is the most fundamental argument against this proposed exemption. But let us think about the circumstances and broaden the basis of this concern. The government has trumpeted politically that the unfair dismissal provisions-what they call Laurie Brereton's laws--discouraged employers from employing people. I want to come to some evidence, if I have time, to challenge that, or certainly the extent of it. But, even if it were true, let us face the fact: those laws do not exist any more. The government has already changed those laws. The Prime Minister said they had wiped them away, they had created a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair deal all round. If the government has created a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair deal all round, why is it taking that simpler, fairer deal away from some people? This is called a fair deal halfway round, a fair deal for some but no deal for others. This proposal creates an exemption to the government's own law. It has nothing to do with replacing Labor's unfair dismissal laws. That has already been done. Let us have a look at a second aspect of the process that makes it quite clear this is a political stunt-a measure designed to give the government an excuse for not solving unemployment, not a measure to actually enhance anybody's rights, entitlements or life opportunity. This emerged in the government's response to the Bell report, which did not recommend an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal law. It proposed a review of the laws after 12 months. Mr Martin-Recommendation 13.",89
164,Mr MCMULLAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Recommendation 13 is one that the opposition supported. But the government chose to ignore it and did not bother to have a review after 12 months. They preferred to abolish the operation of their laws for some Australians straight away, after five months. It is blatantly in breach of the government's pre-election guarantees. What did they say before the election? The Minister for Workplace Relations was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 February as saying that the redrafted system would not contain any exemptions. Silly me; I believed that I thought that meant there would not be any exemptions. But then on 28 February he was quoted as saying: Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. That is exactly what this debate is about. If that is true, you should withdraw this bill. The now Prime Minister, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, said to John Laws-and he must have meant it if he said it on the John Laws program: I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard working employee. He said to Keith Conlon: I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed. There is lots more. Let me just give you one more, but I could give you even more. In his headland speech No.2, so of course we have to take that pretty seriously, he said: Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals. Until today I never understood how you could say all those things and then introduce this bill. But now I understand. Somewhere in one of those quotes he used this magic phrase: he must have said 'never ever'. We now know that that is Liberal Party code for 'as soon as I get a chance'. He said, 'I will never ever introduce a GST.' Mr Martin-He didn't say that, did he?",91
165,Mr MCMULLAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"He did. He said, 'Never ever.' Mr Martin-No, that's not what he said today!",91
166,Mr MCMULLAN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"As Leader of the Opposition he said, 'We will never ever introduce a GST.' And now we find that he is going to do it as soon as he can. So I guess somewhere, if you read all the transcripts, you will find that they used the code word. They said, 'Never ever will we introduce an exemption to unfair dismissals.' That meant, 'Just give us a chance and we'll be in their taking your rights away from you.' It is as blatant a breach of a promise as any, and any worker would have been entitled to think that this might have been a core promise. The exemption is also fundamentally discriminatory. It is unfair to employees and to decent employers. It discriminates between employees of small business and employees of big business. It creates two classes of employees in Australia. It discriminates between apprentices and other new entrants to the work force, including trainees. I welcome the fact that the proposal does not preclude apprentices from the unfair dismissal laws. Apprentices who work for small businesses will not be exempt. Why? I am pleased about it because I do not think anybody should be exempt. But, if this is a reasonable proposition, why shouldn't it apply to everybody? Simply because it is just too patently outrageous to allow it to apply to apprentices. I hope nobody will notice, if you employ an apprentice, a trainee and another young worker on the same day, that one of them will have appeal rights and the other two will not. If you sack them all for the same reason, one will have the right of appeal and the other two will not. What is the justification for that? It discriminates between workers who continue a job after a law commences and those who start a new job-two workers stand next to each other, do the same thing, get dismissed for the same reason and one has a right of appeal and one does not. It does not discriminate between cases on the basis of their merit but on the basis of the coincidence of the workers' employment contracts. It is also important to note that this is a proposal that is fundamentally unfair to decent employers. Decent employers who do the right thing by their employees will have to compete with the shonky operators who misuse and abuse the new exemption they will have. There is a very real danger that this sort of competition will force decent employers to lower their standards just to survive. This lowering of standards will occur at the expense of the rights of even more employees. Why does the government believe this exemption is necessary? It wants to divert attention from its failure in unemployment. It wants to pretend that this will do something about creating jobs. Let us look at the facts. If the previous unfair dismissal laws had been having such a profound negative effect on employment, you would think that when they were swept away employment would have leapt, improved dramatically. There is one state where you can look at the situation quite clearly, because in Victoria there are no complications of conflicting state legislation; it is all the Commonwealth's law applying from 1 January. What we find is that since 1 January, since the unfair dismissal laws changed, employment has fallen in Victoria. It was growing faster before the laws changed than after. In February, March and April of 1997, as this act started to take effect, the number of jobs was falling; yet in October, November and December, under the old laws, the number was increasing. I do not pretend it is cause and effect, but let us get rid of the rubbish that there was a suppressed enthusiasm to employ that only needed the unfair dismissal laws to be swept away. The facts do not support it. So where in the research evidence is there something that says that employers are just waiting for this next round of exemptions from unfair dismissal laws, that there is a latent enthusiasm to employ, notwithstanding that every survey says they think the economy is as flat as a tack and they want the government to do something about that, which they will not do? The Department of Industrial Relations very loyally have been trying very hard to find some evidence to support the government's position. They are a very good department trying very hard to justify the unjustifiable. They have harked back to the three Yellow Pages surveys, which up until February showed that five per cent of small businesses are concerned about industrial laws but 84 per cent are concerned that lack of government action has failed to get the economy moving. But they could not possibly know that today we were going to get this report that said, 'What are the priorities for small business in Australia? Unfair dismissal laws, three per cent.' Three per cent said it was the most urgent priority, whereas they all thought the government ought to be out there trying to get the economy growing. The other surveys that people rely on are Recruitment Solutions and more recently Morgan and Banks. Let me refer to each of them, if I have time. Recruitment Solutions said that 90 per cent of employers were not affected in their employment decisions by the existence of unfair dismissal laws, and Morgan and Banks said that at least 80 per cent of small businesses did not believe the existence of the unfair dismissal law adversely affected their decisions to employ new staff. Those figures are very high-80 per cent, 90 per cent-but they are under the previous government's laws. Those were surveys conducted during 1996, so surely it must be better now. This government swept those laws away. It has got to be more than 80 per cent, it has got to be more than 90 per cent of small businesses which are not affected. It must be nearly 100. Perhaps, the Yellow Pages suggests, it might be 97. But certainly this is not what is stopping small business from employing people-it is the fact that there is no demand for the products they want to sell because the economy is as flat as a tack. So it is no wonder that the minister on the ABC the other day said that he has been doing his own surveys. We tried to find out where they were. We asked the department. The department did not know. I think that means he was in the cabinet room or maybe the party room. He was not talking to anyone who employs more than a few electorate staff. They may all have agreed with him, but none of the published surveys do. Small business has moved on. They want the economy moving. They want some economic growth and then they will increase employment. This is not the solution they are looking for. Let us go back to the ultimate arguments about this particular matter. Let us have a look at what the arguments against this are, in summary. The evidence so far is that changing the unfair dismissal laws has not improved employment. Secondly, the proposed exemption is just so blatantly inconsistent with the government's pre-election guarantees. Thirdly, the proposal will only add to the prevailing sense of job insecurity. Fourthly, the proposal does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of the merits of the case merely on the coincidence of your employment contract. Fifthly, the proposal is fundamentally unfair to employees. Sixthly, it is fundamentally unfair to decent employers. In those circumstances, what does this bill have going for it? Australians today have what the Prime Minister promised them: if they are subject to harsh, unjust or unreasonable dismissal they have a right of appeal. That is what they were promised and that is what they have got. What this bill will achieve, if it is passed, if it is successful, is to say, 'Those rights you had you do not have any more. You will not have the right of appeal if you are subject to harsh, unreasonable or unjust dismissal.' What a claim, what an achievement, what a thing to be proud of. That is why we are opposed to this bill, that is why we will vote against it here, that is why we will vote against it in the Senate and that is why we will keep voting against it if it comes back on any future occasion.",91
167,Mr CHARLES,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I rise to support the government's Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997. While the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) scurries off, I will have a few things to say about his remarks shortly if he would care to wait and hear part of the truth. No, he is not interested. I was afraid of that. He does not want to know what the real issue is, does he? Let me tell you that the member for. Canberra, the shadow minister for industrial relations, talked to us about Brereton's unfair dismissal laws, and what we heard tonight was MCMullan's nonsense. This is a bill about employment. It is not a bill about unemployment; it is a bill about employment. The member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), in an interjection during the last speech, hollered across the chamber at me, 'What about employment?' This bill is all about employment. That is what it is about. Do you know why? I will tell you why. It is because of the legislation that Laurie Brereton set in place-and heaven only knows why he did. The states' unfair dismissal laws that had in place worked very well in making sure that employees who had a right to protest about an unfair dismissal action were able to take that protest forward and have it heard in a calm, generally non-charged atmosphere with very little expense and without creating a culture where everyone who was dismissed thought they were unfairly dismissed. What Laurie Brereton's legislation did was to ensconce in federal legislation this nonsense that if you were dismissed it was bound to be because it was unfair and that no-one was ever fairly dismissed. The cases of just about everyone who was dismissed for any reason whatsoever-because they were incompetent, because they did not come to work, because they were off constantly, because the work they did was of poor quality, because it was unacceptable, because they stole from the till, because they hit another employee, because they sexually harassed another employee or because they verbally abused another employee with racial intent-went not to some minor jurisdiction where those cases could be heard and arbitrated or conciliated but to the industrial relations court, a new court that Laurie Brereton set up because he decided we needed a new court too. When Laurie Brereton decided we needed a new court, what he did, bless his heart, was to set up a culture around Australia where, if you were dismissed, you were dismissed unfairly and you could take the boss to the court and you would always win. Why would you always win? Because never did anyone find that the boss dismissed you fairly. I remember a brilliant case in my electorate. There was a medium sized employer who decided to add to the management staff. They hired a young lady out of university and they put her on the staff and they were going to train her towards a management position. It turned out that she was not very good. When she was on the switchboard taking telephone calls, she managed to get the number wrong most of the time. So you would go to ring the client back, and it was a wrong number, and the person on the other end of the line did not know why you had rung them. If she took they down an order, instead of 25 pot plants, she would write down 250, and the client would send back 225. If she sent out an invoice for $50, it wound up being $500 or $5,000 or $5. She was constantly making mistakes. Every time, the boss would go and talk to her and try to counsel her and say, 'Please, you have got to try to be a bit more attentive to the job and be a bit more accurate.' I have to say that I understand that her father was a union official with Telecom. Her response to her employer was, 'Sack me. Go on. Sack me.' That was all she was waiting for: to get the sack, so that she could get her bundle of money and run. She did not want the job. All she wanted was to get the sack. I remember another case. There was a carpet layer down at Berwick. He had a little business-it was himself and a Girl Friday. That is probably politically incorrect, but that is what he had. And his lady had a better job opportunity. So she took it, and he said, 'Good luck to you. Would you mind finding me someone to replace you?' So she put an ad in the paper and she put someone on. The appointed morning came, and the carpet layer was sitting discussing carpet colour selection with a client. His subcontractors laid the carpets, so there were just two of them. The lady came in, and he said, 'I am busy with a client. Would you mind making us a cup of coffee?' 'I don't make coffee,' she said. 'All right,' he said, 'there is a vacuum cleaner over there in the cupboard. Would you mind cleaning up?' 'I don't hoover,' she said. By about 2 o'clock they both agreed that it was not a match and that the job was not on. They agreed that she would depart. On her way out she said, 'Please, would you mind giving me the sack, because I might not find another job and, if I don't get another job, I'll need the dole.' Reluctantly he said yes. Two weeks later he had an unfair dismissal case on his hands. We created a culture where you could not be dismissed for any reason whatsoever without collecting money from the boss. I can tell the member for Canberra, who has gone, that I have talked to small business after small business in my electorate of La Trobemaybe as many as 50 or 60 of them. They tell me over and over again that they are frightened to death to hire, either because of what it has cost them in the past or because of what it may cost them in the future if they make a mistake. That is what they are frightened ofmaking a mistake. And if you think it is just the $15,000 or $20,000 that is deterring the small business people from hiring, you are wrong. It is more than that. It is the time away from business. It is the agony of dealing with solicitors and barristers, of going up in front of a judicial system in order to prove a case, of the hours of research and work at night to try to prove the case and justify it. We all know that some of the cases are absolutely ridiculous---cases where employees have had their fingers in the till and have done absolutely the wrong thing but where a minor point of procedure has been wrong. And you say, 'You have changed the rules, coalition. The Howard government has changed the rules', and that is true. But if you think that every small business in Australia understands that and knows about the changes in those rules-each of the 800,000 small businesses who are out there busting their backsides trying to survive in a difficult climate for them-let me tell you, you are wrong. You are mistaken. They do not know. That sense of culture, unfortunately, still lives on. with us. There has been a change since the new rules came into place, and my latest advice is that unfair dismissals, altogether-including both those filed in the Commonwealth jurisdictions and those filed in the state jurisdictions-are down 24 per cent on the corresponding period before the legislation came into place. That has been fairly consistent now since about April of this year. They are down about 24 per cent, and those have calmed down a lot. But if you think employers do not still have this view that they will not hire because of unfair dismissal legislation, you are wrong. On 18 June 1997 a small business coalition, which represents a lot of small businesses, met in Canberra. There were 40 representatives of organisations with small business members. They put out a press release on 19 June. Amongst other things, they said that, on the issue of negative perceptions surrounding unfair dismissals, the small business coalition resolved to urge the opposition and the Democrats to support the action proposed by the government on unfair dismissals as it relates to small business, as a symbol to jump-start employment. They further asked the opposition and the Democrats to review their position on the matter. They did not review it, because they stand implacably opposed to a measure which will help to encourage small business to take on and employ new people. I noticed in the contribution of the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) that he talked about people losing their rights for nothing. I think that is absolutely wrong. Small employers, whose businesses are constantly at risk, are doing it tough at the moment-and I acknowledge the fact that they are doing it tough. It is not easy out there, whether you are in manufacturing, retailing or the service industry-it does not matter. They all have to fight hard for every dollar and every bit of expansion. And you say they are going to lose their rights for nothing. That is not right. We have an employment problem and I want to do everything possible to encourage employment. I want those people to put more people I visited a manufacturer only last Friday in my electorate, in the suburb of Bayswater. He said, 'Bob, I will put on three employees tomorrow if you can tell me that, if I hire the wrong person, I can let them go without it costing me an arm and a leg and having to go off to the court.' I said, 'Here is a package of material about the new unfair dismissal laws-a fair go all round. As long as you follow reasonable procedures on matters of competence, whether you are doing the job right, whether you are trying-those sorts of things-you should be right.' The new legislation requires the commission-no court anymore-to take into account the issues on both sides of the equation: whether the employee has genuinely tried to do the right thing and whether the employer has been fair in dealing with the employee. But that particular employer's perception is that, with anyone he puts on, he is likely to end up with unfair dismissal procedures if he makes a mistake. I have encouraged him to put those three people on, and I have encouraged other employers in my electorate who tell me-over and over again-the same thing: we will employ more if you can fix the rules. Businesses with 15 or fewer employees small businesses. The people who run those businesses are totally involved all the time in running their businesses; they are trying to orders and many of them are now trying to export. In a tour around manufacturing in my electorate-in general manufacturing, in the TCF industry, in electronics-almost all of my small manufacturers are doing reasonably well: their turnover and their exports are up. And they need more employees. Their profit is not up because they are squeezed at both ends. It is hard, but they are working hard to make better quality goods, to provide better service, to improve their market position and to improve the position of Australia and help improve our balance of payments. Nobody is protecting them against anything, but if we think that we can live behind a of protection in the next decade and that we can survive the world's competition, we wrong. The member for Canberra says that must protect the right of an employee once was a problemthey have a job to stay in that job forever, versus the right of those who are unemployed anybody. to have a job. I will come down every time in favour of the one who does not have a job; to have a chance to get a job that they want and that they are willing to work hard to keep. In the strongest possible terms, I support this legislation and I condemn the opposiCommission-it tion-the Labor Party and the DemocratsFamily who, once again, are going to vote against employment generating bills in this House and in the Senate.",93
168,Mr MARTIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Cunningham) (9.49 p.m.)It is a pleasure to speak in the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill tonight. In my role as the shadow minister for small business, I have to say to my good friend and colleague, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), that I, like he, have been doing a lot of travelling around-not only in my electorate but around Australia-talking to small businesses, and I have been trying to get a handle on the sorts of issues which are of concern to them. As part of that, I have been trying to make an assessment of where the unfair dismissal issue fits in their perceptions, as distinct from the realities of the circumare stances facing small business. I know it will be unpleasant for the member get for La Trobe to hear this, but the simple fact is that the sorts of issues that you talked about and the concerns that the employers in your electorate have about putting people on can be cleared up very simply: with economic growth and more customers coming into their shops. That is the very simple equation which any small business person will tell you. Do not forget that, when we talk about small business, we are talking about a business with fewer than 20 employees. If we are talking about primary producers or slightly larger manufacturing operations, there can be 100 members or fewer under the ABS definition. If we are talking about micro-businesses in Australia, we are talking about businesses with one or two people-often family memwall bers. That is about 60 to 70 per cent of people who are in the small business sector of are the Australian economy. Guess what? They we do not have these problems because if there Mr Charles-But they don't employ",96
169,Mr MARTIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"Exactly. They do not employ anybody because they are related to each other. There are mums and dads or their children in there. If there is a blue on, it is not going to end up in the Industrial Relations is going to end up in the Court. I am disappointed that my friend the member for La Trobe is scurrying out the door because I wanted to raise a couple of very important points here. What we are doing tonight is debating amendments to the Howard government's own legislation. What the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) says in the media or in this place, making reference to Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws or the Keating government's unfair dismissal laws or industrial relations laws, is garbage. They are gone. They were swept away last year, and my friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, knows that that is the case. He knows that last year his government, with the support of the Democrats in the other place, got rid of the Keating laws in respect of industrial relations and unfair dismissal. They got rid of the industrial relations laws, which they still talk about as being Laurie Brereton's laws. The laws that operate in this country now are the Howard-Reith industrial relations laws-not ours. They have nothing to do with us. We tried to knock them over in the Senate and we got done because you had a deal with the Democrats. We accept that that is the case. We might not like it but nevertheless they are there. What we have tonight are propositions coming before this House suggesting that their own laws, which operated at the start of this year, should be changed. Why? Why is this necessary? Why is unfair dismissal such a flavour of the month, particularly in respect to small business? You have to have a bit of a memory in politics. You have to hark back to when the old Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on the Sunday program and started to talk about this sort of business. Why did he do that? Could it have been because there were a few problems on his side of politics with ministers and parliamentary secretaries? I think it was. Every time this government gets into strife the Prime Minister ends up on the Sunday program making announcements that none of the rest of his front bench or government know anything about. This was one of them. He went on and said, 'For small businesses of less than 15 employees we are going to eliminate the application of unfair dismissal laws to them.' But that was not good enough. Charlie Bell had delivered a report about what small business really wanted. He didn't mention unfair dismissal other than to say, 'The laws have only been there for five minutes, leave them in place and let's have a review in 12 months time.' But that was not good enough for this Prime Minister, who has always been very gung-ho in industrial relations. He has always liked to kick the workers when they are down; the true battlers' friend-you know what he is like. The Prime Minister said, 'We'll up the ante a touch. We'll now sweep away all of our own industrial relations laws when it comes to unfair dismissal for every small business.' And they were supposed to throw their hands up and cheer. The honourable member for La Trobe talked about perceptions. The problem is perception. The problem is that because this government does not tell the truth to people in the small business community-that it is their laws that now apply, whether they be in workplace relations or small business or unfair dismissal-they have it in their minds that there are all these problems that are going to develop. But the simple fact is that under the Howard-Reith industrial relations laws of this country as they stand at the minute-and this is quite relevant-an employer can let an employee go in their first three months of employment without unfair dismissal laws applying. Sorry, what does that mean? Does that not mean that in the first three months of employment if somebody does not work out-and I would suggest that any employer within three months is going to know whether an employee is going to work out in that particular small business-you can let them go? The member for La Trobe should be here to hear that. He was regaling us with stories of people all around the place-women who would not clean up with a Hoover vacuum cleaner or whatever on their first day of employment. Under the laws now you can let that person go if you happen to be that small business person and not have the unfair dismissal laws apply-their own unfair dismissal laws. Where is the sense of it? Why is this being changed? As I said, Charlie Bell, Managing Director of MCDonald's Australia, was asked by this government last year to head up an inquiry into small business. The Prime Minister said, 'In the last election campaign we made a lot of promises on small business. We have to deliver on some of them.' He said to Charlie Bell, 'Go out and do an inquiry and find out what small business really want. We had a few ideas but tell us what they really want.' A report was tabled in November last year called Time for Business. In Charlie Bell's report, Time for Business, he went through a whole range of different things: reducing the taxation compliance burden, helping smaIl business employers, statistical collections, streamlining government processes and regulations, and on and on he went. But in one of those, recommendation No. 13, under chapter 4 on helping small business employers, Mr Bell recommended to his Prime Minister that the revised arrangements for unfair dismissal be reviewed after 12 months of operation 'to ensure that it is delivering a more balanced and flexible approach for small business'. He did not say to change or do anything about the law that they had just put in place; he said to review it in 12 months. That was what Charlie Bell recommended. The Prime Minister, on 24 March, decided he would respond to Charlie Bell and brought down a report caIled More Time for Business. This is where the brainstorm came about doing away with their own industrial relations laws as applied to unfair dismissal. As my friend and coIleague the shadow minister for industrial relations and member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) said, Peter Reith and John Howard-the minister and the Prime Minister-said after they had changed their own industrial relations laws, 'We have swept away Labor's unfair dismissal laws.' Peter Reith said, 'We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace.' This is what this government said: that they were eliminating the laws that were in place and that everything was rosy. Yet within a few short months they were coming forward and saying that changes had to be put in place. As I have indicated previously, when travelling around and speaking to small businesses, they have told me that what they want is growth in the economy; they have told me that what they want is more customers coming in the door; and they have told me that want they want is a bit of fairness in the system-particularly when it comes to a question of balance, a question of fair trading and a question of responding favourably to the parliamentary committee report on the whole issue of fair trading in this country. What they have said to me is that they want to eliminate unconscionable conduct, they want support for franchisees and they want, in retail tenancy situations, a decent and workable retail tenancy agreement. They have told me that what they want is the big end of town, the people who are managing shopping centres on behalf of institutional investors, to give them a fair go. That is what they have said they want. If you go and ask these people, 'What are the issues facing you?' they will tell you that these are the issues. Unfair dismissal does not rate as an important issue with them. On the other hand, if you go and say to them, 'Would you like to see unfair dismissal laws changed in this country?' they will say, 'Yes, of course we would.' Then if you say to them, 'Well, do you realise that the industrial relations laws on unfair dismissal in Australia at the moment are the Howard-Reith laws?' they say, 'Oh no, we thought they were Keating's and Brereton's.' You then say, 'No, no, they were changed last year.' If you then follow that up by asking, 'Do you understand that, if you let someone go within the first three months of your employing them, you are not subjected to unfair dismissal claims?' they say, 'Well, no, Peter Reith, the minister for workplace relations, has not told us that; the minister for workplace relations hasn't said anything like that to us.' You then say, 'Well, that's a fact. And, by the way'-you then ask-'how many employees on your staff are employed under federal awards?' And if they say none, you tum around and say to them, 'Well, guess what, brothers and sisters? The laws do not apply to you, because these are federal laws applying to people on federal awards.' If you go into shopping centres, strip shops or the comer shop where you buy your milk and bread on a Saturday morning and you ask the mums and dads who operate those sorts of things, 'How many of your employees are on federal awards?' and they say none, you then tum around and say , 'Well, guess what? These laws do not apply to you.' These are the exact circumstances. This is the plain truth. If the member for La Trobe wants to talk about perceptions and reality in respect of industrial relations, that is the real perceplaws tion and that is the actual reality of just what is required in the business community at the present time-and how very much those perceptions of the government differ from the reality of the circumstances. There were some questions raised too about the whole issue of employment and whether or not, by changing these laws, business will employ more-small business, particularly. Small business will go and employ more people if they know they are going to get more customers; if there is a bit of confidence in the community. They know that people are very concerned about whether in a week, a month or a year they will still have their job. Job insecurity is the issue in Australia at the present time. I do not care if you operate the small shop on the comer to which I have referred, or you happen to be a retailer in a regional shopping centre that is managed by a Lend Lease or a Westfield or anybody else, or you happen to be a Woolworths yourself. What you want to see is an increase in retail turnover in your shop. What you want to see is confidence return to the business community. And what you want to see are the sorts of things which the fair trading inquiry report talked about. That is what businesses in Australia want to see, particularly micro and small businesses. They will tell you that they would be prepared to hire people if some of those issues were picked up. They will tell you that, if their profitability levels were even remotely reasonable, they would be prepared to hire. They will tell you that it is nonsense being espoused-and it even came out again today in question time-about this capital gains tax rollover of $500,000. Most of the micro and small businesses would love to be able to retire with $500, let alone $5,000. You go and talk to them-talk to them about the problems they have, and see whether that is an issue of significance for them. It is not. This is what an out of touch government believes is necessary-but, in fact, it has passed this government by. My friend the member for Canberra also talked about some of the surveys that were around as to how important unfair dismissal were. One I go to just briefly is the Morgan and Banks job index that was released last week and commented upon, I think, in the Courier-Mail. Under the question that was asked, 'Have the federal unfair dismissal laws caused you not to hire as many new staff as you would have otherwise hired?', can you believe that, of those businesses with from zero to 30 employees-so they are the small businesses-75.6 per cent said that they were not affected at all. Seventy-five per cent of small businesses said that the unfair dismissal laws had absolutely no effect on them. So there you go--75 per cent. Dr Kemp-So one in four, 25 per cent, of small businesses are affected by the unfair dismissal laws?",96
170,Mr MARTIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The minister at the table, who never listens to what anybody says, should have been here a little earlier. What I said, my friend, is that micro-businesses with one or two people, often mums and dads, do not hire anybody. So they are not affected by any of this. It makes no difference. About 70 per cent of small businesses are in that category. But I will take back what I said. I know you are a listener occasionally",99
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,I am a listener; he is not.,99
172,Mr MARTIN,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"The minister is a listener, Mr Deputy Speaker. He should do a little more of that occasionally when these sorts of issues come out. The simple fact is that, as indicated by the shadow minister, this particular piece of legislation simply is not needed. It is based on a false premise. It is based on some sort of a view that employment in small business will be increased because there will be some ability for small businesses and microbusinesses employing people under federal awards to have an opportunity to sack people and, therefore, they will be able to hire more people. Somewhere in there the logic of how that works gets lost. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said today-in response to a question I put to him about when he would bring down a response to the fair trading inquiry report-that he was still out talking to a few people, he still wanted to get a view of the world, he still wanted to see some more people and talk to them and get out in the shopping centres. He should do that and do it very quickly, and he should ask those people about these sorts of issues. He should just reflect on the sorts of things which small business people really want to see. As has been indicated previously, when it comes time to look at the rate of filings for unfair dismissal claims, whether it be now in the commission or formerly in the court, there is only one direction in which the number of those claims being lodged can go-and that is down at a massive rate. It is not the problem that this government believes it is. It is not the problem for all the sorts of reasons that I have outlined. It is not the problem for the reasons that the member for Canberra has outlined. Just simply, it is an absolute smokescreen and a nonsense for the government to come into this place today and say that their own laws needed to be changed-because these are their own laws-and that in some way the amendments being proposed here would create jobs. The simple fact is this: this government wants to run this legislation in this place today and into the Senate in the fervent hope that it - ets knocked over, because next year - hey will come back and run it again. When It gets knocked over again-guess what?that will be the trigger for a double dissolution which the Prime Minister would like to have up his sleeve. He believes, like most governments have believed in the last 15 or so, that to have a Senate that is not of the same political persuasion is often something which needs to be constantly kept under review. He is probably right about that, but I do not think this is the mechanism by which he should be testing it. Quite simply, the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 before the House tonight is unnecessary. Unfair dismissal is not the problem for small business that some industry associations who purport to represent small business believe it is. It is not the problem when you talk to micro-businesses in shopping centres. I do not care where the people are that you talk to, it is not the level of significant problem that this government believes it is. If people come into this place and try to tell you otherwise, they simply have been wasting their time. They should have been talking to the small businesses in their community because then they would have found out the truth. This opposition rejects totally the reasons being advanced for this legislation being introduced. We reject it now; we will reject it in the future. We want to see that job opportunities are created in small business by the government playing proper attention to things like the fair trading inquiry report, by growing the economy and by embracing some of the industry policies which countless reports have suggested to this government they need to do. That is the way in which small business will prosper.",99
173,Dr NELSON,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I do not profess to be any kind of expert on industrial relations law. Whilst my training and background is in the practice of medicine, I have had some experience with employing people both within small business and then as the president of a large organisation with something like an $8 million budget and 50odd employees to look after. I would like to make some comments about the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 and, in particular, some of the things that have been said by the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) and the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). I am certainly grateful for the contribution that both of them have made because it means that some of my colleagues, like the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash), are much more likely to be here after the next election if they continue to apply the policies they are currently advocating. In 1987 I, along with my business partner, decided that we would establish a medical deputising service. In fact, we established two. I set about to get some bank finance. I had to get a second mortgage on my house. I had to work hard to try to get the place which we rented established. We had to significantly go into debt to get the business up and running. We ran the great risk for someone just starting off in new business of employing staff. Employing medical people was not so much a problem because that was the nature of my experience, but employing clerical and administrative staff was fraught with great risk. Having started from that, at the peak of running our business we employed almost 40 people, both medical and non-medical, in casual, contracted, part-time and full-time capacity. By the time we sold our businesses in 1991, which was prior to the unfair dismissal provisions enacted by the previous government, all I can say is that it was a nightmare. Last year I paid my last instalment on capital gains tax that I had to pay. The member for Cunningham talks about the minister at the table not listening, but as the shadow minister for small business I question whether he is actually listening to the business people that he is talking to. When I wrote my cheque last year for the last instalment of capital gains and worked out what I had actually made out of working 100 hours a week for five years. I worked out that I would have been better off being an employee of myself than doing what I had done to create employment for other people. We had reached a point, by the time we sold in March 1991, where we did not want the size of the business to grow. It simply was not worth the effort. I am not by nature an avaricious person. I was not in any way trying to exploit my employees-in fact, quite the opposite. It was not the cost of labour that really got to me in the end. It was all the bureaucracy, the paperwork, the threat of litigation of one form or another, the problems of providing insurance for consumers or clients and bank chargesall of these problems. We sold in 1991 just as the recession we apparently had to have was coming on. I remember paying business interest rates of 23 per cent. When members on the other side arguing against this bill say, 'Only a small number of small businesses are citing unfair dismissal provisions as a major hassle,' they should take into account that trying to help people in small business is not confined to one initiative and one initiative only. It requires a number of things, which include measures that the government has taken. Whether it is the provisional tax uplift factor, capital gains tax relief, industrial relations reform, interest rates and the costs associated with running a business in day-today life or a 20 per cent deduction in statistical collections that is required of people in small business, all of these things add up and create an environment in which people might be more inclined to get out of bed, to borrow money, to take a risk and to work hard to create wealth for themselves, their families, to employ other Australians and to pay taxes which we then distribute to those that have neither power nor influence. This bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 so as to exclude new employees in small businesses from the operation of the federal unfair dismissal provisions. This defence of unfair dismissal claims unfortunately is disproportionately burdensome for tax, I sat down small businesses. In my electorate, in East Killara, there is a news agent which I will use as a typical example. Newsagents, for those of you who know them, generally are out of bed by 4 o'clock in the morning. They have all the newspapers organised for distribution for the day. They work at least six days a week. Many of them borrow heavily to buy the business, and frequently they employ younger people. If you pop into buy a newspaper on a Saturday morning, you usually find a teenager selling papers and doing things to make a bit of extra money. The news agent in East Killara in my electorate is probably fairly typical. He works 100 hours a week and has a family member who also works there. I suspect that they pay themselves for only a 40-hour week even though they work 100 hours. He caught an employee, a young lady, with her hand literally in the till. She was stealing money from him. She admitted that she was in fact doing it-she hardly could do anything elseand he dismissed her. He said, 'You need to go.' That cost him $8,000 for an unfair dismissal claim. He said to me, 'I would rather get out of this business than put up with the stress that is associated with unfair dismissal provisions.' As a result of that incident, a young person, probably in my electorate, does not have a job because that newsagent does not want to employ anybody else. If I extrapolate that to the rest of the country, I cannot begin to imagine just how many people could be employed but are not because of the previous unfair dismissal provisions, even if you still apply the much more balanced ones that we have now to very small businesses. The bill is not going to affect employees' rights to take action against unlawful termination of employment-for example, discriminatory dismissal or dismissal without minimum notice. It is not going to apply to existing employees. So what is all this nonsense about it further creating insecurity about having a job? If the bill is passed, it will mean that who are currently on unemployment queues are more likely to have a job. It is not going to affect people who already have a job. It is actually going to give a little bit more hope to people out there-for example, the people in the electorate of the member for Gilmorethat they might end up having a job. The bill does not affect the rights of apprentices. Whether a particular apprentice is excluded or not depends on the terms of their apprenticeship and applicable apprenticeship legislation. The member for Canberra said that a lot of employees go into state awards. The fact is that South Australia and Queensland are already introducing parallel exclusions. The definition of a small business is an employer employing 15 or fewer employees at the time the employer terminates the employees' employment or gives notice of termination, whichever occurs first. A casual employee need not be counted unless he or she has been employed on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months. Some people have said that we should have used full-time equivalents and more complex formulae for calculating what a small business is and how many employees it would affect. But the whole point is that you have to keep it as simple as you possibly can if it is going to work. The ALP have gone on about a number of issues. They say that employees who have been treated unfairly would be left without any remedy. However, I should remind those on the other side that when they were in government they also had a range of exclusions from their unfair dismissal provisionsfor example, casual employees and probationers, and so on. The Labor Party would say that it is unfair to provide different rights for different classes of employees. However, the different treatment is justifiable given the different impact of an unfair dismissal claim on a small business where the proprietor has to attend to all hearings personally. I think back to when I was President of the Australian Medical Association and had the unfortunate responsibility of having to part company with some of our staff. In one case we were taken to court by a former employee. people At least we had considerable resources and staff on a full-time basis to deal with it. If that had happened to me when I was running a small business, albeit within the sheltered workshop of Medicare, I wonder how I would have coped. I certainly suspect that I would be fully grey instead of 50 per cent grey as I am at the moment. Decisions on expansion or employment are influenced by many factors. What we as a government have to do is to reduce as many of those factors as we possibly can. If you try to reduce road accident tolls, you do not look at just seat belts or driver education; you have to look at car design, road design, speed limits and driver education-a whole range of initiatives which are important. We must do the same in creating an environment in which people in small business are more likely to employ other people. The ACTU suggested that it is a breach of Liberal Party policy to fail to provide access to an unfair dismissal hearing for any group of employees. However, as I said before, the previous government had exclusions from its unfair dismissal provisions for casuals and probationers. I want to respond to what some of the other speakers have said. The member for Canberra came out with all this rhetoric and left-wing ideology. I do not doubt his sincerity and his support for working people, but it is the kind of nonsense that he raised that leads many workers to unemployment queues. If the legislation is so aggressive in its support of employers, if it will enable rapacious behaviour by employers, why, then, has it been criticised by the H.R. Nicholls Society, a group that is not known for its left-wing views? What about unemployment? The ALP and the unions seem worried only about those who have work. What about those who do not have a job? What about those who do not have a job because there are employers out there who, for a number of reasons, feel that they are unable, or are unwilling, to take on more employees? The member for Cunningham said that he is meeting small business people all of the time. I just wonder what he is listening to when he is speaking to them. The member for Canberra, in citing the Yellow Pages small business survey, said that the unfair dismissal provision for small businesses of 15 or fewer employees for the first year of employment of a new employee was a top priority, according to the small business survey, for only three per cent of small businesses. So he more or less dismissed what we are trying to do on the basis that only three per cent of small businesses rated it at the very top of the issues that would be likely to create more employment. Let us say that we are prepared to accept that three per cent figure. Three per cent of those 800,000 businesses is 24,000 small businesses which rate this as the No.1 priority for employing other people. If each one of those businesses took on one employee as a result of this bill being passed, 24,000 new jobs would be created in Australia. If we follow the logic of the member for Canberra and the member for Cunningham, who are doing their very best to keep us in government-if they were prepared to support this bill on the basis of the argument that they have put-there are 24,000 people out there languishing today on unemployment queues who might actually have a job and we, as a government, might have more tax receipts to spend on social welfare programs that are so necessary for the people that they purport to have such great concern for. There is another point that needs to be made in relation to small businesses and what they want. Looking at the figures for unfair dismissal claims, a clearer picture of the actual trends can be obtained from the figures in Victoria, where we now have a single jurisdiction. Some members on the other side have said, 'This is a federal matter and employees can escape into state awards.' If you look at the Victorian situation, where we have a single jurisdiction now, those figures indicate that there has been a reduction of around 27 per cent in claims for unfair dismissal compared with the claims in the corresponding period last year. That means that there are a significant number of business people who are now not having to spend money on lawyers, who are not having to take time away from their businesses to front up to courts and who are not having sleepless nights and all the stresses that go with worrying about an unfair dismissal claim brought by an employee, a number of whom are simply vexatious in what they are trying to do. The latest changes that are proposed by the government are designed to give a further signal to employers in small business that the worse excesses of the previous system have been removed and they can now look with renewed confidence at taking on new employees. I would also like to quote David Gregory from the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He says: It is patently evident that fresh initiatives are required if we are to begin to do something constructive about present levels of unemployment. The VECCI believes that the government's proposals in this area are soundly based. They have overwhelming support of employers in small business, who have indicated that there will be a confidence building initiative. The other person to whom I would like to draw the attention of the House-whilst I do not always agree with him, as he is rather provocative-is Ed Shann, the Director of Access Economics. He had an excellent article published in the Business Review Weekly on 21 July 1997. He was talking about flexibility in the labour market and the impact that it has on employment. In doing so in this particular piece, he pointed out that the employment rate, as a proportion of the population aged 15 to 64, is much better and much higher in countries with a deregulated labour market such as the United States, Britain and New Zealand, which do better than the heavily regulated European countries. New Zealand's employment figure, as many Australians would be aware, moved from below Australia's to above it after it deregulated its labour market. He also pointed out and reminded us-and I would like to remind the House-that the Australian levels of output per hour worked are two-thirds that of developed countries' best practice. There is a 10 per cent gap in labour market productivity in Australia for us to. make up if we are to effectively compete wIth the rest of the world-even on the average performance of other developed c?un-ries. In welcoming the workplace unfair dIsmIssal amendments, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Mark Paterson, said: Mr Reith's additional exemption would be very - pulll! with small business, who need as many nght signals as possible to generate new jobs. !hese things are very important to AustralIans, especially to those who do not have jobs or - e literally struggling to remain in small busmess. It is worth remembering that there are 48 small businesses every day in this country that go belly up. Many of them go belly up because of the inherent nature of small business and the risk that is involved in trying to conduct one, but most of them have been going under because of the environment in which they are actually having to work. There is a need for politicians on both sides the of the House, of whatever political party, at times to put aside some of our ideology and start to look at some practical solutions to what we see as intractable problems. It is of no help or comfort to people living in public housing commission estates, in areas of third generation welfare dependency and in areas where jobs used to be but where they are no longer, to hear some of the rhetoric and nonsense that has come from the other side of the House in relation to this. Supporting the views that the ALP currently does may mean that there are fewer people surviving in small business and, importantly, that there are fewer people in small business who are prepared to give someone else the opportunity to have a job, which unfortunately a lot of other Australians take for granted. I also found in my dealings with the ACTU, when I was President of the AMA and trying to get the ACTU interested in the human and health effects of unemployment, that it seemed entirely preoccupied with only those people who had a job. It appeared not to be at all concerned-other than in a very broad sense-for those who did not have a job. I can only surmise that that is because those who are unemployed are not paying union dues. If I were to give gratuitous advice to the ACTU-which I will give anyway-it is that it ought to start to show a little more concern for some of the social problems this country faces and a little less for purely ideologically driven industrial concerns for its members. If it really is concerned for those who do not have a job, it ought to ask itself what it can do to get the government and the unions off the back of small business and give them the opportunity to create jobs for other people.

174,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: Funding",104
175,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"It is just over one year since the Howard governI ment in its first budget tore the heart out funding for community controlled Aboriginal organisations across the country. In one fell swoop they ripped one-third of avai-able funding away from ATSIC programs at encouraging indigenous Australians to take charge of their own destiny. They say they Tranby quarantined a large part of ATSIC's budget, that but the truth is that those budget devastated the provision of basic services and facilities at the community level. Where there were community controlled organisations providing a wide range of services in a culturally appropriate and, therefore, more efficient way, many of these organisations have now been forc-d to close. In central Australia alone I am adVIsed that 11 women's resource centres have folded as direct result of the government's budgetary cuts. Those organisations provided essenti-l health services, life skills training al support to women and mothers - rin.ging up the next generation of young mdigenous legislation Australians. Now those mothers either have to go without or travel long distances-cap in hand-to hospitals where often nobody knows their customs or speaks their language. It is. story that repeats itself all over AustralIa every day-indigenous Australians forced to come to the government, cap in hand, for handouts. Before the budget cuts, they would have relied on their own people learning skills and doing it for themselves. Last Friday I was presented with a petition organised by Mr Andrew Gunstone of Abbotsford, Victoria, signed by over 15,000 Australians. I understand that this is the largest single petition presented to this parliaspeak ment since the Howard government was pandering elected. The petition shows that there is widespread community support for indigen-us self-determination. I agree completely wIth Mr Gunstone when he says: The people who signed this petition come frowalks of life, cultural backgrounds and pol-tlcal affiliations. By turning the clock back in Indigenous Affairs the Howard Government has completely underestimated the Australian community's opposithe tion to its policies on ATSIC, native title and the stolen children report. The Australian people look forward to a new era of reconciliation and reject a return to the 1950s policies of assimilation. congratulate Mr Gunstone on organising that of petition. On an earlier occasion I attended a Friends of Tranby dinner on Friday, 30 May at the New South Wales leagues club. At that dinner a petition was signed by 187 people. aImed The petition reads as follows: The petition of certain guests at the Friends of dinner draws to the attention of the House we support the decision of the High Court with cuts have regards to native title. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House uphold the High Court's decision. In the next week the government will table their supposed response to the High Court's Wik decision. It is really using the Wik decision as a stalking horse to revisit the original Mabo High Court decision and the original native title legislation. It is all under a the guise of workability and certainty. The reverse will be the truth. The government's legislation will provide greater uncertainty and materIand greater unworkability. The Australian Labor Party will look at the on its merits. It is not meritorious for this federal parliament to abuse the power it was given in the 1967 referendum--t .is a power to legislate to protect Abongmal a people for their benefit, - ot to take awa- the limited rights that the HIgh Court has gIven them. For the past 18 months this government has used indigenous Australians as a political tool, feeding into the prejudice of those in the community who do not understand and do not want to understand. It is time for the government to rethink. They are not only doing damage within Australia but turning Australia into a pariah in the international community. The facts will for themselves. This is a government to the prejudiced. (Time expired) Wine Industry",105
176,Mrs BAILEY,ADJOURNMENT,"I think we will get a little bit of sanity back all into the adjournment debate tonight after that disgraceful outburst that we just heard. I rise tonight in order to highlight one of many important areas of commerce in the MCEwen electorate-namely, the wine industry. The importance of this industry can be shown in many ways. Firstly, the growth in the industry itself in Victoria has seen it advance in prestige to rival many famous Australian interstate and, indeed, overseas wineries. I am privileged to be the member representing an area which can boast such wine growing regions- Mr Speaker, I know that you would be aware of these regions-as Mansfield, with the Delatite Winery; Nagambie, with Chateau Tabilk, Plunkett's and Mitchelton wineries; and the Yarra Valley, synonymous for names such as Tarrawarra, Yarra Ridge, Fergussons, De Bortoli and Long Gully, to name but a few. I must add that it is not simply a record for wine production that makes these wineries such a welcome addition to the MCEwen electorate. With the first production of vines in the Yarra Valley being recorded in the 1840s, Victoria now produces its fair share of a national wine export market worth around $500 million. The growth in the wine industry in smaller towns such as St Andrews, Northwood, Avenel and Dixons Creek have supported growth not only in the national economy but also in the local districts through associated industries such as travel, tourism and hospitality. Secondly, the quality of wines has seen them being rewarded recognition not only here in Australia but overseas as well. Oncesmall wineries have made a name for themselves in the industry and are attracting attention from larger corporations. Modest wineries have now grown into medium sized companies, with further expansion in the industry promising further growth. The Hon. Pat MCNamara, the Deputy Premier of Victoria, in opening the 'Opportunities for vineyard development in Victoria's high country' seminar stated: Victoria is well placed to enter all segments of the wi;fie export mark-t. We have large tracts of sUitable land, plentiful supplies of good quality water and a reputation for producing a diverse range of wine styles. The value of the wine industry in Victoria shoUld not be underestimated. With growth in the next 12 years, Victoria aims to secure approximately 30 per cent of the national export market. In this goal, the Victorian Wine Industry Association estimates that production across the state should expand by up to 700 hectares of planting each year for the next 10 years. Growth such as this is essential in bringing jobs back to the rural communities, many of which suffered so badly under the previous 13 years of Labor government. This government, the Howard government, is working very hard to secure our rural and regional communities, and we encourage small business and industry to take advantage of all that is offered. The growth in the wine industry in Australia has specifically opened up new opportunities to jobseekers from a wide range of fields. From seasonal employment around the time of harvest to positions for experts in the fields of viticulture and winemaking, the increase in the number of vines being planted, tourism and marketing initiatives and value adding processes in the wineries have enabled the industries to employ many additional employees. In a report from the Wineries Tourism Council it was stated that wineries are a major drawcard for visitors to regional Victoria. Their research showed that more than 53 per cent of people visiting wineries indicated that their visit to that particular region was prompted by a trip to a winery. This kind of tourism entices visitors to stay not just a few hours but a number of days. For example, one of the places they love to visit is the De Bortoli winery and restaurant, which recently won the prestigious Jimmy Watson trophy. Their late picked wine, bearing the simple label of 'Noble One' has won international awards beating comparable French wines hands down. In addition to the benefits to the wineries of having an increase in cellar door visits and sales, tourists are keen to stay for a few nights to provide an additional boost to the local economy. The Wineries Tourism Council has estimated this increase will continue. (Time expired) Public Housing: Tenants Councils",105
177,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to raise a matter of serious concern that affects the substantial number of high-rise public housing estates in my electorate-a decision by the Kennett government to defund tenants councils or tenants associations that were first established in the estates by the former Cain government. This really relates to only a fairly small amount of money, and, in fact, may not save any significant amount of money at all. But it will have a devastating impact on the sense of community of the estates on the degree to which the various groups of people in these estates are able to relate to each other, work together, tackle the various problems that they face collectively and advocate on behalf of themselves as a group with respect to public housing issues. What these tenants councils currently do is employ usually one, two or three people, one or two tenant workers and administrative staff in a location on the particular estate. They advocate for individual tenants who have problems-for example, they may take them to the residential tenancy tribunal-and deal with issues of maintenance, trying to ensure that the ministry actually looks after maintenance problems. They organise many collective community activities. In some estates they are involved, for example, in assisting with community gardens, vegetable gardens and the like. They are a forum where the various ethnic groups on the estates can come together, with the aid of interpreters, and express common concerns. Issues such as security problems, drugs and various other problems on some of the estates can be dealt with. What actually emerges from these tenants councils is a sense of community, a sense of participation and a sense of belonging. What is actually happening is of considerable importance because these high-rise estates are like medium-sized country towns. The estate at Richmond has roughly a quarter of the population of Richmond in that one high-rise estate in a fairly small area-it has almost 7,000 people. There are other estates in my electorate that have 4,000 or 5,000 people on them. The only collective structure they have, the only means for integrating the community on those estates, is those tenants associations. The Kennett government is defunding them and is going to replace the process with tendered out, contracted out operations that will only provide the narrow services of individual representation to the tenants. Critically, there will be no sense of accountability between the tenants and the service providers. Hopefully, what we will have is a legitimate organisation like the Salvation Army or the Brotherhood of St Laurence getting these tenders. They at least will do their best to perform these services. But they cannot hope to be genuinely representative of the tenants. They will not be accountable to the tenants as the current tenants councils and tenant workers are through the structures that exist. They will also be organised in ridiculous regions. For example, the region in which the estate in Flemington in my electorate is situated will extend as far out as Melton but will not include areas such as Carlton, which are only 5to lO-minutes drive away, and very similar. So we will have a situation where a particular service provider is going to be looking after a very diverse range of different sorts of public housing and there will be no sense of collectivity. There is no guarantee that you will have on a particular estate, even a large estate with 4,000 or 5,000 or more tenants, a presence. At the moment, what we have is, usually on a ground floor location in one of the blocks, an office of the tenants council that is staffed with some basic resources there where tenants and particular groups of tenants can come and actually deal with their problems, get assistance, get some sort of sense of community and interaction with others on the estate. One of the things that worries me is that it is conceivable that we will end up with 'Dodgy Bros Tenancy Services Pty Ltd' actually providing these services, that the Kennett government will take the same approach that it has taken on the question of cleaning. When that was contracted out, we ended up with people who had had no previous experience involved in providing cleaning services getting contracts simply because they put in the cheapest bid. We could end up with some real shysters, who have no real concern for the interests of tenants, actually winning these bids-maybe not this time, but perhaps down the track. The former minister, Mr Knowles, at least understood the importance of these tenants associations. They are a critical factor in ensuring that these estates are basically livable, reasonable places for public tenants. He understood that if you took these away you would actually end up potentially with the sorts of problems that you have in public high-rise estates in places like Britain United States. The current minister, Ann Henderson, apparently does not understand that. I am seriously concerned that the degree of the quality of life on the estates will deteriorate significantly, that there will be no accountability between tenants and those providing the services, that the range of things that will be provided-the degree of social intermediation and interaction between the different groups of people on the estates-will diminish and that we will have a substantial reduction in the overall quality of services. (Time expired) Cambodia  Lincoln once observed that 'no man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent'. Regrettably, this is a doctrine which appears to have had little application and relevance in contemporary Cambodia. The tumultuous events of July, culminating in the political overthrow of Prince Ranariddh, the First Prime Minister of Cambodia, is testimony to this. In any discussion of issues as complex as the domestic politics of Cambodia, it is often easy to rely on assumptions at the expense of the realities of the situation. Appreciating the dynamics of the Cambodian political landscape and the personalities that make up its leadership is crucial. Regardless, there are fundamental principles of liberty and democracy that can never be ignored, that can never be dismissed. Principles of such importance must never be compromised. The horrific nature of the Khmer Rouge dictatorship between 1975 and 1979 has been thoroughly documented in this House before. Prince Ranariddh's decision to commence a dialogue with influential members of the Khmer Rouge was a poor exercise of judgment but it in no way justified the powerful retaliatory response of Hun Sen. The events surrounding Prince Ranariddh's overthrow are outrageous and are deplored from both a humanitarian and a democratic perspective. Reports of torture and execution and the of bodyguards and supporters loyal to FUNCINPEC by Hun Sen's followers are deeply disturbing. Australia can neither understand nor condone the use of force to bring about a change in government within any state. In recent developments a majority of the remnants of FUNCINPEC have met and subsequently nominated Ung Huot as their party leader and candidate for First Prime Minister. Similarly, the parliament of Cambodia have overwhelmingly endorsed Ung Huot for this position. Clearly, out of respect for the democratic process, Australia must work with the Cambodian government in an attempt to foster and nurture its infant democracy. In advancing this objective, the following measures should be adopted. Firstly, in a demonstration of respect for democracy, all members of the former Cambodian parliament, including Prince Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy and other liberal Buddhists who are at present living in political exile, should be permitted to return and be encouraged to remain in their country with the protection and sanction of the Cambodian government. This is not merely a gesture of goodwill to Hun Sen's political opponents; it is a basic human right and a display of good faith to international observers and sceptics. Secondly, the Australian government should maintain its insistence that the Cambodian government strictly observes fundamental human rights and the rule of law for all its citizens. Thirdly, the Australian government should increase its fiscal commitment and technical support to the Cambodian government for the proposed May 1998 elections a level of assistance commensurate with the task at hand. The federal government has already allocated $500,000 for election prepaservices rations, voter registration and electorate education. Finally, a team of international observers should be developed with the cooperation and consent of the Cambodian government to monitor the proposed elections of May 1998. Inevitably, there will be critics of this plan-people thinking and living in the short term-who will identify money and as the primary issues. I challenge those critics to approach the issue laterally and to consider how fortunate they are to be living in a country where they have the freedom to voice their opinions and criticisms, unlike their Cambodian counterparts. Australia and all the members of the interevaluation national community have a dual obligation the people of Cambodia and to their own economies. More specifically, Australia has invested billions of dollars in Cambodian industry, commerce and infrastructure since the re-emergence of democracy in that councarer try. Any responsible strategy to protect investment while simultaneously fostering political freedom for the people of Cambodia must incorporate a long-term plan. To those who doubt the viability of this perhaps appropriate to consider the simple words of George Washington: Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth. In Cambodia we must try again to plant seed that, if it grows, will be of benefit to all. Disability Services",107
178,Ms MACKLIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take the opportunity tonight draw the attention of the House to some taged. recent developments in the organisation disability services. They have received scant attention either in the House or more broadly in the community but of course have a very socially. significant impact upon people with disabilities, their families and carers and the services on which they rely. In particular, I want to talk about the to renegotiation of the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. This agreement governs the funding and organisation of disability throughout the country. It expired on 30 June this year after five years of operation and after an independent evaluation that had been in fact completed a year before. The evaluation had taken place a year before, so the Commonwealth and the states had had a year to reach agreement on the terms and conditions of the new agreement. They have failed to do so-a story that is becoming too resources common with this government. This failure must in large part be attributed to the Commonwealth. Not only has it been unwilling to reassure state governments that existing funding levels will be maintained in a new agreement; it has attempted to reduce funding-and this despite the findings of the that in all service types funded to under the agreement demand for services exceeds supply. It found that 13,500 people with severe and profound handicaps were in critical need of accommodation; 7,700 people with severe and profound handicaps had a over the age of 70; 7,000 carers of our people with severe and profound handicaps did not have access to respite care; and up to 70,000 people with severe and profound handicaps might need access to day or recreaproposal, it is tion activities. I am seeing the impact of the decisions to reduce funding in my own electorate, where, for example, Commonwealth funding cuts to a group called SPEECH, the Society to a Promote Essential Education for Children, us threatened the viability of services at Eltham, West Preston and Broadmeadows. If these services are curtailed, the children who now attend classes at these centres to assist them in overcoming severe speech and communicato tion impairments will be severely disadvanWithout early intervention such as that of provided through SPEECH, their future education and employment will be severely disadvantaged, as will their ability to interact I have also recently had the parents of severely disabled adults living at home pleading with me to help them find a home in community residential units. Mrs Bailey interjecting",109
179,Ms MACKLIN,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for MCEwen interrupts. My electorate borders hers. The service in Eltham is undoubtedly serving people in the electorate of MCEwen. Instead of shouting in this debate, she should take up the matter with the responsible minister, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who has seen severe cuts take place and has not been prepared to take this agreement to the states. The minister might listen. The member for MCEwen obviously is not interested, and I will be very happy to let her electors in Eltham know what is going to happen as a result of this minister's incompetence. The minister has said to all the states and territories, 'We're not going to have a new Commonwealth-state disability agreement. We're just going to extend it by a month at a time.' If the member for MCEwen thinks that that will help the people in her electorate festival. or my electorate who need access to services, such as children who cannot hear properly and parents who have severely disabled children, she has no idea about the needs of those children or their parents. That shows just how out of touch this government is. Mrs Bailey-In 13 years you did precious little.",110
180,Ms MACKLIN,ADJOURNMENT,"We had an outstanding agreement on disability services. Minister Moylan repeatedly refuses to consider the needs of people with disabilities. The member for MCEwen clearly sides with the minister, who has no understanding of the needs of the states or the needs of people with disabilities. We will be more than happy to let the people of Eltham know what her views are. Disability Services Beaudesert Country and Horse Festival",110
181,Mrs ELSON,ADJOURNMENT,I would like to remind the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) that as a result of the 15 years I worked in disability services before I became a member of parliament I could tell a few stories of total neglect by the Labor Party in the past 13 years. Ms Macklin-By the Queensland government; the Joh Bjelke-Petersen government.,110
182,Mrs ELSON,ADJOURNMENT,Not the Queensland government; the Commonwealth government was what I dealt with for 15 years. I rise in this House tonightMs Macklin-You wouldn't have a clue.,110
183,Mrs ELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"You do not have a clue. I rise in this House tonight to pay tribute to a small band of community leaders who 12 months ago made a decision not to let their rural shire become redundant. While some were talking doom and gloom after the closure of the meat abattoirs which left 600 of their townsfolk unemployed and a fire which burnt down a number of retail businesses, causing further unemployment, this small group were planning a comeback. The rural community I am talking about is Beaudesert and the event which has placed this town back on the map is the country and horse I am invited to many community events and organisations and I have seen some outstanding displays of talent and teamwork, but none has left me feeling the way I did after this fantastic week of festivities. I was feeling nothing but pure pride for this town. The teamwork and community spirit displayed was exceptional. To see the townspeople get solidly behind the festival and really put on a great show for many visitors to our area is a great testament to the fighting spirit of this small, close-knit community. The people of the Beaudesert shire gathered together to support and contribute to a festival which celebrated the rural lifestyles and scenic beauty of the Beaudesert region in particular. It was a rare opportunity for cityfolk in the neighbouring Brisbane, Gold Coast and Ipswich suburbs to take a break from their urban lifestyle and take a peek at how their country neighbours live. The festival provided a dazzling array of entertainment, from guided tours of the shire to competitions such as bush poetry and pottery for adults and colouring-in competitions for the kids. The huge amount of participation in these competitions was very encouraging. One competition took place at the historic Nindooinbah House, which in the past has played host to royalty. Nindooinbah opened its doors to the quilters and embroiderers competition, which attracted over 400 displays from across Australia. I want to congratulate Margaret Hockey on her hospitality, as so many people came to view this exhibition in such exquisite surroundings, and in doing so raised much needed funds for Catholic Care and Concern. The festival also catered for those who were not so competitive with food and wine tasting, day and night rodeos, bush poetry, sheepdog trials and a host of activities to keep everybody busy and entertained. The four-wheel drive tours of the shire was a great way for visitors to see the area, which is often overlooked by the public. It took in the local Palmaday and Belcam studs to show a display of race horses and their facilities. The tour also gave visitors the opportunity to take in the sights of the beautiful Mount Tamborine. To top off the superb week-long program, the weekend brought the celebrations to a high with a spectacular street parade which attracted over 5,000 people to the streets of Beaudesert. The 'parade of a thousand hooves' consisted of the most amazing floats, bands, entertainments and horses of all breeds. The parade was followed by a country music concert put on by the very talented Ray, Tania and Lee Kernaghan. I cannot adequately express the tremendous amount of pride and respect I have for the organisers of this festival. As someone who has worked as a special events coordinator, I know that tremendous successes like this are the result of many months of dedication and hard work. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Nancy Moss, John Knight, Julie Gordon, Paul Mayes, Fred Gillow, Carol Williams, Glenn Berg, Joe Mevisson, Annie Minton and Chris Gimmitt, who are all members of the Beaudesert shire country and horse festival committee. Also, I must congratulate Beaudesert radio Sun PM; Bet Milne Ward for the youth rock concert; Mr Bill Wymen, Coralie Clarke and the Zonta Club of Beaudesert for the festival bush ball; Elizabeth Wilson for the Rathdowney Campdraft, which I am only too happy to support every year; Barbara MCMillan for the four-wheel drive tours; Iimboomba Rotary Club for the Boomba bush dance; Nancy Moss for organising the bush poetry sausage sizzle; and the many, many more people who helped make this festival a huge success. Special congratulations also go to all the people who sponsored or helped with a float in the parade. The floats were very innovative and colourful. (Time expired) HMAS Sydney",110
184,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"In the very short time available to me, I would like to take this opportunity tonight to welcome the announcement today by the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) that he proposes to refer to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade the issue of the sinking of the HMAS Sydney. This is a matter that I have been pursuing together with the member for Moore (Mr Filing). I have appreciated the support from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), both of whom are vice-patrons of the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust.

NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 26 August 1997: Copyright Act-Declaration under section lOA, 20 May 1997. Superannuation Act 1976-Declaration-Statutory Rules 1997 No. 214. Superannuation Act 1990Declarations-Statutory Rules 1997 Nos 212, 213. The following answers to questions were circulated: Comcar: Subcontractors (Question No. 1479) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 1052 (Hansard, 4 February 1997, page 92), has progress been made into investigating allegations (a) that Mr L Swindell's Specialised Transport Services PL utilised Comcar computer information concerning bookings, billing and client print-outs, (b) relating to Mr Swindell's claim that he had a commercial relationship with Comcar management personnel, (c) relating to the circumstances of Mr Swindell's successful tender over Comcar for contracts associated with President Clinton's visit and (d) as to extent of the dissemination of computer password information among Comcar personnel, if so, what. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In responding on 4 February 1997 to the honourable members question No. 1052, I advised that I would provide detailed answers to that question when investigations into related allegations had been completed. Those investigations have now been completed. I provide the following details in the order of the parts of question 1052. (1) Yes. (a) Mr Swindells was employed in COMCAR management as the NSW State Supervisor and prior to that the NSW State Operations Manager. (b) He was employed in the position of State Supervisor from 23 January 1995 to 30 June 1995 and State Operations Manager from 9 June 1992 to 22 January 1995. He was employed in COMCAR in various capacities for nearly 25 years. (2) (a) Yes. (b) COMCAR does not compete in the hire car market. It provides a car with driver service to entitlees on a cost recovery basis. COMCAR customers are not tied to COMCAR and may choose self-drive, chauffeured hire cars or taxis depending on their transport requirements. (3) No. COMCAR has on occasions subcontracted the hire of coaches to Larry Swindells Specialised Transport. Total payments from 31 December 1995 to end December 1996 was $47,750.75. NA (4) In Sydney, Larry Swindells Specialised Transport Services was contracted directly by the United States Consulate for its transport requirements and by COMCAR for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's coach requirements. (5) On 17 October 1996 and 15 November 1996. (6) The United States Government provided its own vehicles for the use of the President, Mrs Clinton and other members of the party (as was the case with President Bush's visit). In accordance with the normal guidelines for a visiting Head of State the Australian Government offered to provide four COMCAR vehicles to the visiting party. This offer was accepted. (7) The use of hire cars was a commercial transaction between the United States Government the and Australian hire car companies. The related details are matters known to those parties and not my Department. The cost of the provision of COMCAR vehicles was $13,661.00. (8) The Department's Fraud Control Unit found that Mr Swindells' company has had a commercial relationship with both DAS Removals and COMCAR which, respectively, employ Messrs Fink and Hanley. Mr Fink was previously employed by COMCAR. However, the Fraud Control Unit found no evidence to confirm that Mr Swindells'-relationship with either Messrs Fink or Hanley was improper. (9) (a) (b) The Department's Fraud Control Unit found that Mr Larry Swindells used the COMCAR computer system and laminating facilities in the COMCAR office in Sydney in the course of providing services to COMCAR. It found no evidence/information that this was unauthorised or otherwise inappropriate. (10) The following number of people in COMCAR have access to reservation, allocation and client billing data: (a) 51 to booking information; 9 to billing information; and 9 to client print-outs. (b) and (c) The positions these people hold are: for 'booking' information-Allocations Officers, Reservations Officers, State Operations Supervisors, State Operations Officers, Visits Officers, Finance Officers, Systems Officers, Customer Liaison Officer, Client Maintenance Officer, Assistant Manager National Operations and the Assistant General Manager; for 'billing' information-Finance Officers, System Officers and Assistant General Manager; and for 'client' information-Client Maintenance Officer, Customer Liaison Officer, Visits Officer, Reservations Officers and Systems Officers. Aircraft Parts (Question No. 1569)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (1) Is the Civil Aviation Safety authority investievidence gating the suspected use and trading in unapproved parts for Robinson R22 helicopters; if so, what progress has been made since 1 July 1996. (2) Has evidence been found, or suspicions raised, of fraud of criminal acts in relation to the use of, or trafficking, unapproved aircraft and helicopter replacements parts. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question as follows: (1) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) does not have a specific directed investigation related to suspected unapproved parts (SUPs) concerning Robinson R22 helicopters. However, following reports of suspected unapproved parts used in R22 helicopters, CASA issued the following Airworthiness Directives (AD) which require inspections to determine whether unapproved parts have been fitted to R22 helicopters in Australia: AD!R22/16 and AD!R22/39 related to bearings. AD!R22/43 related to main and tail rotor blades. CASA acts on reports of information related to SUPs. CASA believes that one of the most effective methods of preventing the use of unapproved parts is through an extensive industry education and awareness program. In this regard, it has established a telephone ""hot line"" (1-800 245011). This is for reporting any suspected unapproved aircraft parts. In addition, advisory material produced by CAS A on how to identify approved parts from overseas sources, together with procedures for handling suspected unapproved parts, is to be released shortly. To further assist the industry, CAS A has established a home page on the Internet which includes notifications of unapproved parts from the US Federal Aviation Administration and details of Airworthiness Advisory Circulars issued by CASA. The home page address is http://www.casa.gov.au. Details of these initiatives are to be included in a forthcoming edition of CASA's Flight Safety Australia journal. (2) & (3) When intelligence is received about possible use of & unapproved parts, the relevant CASA District Office investigates the claims. If there is evidence to support the claim, the matter would be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) or, if criminal acts are suspected, the information would be referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for action. To date, CASA's investigation have not revealed to support a brief being referred to the DPP. In one case, evidence has been provided to the Australian Federal Police, which was considered insufficient by the AFP to mount a prosecution. In May 1996, a special audit of a helicopter maintenance organisation was undertaken by CAS A. No evidence was found to support allegations that unapproved parts were being used. From the information available from local and overseas sources and the investigations undertaken by CASA, there is no real evidence to indicate that the use of unapproved parts in Australian registered aircraft is prevalent. However, CASA recognises that the use of unapproved parts is a potential problem and the initiatives outlined above are designed to increase industry and CASA District Office staff awareness. Terrorism Groups in Australia (Question No. 1698) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Is he able to say how many extreme right wing militia and terrorist groups are operating within Australia. (2) Is the exposure and prosecution of right wing militia and terrorist groups who are found to have committed prosecutable offences an objective of the Government. (3) Are there possible links between extreme right wing militia and terrorist groups and registered and unregistered political parties holding similar extremist views, including the (a) Australia First Party , (b) Australian Refonn Party and (c) Pauline Hanson One Nation Party; if so, is the Government taking action to prevent extreme right wing militia and terrorist groups from having a voice in federal Parliament; if so, what. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is follows: (1) It is not the practice of this government, and I understand that it was not the practice of previous governments, to comment on matters relating to national security. This is clearly a matter relating to national security. (2) The exposure of right (or left) wing militia and terrorist groups whose members have committed prosecutable offences is not a specific objective of the Government. The prosecution of members of such groups (as of other persons) who have committed prosecutable offences is an objective of the Government. (3) It is not the practice of this government, and I understand that it was not the practice of previous governments, to comment on matters relating to national security. Possible links between extreme right (and left) wing militia and terrorist groups political parties holding extremist views are clearly matters of national security. The Government is not, and clearly should not be, taking action to prevent extreme right (and left) wing militia and terrorist groups from having a voice in federal Parliament. In fact, the Government would prefer that extremist views were expressed in debate rather than in violence. Convention on the Rights of the Child: Australia's Report (Question No. 1708) Mr Richard Evans asked the AttomeyGeneral and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) Who determined the terms of reference for Australia's report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. (2) What sum did the report cost to prepare. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The report was prepared in accordance with the guidelines for the preparation of initial reports issued by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. (2) The cost to Government of the preparation of the report is not readily quantifiable. The report was prepared by the joint efforts of federal, State and Territory Governments. Within the federal Government, no specific sum was allocated for its production. I understand however that the printing and production costs for the report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child were in the order of $13,000.00 Black Spot Funding: Park Road, Kogarah Bay (Question No. 1778) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 29 May 1997: (l) Has he received an application for black spot funding from the Kogarah Municipal Council in the electoral division of Barton to enable work to be carried out on Park Road, Kogarah Bay; if so, will he request his Department to consider urgently the application. (2) Is the road now virtually an arterial road because, in addition to the heavy use of the road in peak periods, it is also being used by heavy and transport going to, and coming from, the container wharf at Port Botany. (3) Is the stretch of road between Vaudin and Wyee Streets particularly dangerous with a number of serious and fatal accidents having occurred along it. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is a current nomination from Kogarah Municipal Council for installing a ""New Jersey barrier"" (that is, a concrete median barrier) and edgelines over a 650 metre length of Park Road, between Bayview Street and The Promenade, at an estimated cost of $80,000. Under the Federal Road Safety Black Spot Program all nominations are examined thoroughly. Every proposal is referred to a consultative panel established in each State and Territory for consideration and comment. Submissions from panels are then referred to the Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS). FORS advises me on a suitable program of works for each State and Territory based on the Program's eligibility criteria and the funds available. (2) Park Road is classified as a ""regional road"" under the care and control of Kogarah Municipal Council. (3) The length over which the remedial treatment is proposed, which includes the section between Vaudin and Wyee Street, has recorded seven casualty crashes, including one fatality, from 1992 to 1996. Medical Facilities: Queensland (Question No. 1793) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 3 June 1997: (1) How many: (a) medical practices, (b) general medical practitioners, (c) medical specialists, (d) public hospitals, (e) private hospitals and (t) day surgery centres exist in Queensland in the (i) Sunshine Coast area, (ii) City of Caloundra, (iii) Shire of Maroochy, (iv) Shire of Noosa, (v) Shire of Caboolture, (vi) Shire of Cooloola and (vii) Shire of Kilcoy. (2) What medical specialities are practised in each area referred to in part (1). (3) Is it a fact that there are more than 300 general medical practitioners, 7 public hospitals and 5 private hospitals in the areas referred to in part 1. (4) Are all Australians regardless of ethnic origin, permitted to access and use the services referred to in part 1. (5) Has an application been received for an Aboriginal health centre on the Sunshine Coast; if so, (a) will this duplicate services already available, (b) who lodged the application, (c) are the applicants associated with the (i) Caloundra and District Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation Region Practitioners (a) (i) Sunshine Coast (b) (ii) Caloundra (c) (iii) Maroochy (d) (iv) Noosa (e) (v) Caboolture (t) (vi) Cooloola (g) (vii) Kilcoy (h) 7 (a) The sum of the number of medical practitioners does not equal the total for the Sunshine Coast, since some medical practitioners practise in more than one region. (b) On the assumption that the Sunshine Coast is coterminous with the areas covered in (ii) to (vii). (c) Postcodes 4517, 4518, 4519, 4550, 4551, 4552, 4553 and 4575. (d) Postcodes 4554, 4555, 4556, 4557, 4558, 4559, 4560, 4561, 4562, 4564, 4572, 4573 and 4574. (e) Postcodes 4563, 4565, 4566, 4567, 4568, 4569 and 4571. (t) Postcodes 4504, 4505, 4506, 4507, 4508, 4510,4511,4512,4514,4516 and 4521. (g) Postcodes 4570, 4580 and 4581. or (ii) Kabi Kabi Aboriginal Corporation and (d) will he provide details of the application. (6) Will a health centre be (a) rented or (b) built; if so, what costs are involved. (7) How will patients travel to an Aboriginal health centre and who will pay for the transport costs.",111
186,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) From the records of the Department of Health and Family Services and the Health Insurance Commission, it is not possible to determine the number of medical practices in the regions in question. Details of the number of general medical practitioners (including 'other medical practitioners') and medical specialists (including non specialists working in specialist fields) rendering services on a 'fee-for-service' basis under Medicare in 1995-96, and details of the number of public hospitals, private hospitals and (approved) day surgery centres in the regions in question, are as follows: Day General Medical Medical Spe- Public Private Surgery cialists (a) Hospitals Hospitals Centres 542 328 6 5 123 80 2 1 201 209 1 2 86 39 1 178 122 54 36 (h) Postcode 4515. (2) Based on an analysis of services rendered on a 'fee-for-service' basis under Medicare in 1995-96, the medical specialties practised in each of the regions are as follows: Sunshine Coast-obstetrics and gynaecology, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, plastic surgery, urology, ophthalmic surgery, ear, nose and throat surgery, anaesthesia, psychiatry, radiology, pathology, dermatology, infectious diseases, general medicine, immunology, cardiology, clinical haematology, gastroenterology, renal medicine, neurology, nuclear medicine, paediatrics, rheumatology, thoracic medicine, geriatrics, medical oncology and emergency medicine. Caloundra-general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, ophthalmic surgery, anaesthesia, psychiatry, radiology, general medicine, cardiology, rheumatology and thoracic medicine. Maroochy--obstetrics and gynaecology, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, plastic surgery, urology, ophthalmic surgery, ear, nose and throat surgery, anaesthesia, psychiatry, radiology, pathology, dermatology, infectious diseases, general medicine, immunology, cardiology, gastroenterology, renal medicine, neurology, nuclear medicine, paediatrics, rheumatology, thoracic medicine, geriatrics and medical oncology. Noosa-obstetrics and gynaecology, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery, ophthalmic surgery, anaesthesia, psychiatry, radiology and thoracic medicine. Caboolture-general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, anaesthesia, psychiatry, radiology, general medicine, cardiology, clinical haematology, gastroenterology, paediatrics, rheumatology and thoracic medicine. Cooloola-general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, anaesthesia, radiology and pathology. Kilcoy-nil (3) There are more than 300 general practitioners, and there are 6 public hospitals and 5 private hospitals in the areas referred to in part (1). (4) There is no legal constraint on all permanent Australian residents using these services. The Government is, however concerned to ensure that other constraints, such as the location and appropri98 ateness of services or, in the case of private services, their cost do not in practise exclude some groups, such as Indigenous people. The review I have requested will answer these questions in respect to the Sunshine Coast. (5) Yes-An application for the proposed North Coast Aboriginal Corporation for Community Health was submitted on 13 December 1996. (a) The application was based on a planning study which indicated gaps in a number of aspects of health service in the area, including Dentistry, Women's Health and Grief Counselling. Other gaps determined through an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey of the Sunshine Coast in 1995 included Immunisation, Mental Health, School screening, access to Ear Nose and Throat, and Eye specialists. However, in view of concerns Mr Slipper has expressed, I have ordered a review of health services in the Caloundra region to establish what additional services, if any, would be most appropriate. The reviewers will report to me shortly. (b) The application was lodged on behalf of the Caloundra and District Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation for Youth and Family Support. (c) (i) Yes. (ii) Yes. Mrs Kathleen Hicks (founder) participated on a steering committee which guided the development of the business plan. (d) Yes. A copy of the letter of application and business plan will be supplied to the honourable member. (6) The organisation intended to rent accommodation. However, activity has been suspended pending the outcome of the review. (7) Again, no such plans are being pursued until the review is complete. The organisation's intention was that transport would be provided through an eight seater bus, one station wagon and one sedan through a leasing arrangement at a cost of $18,696 per annum. Unemployment: Fairfield-Liverpool Region of NSW (Question No. 1799) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: (1) Does the Fairfield-Liverpool region suffer the worse unemployment rate in NSW and the second worse in Australia. (2) What sum, and what percentage, of the funding the Government will provide in the 1997Budget for labour market programs, including the work for the dole scheme, will be allocated to the Fairfield-Liverpool area in 1997-98. (3) How does the funding compare to funds allocated for the same purpose in (a) 1993-94, (b) 1994-95, (c) 1995-96, and (d) 1996-97. (4) How many persons regularly use the assistance provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service offices in the Fairfield-Liverpool region. (5) How many persons referred to in part (4) are (a) unemployed, (b) unemployed and receiving some form of social security payment, (c) employed in full time work, (d) employed in part-time work, (e) employed in casual work, (f) employed in part-time, casual work, (g) unemployed and on the waiting list prior to being granted payments from the Minister's Department, (h) unemployed and not-receiving any welfare payments, (i) unemployed but married with a spouse in work and (j) unemployed but living off retrenchment moneys. (6) Will the residents of the Fairfield-Liverpool region have to pay to use the services provided by the CES, or its equivalent; if not, why not. Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) At an average rate of 16.4% in the three months to May 1997, the unemployment rate for the Fairfield-Liverpool region, as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is the highest in New South Wales and the highest in Australia. (2) DEETY A Area Offices have been given indicative allocations for 1997-98 Labour Market Labour Market Program Employer Incentives $13,105,749 Training for Employment Job Seeker Preparation and Support Training for Aboriginals and torres Strait Islanders Industry and Enterprise Entry Level Training TOTAL $19,957,905 Notes: 1. Labour Market Program (LMP) payments may be made to organisations or employers (providers) which have been contracted to provide certain services, or to the unemployed clients who are being assisted. All LMP payments were compiled on the basis of a client's postcode or where payments did not relate to a single client, the providers business address postcode. 2. The existence of a relevant postcode is no guarantee that the activity associated with the payment occurred in Liverpool/Fairfield. In particular, a provider with a business address postcode within LiverpoollFairfield may be conducting LMP projects outside the region. There may also be providers with postcodes outside LiverpoollFairfield who are in fact conducting LMP projects within the region. 3. There are certain types of LMP payments which cannot be categorised by postcode and are therefore not included in the above table. These are Formal Training Allowance, Apprenticeships and New Enterprise Incentive Scheme Allowance payments. 4. 'Employer Incentives' includes Jobstart, New Work Opportunities, LEAP and 10bskills. 5. 'Training for Employment' includes JobTrain, Accredited Training for Youth and Skillshare. 6. 'Job seeker Preparation and Support' includes Special Intervention Program, Job Program expenditure. No allocations have been set at the regional level at this stage. (3) Government funding allocations for labour market programs (LMPs) in the Fairfield-Liverpool region for 1993/94, 1994/95, 1995/96 and 1996/97 are provided in the following table. Financial Year 1996-97 1993-94 1994-95 1995-96 (as at 13/6/97) $13,547,333 $17,497,052 $18,517,188 $4,646,702 $5,854,037 $4,335,691 $3,949,257 $1,697,476 $1,274,024 $1,952,501 $1,280,393 $129,610 $161,829 $340,858 $257,352 $379,368 $644,913 $1,469,764 $1,468,564 $0 $125,767 $930,644 $2,064,382 $21,607,903 $26,526,510 $27,537,136 Clubs, Mobility Assistance, Contracted Placements, External Disability, Post Placement Support and Community Activity Program. 7. 'Industry and Enterprise' includes the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and OLMA. 8. 'Entry Level Training' includes only National Training Wage payments. (Apprenticeships, Group Training and National Skills Shortage payments cannot be categorised by postcode). 9. $13.3m of Accredited Training for Youth expenditure (under TEP) in 1993-94 was not included because ·the payments were to umbrella providers operating on a statewide basis. (4) In April 1997, there were 30,811 persons actively registered with the CES offices in Fairfield and Liverpool combined. While most of these persons were unemployed, a small number were in employment but utilising the services of the CES to obtain other work. (5) (a) Of the 30,811 persons registered with the CES in Fairfield and Liverpool in April 1997, the majority (94%) were either not working or were working less than 35 hours per week. Within CES guidelines, a client is defined as being 'unemployed' where they are actively seeking regular full-time work and: are not employed; or are currently employed on a part-time, temporary or casual basis; and are away from full-time education; or have a medical condition, supported by medical evidence, that limits their capacity to work to a part-time basis, but who are seeking work suitable to their level of capacity; or receive an Disability Support Pension or Sickness Allowance and have been referred by a Disability Panel to the CES, and agreed to develop an Activity Plan with a Case Manager; or are a Jobs Education and Training client. CES statistics on the number of job seekers not working or working less than 35 hours per week are not an officially recognised measure of unemployment and should not be compared with ABS statistics of unemployment. (b)-(j) It is currently not possible to cross classify data from the CES relating to the labour force status of a person with the data from the Department of Social Security (DSS) relating to whether or not they are receiving a social security payment. Further, employment status of persons registered with the CES cannot be disaggregated by full-time, part-time, or casual status. (6) Access to self help employment services such as touch screens and job vacancy data at the CES is free of charge at present and this is expected to continue in the future under the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. The new employment services market will ensure that assistance is directed to those most in need. This means restricting eligibility for services paid for by the Commonwealth to recipients of a qualifying income support allowance and to young people aged 15 to 20 years irrespective of whether they receive income support. Contracts with providers under the new arrangements will preclude them from charging eligible job seekers for employment services. Meat Research Council (Question No. 1862) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 18 June 1997: (1) Further to his answer to my question without !l0tice (Hansard, 2 June 1997, page 4372) concernmg the management of Fututech, has the Meat Research Council (MRC) stated that the Kilcoy plant was never meant to be a commercial success. (2) Did the MRC sign a binding contract to - rovide a fully operational commercial slaughter hne to be built with guaranteed performance targets; if so, is this action (a) contrary to the statement by the MRC and (b) sufficient warrant for a parliamentary inquiry into the management of Fututech and misuse of beef producers' funds. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Meat Research Corporation (MRC) has advised that the Kilcoy plant was established as a commercial prototype to test, as a research project, the operation of the Fututech system under commercial circumstances. The MRC and industry sought an outcome from the research which would demonstrate one way or the other if, under commercial circumstances, the new technology would provide benefits for industry. The research project was not established for the reason of making a profit for the MRC, although the MRC would have derived significant benefits from royalties and patents had the project proved successful. (2) See reply (1) above. A contract for this research was entered into by MRC. (a) No. (b) No. Brisbane Airport: New Runway (Question No. 1863) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 18 June 1997: (1) Has the Government decided when tenders will be called for work on the proposed new runway at Brisbane Airport; if so, what (a) time frames are involved for tenderers and (b) are the anticipated dates of commencement and completion of the project. (2) What are the costing details of the project. (3) Are there any details, including costing details, pertaining to the alternative option of a new runway parallel to the existing cross runway. (4) Have environmental impact studies been carried out; if so, (a) what and (b) do they show that the proposed runway is a better option than a new runway parallel to the existing cross runway. (5) What will be the expected increase in the number of domestic and international flights in and out of Brisbane after the project is completed. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(5) The sale of Brisbane Airport was completed on 1 July 1997, and the new airport operator, Brisbane Airport Corporation Limited, took control of the Airport on 2 July 1997. Consequently, any proposal for a new runway at Brisbane Airport is a matter must be initiated by the new Airport operator. Under the provisions of the Airports Act 1996, any plans for a new runway will need to be submitted to me for approval. Before they are submitted, any major development proposal must go through an extensive public consultation process. In addition, if the new airport operator wanted to proceed with a new runway, consideration of the environmental impact under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 would have to be undertaken as part of the approval process, and the operator would have to meet, and adhere to, all the other strict environmental standards set out in the Airports Act and under the accompanying regulatory regime. In relation to previous environmental impact studies, such studies were carried out when the airport was developed in the late 1970s, early 1980s. However, there was no option considered for a runway parallel to the existing cross runway. Export Facilitation Scheme: Motor Vehicle Exports (Question No. 1872) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Is it a fact that the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) discriminates against most car component exporters in the way export credits are calculated; if so, will the Government remove the discrimination from EFS arrangements so that there is parity among all exporters in the car manufacturing and car component manufacturing industries. (2) Do exports of motor vehicles, engines and transmissions earn credits under the EFS by reference to the local content of the exports based on a formula that includes the value of raw materials in the export of the goods, whereas car component exports raw materials are excluded by reference to a value added formula. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The rules for the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) are set out in a 1994 publication by the Australian Customs Service, Administrative Arrangements to the Year 2000 for the Automotive Industry. EFS is due to expire in the year 2000 and the Government has no plans to amend it in the meantime. (2) Yes. Export Facilitation Scheme: Replacement (Question No. 1873) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: Does the Government have a structure to replace the Export Facilitation Scheme after 2000; if so, (a) what and (b) will the replacement scheme be equitable to all exporters including exporters of vehicles, engines and transmissions on the one hand and exporters of car components on the other. Mr Moore--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has announced that it will introduce a new scheme when the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) expires. It will not be related to export performance. Details of the scheme are still under consideration. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Reconciliation Convention Assistance (Question No. 1880) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide assistance for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne in May 1997; if so, what. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Department of Industrial Relations: Reconciliation Convention Assistance (Question No. 1883) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, on for all other notice, on 23 June 1997: Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide assistance for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne in May 1997; if so, what. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Reconciliation Convention Assistance (Question No. 1891) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide assistance for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne in May 1997; if so, what. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No assistance was provided by the Department for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne. Department of Primary Industries and Energy: Funding Assistance to Australian Local Government Association (Question No. 1899) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide grants to the Australian Local Government Association in 1995-96: if so, what. (2) How were funds referred to in part (1) expended. (3) Were funds referred to in part (1) fully expended for the purpose for which they were granted. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) Yes, the National Landcare Program Grant $86,800. (2) Salary and operating costs of the National Local Government Landcare Policy and Liaison Officer. Project objectives were: to promote landcare in local government; to report on the achievement of sustainable resource management by local government; to assist in the co-ordination of nationalJdepartmental activities relating to or affecting the National Landcare Program; and to report and provide advice as part of developing proposals for future direction of local government in natural resource management. (3) Yes. Department of Industrial Relations: Funding Assistance to Australian Local Government Association (Question No. 1902) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, on notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide funding grants to the Australian Local Government Association in 1995-96; if so, what. (2) How were the funds referred to in part (1) expended. (3) Were funds referred to in part (1) fully expended for the purpose for which they were granted. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) received a progress payment of $22,080 from the Department in November 1995 as part of the Local Government Enterprise Bargaining Project. (2) The Local Government Enterprise Bargaining Project was a jointly administered project between the former Office of Local Government in the Department of Housing and Regional Development and the Department of Industrial Relations. The objective of the project was to facilitate enterprise funding bargaining in Local Government. The project provided assistance to local government industrial parties: the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA), the Australian Services Union (ASU) and the Australian Workers Union-Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees Amalgamated Union (A WU/FIMEE). Assistance was shared equally amongst employee and employer representative organisations and was used to employ project officers to assist individual councils to develop enterprise agreements. ALGA engaged 3.5 full time equivalent project officers/facilitators to assist selected councils to develop and conclude enterprise agreements. (3) Under contractual obligations between the Commonwealth and ALGA, it was conditional that prior to receiving a progress payment, a satisfactory progress report and an expenditure statement be submitted. The Department paid a second instalment (ie the $22,080 referred to in (1)) of the grant to ALGA in November 1995 (the first instalment was in 1994-95), after receiving a satisfactory progress report which was written against an approved work program (Schedule A-contract between the Commonwealth and ALGA). Department of Industry, Science and Tourism: Funding Assistance to Australian Local Government Association (Question No. 1904) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide funding grants to the Australian Local Government Association in 1995/96; if so, what. (2) How were the funds referred to in part (I) expended. (3) Were funds referred to in part (1) fully expended for the purpose for which they were granted. Mr Moore-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) NIA (3) NIA Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Funding Assistance to Australian Local Government Association (Question No. 1910) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: (1) Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide funding grants to the Australian Local Government Association in 1995-96; if so, what. (2) How were funds referred to in part (1) expended. (3) Were funds referred to in part (1) fully expended for the purpose for which they were granted. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The only payment made to a local government association in 1995-96 was an $80,000 progress payment towards the $198,720 grant over three years awarded in 1994-95 to the NSW Local Government and Shires Association under the Community Relations Agenda program. (2) The award was expended by the Association to .develop community relations policies and prOjects for use by Local Government organisatIOns. (3) Yes. NA _AGE STATE: NSW Youth Unemployment and Training Benefit Recipients (Question No. 1914) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: How many 16 and 17 year olds resident in each post code area (a) receive some form of unemployment or training benefit and (b) will have their benefits (i) reduced and (ii) discontinued. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) I understand that the information sought is for each post code area in Australia. Please see table below. (b) I understand that the question relates to the introduction of Youth Allowance. The qualification criteria for under 18 year olds for Youth Allowance mean that most young people aged under 18 will be expected to particIpate in full-time education or training until they have achieved Year 12 or equivalent. However, there will be exemptions from this requirement for young people who are sick or homeless, or experiencing temporary family trauma. Young people who have had a job and are temporarily unemployed and those who cannot access an education or training place will also be able to receive Youth Allowance. It is estimated that up to 1,600 young people who ar- currently receiving Youth Training Allowance WIll not be able to qualify for Youth Allowance. This is an estimate of the upper limit of those affected. The actual figure is expected to be lower and WIll depend on the behaviour of individuals. It is not the Government's intention for young people to lose payment and they will continue to have the option of income support if they choose. It is not possible to determine the numbers of young people affected in each post code area.

and Energy, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) Is there a need for one unified national grower representative body for the Wool industry; if so, is the Wool Council of Australia the most suitable body. (2) Does the Australian Wool Growers' tion have a role as a representative of wool growers. (3) Does the Government respond only to a single grower voice; if so, which voice would best represent growers. (4) Has his attention been drawn to (a) a press survey in 1997 which showed a 6% satisfacNA 16 17 16 17 TOTAL 2600 3 4 7 2601 4 4 2602 10 17 27 2603 1 7 8 2604 10 11 21 2605 4 4 2606 5 7 12 2607 2 8 10 2609 1 1 2611 5 9 14 2612 8 11 19 2614 3 8 11 2615 15 42 57 2617 8 20 28 2900 I 1 2 2902 11 20 31 2903 5 6 11 2904 3 10 13 2905 6 24 30 2906 2 10 12 2913 2 4 6 2914 1 I TOTAL 100 229 329 ? 9 2 39 60 101 TOTAL 9 2 39 60 101 tion rate with the Wool Council of Australia and (b) reports that the Western Australian Farmers Federation and the WA Minister for Primary Industries are threatening to break away from the Wool Council. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is for the wool industry to decide what form its national representative body should take, and it is not for others to seek to dictate to the Associa- industry who should represent them. (2) The Australian Wool Growers Association (A WA) has played a valuable role in the debate on wool industry reform. However, AWGA's proposals to both lead the growing industry and manage service delivery, such as promotion and rural research and development, would not be sound policy or reflect good governance principles. (3) It is obvious the Government can most effectively respond to growers if the industry speaks with a clear single voice. I urge AWGA to work with Wool Council in determining whether further reform of Wool Council is needed and to assist the development of proposals to improve the accountability to wool growers of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation (AWRAP). (4) I am aware of a survey conducted by Rural Press in March. However, the small size and limited distribution of the reported survey sample do not give me confidence in the validity of the results. I am also aware that the WA Minister for Primary Industries, Mr House, has expressed support for elements of the AWGA proposal. However, I repeat it is up to growers to decide who should represent them. The Western Australian Farmers Federation voted on 10 July 1997 to continue membership of Wool Council. Firearms Control: Nationwide Agreement (Question No. 1919) Mr Rocher asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: Will he reply to my written representation of 15 May 1996 and written reminders dated 23 October 1996, 8 January, 10 March and 22 May 1997 on behalf of Mrs C. Lovegrove; if so, when. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have received a substantial amount of correspondence in relation to the Nationwide Agreement on Firearms Control and sincerely regret the delay in responding to your representation. I have forwarded my response to you under separate cover. Bifenthrin Pesticide (Question No. 1920) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to claims that the pesticide Bifenthrin is responsible for the decline of aquatic species in Brisbane's waterways and other waterways throughout Australia. (2) When was the pesticide first approved. (3) By whom was it approved. (4) What testing was carried out prior to its approval. (5) What is an acceptable level of use of the pesticide and is the level adhered to. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether (a) in The Netherlands and the USA there is a limit on the amount of Bifenthrin which is allowed in foodstuffs and (b) Bifenthrin is toxic in small amounts and when mixed with other chemicals is fatal at 1 part per trillion. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of these claims. The claims are based primarily on Queensland Government laboratory analyses of sediment samples from affected waterways which initially indicated the presence of Bifenthrin. However, a close check of these analyses showed that the presence of Bifenthrin could not be confirmed. Subsequent analyses of samples from fourteen other waterways of concern failed to detect Bifenthrin in all but two of the samples, in which trace amounts of Bifenthrin were reported. The problem is still being investigated by the Queensland Department of the Environment, and the most recent advice is that they have yet to identify the cause (which mayor may not be related to chemicals). (2) and (3) The first product based on Bifenthrin was cleared, following assessment, by the NRA on 23 November 1993. At that time, applicants needed to also comply with the requirements of those Statesrrerritories in which the product was to be registered and sold. The first Statefferritory in which this product was approved was NSW on 3 December 1993. (4) The NRA's legislation requires it to satisfy itself regarding a prescribed range of matters prior to allowing registration. Assessments of full environmental studies, including studies involving aquatic sediments, and of studies relating to effects on human health, were carried out by the NRA prior to clearance. (5) Very precise directions regarding acceptable use rates and directions for use appear on the labels. Because Bifenthrin, like other members of the synthetic pyrethroid family of chemicals, is known to have of this fact as a condition of registration. Control-of-use is a Statefferritory responsibility. I am not aware of violations of the approved use-rate for this chemical. (6) (a) Bifenthrin is approved for many uses in city the USA, and, accordingly, maximum residue limits (MRLs) for a range of foodstuffs are prescribed in that country. Bifenthrin is currently not registered for use in The Netherlands, and no MRLs have been prescribed in that country. (b) There is no evidence to suggest that Bifenthrin at a concentration of 1 part per trillion, either alone or in combination with other chemicals, is toxic to humans. The Minister for the Environment is providing a reply to this part of the question as it pertains to the environment.

(3) Will the publication of letters in Nature be given full faith and credit academically for Australian researchers. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) Nature is a highly prestigious scientific journal published in England which reports much ground-breaking research; (b) Articles and letters published in Nature are subject to international refereeing; (c) The Minister understands that some important scientific discoveries are published in Nature.

Letters to Nature were reported in one of the categories not retained. (3) This decision does not reflect a view of the worth of letters to Nature. It is not possible for the collection to cover more than a sample of publication types without becoming too complex and resource-intensive once again.
