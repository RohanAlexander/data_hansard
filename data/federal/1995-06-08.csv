2,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"--'-by leave-On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the Finance minute on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts report No. 333 entitled The sale of Aussat. The committee's report stemmed from an audit report into the sale and contained four recommendations. These recommendations were aimed at ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are· in place to monitor the performance of obligations arising from the Aussat sale in the years leading up to the termination of the telecommunications duopoly in 1997 and to draw lessons from the sale process to develop more effective procedures and controls for the benefit of future sales of government assets and business enterprises. I believe the committee's recommendations have made a valuable contribution in these areas and it is pleasing to note the generally positive responses contained in the Finance minute. I commend the minute to the House. TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CARRIER LICENCE FEES) AMENDMENT BILL Consideration resumed from 11 May. Second Reading",11
3,Ms MCHUGH,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to enable the telecommunication standardisation component of Australia's contribution to the International Telecommunication Union to be recovered through carrier licence fees payable by telecommunications carriers from 1 July 1995. The ITU is a United Nations specialised agency which is concerned with international cooperation in the use of telecommunications and the radio frequency spectrum. It establishes agreements and recommended world standards for telecommunications and radiocommunications services. Currently, telecommunications licence fees Report only recover the public interest regulatory costs incurred by the Australian Telecommunications Authority, and the total fees payable by the carriers must not. exceed the appropriation provided to Austel for the previous financial year. Carrier licence fees are payable on 1 July 1995. Inclusion of the ITU contribution in carrier licence fees is in addition to Austel' s appropriations and will exceed the amount able to be collected under the current legislation. An amendment to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991 is therefore necessary to enable the full recovery of the telecommunication standardisation component of the ITU contribution from carriers from 1 July 1995. Australia's ITU contribution for a given calendar year is paid prior to the commencement of that year. The amount of the ITU contribution is likely to change every year. The amount to be recovered from carriers for telecommunications sector activity will depend upon the level of the total ITU contribution, which is set in Swiss francs and is subject to exchange rate variation, and the share ascribed to the telecommunication 1995 standardisation sector of ITU activity. The bill provides for an amount to. be determined under the regulations as the proportion of the Commonwealth's contribution to the total budget of the ITU for a calendar year that is attributable to matters relating to telecommunication standardisation. It is proposed to amend the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Regulations to prescribe a procedure for determining the additional fee before 1 July 1995 in order for the ITU contribution to be included in the carrier licence fees due on that date and on 1 July of each succeeding year in respect of a general telecommunications licence or a public mobile licence. Financial Impact The financial impact of the. proposed amendments on carriers will be to increase the annual amount payable. in licence fees by' a total of approximately $1 million. The cost will be shared by carriers on the basis of their share, of telecommunications traffic. I commend the bill to the House.",11
4,Dr KEMP,COMMITTEES,"'-Under the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991, the total' of the annual telecommunications licence fees must hot exceed the cost of running the industry regulator, Austel, in the previous fiscal year. The Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill 1995 seeks to change the upper fees limit, allowing the government to also recover the costs of Australia's contribution to the International Telecommunication Union, the international telecommunications regulatory body. In 1994-95 the cost of running Austel was $12.6 million, all of which was funded by the carriers-namely Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone. The ceiling allows the government to internalise the costs of telecommunications industry regulation by making the carriers pay for the regulator, while preveiltingthe use of carrier licences for the purposes of general revenue generation. The International Telecommunication Union is a United Nations body charged with prescribing telecommunications standards, radio communications planning and other related activities. Whilst Australian carriers currently make their own separate lTD contributions, the Australian government contribution to , these payments to the lTD in 1993-94 totalled $4.86 million. Prior to 1991, Telecom, OTC and Aussat paid for the government's lTD contribution. Australia's contribution to the operation of the lTD is quite high relative to the size of our economy and the contributions of similar developed nations. The proposed amendment raises the ceiling on carrier fees so as to include the telecommunications standards component of Australia's lTD contribution, allowing the government to 'recover this outlay from the telecommunications carriers. Regulations will determine the size of this component. There appears to ,have been no official notification to the carriers that this bill was being prepared. The carriers, I understand, accept the general principle that domestic, industry specific regulation should be funded by the industry, but they are less thanenthusiastic about covering payments to international bodies. The carriers have no official position on this matter due to the lack of warning of the bill being introduced. According to the explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill, the government intends to recover about $1 million of its contribution from the carriers in the coming financial year. There appears to be no provision for fee reductions in recognition of corporate contributions by the carriers directly to the lTD. Telstra will bear the cost of this measure, as it is by far the largest carrier. However, it is li-ely that it will offset this increased levy with a commensurate cut in its own lTD contribution. The net effect is likely to be a reduction of Australia-s total contribution to the lTD. The bill is expected to reduce the burden on the taxpayer, as it transfers responsibility for government payments to the lTD to industry. The coalition will not oppose this. bill, but I take this opportunity to once again deplore the government's lamentable record in this portfolio. As we have seen in the past, the government is determined to blindly charge ahead with its own agendas, with a total lack of consultation with those people who will be directly affected by the changes-the telecoinmunications industry. This lack of consultation is quite startling, given the lack of any urgency behind this bill. The responsibility for making these payments will fall on industry and, while the amounts will not seem excessive, the carriers should have at least been notified that the changes proposed by this bill were to be made. With this in mind, the coalition will carefully scrutinise any regulations which come before the House under this bill. The proposed regulations will determine the size of the telecommunications standards component of Australia's lTV contribution, an amount which is payable by government and recoverable by government from the carriers. It is to be hoped that some consultation, or at least some warning of the nature and scope of the regulations, will be given to the carriers.",12
5,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"We are here today to consider the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill 1995. In 1991 the government introduced a package of legislation aimed at reforming the telecommunications industry. One of the provisions· of the Telecommunications Act 1991 was to allow for network competition by giving the Minister for Communications and the Arts power to license Australian trading corporations as general telecommunications carriers. General carriers are the primary providers of Australia's telecommunications services. The act also provides for a licensing regime for public mobile carriers who supply public mobile telecommunications services. The Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Act 1991 provides that the holders of general telecommunications licences or public mobile licences must pay a fee to the Commonwealth for the licence. Section 6 of the act sets out the limit on total annual fees that become payable under the act. The amount of the fees or the formula by which fees are determined is set out in regulations. According to the second reading speech for the 1991 legislation: It is intended that the amount or the formula determined by the regulations should represent a reasonable estimate of the administrative costs borne by Austel in directly regulating the activities of the carriers . . . There is an upper limit on the total of the fees that may become payable under this legislation in anyone financial is the amount of Austel's appropriation from the consolidated revenue fund for the previous financial year. The amendment proposed in this bill would add to this limit an amount which is a proportion of the Commonwealth's contribution to the total budget of the International Telecommunication Union-the lTV. The upper limit will thus be fixed by a combination of Austel's appropriation plus a proportion of the Commonwealth's contribution to the ITU. The amount of the Commonwealth's contribution to the lTV, which will be taken into account for the purpose of determining the limit on the total of annual fees, will be determined by regulation. The amendment applies to fees payable for general telecommunications licences and public mobile licences from 1 July 1995 or from 1 July in each succeeding year. As has been said by the shadow minister for employment, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), there is broad support for this legislation across both sides of the House. But it is also an opportunity to reflect on what has been happening in recent years in the telecommunications sector. This government has launched into a major reform in the telecommunications industry as an industry where there is significant potential export benefit, where there is scope for significant job growth and where there is an industry which-when we talk about the need for a smarter country-fits into that with respect to the increasing levels of technology and development that are occurring on an ongoing basis. As such, it is an industry that is crucial to the development of Australia's future. We can be proud of what the government has achieved over the years in this area-an area of massive change on a continuing and evolving basis. With respect to what the government has done, there is a range of facts I would like to put on the table. What we have seen is improved efficiency and customer service. That has been as a result of the telecommunications service sector making the changes that have had to be made in the circumstances. That is a great credit to the companies and their year. This limit workers. When we look at today's prices, they are, on average, some 40 per cent lower for the long distance and international markets than they were five years ago. The reform that has occurred in the Australian telecommunications industry has become a model which is being viewed by many countries as a potential way forward for them in terms of adjusting their own status where they have monopoly providers and are looking towards a more competitive, effective and efficient regime. We have countries vlsltmg here on a regular basis, examining what we are doing, using it as a basis for what they are looking at, with respect to change within their own society. Mobile phone use in Australia is up-it is up from around 650,000 users in 1992-93 to over one million users today. With respect to the industry itself, I was recently at a meeting with representatives of the Australian Telecommunications Industry Association. They had a particularly good story to tell with respect to this industry in Australia. It is a growing success story. Seventy per cent of their requirements are provided locally within Australia. Employment wise, they provide around 13,000 jobs directly-and that is not counting the question of indirect job creation as a result of their activities. With respect to investment and advanced manufacturing, we are talking about $100 million per annum. Their local sales within the Australian market, therefore avoiding the need for imports, is around $4 billion per annum. Their export performance is growing and is now valued at around $800 million per annum. They are at the forefront of research and development, with expenditure of around $180 million per annum. They have estimated that value adding per employee has increased 40 per cent over the last five years. It is becoming a more efficient, effective and productive industry and therefore, I think, embraces a range of issues that those on both sides of the House seek to pursue with respect to reform in the economy and in terms of building a more successful and smarter economy. I think they are getting the runs on the board on a continuing basis. There are a range of examples in relation to export activities which I think highlight the depth of market penetration overseas in a range of different activities and in a range different geographical areas, for example: switching cable and optical fibre contracts in China; submarine cable exports worth $250 million; data communications contracts in China, Europe, Thailand and Malaysia; cable contracts in Vietnam; rural telecommunications components in Indonesia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea; and cellular equipment in South America. Twelve of our telecommunications suppliers are in the top 400 exporters. All of that, I think, points to the fact that we have a vibrant, developing and growing telecommunications industry. That industry is evolving and growing over time and, because it is a continually changing and evolving industry, the regulatory framework it works under has to adjust accordingly. This bill is a necessary although small, I suppose, part of the necessary changes that have to be made to that overall regulatory framework, and it has bipartisan support. This bill is necessary to ensure that that evolution occurs in a way which will assist the growth and development of the industry. I commend the bill to the House.",13
6,Mr STEELE HALL,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak to the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Fees) Amendment Bill, a piece of legislation directly involved with supporting the regulatory authorities of our telecommunications industry and telecommunications network. No-one would disagree with the speaker who has just resumed his seat, the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), in his support of the expansion of the industry in Australia, the improvements in its efficiency and its particularly valuable involvement in export industries through the development of higher technology in research in this country. However, I refer particularly to one part of the telecommunications industry; that is, the mobile phone section. This is directly involved-perhaps as far as the public is concerned it is more directly involved than any other-with regulation through Austel and the application of the telecommunications code. It is in this area that I believe the government is deficient in that it has failed to provide through the Minister for Communicaof tions and the Arts (Mr Lee) a land access code. The minister is required to provide this under the Telecommunications Act. As the act directed last year that the minister should do this, I find it strange that he has not done so and that apparently there is no urgency in providing the code he has been directed to so provide under the legislation passed by his own government. This only highlights the fact that when we have further expansion, as we do have, of the mobile phone system and we enjoy-all of us here do, I expect, and so do many more in the community-the system on a monthly basis, we must know that some people pay a price for the expansion of that system. That price is the diminishing environmental enjoyment of some of the residents of our community who have to put up with the visual impact of increasing numbers of telecommunications towers and antennae. I raised this question in the debate on the budget because I am still involved, as a representative of my constituents, with very unsatisfactory procedures in relation to the installation of antennae and broadcasting equipment to support the mobile phone system. I know that other members, too, have been involved in what they consider to be a very unsatisfactory situation. The basis of why it is so unsatisfactory is that the three existing telecommunications companies involved in the expansion of the mobile phone system are operating under an exempt status in this community. Local, state and most Commonwealth government authorities have no particular authority as to where and how these communications facilities are installed. I, again only as an example, without reiterating my previous remarks in this House, indicate that, whilst the telecommunications code sets out a broad range of activities that the companies must involve themselves in in so installing their equipment, there is an almost total lack of effective involvement locally in any disciplinary measures involved in those companies' activities. In the end, it is only the secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and Austel who can have any particular influence on those installations. I know those companies are becoming more careful of their public relations in this matter, but I give this instance yet again of a defective system as it applied to a lation. The installation involved had been shifted around in the council area because of local opposition to the particular sites that been chosen. Eventually a site was chosen on the roof of a theatre. The council was informed by the company of its plans and plans of a certain dimension were given to the council. The scale on the plans was wrong and when applied to the plan itself produced the wrong measurements of the installation. The plan itself was correct but the scale applied to it, which people used to understand what the size would be, was wrong. The plan supplied to the owner of the building, who agreed to the installation and of course would receive some rental, was wrong. The actual installation is something like 35 per cent bigger than the plans supplied. The council was notified by the company, which the company was obliged to do, and notified only one local resident. The telecommunications code, whilst it has all sorts of instructions to the company to notify the council, has no imperative that the council should notify its own residents. I have been told by a particular council officer in one other council that whilst the council has been notifying residents there is no obligation to do so. The basic problem that concerns the public is that companies, which have proliferated from one to three, are operating under exempt status. As the telecommunications industry is further deregulated, we can expect in 1997 a number of further entries to the mobile telephone network. We can also expect to find possibly a half a dozen or more companies under the current attitude operating under an exempt status that can in law snub their noses, if they so want to do, at the residents whose amenity they will impinge upon. At a time when the whole of the community is looking to visually improve its citiesand we, in South Australia, have a particular local government attitude to get rid of unsightly power poles-we have companies who are exempt from state and local council laws and planning. It is not possible for this situaparticular instaltion to continue. I understand that a review of the situation had is to be made by Austel. I hope most seriously in the reviews that will be carried out that the citizens of Australia will have their authority restored through their elected representatives to council and state governments and to other federal government bodies in relation to their environment and that compensation, which is allowed and provided for for the acquisition of land and physical aspects, will be extended to the destruction of value of properties by the loss of amenity visually, which happens from time to time. Until this is done, there will be continuing injustice to an increasing number of people as more and more antennae are developed. I looked at some statistics provided by my colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who sends out from time to time some very interesting statistics to his colleagues; I do not know whether he sends them to members of the government. He included in the one that came yesterday a reference to the use of mobile phones in Australia. In 1990-91 there were 158 million calls. In 1992-93 there were 411 million calls. Those figures are outdated-I guess they are the last ones available-but they give some indication of the explosion in the use of mobiles phones in Australia and the new installations of towers to support them. This hiatus, in the sense that old rules allow companies to operate under exempt status, will be untenable as companies reach out to make their multimillion dollar profits. That is not an anti-profit statement, but a simple statement of fact that you cannot have private companies proliferating which are able to install their installations with an exempt status in search of private profit. The power of local citizens must be restored in amendments to the telecommunications code. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Gear) read a third time. NA (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 1995 Cognate bill: NA BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 9 May. Second Reading",14
7,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bills will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects to give effect to certain announcements in the 1995-96 budget. In regard to the company tax rate change, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995 will increase the general rate of company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent for taxable income of the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. The increased rate will apply to most companies, including non-resident companies, that are taxable in Australia. The new rate will also apply to public trading trusts, corporate unit trusts and limited partnerships that are taxed as companies. The non-statutory fund income of non-mutual life assurance companies will also be subject to tax at the increased rate. The change in the rate of tax will not apply to certain classes of companies or incomes that are taxed at special rates of tax. The new tax rate will not apply to the statutory fund income or the superannuation business of life assurance companies or to pooled development fund income. It will also not apply to the trustees of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds or pooled superannuation trusts or to registered organisations. The concessional tax rates that apply to recognised credit unions for the income years up to and including 1996-97 are also not affected by the rate change. The change in the company tax rate will affect the operation of the franking accounts of companies. Changes to deal with the franking accounts matters will be provided for in an amendment bill to be introduced later this year. The change in the company tax rate will provide revenue gains in the order of $320 million in 1995-96, $1,570 million in 1996-97, $940 million in 1997-98 and $1,140 million in 1998-99. Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations In the. 1995-96 budget the government announced a review of the taxing arrangements that apply to the life insurance business of friendly societies and life assurance companies. The government is concerned that the review not interfere with the conduct of life insurance business. Accordingly the trustee rates that applied during the 1994-95 income year to the eligible insurance business of life assurance companies, 39 per cent, and friendly societies and other registered organisations, 33 per cent, will be maintained until the 1997-98 year of income while the review is undertaken. The tax rates that apply to the life insurance business of life assurance companies and friendly societies will be aligned as an outcome of the review. . Consequently, amendments in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill will freeze the rate of tax imposed on the eligible insurance business of friendly societies and other registered organisations at 33 per cent for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 years of income. The rebate applying to taxable bonuses paid on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will increase to.33 per cent from 1 July 1995 as scheduled and will be maintained at that level for the year beginning 1 July 1996. The costto the revenue of the measures is expected to be $11 million in 1995-96, $45 'million in 1996-97 and $22 million in 1997-98. There is expected to be a revenue gain of $4 millionin 1998-99. Tax advantaged computer programs The sales tax law contains a concession for goods containing computer programs on reprogrammable microchips .. The concession was introduced in September 1992 through a Senate amendment. In effect, the exemption removed from the taxable value of goods the value of any computer program embodied in a reprogrammable microchip. This meant that a tax benefit could be obtained merely by putting computer programs on reprogrammable microchips instead of nonreprogrammable chips. The government strongly opposed the introduction of this measure, reflecting the range of drawbacks with it. The exemption has allowed some taxpayers to claim large reductions in their sales tax liability, and over all it is estimated to be costing the budget some $150 million per annum. Greater losses are anticipated as manufacturers switch to tax advantaged computer programs. Apart from the fiscal costs, the exemption has caused a range of other problems, including the misallocation of resources by manufacturers using the more expensive reprogrammable microchips solely to get a tax exemption. There have been major problems for taxpayers and the Australian Taxation Office in assessing the value of tax advantaged computer programs. These have resulted in some manufacturers gaining unfair competitive advantages and, given the difficulties with valuing foreign sourced computer programs, it is likely that some Australian manufacturers have been disadvantaged. The Sales Tax· Assessment Act 1992 is being amended to remove the concession in respect· of computer programs contained on non-permanent microchips. This will arrest the significant loss of sales tax revenue arising from the imprecise nature of the exemption, remove anomalies that result in difficulties for taxpayers and promote equity in the marketplace. The treatment of computer programs will be restored to what. it was before the introduction of the 1992 amendment. There. will continue to be a reduction in taxable value for certain programs on microchips in cartridges. The amendments will take effect from budget night. The gain to revenue from the measures is likely to be $10 million for 199495, .$150 million for 1995-96, $160 million for 1996-97, $170 million for 1997-98 and $185 million for 1998-99. Sales tax refunds The sales tax law provides that refunds of sales tax can be obtained only where conditions in the sales tax law are satisfied. These measures provide a level of certainty for both taxpayers and the government in the treatment of claims for overpaid tax. However, common law court challenges are seeking to bypass the specified conditions and extend the refund periods beyond the three year limit in the sales tax law. If successful, these challenges could result in 'windfall' gains to taxpayers of millions of dollars in cases where the tax was not borne by the taxpayer. Measures in these bills will prevent the extension of the refund period and the possibility of windfalls for certain taxpayers. These measures will take effect from budget night. It has not been possible to quantify the financial impact. Consequential changes The Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 also makes changes consequential on the increase in the rate of sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles and on the increase in the company tax rate. Provisional tax uplift factor I will be moving amendments during the detailed consideration of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill to give effect to the eight per cent provisional tax uplift factor for the 1995-96 income year as announced in the budget. The government had originally planned that this change be included in a bill for introduction later in this session but has agreed to a request from the Democrats to bring the matter forward for debate in the context of these bills. Full details of the amendments in these bills are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bills to the House.",16
8,Mr COSTELLO,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"No wonder the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) ran through as quickly as he could that prepared speech, because this is legislation which completely breaks faith with the Australian people, completely breaks faith with Australian companies and completely breaks faith with the promises that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made before the 1993 election. It is a downright taxation fraud. It is one of the great tax lies of the last election campaign. The first of the two bills being dealt with here is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995. This, together with the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995, amends income tax rates to increase the rate of company tax from 33 to 36 per cent. The bill is estimated to reap an additional $320 million in revenue in 1995-96; $1,570 million in 1996-97; $940 million in 1997-98; and $1,140 million in 1998-99: This bill implements a decision which is a complete violation of the assurances that the Prime Minister gave to the Australian people before the 1993 election. For this reason, the coalition will oppose and vote against this bill. The coalition will not be a party to, nor will it endorse, electoral fraud. If this House existed for the purpose of representing people and holding governments accountable, it would be rejecting this legislation. If this House-both sides of the House-took seriously its responsibility of holding governments accountable to the people of Australia, this would be rejected out of hand. On 9,February 1993 the Prime Minister announced in his Investing in the Nation statement that the Labor government would reduce company tax from 39 to 33 per cent if re-elected. On page 45, his Investing in the Nation statement said: To stimulate business investment, the Government will lower the rate of company income tax from 39 cents to 33 cents for taxable income ... On page 59, it said: The reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate to 33 per cent will provide Australian industry with a world competitive tax system. During his Investing in the Nation address at the National Press Club and in the following questioning from journalists the Prime Minister put the hard sell on the cut in the company tax rate. The Prime Minister said: We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian companies to work for Australia.is to lower their tax burden. So, under a Labor Government, on 1 July this year the company tax rate will be reduced from 39 cents in the dollar to 33 cents ... this will make the Australian corporate tax system highly competitive within the OECD countries. He continued: But, I think perhaps more importantly, we will also be competitive with the countries in our region. Australian companies will thus be much better placed to trade with Asia-the region where it is going to matter most. He went on: The imperative is to be competitive now with Asia in the region, and the competitive rates are down around those low 30s. So that's why if we want our dynamic companies ... to go out there and get it, to go out there and take their share of the world market for Australia, you've got to give them a chance. And the chance is at rates comparable with all of the other tax rates in the Asia-Pacific region, and indeed the OECD. And that's why we've taken it down to 33 per cent. Yet here we are in 1995 with a proposal from this government to reverse all of those highfalutin statements, all of those promises that were made before the election to try to gamer in votes, and to dash the hopes of Australian corporates who might have been tempted to believe the Prime Minister. How does he live with his conscience when he does this kind of thing on a regular basis? What possible explanation could there be for the complete violation of all of those highminded sentiments made before the election which were not even carried through for one term of the parliament afterwards? I say to the Australian corporates and to the Australian people: you have seen him do it before; do not trust this character again. He has got form; he is a recidivist, a repeat offender; he is somebody who has tried this trick over and over again. No doubt before the next election the great repeat offender will stand up and say, 'Trust me one last time.' With people like that, you consider their history, you take into account their behaviour and you judge accordingly. There is no basis whatsoever for any Australian corporate or any Australian taxpayer to trust this Prime Minister on a tax promise ever again. However, even with the much vaunted reduction of the company tax rate from 39c to 33c-and remember it is now to be reversed to 36c-there was still a catch. With the announcement to cut the rate of company tax, the government decided to reintroduce quarterly payments of company tax to bring forward receipts to the government. For both 1995-96 and 1996-97 the government expected to match the revenue lost through cutting the rate of company tax by bringing forward company tax receipts. The government's announced increase in company tax in the budget is expected to increase revenue by $320 million in 1995-96 and by $1,570 million in 1996-97. For both 1995-96 and 1996-97 the government has pulled off one of the most remarkable sleights of hand you have ever seen. By reducing company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, by bringing forward company tax receipts and then by raising the company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, the government will collect more revenue than it would have if it had not lowered the rate in the first place. According to the figures contained in the 1993-94 budget, the government expected to fully offset the reduction in company tax from 39c to 33c in 1995-96 by bringing forward payments. In 1995-96 the tax cut would amount to $1,620 million and the new payment arrangements would bring forward an additional $1,620 million. It is a similar story for 1996-97. The tax cut would be $1,700 million, but the bringing forward of tax payments would bring in an additional $1,690 million. As a result of reducing the rate to 33c but offsetting it completely by bringing forward the tax payments, when you now take it back up again you gain extra revenue. This was the tax cut that increased the taxes payable to the government. It was a tax cut that brought in more revenue. This must be one of the greatest tax cuts of all time for this government. As a result of this budget, the rise in the company tax rate will bring in in net terms an additional $320 million in 1995-96 and an additional $1,570 million in 1996-97. The government has achieved a truly remarkable result by cutting the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent down to 33 per cent and raising it back to 36 per cent. It will actually raise revenue. The simple fact is that companies would be paying less tax in 1995-96 and in 1996-97 if the corporate tax rate had remained at 39 per cent with the same payment arrangements in place. In his deficit dalek speech last year at the MTIA national annual dinner, the Prime Minister posed the rhetorical question, when discussing where the government might take action to reduce the budget deficit, 'Are we to increase the rate of company tax when we have at last a rate that is competitive with our Asian neighbours?' On budget night, he answered his own question-yes, we are to increase the rate of company tax when we at last have a rate that is competitive with our Asian neighbours. As a result of transitional arrangements in relation to payments, we have actually increased the tax burden on Australian companies in 1995-96 and 1996-97. This Prime Minister is the real before and after man. There are actually intervening events that can allow you to assess after conduct against before conduct. Before conduct in the light of after practice is shameful conduct. The only thing that actually intervenes is an election. Once he has garnered in the votes, he starts garnering in the taxes. Have you noticed that? Once the votes come in, the taxes come in as well. But for business and corporates the taxes go out. But you will recall that the whole expression of this promise-the before promisewas that we had to have a rate of corporate tax which would allow Australian companies a go in the Asian region; that we would get a rate which was competitive with our Asian neighbours. I am not aware-and now, of course, we are putting it up--that any of our Asian neighbours have been increasing their corporate tax rates lately. I am not aware that this is being driven by an increase in the region so that we can match it without taking a competitive disadvantage. The simple fact is that our Asian neighbours are not increasing their corporate tax rates. Some of the applicable rates in the region are: 34c in Malaysia, 27c in Singapore and 30c in Thailand. So it has nothing to do with the Asian region. In fact, if we measured the after conduct by the before promises, all we would have to say is that the Prime Minister is actually trying to make our rates uncompetitive with Asia. That is the net effect; that is the logical conclusion. If the whole thing was premised by this view of competitiveness with Asia, the only explanation as to the current arrangements is uncompetitiveness with Asia: That must be the logical conclusjon. The government must face that fact. When the Assistant Treasurer came in, was there any explanation as to why it was no longer necessary to have competitive rates with Asia? Was there any explanation as to why it was no longer necessary to have the rate that the Prime Minister had promised before the election? None whatsoever. We got the feeling that the Assistant Treasurer was going to get this bill in here and get out of this place as quickly as he could. Of course he could not explain it, and he has now run out of the chamber. Who would 'want to be around while the logic of the utter fecklessness of this Prime Minister with Australian corporates is being discussed here in the people's chamber? In order to obtain an understanding of the government's true motivation behind the decision to increase company tax, it is also necessary to carefully scrutinise and sift through the words of the Treasurer· (Mr Willis). In his budget night speech the Treasurer said: Now that the economy is. growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make a contribution to tightening of fiscal policy. Accordingly, the rate of company income tax will be increased from 33 to 36 per cent for the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. If we compare that language about contributions to tightening of fiscal policy with what the Treasurer was saying in the lead-up to the budget, the sheer magnitude of the Treasurer's hypocrisy,. whose utterances are increasingly intellectually bankrupt, is revealed. On 30 November last year, in answer to a question on .business tax concessions, the Treasurer said: Well, I don't want to comment on individual elements except to say this, that in that area of change to business tax there was certainly a considerable concern to get the economy moving again, so it was done with an eye to cyclical improvement. But it was also done with an eye to structural change, and that is to provide some longer term encouragement to investment. So I don't thiQk it would be a case of simply saying, 'NQw the economy is growing well, we can rip all that away.' We clearly have to bear in mind the sorts of factors that we did take into account in making those changes, which were particularly the need to have a competitive tax regime for business .. So in November last year he was saying that this was done with an eye to the long term for a competitive tax rate. He was saying that it was done with an eye to structural change. Yet, in his'own words, in his own budget, six months later when he said it was not the kind of thing you could rip all away, what did he do? He ripped it all away. It was a structural change which lasted all of six months. I would hate to see it temporary change from this Treasurer, wouldn't you? It was a structural change which lasted all of six months. He said that it was not done with an eye to being cyclical, he was not going to rip it away if things got better; yet he has stood up here and said, 'You know that tax rate reduction, it's all off.' He is utterly intellectually bankrupt. It is the same with the Commonwealth Bank. The words and the intentions of the Treasurer in the prospectus amount to nothing. The rise in company tax is just a grab for cash. The government has shown that it is incapable of controlling the growth in its own purpose outlays so it is resorting to new tax hikes. On the revenue side of the budget, the government will collect an additional $14 billion, a 12 per cent increase on the last financial year. Included in this rise the Treasurer and the Prime Minister will raise taxes by another $2 billion in 1995-96 alone. An extra $17 billion will be raised in revenue over the next four years as a result of changes announced in the budget, and $15.2 billion of that represents the imposition of new and increased taxes. When you carefully analyse the budget, you can see that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are blind on one side. The only side they see is the revenue side. But I have to give credit where credit is due. The government undertook an extensive bid to soften up the community for this feckless repudiation of its election promise. The government sank to new depths in relation to spreading disinformation when people from the Treasurer's office were running around the press gallery saying that it was business that wanted a rise in the corporate tax rate. This reached new heights of ludicrous proportions when the Australian Financial Review on 24 April carried a front page headline of 'Business faces $1 billion tax rise'. The report said that the government had won big business support for a two per cent increase in the company tax rate as long as dividend imputation remained intact. I remember being asked about this by journalists, and I said to them, 'If business wants a company tax rise, get one of them on the news tonight saying that it wants its company tax to be put up.' Later in the day, the Business Council of Australia completely denied the story. It revealed the story for what it was: a government inspired story having nothing to do with business or business intentions. It was what we have seen so often in relation to the budgets brought down by the master deceiver, the Prime Minister: the softening up of the public, the planting of press stories and the massaging of public opinion to try to provide a cover for the real intentions. The government's real intentions were tv increase the revenue, having the effect of reducing competitiveness; to renege on an election pledge; and to tum around the structural change. The Prime Minister is blind on one side; he sees only the revenue side of the Commonwealth accounts. The Business Council completely repudiated that story, and the opposition completely repudiates this bill. We are determined to make sure that this government is held to its promises. Other parties in other chambers of this parliament once used to say that their role was to keep government honest. Here is their chance. To vote with the government on this bill is essentially to sanction electoral fraud, the dishonest breaking of election promises and the dishonest repudiation of the tax reductions. We in the opposition want to make this clear: we will not vote for tax lies; we will not vote for the repudiation of election promises. We will vote to make sure that the government is held accountable by this side of the House at least. For that reason, we will oppose the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill, which increases company tax to 36 per cent. The second bill which is being debated cognately is the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill. This bill has several different aspects which I would like to deal with in some detail. The coalition opposes some parts of the bill and will vote against some parts in the committee stage. There are other parts of the bill which we do not oppose. Firstly, schedule 1 of the bill makes consequential amendments in relation to the rise in the company tax rate. These consequential amendments are designed to ensure that the increase in the company tax rate will not apply to the concessional rates of tax that apply to recognised medium and recognised large credit unions for the 1995-96 and 199697 years of income. The coalition has no concerns about this aspect of the bill because it would like to see those concessions restored. Should we have thought that the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill-which puts up the company tax-would be defeated, we would have opposed this path. We assume, however, that the first bill increasing company tax will go through. If that is the case, there is no need to oppose this schedule which inserts the concession. We want to see concession for recognised medium and recognised large credit unions preserved. Secondly, schedule 2 of the bill amends the income tax law to freeze the rate of tax imposed on the eligible insurance business of friendly societies and other registered organisations at 33 per cent for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 income years. In addition, the rebate applying to taxable bonuses paid on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will increase to 33 per cent from 1 July 1995 as scheduled and will be maintained at that level for the year beginning 1 July 1996. The government has decided to introduce this tax freeze to enable the review of the taxing arrangements that apply to the life insurance business of friendly societies and life assurance companies. However, this review has been under way since 1989 and the legislation does not remove the 16gislated rise in the tax rate to 39 per cent in 1997-98 and later years. The coalition opposed the increase in the tax on friendly societies and other registered organisations back in 1993. It was yet another case of the violation of the government's electoral mandate. So the coalition will not oppose this freeze. The third part of the bill makes consequential amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 because of the increase in the sales tax applied to passenger motor vehicles by the sales tax exemptions and classifications modification bills. In his One Nation speech on 26 February 1992, the Prime Minister stated: From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be pennanently lowered to 15 per cent. This is another one of these permanent structural changes that the Prime Minister used to talk about in his before manifestation that was taken away in his after manifestation. The Prime Minister now dismisses all of those promises with an increase in sales tax on motor cars. Again, this is another feckless repudiation of promises made in an effort to get votes. The coalition has made it entirely clear, again for the same reason, that it will hold the government accountable for its promises. We will not sit by and let this Prime Minister continue to repudiate his assurances to the Australian people. The coalition opposes the increase in sales tax on motor vehicles because it is another violation of the electoral mandate, and, as a consequence, we will oppose clause 3, part 1 of schedule 3; part 2 of schedule 3; and schedules 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 contained in this bill. The fourth part of this bill amends the old and new sales tax legislation to ensure that the only access to credits or refunds of overpaid sales tax is via the provision of the sales tax law itself. In other words, the government seeks to prevent common law claims for tax refunds outside the wholesale sales tax legislation. The bill amends the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 and the Sales Tax Amendment (Transitional) Act 1992 to ensure that refunds of sales Itax may be obtained only through the procedut,es prescribed by the provisions. The current s-les tax law provides two grounds for the paym-nt of refunds-refunds of sales tax which w-re legally payable and refunds of amounts paid as sales tax which were not legally rep""ayable. The effebt of the amendment is that claimants who dp not satisfy the conditions of the two grounds will not be entitled to a refund. Both the current law and the former sales tax legislation contain three-year limitations on claims for refunds and a requirement that the person who bore the tax must actually receive the refund. The amendment will apply to liabilities to pay refunds arising after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May 1995 and liabilities to pay refunds arising at or before 7.30 p.m. on 9 May if legal proceedings to enforce payment of the refunds were commenced after that time. The coalition believes that common law remedies should not be closed off; therefore, we will oppose that part of the bill. Common law remedies are entitlements under the law which apply generally. Why should they be closed off in relation to sales tax? This is as found by the courts in accordance with the principles of jurisprudence, and the coalition cannot see why the statute should close those remedies off. They are the only remedies available at law and the law should not be amended to close them off. The final part of the bill deals with removing the sales tax exemption for computer programs on reprogrammable microchips. The bill amends the Sales Tax Assessment Act to limit the tax advantaged computer program concession. Since 1 January 1993 taxpayers have enjoyed a concessional taxable value on a wide range of goods, such as computers, mobile phones and whitegoods, which contain computer programs housed in reprogrammable microchips. Reprogrammable microchips are microchips into which software is not embodied permanently such as erasable programmable read-only and Flash ROM. Software supplied on an erasable program read-only memory or similar device is totally erasable and can be replaced with new software. It has been alleged by the government that the exemption has allowed unexpected and large deductions in relation to sales tax. The government maintains that the concession was intended to encourage innovation, but has instead encouraged wastefulness as manufacturers add non-permanent microchips to their goods in order to qualify. When supporting this proposal in the Senate, the coalition indicated that it did so with some reluctance. We know that the government says that this has created an unforeseen anomaly. This is not in the category of a tax violation or a violation of the Prime Minister's promises to the Australian people before the last election; therefore, we will not vote against it. We do, however, say that the effects of the exemption should be closely monitored. It should not be used to anybody's detriment, if it has a wider effect than anticipated. Given the fact that the government maintains it is but an anomaly, we recognise the right of the government to close down anomalies which would otherwise open wide holes in the administration of the taxation system. The Assistant Treasurer indicated in his law speech that he will be moving an amendment in relation to the provisional tax uplift factor. Our view in relation to that provisional tax uplift factor is that the government has specified the wrong amount. I will put my case in relation to that when the amendment is moved. We will make our own amendment to that. We will vote against the government's tax lies, and we will oppose those sections of those bills which I have outlined in my speech.",18
9,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I have been sitting here wondering who I would follow in this debate, and I find it is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mf Costello). The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was in here the other night telling us how we need sophisticated debate on tax legislation-which, incidentally, he did not give us. My goodness, something has happened; he is not here this morning. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is not here to debate the issue, nor is anyone else from the government side. There is not one member listed to speak in defence of the tax: imposition that these bills before us represent. The next item of business-the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995-must be a good area for members opposite. They. must see something in it which they can sell, because there are five government members listed to speak about it. They are going to laud it. They can speak for their expenditure programs and the largesse afforded by the government out of taxpayers' funds, but they cannot come in here and explain to the people why they have to raise so much money, why they needed to tell those lies in the lead-up to the last election and why they needed to break those promises. Not one person.",23
10,Mr COBB,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,They are embarrassed.,24
11,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Some, with a bit of a conscience, are so embarrassed that they cannot find their way into the chamber to defend government taxation programs. These two bills, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, are the latest in the 1995-96 budget bills to be debated. They are much like all the others we have seen so far. What they have in common is that they all raise taxes. It is all about raising money. Some might be thinking, 'What's new?' It is true that Labor's tax record is a disgrace. It has invented new taxes. It has raised existing taxes. It has brought forward the collection of taxes. But these bills take the biscuit, in that they continue to represent the broken promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the lead-up to the 1993 election. This is not the first evidence of the broken promises from the 1993 election campaign. . The Dawkins horror budget-which honourable members will remember-put paid to Labor's general promise on taxation and demonstrated that the re-election of Labor was based on fraud. It was based on deceit. The Australian people were simply lied to. How different this outcome is from the Prime Minister's words on 19 November 1992 on Lateline, when he said-and I will keep on repeating this-'What I am promising is not to put up tax.' The Prime Minister has been udtrue to himself but, more importantly, he has condemned the Australian people to pay for his inability-admittedly, through -. speech impediment-to get his tongue a-ound the truth. President Bush, you will rpcall, Mr Deputy Speaker, once told the IAmerican people, 'Read my lips-no new taxes.' President Bush broke his pledge to the American people-and he paid the price. Th- American people threw him out of the White House at the first chance they got. The Prijhe Minister had better start packing his bags because the people will get the opportunity to deliver retribution in this country: at the next election they will toss this man out of the Lodge. Labor has broken its promises in terms of income tax, company tax, indirect taxes and any other tax or charge we can care to mention. We had income tax cuts which were legislated; they were l-a-w, law. But the reality is that they were l-i-e-lie, lie, lie. The government also goes some way to showing its increased confusion in terms of establishing sound tax policy. The reality is that this government now has no policies. It simply has no policies. It certainly did not have at the last election. A combination of lies, criticism, criticism and even more criticism was all they offered to the electorate in the run-up to the 1993 poll. It is no surprise that, after the election, the Prime Minister called the departmental secretaries into his office and demanded they go back to their departments to produce policies which his government could pursue. That was after the election. So certain was the present Prime Minister that he would lose in 1993 that, after he fell over the electoral finishing line, he had no plans, he had no policies, and he certainly had no vision. Now he wants us to reveal our policies so he can pinch them. He has Buckley's. The increase in the rate of company tax: is a perfect illustration of the government lacking a policy direction. The government's rhetoric constantly alters, as you know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker, and its policy positions keep shifting. So it is little wonder that under this regime the business community is banging its head against a brick wall. After all, business needs stability if it is to undertake new investment and strive to compete'in new markets. The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill 1995 amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to increase the rate of company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. This increased rate is to apply to most companies and extend to others which are taxed as companies. The amendment will apply from the 1995-96 financial year and to all years thereafter, unless Labor decides to alter the tax rate once again-or unless we get a. coalition government, which will provide some stability and maintain a sense of direction for the tax paying corporate sector. In 1995-96 thiswill mean that government revenues will benefit to the extent of an extra $320 billion. In 1996-97, though, the take increases to $1.570 million dollars-$1.57 billion. The extra take in 1997-98 will be $940 million, and in 1998-99 it will be back over the magic $1 billion mark to $1.140 billion. The government claims that the compliance cost is negligible, but I will get back to that in a little while. In the 1993-94 budget the government announced that it was reducing the rate of company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent-and how well we all remember that. On 9 February 1993, the Prime Minister stated: We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian companies to work for Australia is to lower their tax Coming on top of the accelerated depreciation allowances announced in 'One Nation', this will make the Australian corporate tax system highly competitive within the OECD countries. But,more importantly, we will also be competitive with countries in our own region. Australian companies will thus be better placed to trade with Asia-the region where it is going to matter most. That was all fine and dandy and hard to argue with. Before the 1993 election, the Prime Minister also stated: As part of a dynamic East-Asian growth region and with increasing strength in education, training research and development, Australia is well poised to take advantage of these trends. Our integration into the Asian regional economy, however means that we need to compare ourselves not just with OECD members, but with regional competitors for new manufacturing and large-scale processing facilities. Amen to that. The Prime Minister claimed that to aid that integration the government would therefore cut the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. He said this would: . . . encourage firms to invest out of increased retained earnings and improve the competitiveness of Australia's business tax regime compared with our regional neighbours. We agreed with that. In response to a question by the member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) on 18 November 1993 about tax rates in the east Asian economies and about whether Australia's company tax rate is competitive by the standards of the east Asian economies, the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, replied: As the Deputy and Acting Prime Minister indicated, the Prime Minister is on his way to APEC for the APEC leaders' meeting, which is evidence of the increasing economic integration of the nations of the region and, most particularly, a measure of the integration of Australia with many of the countries in that region. It is for that reason that the government has been keen to compare the investment climate in Australia with climates which operate in some of the countries of south-east and north-east Asia. The question refers to comparable company tax rates in the east Asian area. Perhaps it is worth reminding the House of what those rates are for a selected group of companies. I admit that, but they are the more advanced burden. industrially, nevertheless. He continued: For Japan the company rate of tax is 37Y2 per cent; Taiwan, 25 per cent; Korea, 36Y2 per cent; Thailand, 30 per cent; Malaysia, 34 per cent; Indonesia, 35 per cent; Singapore, 30 per cent; and the Philippines, 35 per cent. If one averages those rates which I have mentioned, the unweighted average in these economies would be 33 per cent. That is precisely the rate which. now applies in Australia and, therefore, clearly puts Australia very much in touch with these economies on a comparable basis. So what are we going to do? We are going to penalise that element of the price component of competition by adding another nearly 10 and per cent to the company tax rate. If the words of the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer were true, why do they not apply now? It is a simple question. If their rationale is carried through, are Australian companies now disadvantaged relative to neighbouring Asian countries? If what they said in the first place was true and accurate, then the answer to the question I have just posed is yes. How does the government rationalise this increase in company tax? We all know it is only a grubby attempt to increase the revenue flowing into the Treasury coffers, but Labor claims the increase in company tax is justified because the corporate profit share has returned to record highs, companies have benefited from a number of tax concessions such as investment allowances, accelerated depreciation, et cetera, and now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate the corporate sector should pay more tax. The fact remains that profit share as a percentage of gross domestic product has only just risen above 17 per cent. It has only just recovered to where it was in 1989-90. If you examine company tax as a percentage of total income tax, you see that the figure in 1988-89 was 17.2 per cent, in 1994-95 it was 19.5 per cent and in 1995-96 it was 19.8 per cent. From 1990 to 1992 the figure was above 20 per cent. It is a fact that when the economy dived into recession it was business tax that took up some of the slack. It was business that was called on once again to make up for the errors of this government. It made a contribution then and is being asked to make another. The fact is that projected company tax revenue in this budget is up by 15,4 per cent compared with an increase in total revenue for the coming year of 12.8 per cent. It is up 15.4 per cent in the corporate sector-and this at a time when the consumer price index, the measure of inflation, is projected to increase by only four per cent. That is a real increase of 11.4 per cent. In money terms, it is an increase in company tax of $2.29 billion-$2.29 billion out of the working capital, out of the cash flows, of Australian businesses. Labor is yet again squeezing the business community to pay for its profligacy. Over the last 12 years of hard Labor, while total revenue increased by 177.8 per cent, company income tax increased by 254.9 per cent and total company tax increased by a whopping 370 per cent. That is the record of 12 or 13 Labor budgets. Over the same period, inflation rose by 68.4 per cent. Company income tax has therefore increased in real terms over the past 12 or 13 budgets by almost 200 per cent and all company taxes by 300 per cent or thereabouts. No' wonder the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said on 9 May: The rise in corporate taxation from 33 per cent to 36 per cent will diminish corporate retained earnings and therefore reduce business expansion. It was a measure widely foreshadowed and vehemently opposed by the business community. Higher corporate taxes will undermine business confidence at a time when confidence was already falling. This, and other measures taken which will impact on business revenues, will undermine the recovery process. This increase in tax means one thing: there will be less investment, not just because of the increase in the tax rate but because of the uncertainty about what the rate will be in 12 months, two years and so on into the future. Labor does not know where it is going, and it has not demonstrated where it might like to go. The rise in company tax of three per cent will have a negative effect on business and the whole economy. Will business be forced to put up prices or cut costs by laying off staff? What are the implications of the tax rate increase for long-term inflation? All these questions have to be asked by people making decisions now about how to invest and what capital investments to make. Increasing tax burdens have a crippling effect on small businesses at a time when the government ipforms us that unemployment figures are falling and that our economy is booming. The business community needs the government to fix a rate and stick with it. If long term investment strategies are to be encouraged, then business must be able to reduce as many uncertains as possible in its planning. The commercial world is tough enough out there without our government making things worse. With the original cut in the rate of company tax from 39 to 33 per cent, the government introduced a new quarterly instalment system. Now companies will be hit with a double whammy because they still have to meet the accelerated payment schedassumption ules, as well as now paying this higher rate tax. The compliance costs in this country are and remain simply the highest by far in Western world, with the possible exception the United States. The compliance costs will be higher not only because of the increase in the company tax rate to 36c in the dollar but also because companies will have to maintain three franking accounts, reflecting the tax payable at the three different rates. As Mr Geoffrey Lehmann stated in the Financial Review on 21 April: This will make a complete joke of the income. government's so-called tax simplification projects. Labor promises tax cuts, lower compliance costs and simpler tax law. What it actually delivers opposite. Is it any wonder that the cost of compliance continues to have a dampening effect on the spirit of innovation and competitiveness of small businesses in this country? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has indicated that we will vote against the bill. The advice of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is that the government is going to legislate later by way of amendment an increase of the uplift factor to eight per cent. We will also oppose that and propose alternatives. It is passing strange that the uplift factor should be at eight per cent when we have an estimated inflation rate of four per cent and, allegedly, a growing economy with an implied increase in the corporate business take. Why we need the uplift factor to be at eight per cent is beyond me. If it has to be anything it should be around four per cent. (Time expired)",24
12,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I will make only a short contribution to this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill and Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill as the subject matter has been well and truly covered already. I pick up on what the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was saying towards the end of his contribution about the uplift factor. I regarded the whole concept of an uplift factor as objectionable right from the start because it makes certain assumptions, I suppose, about business profitability that just do not stack up out there. To make some on some ad hoc basis, as it obviof ously is, that because business profits were X last year they are going to be X plus eight per cent in the ensuing year is of great concern. the . As the member for Curtin pointed out of towards the end of his contribution, there is no firm basis for that eight per cent. There is no apparent justification for it because one of the government's great achievements, it keeps telling us, is a low underlying rate of inflation, about four per cent. So there is certainly no justification that we can see for maintaining that uplift factor at eight per cent for 1995-96 and 10 per cent for later years of There has been a lot of debate in this House is the this week about tax. Our fundamental objection to these proposed changes is that they renege on promises that were made before the last election, iron-clad commitments to the contrary . We are being asked to come in here today, apparently, and vote in favour of changes to taxes which are contrary to what we were told prior to the last election. It has become evident to everyone in Australia by now that this government was largely re-elected on the basis of fraud. We had ironclad commitments from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that there would be no increases in taxation. I do not know how you interpret that and I am not sure how the people of Australia react to that but he said unequivocally that there would be no tax increases. Now we are faced somewhere down the track with significant tax increases. There might be all sorts of justifications for that. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) comes in and tells us that this is all part of the necessary fiscal tightening. I can accept that argument. I understand entirely that the government has a role in implementing an appropriate fiscal strategy at each budget session. But the point here that is objectionable is that this option was cut off by the Prime Minister prior to the last election. He used it to great effect, in my view. He made political points which obviously were effective. He made the point that there would be no tax increases. He went further and made a great fuss about the fact that there were going to be decreases in personal income tax. We now see that that has turned out to be a fraud. I hope that during the debates on these taxation issues this week we make the Australian people aware that the Prime Minister and the government have a real credibility problem here. That is what these debates have been about. They have not been about the essential nature of changes to the tax regime. I am sure that any government of the day, and certainly we on this side, would have to consider acting in a fiscally responsible way depending on the circumstances at the time. But this debate, and similar debates, have been about credibility. What we on this side have attempted to highlight in contributions to this debate is we were promised otherwise. What is the difference between a broken promise and a lie? I submit that there is nothing. What are the Australian people to make of promises which were made to them before the last election that there would be no tax increases? In dealing specifically with company taxes, as we are here this morning, what are we to make of ironclad commitments by the Treasurer that this was to be a permanent reduction to 33 per cent? This was a major plank of the government's policy in the lead-up to the last election. In fact, I think coming out very close to the election and announcing a decrease in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent was a brilliant move. In my view, it was a very good political move, and of course it was welcomed. The rationale for it was absolutely right-it was aimed at making us more competitive internationally. One thing that Australia desperately needs is to be competitive on an international basis. That reduction achieved that purpose. The rationale for it was to bring our company tax rates more into line with those of some of our trading partners. When the Treasurer at the time was asked whether this was to be a permanent reduction, he said clearly it would be. There is nothing equivocal about that. There is nothing ambiguous about the word 'permanent' as far as I know. In the context of an election these things are done for good reasons. I admit that. I support that. I supported that move because I thought it was a very good politic-l move. But our objection is that in the end the word 'permanent' apparently does not have that meaning as far as this government is concerned. The Treasurer can come in here, as he did - he other day, and in answer to a question attempt to weave and duck his way around the meaning of the word 'permanent'. He made the point then, and I do n9t have any problem with this, that the government has the right to change itstaxation regime from time to time to make it relevant and to meet the demands of particular circumstances. It may well be that the argument that the reducthat tion was to achieve a purpose at some point does hold water. It may well be that in some people's minds it is now justifiable, although I do not accept that it is, to put up those rates again if the objective for reducing them has been achieved. But the fact is-this is the bottom line for all of these debates about tax-that we were told that it would be otherwise, that it would be a permanent reduction. That is our objection as much as anything to the way these changes to the tax regime have been handled. This debate boils down to one not so much about tax, technical aspects of taxes and our international competitiveness; it simply boils down to the issue of credibility. I do not see, and we did not see the other day when we were debating tax issues, many government members coming in here to debate this issue with us. Mr Braithwaite-There are none here now.",27
13,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"There are none here now. There is only one government member in this chamber at the moment, and that is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is sitting at the table. The people of Australia who are listening to this debate outside this place do not realise that. I make the point that no government member will come into debate these issues with us because they know they cannot win technically. In a debate about putting up company tax, on a technical level I do not think we can say circumstances have changed. Australia needs to be internationally competitive more so than ever. That was the reason for reducing the company tax rate to 33 per cent In my opinion, it is an argument for reducing company tax rates further rather than putting them up. But, in the end, we have the government totally over a barrel in that this is ultimately an argument about the meaning of words. We are debating the fact that we were told by Prime Minister there would be no tax increasrates. es. We were promised tax cuts. They have been delivered. You can duck and weave promise around that one, as the Prime Minister does and as government members do when they dare to come in and debate this, but the is that the promised tax cuts, the legislated cuts, have not been delivered. Some aspects of them were brought forward but now have been deferred-at least, not even deferred; they have now changed totally in way they will be delivered in the form contributions towards superannuation someperpetrated where way down the track towards the year 2000. The debate ultimately is about the credibili- reasons, ty of a government which goes into an election campaign promising certain things and making certain statements. We had the same debate about the Medicare levy where we were told six months ago-by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) no less-that there would be no increase iri the Medicare levy. There was rio equivocation about it. There was' not a door left open, there might well have been. There could arguments as to why it should be increased. I suppose, if you want to be technically correct, it ought to be increased to pay for cost of health care. I know we have had that materials. debate, but the point is that, in this context, we were promised that there would not be an increase. Now we tum around and find ,there is an increase. Today, in dealing with the increase company tax, I could easily make a case for why we should be retaining it and why it should be reduced. But, in the end, fundamental reason for voting against this increase is our objection to the fraudulent in which these tax changes have been brought in. We are voting against it to highlight that particular factor so that the Australian people can be aware that we will not be a party to this sort of practice. If we had had before the election a different approach and a responsible approach where this was not a matter of promises being made and broken, then we may well have accepted it and agreed with the government that there the was some fiscal reason for changing these tax We will oppose the rise in the company not tax rate because it is a breach of Labor's at the election not to increase taxes. We intend to keep the Labor government, if we can-both here in the House of Represenfact tatives and in the Senate-to its election tax promises. The government closed the door, it shut off the options for electoral purposes; some and it needs to pay the price. The Australian people need to be aware the that, for the purposes of this government of getting re-elected last time, a fraud was in the commitments that were given and in the actions taken by the government to cut off those options. For the same we are opposed to all of the tax increases, because the option is not there, in our view, in view of the promises that were given by the government. In my electorate I have a tourism based economy. Most of the people who are contributing so much to a vibrant tourism industry are small businesses. For that reason, I am opposing per se the tax increases-the comas pany tax increases and the increases in taxes be on motor vehicles-because they are such an integral part of the tourism industry. I am also opposed to-violently opposed to, if you the like-increases in indirect taxes on building Mr Braithwaite-And joinery.",28
14,Mr BRADFORD,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"And joinery. We do not have the answers to questions about how that will be handled yet. The amazing thing, as in my friend the member for Dawson reminds me, is that so often the government rushes into these things in a half-baked way. When our the Taxation Office is phoned-now our constituents are phoning for some guidance way from the tax office as to how these increases to sales tax are to be applied-it does not have the answers. There is chaos out there in the building industry while someone tries to sort out what the answers are. It is most objectionable that we are to have these increases in indirect taxes which amount to a GST. Once again, it is a matter of credibility. The government's strategy prior to the last election was to point to increases in indirect taxation and condemn us for them. Now we see the government doing that very same thing, and underestimating the impact into the bargain, as we pointed out in question time. The budget papers say this will result in an increase of around $400 in the cost of an average home. We have clearly demonstrated that that vastly underestimates the cost. The added cost to an average home in most cities of Australia will be much closer to $1,000 or in excess of $1,000. I will not delay the House any further. On behalf of my constituents, I just take this opportunity to put their strongest objection to these increased taxes, not necessarily per sealthough we can argue against them per sebut because the credibility of the government is at stake. Where it promised no tax increases, we have tax increases.",29
15,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I join with the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) to talk about the low base on which the tax debate in Australia is taking place. The students who are in the gallery at the moment expected that there would be a debate here about taxation. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill and cognate bill being debated here are opposed by the coalition, but they have no government supporters. Are the members of the government so embarrassed? Were they taken so little into account in the formation of this budget and these tax increases that they are not prepared to come here and defend the government in this regard? I have news for them. When they go back to their electorates and try to defend the budget increases, which were in direct contradiction to the promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the last election, how are they going to account for the fact that they are now imposing these tax burdens on all Australians and that there is no debate on them, as some visitors to this House expected? There is no doubt why the embarrassment is there, particularly when you take into account the comments made by the Prime Minister just prior to the last election. On 9 February 1993, just one month before the election-I mention this in relation to the company rates of taxation-he said: We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian companies to work for Australia is to lower their tax burden ... Coming on top of the accelerated depreciation allowances announced in One Nation, this will make the Australian corporate tax system highly competitive within the OECD countries. He went on to say: ... more importantly, we will also be competitive with the countries in our region. Australian companies will thus be much better placed to trade with Asia-the region where it is going to matter most. Quite significant. The comment was made in a desperate grab to outmanoeuvre the coalition with its Fightback package. Unfortunately, by outmanoeuvring was the manner in which it was done. I believe that in the sales tax component of these bills the government, particularly the Prime Minister, has reneged on so many things. The truth of it is now evident. The promise made at the last election was another Keating lie. Mr Snowdon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask him to withdraw that.",30
16,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,I did not call the Prime Minister a liar. I just said it was a lie. I believe that is parliamentary. I was not describing any person. I just said it was a lie.,30
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"It has upset some people, so I suggest the honourable member withdraw that statement.",30
18,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Due to the sensitivity of the only government member in the House, I withdraw it. People in Australia will know whom to trust at the next election when promises are made. I want to draw that analogy further. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) at the table encourages me to do so. Let us talk in terms of the personal tax breaks that were made law through this parliament prior to the last election. In this respect, we must spell law l-ie because they never eventuated; they will not eventuate; and this budget does nothing to make them eventuate. Let us talk in terms of the Commonwealth Bank. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) quite categorically stated at the first issue of shares in the Commonwealth Bank that there would be no reduction in the Commonwealth's 51 per cent ownership rule. But this budget sells the rest off. We had a categorical promise from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy, but in this budget there is. We were told that there would be no GST, despite the fact that the Prime Minister thought in 1985-86 that a GST was not a bad idea. At the moment we have the worse and most pernicious form of indirect taxation in the huge increase in sales tax. As I understand it, since the Prime Minister's opposition to the GST in 1993, the sales tax in Australia has more than doubled. This particular budget increases sales tax by a massive 22.3 per cent. As I said, it is in the worse form because it is a blow to small business. I defer again to the sensitivities of the parliamentary secretary at the table and say that there is no reason for the Australian people-small business, the taxpayers and the battlers of Australia-to trust the Prime Minister, irrespective of what he says or does before the next election. I will just go back to the announcement I read out earlier, which was a policy decision made by the Prime Minister on 9 February 1993. The Prime Minister has the audacity, both here and in the press, to demand the coalition produce its policies now. There we were one month before the last election and his tax policy emerged. Now he has the hide to come and ask us to do better. The policy I am going to the next election with-and I believe it is the one that will win-is a policy to get rid of Labor because of the corruption it has spread in this budget and the manner in which it has spread the deliberate misrepresentations of what it intends to do. If we look at the whole aspect of the budget, as far as tax is concerned, what the Prime Minister is trying to do-as we saw him do in the last election-is make an issue by reducing interest rates. That is the target. He has already achieved a temporary, shortterm reduction in interest rates. But the question has to be asked: how, in a budget that has fudged so much to arrive at a surplus, is this going to happen? The $320 million increase in the company tax alone is just one of those fudges that have enabled the government to bring this budget into surplus. Another question that has to be asked, particularly in connection with companies, is: are Australian companies now better placed with the Asian trade to be able to afford a three per cent increase in taxation? The Institute of Chartered Accountants in a media release said: ... the Government's tax grab in lifting company tax rate by three percent to 36 percent is a shock for the corporate community. "" We always expect company tax to rise, but three per cent is a totally unacceptable increase and will not assist companies in their efforts to continue the recovery from the recession ... "" In addition the new company tax rate puts us totally out of whack with Asia where Singapore's corporate rate is 27 percent and Indonesia's 30 percent. "" You don't have to be blind freddy to see that this hurts our international competitiveness and our chances to attract overseas investment. "" This is particularly difficult when their economies are booming and providing extensive investment alternatives in their home countries. "" This makes the tax disadvantage against a country like Indonesia exactly 20 percent."" The institute went on to say that it could not agree with the tax. It is a damning indictment of where we stand to compete in trade with our Asian countries that Singapore has a corporate tax rate of 27 per cent; Indonesia, 30 per cent; and we now have 36 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, I know that you would be very interested in this as you are a person who believes that Australia's way out of its economic problem at the moment is through trade, and we are disadvantaged once again particularly in this investment area. Companies not only have to bear this increase but also have to bear the continuing compliance costs of other Commonwealth taxes such as the capital gains tax; the fringe benefits tax, which is absolutely unintelligible in its present form; and the superannuation guarantee levy. In the last 10 years this government has made an art of accelerating the collection of taxation. It now gets into government's coffers much earlier in order to maintain this fudged surplus. Taxes would not have been collected in arrears for another 12 months, and yet they are in this taxation pool. The other headache companies are going to be faced with is the yet to be announced manner in which the computation of dividends will be handled. It looks as though· we will be having three regimes-39, 33 and 36. An allocation of profits will have to be separately kept, but that is yet to be announced. It would certainly help the companies of Australia if they knew where they stood at the moment. I am not sure whether it was an unintended consequence, and it was not highlighted in the budget, but a company that has a closing year prior to 30 June is likely to be paying a company tax rate of 36c in the dollar from its last closure of accounts. For instance, if that date was February or March, that company would now be paying the full rate of 36G. That is retrospectivity; that is taxation by stealth. I am trying to indicate that the budget itself has a fudged surplus. It is easy enough to get to the amount if you start with the basis that the deficit of this budget is $8.232 billion. If you take off the asset sales, which is selling the Australian family jewels, worth $5.35 billion; the repayment of a state debt, which my own state of Queensland was happy enough to oblige, of $2.22 billion; and the ABS adjustment of $1.378; 10 and behold you get an implied surplus of $718 million. . I am afraid that I have to tell the government that no person outside Australia trusts this government to understand that there is a real surplus there. They know we are in debt. They know we a-e in trouble. As I say, the improvement in the interest rate will be very short term. In relation to other aspects of the budget, the Treasurer has said this is an expenditure cutting budget. I will refer to the real figures. Before you reduce it by asset sales, there is a 5.3 per cent increase in expenditure across the broad as against an infiationrate, or whatever you might want to compare it with, of two or three per cent. How is this expenditure paid the forr Companies are going to pay 15.4 per cent more, which is $17.14 billion this year; sales tax, as I have already said, is going to collect a massive $14.16 billion, a 22.3 per cent increase; and the total indirect tax rise is some 13.4 per cent. That is where the real deficitis. That is how it has been arrived at. The call will be to get the interest rates down. It does not take into account that real budget deficit. It does not take into account that the current account is going to grind along and continue to produce outcomes of more deficits than Australia can afford, which will have an effect on the interest rates. In relation to the exchange rate, as pointed out here the other day by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), over the last five months the Australian dollar has fallen eight per cent against the US dollar, 10 per cent against the UK pound, 11 per cent against the New Zealand dollar-and that is an economy that is booming across our way which could teach us a few lessons, if the government cared to 100k-16 per cent against the German mark and 22 per cent against the Japanese yen. In amongst all of this, we have the growth of the foreign debt. This budget has been manipulated for one reason only: to try to get interest rates down for a sufficiently long period before we go to an election. But nobody out there believes anything this government says. People are still very hesitant about buying a house. This has been compounded by the budget measure to increase some building costs by 12 per cent. This will cause further hesitancy in the housing market. In view of all the Prime Minister's broken promises, I believe that these falling interest rates will be a false dawn and that the reality will come later on. I wish to refer to the uplift factor. I understand that we are going to have an amendment to this legislation. I believe this to be pernicious. It is the means by which this government accelerates the payment of taxability ation, and in this case the means is the provicollection sional tax uplift factor. It to find out what the real situation is because there are still a lot of people out there in small business whom this provisional tax uplift factor will hurt considerably. Finally, I wish to read into Hansard some research on the difference in the amount taxation paid in Australia by a single person and a family. These figures go 67, which is when the change to decimal currency occurred. The research classifies the family as one in which there is only one income earner and two dependent children. The research states: tax as a proportion of income has increased time for both groups, with that for the person increasing by 15.5% to 23.7% and for family increasing from 5.9% to 16.0%; the increase has been much greater for the family ahead. than for the single person. The family is now paying nearly 2% times the proportion of income in tax than in 1966-67, while the single person is paying 1Y2 times; in 1988-89, the peak year for tax (as a proportion of income), the family paid 3% times the percentage in 1966-67 compared with 1% times for the single person. the marginal tax rate has generally increased over the period: the family's from 22.1 cents in the dollar to 36.9 cents, the single person's from 27.8 cents to 36.9 cents. For both types the rate peaked at 47 cents in 1984-85 and 1985-86; the proportion of the family's tax to the single person's tax increased from 38% in 1966-67, peaked at over 75% in 1988-89 and. had dropped back to 67% for 1993-94. The schedule quite clearly shows that the proportion of tax paid by those families who have taken the option of having a parent at home to look after the children to the tax paid by a single person has increased from 38 per cent in 1966-67 to 67 per cent now. These people may have been helped if it were not for what the government has deliberately done to defranchise single income families from the benefits which I believe they should be getting but are being denied through excessive taxation. The next election will be fought on the fact that the government makes promises which it does not keep and that it has an excessive to fudge the figures and accelerate the of taxation, regardless of where it would be interesting comes from. I call on members of the government to try to explain to their constituents why on 1 July . the cost of houses is going up, the cost of motor cars is increasing by five per cent and sales tax is increasing by one per cent and of why the promise of a tax deduction in 1993, which would have been most welcome, has back to 1966not been forthcoming? You cannot expect Australians to save when the taxation regime denies them the ability to save. You cannot talk about savings in the form of superannuation because that is a very over limited form of saving which does not flow single back into the economy and create small the businesses and provide the other resources that are so necessary for Australia to get I mention once again the pernicious sales tax that has to be borne by small business in this country. When we have this rate of indirect taxation built into our costs it is no wonder that we are becoming uncompetitive with our Asian neighbours, European countries and other places when they have a VAT arrangement that reduces that level of taxation. When the opposition talked about a proposed GST of 15 per cent the government completely overlooked the compensating factors such as the reduction in many other taxation measures and the increase in pensions. I will be opposing the bill. I believe this is food for thought for the people of Australia. (Time expired)",30
19,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"in reply-I was very surprised to hear the GST mentioned again. I thought the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), might have tapped the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on the shoulder and said, 'Do not mention that one again.' I thought it would have been like the Monty Python skit where they said, 'Don't mention the war.' Mr Costello-It was actually Fawlty Towers.",33
20,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I stand corrected. I thought he would have said, 'Don't mention the GST.' I thank all those who participated in the debate on this legislation. I am aware of the opposition's position on this bill, but the government believes that the budget bills to be brought in this year are responsible and achieve the government's objectives of putting downward pressure on interest rates and sustaining the recovery into the future. There were a few points made in the debate that I want to respond to. The shadow Treasurer, I think it was, asked us to have a look at this government's history on taxes. I am very happy to do that. We did not have much to beat. When we came into government in 1983 we had a taxation system which royal commissioners said-it was not the government or the opposition that said this-had optional tax for the rich. They also said that the fastest growing industry was tax avoidance. That is where we started from in 1983. It was left to this government to put some respectability back into tax laws. We introduced measures such as a capital gains tax. Australia was one of the few countries in the world that did not have a capital gains tax. We saw what happened when we did not have one. The bottom of the harbour schemes and the money laundering schemes of the 1970s and the 1980s only resulted because we did not have a capital gains tax. We brought that in, with opposition from the Liberal Party and the National Party. The fringe benefits tax, which is an eminently fair measure, was also opposed by the opposition of the day, but, looking back on it, we wonder how we got by without it. That has allowed us to drop the top tax rate from 60c under the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to 47c; and the bottom tax rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. There have been a few comments made about the company tax rate. Once again, let us have a look at the government's record in that regard. When we came into government the rate was 46 per cent. Mr Costello-Do you admit you broke your promise?",34
21,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I never admit anything. I get lessons from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). We dropped the rate down to 33 per cent. It is going to go back to 36 per cent because this is a responsible budget and there was a need on the fiscal side to do this. What did the opposition say at the last election? The opposition said that the rate would be 42 per cent. We are still six per cent lower than the opposition's figure, with full dividend imputation. Back in the good old days under the Leader of the Opposition we had a company tax rate of 46c. The profits were distributed and they were taxed once again. If you were a top marginal taxpayer you were charged 60c on those dividends. What sort of incentive for investment was that? Nowadays, we have a rate of 36c, with full dividend imputation. We are one of the few countries in the world that have that. We hear about all the comparisons with our neighbours on the tax rate, and 36c is still competitive. But there are other factors that go into making business decisions about which country to put a business in. These include having an educated work force; the cost of doing business in Australia, which is a fraction of what it is in some of the countries mentioned in this debate; having infrastructure in this country that can handle the investment that is being made with it, which is particularly the case in telecommunications; the living environment for the company executives, which is a big factor in where some of these companies put their investment; and, of course, the political stability of this country. All of these factors, as well as the tax rate, go into making Australia a very attractive country in which to invest, and we are seeing that investment. In fact, we see regional headquarters being established here in Australia over and above the countries mentioned by some of the speakers in this debate. The other point that has been made in this debate is that we have relied too heavily on taxing and not on cutting spending. Let me just say that cutting spending is not a oneyear exercise. We cannot do it every year and come up with big figures. Let me just state a fact about spending cuts: if we were spending money at the same rate as the Leader of the Opposition was when he was Treasurer, we would be spending an extra $17,000 million this year. Since 1983, we have cut $17,000 million, as a percentage of GDP, out of outlays. After making cuts of that magnitude, it is always harder to make more substantial cuts. I was told by Treasury that the easiest way to make cuts is to stop indexation of social security benefits. That will raise a couple of billion dollars a year. Of course, that is what the present opposition did when it was in government. It did not index pensions. It saves a couple of billion dollars a year in today's dollars, but the people who underwrite that are the people who can least afford it. A Labor government would not do that. I am told that sales tax refunds also featured in the debate. The government is of the view that sales tax is not paid by the retailer. It is paid by the person who is buying the goods, to the extentMr Costello--It is on the purchase? Is it a GST?",34
22,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Do you understand how business works? I know it is pretty hard for a lawyer. Wholesale sales taxes are usually passed on to the consumer. Mr Costello--Are you saying that the consumer pays it?,35
23,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"What I am saying is that it is the consumer who pays the tax and the wholesaler who collects it. Are we agreed on that? Mr Costello--We are agreed that it is a consumer tax, are we? Are you saying that it is a consumer tax?",35
24,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"We are agreeing that the consumer pays it. Mr Deputy Speaker, is the deputy leader making a point of order?",35
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,The deputy leader will resume his seat. The chamber does not allow two speakers at the one time.,35
26,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"We are agreeing that the consumer pays it. Who do you think pays the tax? This is a novel view from the shadow Treasurer: it is the wholesaler who pays the tax! Of course, it is not.",35
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,The minister would be well advised to cease replying to the interjections.,35
28,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Okay. It is very hard. Mr Costello--Big faux pas, George.",35
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will please restrain from interrupting.,35
30,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am trying to educate the shadow Treasurer about how things work in the real world. The wholesale sales tax is passed on to the consumer. Do you agree with that? Therefore, if there is an overpayment, who should get the benefit of that overpayment? Should it be the consumer who has paid the tax, or the wholesaler who has collected it? That is a central point. What we are saying is that, by and large, it is the consumer, if you can identify who that is. There was one case where we could identify the consumer-that is, in relation to swimming pools. When there was a tax on swimming pools which was found to be unconstitutional, the consumer was able to be identified. We did not pay the money back to the person who put the pool in the ground; we paid it to the person who purchased the pool. Why should we pay it to the person who put the pool in the ground? All he did was charge the consumer. That is the thrust of the bilI. The fact is that, if we were to give it back to wholesalers, it would be just a windfall for them. So, in this bill, we have made sure that they do not get that windfall, and that is the way the legislation is framed. There are a couple of things I would like to finish on. One of them is reprogrammable chips. I am happy that the opposition is supporting the government on thisMr Costello--We are not opposing it.",35
31,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am glad they are not opposing this. The point was made, back when this was foisted on us in the Senate, that it would cost the government revenue. It would influence the way in which businesses carried out their operations. If you have a programmable chip on which there is a dedicated program and you can put that same program on a reprogrammable chip, and there are different tax rates for both of them, obviously manufacturers will go for the reprogrammable chip. Why wouldn't they?They get a big tax break. The sort of thing we are talking about here is the importation of portable telephones where the importer was taking telephones out of their boxes and out of their plastic, taking their backs off, putting in reprogrammable chips and putting them all back together again just to get a tax break. Is that good business? It is costing the government $150 million a year. The Democrats should be exposed on this one. They were told at the time that this would happen. It has happened, and in this bill we have gone to remedy it. But we should never forget that it was the Democrats, aided by the opposition, who foisted this amendment on the government-and it has cost us $150 million. So I am glad that the opposition is not opposing this; in actual fact, it should be supporting it. A sign of the way the opposition conducts itself around this place is that you cannot get a decent commitment from it about anything; if there is a fence to be sat on, it will sit on it. Finally, the last speaker, the member for Dawson, spoke about what the next election would be fought on. As always, it will be about vision for the future, jobs, education, and healthand the republic might have a say in it as well. But one thing we can be sure of: the government has a proud record on tax, and we are happy to stand by that record. Mr Costello- Mr Deputy Speaker, could I just clarify a point? Which bill is to be read a second time?",35

Motion (by Mr Gear) proposed: After Schedule 9, page 14, add the following Schedule: AYES ""SCHEDULE 10 NA ASSESSMENT ACT 1936 1. Subsection 221YA(I) (definition of provisional tax uplift factor): Omit the definition, substitute: 'provisional tax uplift factor: (a) in relation to the 1995-96 year of incomemeans 8%; and NOES (b) in relation to a later year of income-means, until the Parliament otherwise provides, 10%.'. 2. Application The amendment made by this Schedule applies in relation to provisional tax (including instalments) payable for the 1995-96 year of income and for all later years of income. "".",37
37,Mr COSTELLO,AMENDMENT OF THE INCOME TAX,"I move: Proposed Schedule 10, paragraph (a) of the definition of ""provisional tax uplift factor"", omit ""8%"", substitute ""6%"". The government's amendment attempts to implement the budget announcement to set the provisional tax uplift factor at eight per cent for 1995-96. Those who do not have tax deducted under PAYE arrangements and pay provisional tax either quarterly or in one instalment will, under the proposal put forward by the government, be assessed for an increase in their income at the rate of eight per cent. The government's proposal assumes that all those people who pay provisional tax will have an eight per cent increase in their income in 1995-96 over 1994-95. They are required to pay tax on this assumed increase. I have moved an amendment on behalf of PAIRS the coalition which will set the uplift factor at six per cent for 1995-96. In doing so, the coalition is acting on our commitment to small business and self-funded retirees. There are around 800,000 small businesses and investors who pay provisional tax. They are hit by this budget measure. The coalition believes that the uplift factor should be set at a realistic level which is more consistent with expected rates of income growth and inflation. Headline inflation for the year to March is 3.9 per cent. Why then assume that an average income for a provisional taxpayer will rise by eight per cent? The government refuses to nominate the factors, other than the inflation rate, which have been taken into account in setting the uplift factor. Of course, at the end of the day, taxpayers pay taxes assessed on assessable income. If provisional taxpayers' incomes do not rise by eight per cent, they can apply for a variation. But this is an additional administrative burden and carries with it some risk. If provisional taxpayers estimate not within a 15 per cent band, they can be liable for additional tax. Alternatively, they can pay it and claim a credit when they file their 199596 return. But the effect of that is to give the tax office the tax in the meantime. The tax paid eventually is evened out, but the cash flow advantage under this flows to the tax office while the cash flow penalty goes to the taxpayer. An inflated uplift factor is a direct on small business. Small business has a difficult time as it is in trying to survive. is not as good as it ever gets. It can get better. We, as part of our commitment to make it much better for small business, are therefore seeking to reduce the provisional uplift factor to six per cent. By maintaining such an unrealistic uplift factor, the Labor government is causing unnecessary cash flow problems for small business. The provisional tax uplift factor has been the subject of much discussion and criticism. Currently, there is a reference before the Senate Economics Reference Committee. Many groups have given compelling evidence for the uplift factor to be examined and reduced. The Australian Society Practising Accountants gave evidence that it is hard for its members and advisers to tell small business that the rationale behind eight per cent increase is an assumption eight per cent increase in their income. EveryHiggins body would be happy with an eight per cent increase in their income, but the fact is that most do not find it the reality. The society gave evidence that, if there is an uplift factor, it should be in the order of the current level of inflation. The Taxation Institute of Australia gave evidence to the same effect. The Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Ausing tralia said that the low inflationary environment of recent times and the determination of the monetary authorities to maintain inflation below three per cent has made a mockery of the federal government's refusal to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor. We warned at the time of the budget last year that, unless the government could come up with some sensible and coherent reason why this factor should be set at eight per cent, we would be opposing it this time around. The government might say that inflation and an allowance for real growth mean you should have a margin on top of inflation. But, on that, we would be prepared to allow generously six per cent. Eight per cent is just plain greed by the government. Eight per cent is plainly punitive on small business and retirees. Our amendment seeks to reduce the assault uplift factor to six per cent. If that fails-and I hope it does not-we This would be forced to vote for the government's much amendment, because that is the only way we could get eight per cent. If nothing goes through the House, the uplift factor would tax actually go back to 10 per cent as a consequence of the way in which the government has structured it. I call on those in this House that support small business, those in this House that support the self-funded retirees and those in this House that believe in taxation equity and freedom, to support a six per cent uplift factor, to make sure that the government does not get the benefit of the cash flow and to make sure that small business is not penalised by greedy government of Certified in this country.",38
38,Mr ROCHER,AMENDMENT OF THE INCOME TAX,"I want to support in the strongest possible terms an my colleague the Deputy Leader of the of an Opposition, the honourable member for (Mr Costello). It is outrageous that business, particularly small business, should be confronted with an uplift factor that was pulled out of the hat, as it were, and set at eight per cent when the government's own budget forecasts anticipate an increase in the consumer price index of four per cent. The eight per cent uplift factor is proposed by the government at a time when it is crowthat the increased share of business profits has been restored to what it sees as desirable. While I and my colleagues on this side do not agree that is the case, it is, nevertheless, another reason to oppose this grubby little tax grab as represented by the proposed uplift factor. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the coalition, is being unduly generous in suggesting that it be at six per cent. It is very hard to justify an uplift factor in excess of the anticipated rate of inflation for the coming year. Profit shares are up to a level which gets the government excited, at least in its rhetoric, but we have to look at this with the background knowledge that the government has increased taxes consistently during the years of its incumbency. For example, company tax increased by more than 300 per cent. That is not a bad effort. That is in real terms. The total business tax take over 13 Labor budgets will have increased by around 370 per cent and, if you adjust for inflation, it is around the 300 per cent I mentioned before. On top of that, the government brought forward collections. That is the most insidious of all tax grabs under this government. We now know that quarterly tax instalments have been brought forward at every opportunity and on more than one occasion so that the government is getting the absolute maximum it possibly can. The real problem and the real sin in all of that is that it has made grave inroads into the working capital and into the cash flows of businesses. You cannot underestimate what this has meant in rating the ability of businesses to continue to expand, to continue their efforts to improve performance and to become more competitive-which would seem to be the objective of the government; but its action, in effect, is entirely . counterproductive. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that, while you can apply for a variation of your provisional tax bill, you do run a grave risk. Whilst not many would be that far outside the tolerances allowed by the Australian Taxation Office, not many will take the risk. If they happened to fall outside those tolerances allowed, they would incur very savage penalties which are excessively punitive. I simply want to be on record as supporting 100per cent the amendment moved by my colleague the Deputy Leader. of the Opposition, but i do have this one small qualification: I think he is being unduly generous in putting his proposed amendment at six per cent. . Mr Cleary-It's unlike him to be so generous.",39
39,Mr ROCHER,AMENDMENT OF THE INCOME TAX,"No, I think you have seen me trot to the other side when it has been warranted. I certainly do not think it is warranted on this occasion, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is demonstrating the commitment of the coalition to the interests of the business sector in Australia, particularly to the interests of small business, amongst other things. In that, he and we have impeccable records. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Costello's) be agreed to. The House divided.

Bill (on motion by Mr Gear) read a third time. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 10 May. Second Reading",40
40,Mr HOWE,AYES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. NOES Local government is close to the communities it services and has a wide range of representational, executive and community service functions which impact on the quality of life of all Australians. Local government plays an important role in achieving a range of national priorities in the areas of micro-economic reform, urban reform, regional economic development, environment and social justice. In recognition of the importance of local government, the Commonwealth currently provides in excess of $1 billion in grants to local government. These grants are untied, allowing them to be spent by individual local councils in accordance with the priorities they determine. This bill provides for the continuation of these untied grants to local councils and for the continuation of their annual escalation formula. The bill also includes important reforms in relation to the transparency and accountability for these grants, including outcomes achieved by local governing bodies. I should emphasise that the bill does not impose conditions on the way in which local governing bodies can spend their grants. NA Rather it requires that information on the distribution of Commonwealth grants and the performance of recipient local governing bodies be available for scrutiny by this parliament and the people of Australia. The need for these reforms arises out of studies undertaken as part of the Australian urban and regional development review and extensive consultation and discussion with state governments, the Australian and state local government associations and individual local governing bodies. Untied Commonwealth funding to local government has been provided under various acts since 1974. Although the actual arrangements have been subject to various amendments since that time, all Commonwealth governments, no matter what their political persuasion, have recognised its importance to local government and agreed to the funding continuing. Under the existing act, there are two components to the untied funding. The first is a general grant component which represents around two-thirds of the total financial assistance grants. This funding is allocated between the states and the Northern Territory on a per capita basis, with the intrastate distribution being undertaken primarily on a horizontal equalisation basis; that is, the funding is provided on a basis that ensures that each local governing body in the state or territory is able to function by reasonable effort, at a standard not lower than the average standard of other local governing bodies in the state. The second component, making up the remaining untied funding, relates to identified local road funding. Prior to 1991, funding for local roads was delivered under tied arrangements. In 1991, this government amended the existing Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 to give effect to the 1990 Special Premiers Conference decision to untie local roads funds and pay these via general purpose grants. These funds are allocated amongst the states and territory on an historical funding basis, with intra state distribution being on a roads needs basis. This bill maintains all these features of the existing act but removes the provision in the current act which would see local road funds absorbed into the general grants with effect from 1995-96. The bill gives effect to the Premiers Conference decision of 11 April 1995 to continue to distribute local road funding on the basis of historical shares rather than having them absorbed into local government general grants and distributed on a per capita basis. Absorption of local road funding into the general grants would result in a change in distribution amongst states resulting in signifimethodologies cant funding reductions to Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Queensland and would also lead to changes in the intra-state distribution of these funds in all states, which would disadvantage rural and remote areas. The continued separate identification of local road funds has had strong support from local governments and from all state local government ministers. Escalation of local government funding is determined by the Treasurer in consultation with the responsible minister, having regard to the level of assistance grants and special revenue assistance paid to the states each year. This linkage means that the escalation factor for local government financial assistance grants takes account of inflation and population growth. The bill provides for the development of national principles, applicable to all states and the Northern Territory, governing the intrastate distribution of grants. National principles, in lieu of bilateral principles, provide a more nationally consistent and transparent basis for allocating funds to local governing bodies. Application of common principles should ensure, subject to the particular methodologies of the state and territory grants commissions, that similar councils receive similar grants, at least in relative terms. National principles will be determined after consultations with the states and territories and the Australian Local Government Association, with a view to reaching a common view on their content. Where there are disagreements the Commonwealth has undertaken to seek the views of the Local Government Ministers Conference. Allocations among local governing bodies will continue to be made by local government grants commissions. The bill contains major enhancements to the accountability arrangements. The minister will be required to present an annual national report to parliament, replacing the current requirement which only requires presentation of the various state-territory recommendations. The new national report will include information on the grants to individual councils and categories of councils. It will report on state grants commission in relation to both equalisation and local roads grants, on achievement of horizontal equalisation amongst councils and on council efficiency and effectiveness. The report will also provide information on the operation of the act in relation to service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I am sure that honourable members will welcome the opportunity to be kept informed about the funds paid to local governments in their electorates, and recognise that local government efficiency and effectiveness and service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are important and legitimate national priorities. Reporting on services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities will not be a simple task. The Commonwealth does not hold most of the information and we will need to work hard and cooperatively to ensure data are comparable and meaningful. In this regard the Commonwealth is pleased to note that local government shares the national objective of ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have equitable access to services. The Commonwealth particularly welcomes the resolutions of the Local Government Ministers Conference-including the Australian Local Government Association-in April this year concerning services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Commonwealth will consult widely and fully with local government and states in developing data. The bill provides for the act to be reviewed prior to 30 June 2001 and establishes particular issues that such a review must examine. The aim is to ensure the act is delivering the intended reforms. In developing this bill I have also taken the opportunity to address a number of administrative matters. The moneys under this bill are appropriated to the Department of Housing and Regional Development and paid by that department to the states. This replaces the current provision under which the Treasury makes the payments and is in line with the principle that the department administering the legislation should look after the funding. Payments to the Australian Capital Territory are included for the first time, in line with the requirement to treat the ACT in the same manner as all other states and the Northern Territory. Previous local government funding to the ACT was by way of an analogous payment, estimated using the same factors as were applicable to other states. This change , does not affect the grant outcomes for the states and territories. The bill provides for an earlier announcement of the estimated funding levels for the coming financial year. This has been done to facilitate announcement of funding in a May, rather than August, budget. The change responds to requests from some states for an earlier announcement to allow for individual council distributions to be included in council rate setting assessments for the coming year. In order to allow for early announcement, an estimated entitlement for local government funding is determined at the time of the Commonwealth budget, based on the estimated growth in the state general purpose funding. Once estimates have been produced for budget purposes and conveyed to stategovernments, no further adjustments will occur until the year following the year of payments. Adjustments of these estimates would be done when providing estimates for the next year's budget, with the final entitlement being established when the last payment is determined for state general payments-that is, by the end of June in any year. This change has necessitated altering the formulas included in the bill, but the final funding to local government is still the same as it would have been under the current legislation. The advantage is that local government will know much earlier the level of funding it can expect for the coming year. Transitional provisions are included to ensure that the changes to the new legislation will create as little disruption as possible to council distributions. Distributions for 199596 will occur as if the current legislation was still in place. The bill also provides that the minister may determine, if necessary, and on a state by state basis, phase-in arrangements to take account of the impact on councils of the new national principles. I commend this bill to the House.",42
41,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in the consideration by the House of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995. This is probably the most important piece of legislation affecting local government to come before the House in many years. The bill replaces the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986, under which federal financial assistance grants were provided to local government. The bill continues current arrangements under which the federal assistance grants are provided in two separately identified categories. The first category is general purpose grants, which are paid on a per capita basis to each state and territory and distributed between councils on a horizontal equalisation basis. The second category is identified local roads grants, which are distributed between the states and territories according to an historical formula based on their relative road needs. There are indeed a number of useful features of the bill which are an improvement on the current arrangements. I am pleased to see that councils will now be receiving early advice on their annual allocations, which can only assist them in forward planning and in framing their own budgets. It is particularly important for the many local councils out there, at a time when they are trying to become more efficient with their ratepayers' funds, to know well in advance of their own budget considerations what assistance will be coming from the Commonwealth. This reform is long overdue. The introduction of national principles to govern intrastate distribution of financial assistance grants is a welcome attempt to introduce more consistency in the distribution of these funds. The draft principles, which mayor may not be the version finally declared by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), do seem, however, to have been framed with a view to ensuring that there is as little change as possible in the current distribution of funding. While this has the support of the states and local government, it does appear that the national principles are just a continuation of current arrangements with just a little window dressing. For the first time, funding for the Australian Capital Territory will be included in the local government financial assistance arrangements. This will replace local government type funding for the territory currently provided through other legislation. It continues the process of putting the territory on the same footing, for Commonwealth funding purposes, as the states and the Northern Territory, and it is a welcome move. I commend the minister for his confidence in the new Liberal administration, under Chief Minister Kate Carnell, which has taken office in the ACT. It is a step forward. I am also pleased to see that the minister has seen the light and decided not to propose the absorption of the untied local road funds into the general purpose assistance grants. Absorption of the local road funds, which will automatically occur under the current legislation, would have meant that, for the first time, interstate distribution of road funds would have been made on a per capita basis. This would result in major reductions in the proportion of local road funding provided to Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. The minister has obviously accepted the advice of the recent review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 which found that absorption of local road grants into the horizontal equalisation process would cause major disruption. The review favoured the continuation of the current funding arrangements. While recognising these positive aspects of the bill, the opposition does have serious problems with a. number of its key aspects. These concerns reflect the opposition's broader concerns about the government's approach to local government issues generally. The absence of any real funding commitment to local councils, the shallowness of the government's record of consultation with local government, and its brazen disregard of agreements reached with the other two levels of government are squarely exposed in this bill. It is also apparent that the bill will do remarkably little towards achieving its stated objectives. The minister's second reading speech is long on rhetoric but when you read the bill you quickly discover the cupboard is bare. A major failing of the bill is that it continues the parlous level of funding for local councils that local governments have become used to. In 1983, when the government came to office, federal general purpose assistance grants to local councils comprised 1.03 per cent of total Commonwealth tax revenues. By 1995-96, this year, the share will have declined to 0.67 per cent. While total tax federal revenues increased by 29 per cent in real terms over this period, the real level of financial assistance grants fell by three per cent. The fundamental problem which confronts councils is that the present government has built into the budgetary framework a level of funding for local government which will be difficult to retrieve in the short term. Although the government has foreshadowed a real terms per capita maintenance of local government funding commencing in 1997-98, this has not been enshrined in the bill. The impact of the funding decline is most felt by rural councils which struggle to be able to provide the essential services that their ratepayers come to expect. The worsening condition of our local road network, declining standards of health care and rising property rates are all consequences of the federal government's shabby treatment of Australia's third tier or third sphere of government. Other federal programs which assist local government in carrying out its functions, such as the road safety black spots program and the federal urban public transport program, have been abolished under this government. The various state local government associations have written to all federal members of parliament to voice their concerns about the bill. I urge every member to think carefully about the issues raised in these letters by the councils. Their concern is that the bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects. Local, state and territory governments have also made known their disgust at the way in which this bill ignores key agreements reached between the three levels of government on how the new local government funding arrangements would be implemented. The opposition shares these concerns. I would now like to address the particular aspects of the bill with which we on this side take issue. They include, firstly, the failure the bill to require the government to consult with local government on the preparation of the national principles for the interstate distribution of the financial assistance grants. Secondly, there is the absence of any parlia. mentary oversight of the federal minister's power to declare national principles for the distribution of financial assistance grants. Thirdly, there is the failure of the bill to require the minister to consult with the states and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament on the operation of the legislation. I foreshadow that at the detail stage of the consideration of this bill I will move amendments to remedy these defects. A major feature of the bill is the inclusion for the first time of specific objects. These objects include improving the provision· by local councils of services to Aboriginal communities and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local councils. No member of this House could disagree with these aims. But when you read the legislation to try to discover how these objectives will be achieved you are left none the wiser. The bill provides no strategy to promote the achievement of these objectives. However, the minister will be required to report to parliament annually on how councils have met the objectives specified for them in the bill. For the first time, in relation to local government payments the federal minister will be required to table in parliament an annual report on the operation of the financial assistance grants legislation. This will include the extent to which the funds have been allocated on a horizontal equalisation basis and on the performance by councils of their functions, including their efficiency and provision of council services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Australian Local Government Association and the state and territory ministers believe the government provided a firm undertaking that any reporting arrangements were to be made to the Local Government Ministers Conference. The federal government had agreed that reporting on councils' performance would be dealt with under the auspices of the regular Local Government of Ministers Conference meetings rather than to parliament in the first instance. There has been no agreement on the form which the report should take or on the detail of the benchmarking arrangements to be implemented. These issues were to be the subject of further investigation by officials, with advice to the ministers next year. I give notice that I will move an amendment requiring the federal minister to consult with relevant state ministers and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament. In relation to the issue of improved service to Aboriginal communities, the Local Government Ministers Conference decided that agreements would be negotiated between the states, territories, state local government associations and the Commonwealth on how best to deliver improved services to Aboriginal communities. These agreements would involve complementary action by other spheres of government where necessary and additional assistance provided to councils identified as needing to improve their performance. None of this, however, is reflected in the bill, which puts the onus on councils to redress problems of many years standing without one cent of additional federal funding. It is tragic that the Deputy Prime Minister has sought to pass the buck in this way on such an important problem that the nation must address. The problems faced by Aboriginal communities require an expanded whole-ofgovernment effort. Local government does not have the capacity to do a great deal more without substantial additional funding, none of which is provided in this bill. It is also appropriate to focus on one disadvantaged group in the community. Other groups with special needs could have been singled out for attention, such as migrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities, people in remote communities, the unemployed and so on. This bill also runs the risk of compromising the whole basis of federal local government funding. Federal grants to local government are currently untied. The principle until now has always been that what councils do with the money must remain a matter for the democratic process at a local level. Instead, this bill in effect converts the general purpose funding into tied funding rather than establishing a targeted program to achieve the sensible objectives specified in the bill. To quote the Australian Local Government Association, this aspect of the bill seriously undermines the concept of untied general purpose grants. The opposition does not intend at this stage to move amendments remedying these aspects of the bill. The question of services to Aboriginal communities can only be addressed through a coordinated program which will require the assistance of and action on the part of many government agencies at state and federal level. As I said earlier, the objectives are fine but the bill on its own cannot provide the solution. The broken promises I have referred to above cast a poor light on the special agreement between the federal government and local government which has been heralded by the minister as a new Commonwealth-local government accord. It is ironic that, in the same week the minister announced his intention to develop the accord, local government was telling the world that the government had broken key agreements on the content of this legislation, including failure to incorporate key consultative mechanisms in the bill. This is really symptomatic of the minister's whole approach to his portfolio. On so many issues of concern to Australia's 741 municipalities, the government's promised consultation is revealed as just empty promises. On this issue, like so many others where fine words fail to translate into action, the Minister not for Housing and Regional Development is an emperor embarrassed by his nakedness. When it really comes to the crunch, the government's so-called commitment to consultation with local government really is just a sham. According to the Australian Local Government Association, the bill fails to iniplement agreements reached at conferences of local government ministers, including the Australian Local Government Association president. So we have had these agreements with state ministers. We have had these agreements with the Australian Local Government Association, which is the representative body of local governments right across this country. And now we have the minister going around the country saying, 'We are going to have this new accord with local government. Everything is fine and rosy and we are going to get on so well in this great big family all working together. And this third sphere of government in this country is going to be onside with the government all the way.' Yet, when we get this bill into the House, what do we find? The minister has reneged on some of those agreements that he made with the ministers, that he made at the meetings with the Australian Local Government Association, and, more importantly, with the President of the Australian Local Government Association. The so called accord quite clearly is something which has broken down before it even begins. It would be bad enough if the government's dismissive treatment of local government were confined to this bill, but it is just one of a long series of occasions on which the government has ignored or disregarded the interests of local government. I note that the proposed accord is likely to address local government's role in progressing national competition policy, for instance. It seems to me that the government's position on this issue is pretty well fixed and local government does not fare well. Local government has not been included in the system of competition payments agreed at the Council of Australian Governments. Moreover, the intergovernment competition principles agreement does not provide for state and Commonwealth business enterprises to pay local government rates and charges. The threshold problem is that the government refused to allow the Industry Commission to investigate the extent of local government's contribution to the benefits flowing from the competition policy reforms, or to examine the impact of reforms on local communities. Why would the government refuse to allow the Industry Commission to investigate the impact of a national competition policy on local government? We would love to hear the answer from the minister. It is also reflective of the shallowness of government's commitment to consultation that local government had an enormous battle just to gain representation on the intergovernmental working parties set up to progress the mechanisms to implement the Hilmer reform. It was not until the Council of Australian Govemments meeting in Darwin that they got one representative on that body. So much for this great accord. So much for this great partnership. Local governments have one voice, and they have to fight tooth and nail to be acknowledged as a partner in governance. They will have to play a part in national competition reforms, and they are happy to play their part. They believe they have a fair case in arguing that they need to be heard far more on the concerns they have in terms of progressing national competition policy. I note the belated announcement on this issue made this week by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in response to the opposition's pressure. He announced that he would seek a parliamentary inquiry into how community service obligations can best be continued under the Hilmer regime. This is a sign that the government is starting, at long last, to listen to the concerns of local-particularly rural---communities about how the benefits of national competition reform can be most fairly distributed. I welcome the Assistant Treasurer's reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. I understand that the committee has accepted the guidelines and the references that he has made to the committee. At lorig last-and only through the pressure that has come from this side of the House-we are going to see some progress in that area. It is a very, very important areaMr Hicks interjecting",44
42,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"The member for Riverina knows well the concerns that are being voiced out there in the Riverina, particularly at the local council level. The government would have been better advised to have consulted with local govern the ment about the Hilmer reforms much earlier. That could have allayed some of the anxiety felt in local communities-particularly those in rural areas. Quite clearly, it is this side of the House that understands the concerns of the people who live, work and generate wealth and jobs out there in rural Australia. This is where the pressure has come from on this issue. At long last, the government is showing some signs of having listened to our voice from this side of the House. Mr Hicks-What about a 'better country town' program? MrBRUCE SCOTT-That raises another long debate, I inform the member for Riverina. Given this background of official neglect, councils could be forgiven for being more than a little cynical about the minister's wish that the proposed accord establish common ground between the Commonwealth and local government on competition policy. One of the difficulties faced by the opposition in considering its approach to this legislaMinister tion is a complete lack of any explanation provided by the minister on the rationale of many of its provisions. The whole question of federal funding for local government was addressed in two recent reports by the Australian Urban and Regional Development review, namely Financing local government and Local government funding methodologies. These reports made a whole series of recommendations, some of which have apparently been adopted by the minister and many of which have not. This is of more than academic interest. At the Local Government Ministers Conference last year, the Deputy Prime Minister advocated arrangements to encourage and improve local council efficiency. His proposals were very different from the damp squib he has presented in this bill today. Those recommendations flowed out of the reports mentioned above. However, the Deputy Prime Minister was comprehensively rolled by the states and local government on these proposals, and they have since vanished without trace and without any public explanation by the minister. On this point, the government has had before it, for more than 18 months, the findings of a report prepared by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, titled Driving the road dollar further. The government has still not provided an official response. The report made a number of recommendations about federal untied local road funding, most of which have not been incorporated by the government in this bill. In the unforgivable absence of any government response to this report, we are none the wiser as to why the government has done this. This is public administration at its sloppiest. I understand that primary responsibility for tabling the government's response rests with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Our advice from his department is that he does not have time to attend to the report, given other matters that demand his attention. We know what those other demands are. Once again, I call on the Deputy Prime to prevail on the transport minister and get him to do his duty by this House and table the government's response to this report. At the very least, the Deputy Prime Minister should outline his response to the issues addressed by the committee within his own portfolio responsibility. The opposition is also concerned at the apparently fragmented nature of the government's local government assistance program. I commend the minister for incorporating a number of these disparate programs into the local government development program. But the cost has apparently been a substantial increase in staffing levels of the Office of Local Government. Scarce local government resources should be devoted to providing services at a local level, not in expanding the Commonwealth bureaucracy. The minister might explain whether an expanded bureaucracy will be more efficient, or whether this staffing increase is really necessary. Some local government associations have expressed the view that this represents a further attempt by the minister to extend his control over the activities of local government. The opposition finds it very difficult to disagree with local government's assessment of this issue. We also have concerns about the local government development program itself, which, as it is funded under a one-line entry in the Appropriation Bill (No.1), is administered with very little parliamentary supervision. It is not clear why the funding for and administration of this program would not be more effectively dealt with in local government financial assistance legislation. This is a matter I intend to pursue. In the context of the Senate estimates hearings, the opposition has asked a number of questions on these and other issues, which are intended to assist its consideration of this bill. It is to be regretted that the answers to these questions have not been made available by the minister's department in time for this debate. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to honour agreements with the Territories and local government relating consultation on the operation of the legislation and on the need for a coordinated approach improving the efficiency of local councils the delivery of services to Aboriginal communicolleagues, ties"".",48
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Hicks-I second the amendment.,50
44,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"I am pleased to rise in the House to support the Local Government (Financial Assistance) 1995, which has been brought into this place by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). I acknowledge before the House the Deputy Prime Minister's interest in and contribution to local government in this country. He has always regarded local government as a very important and significant level of Australia's democratic structure. The Deputy Prime Minister has worked tirelessly to encourage better planning urban renewal in local communities. He has regarded local government as an appropriate vehicle for the expansion of community services. He has gone to great lengths encourage local governments to take a pronot active role in the economic development their regions. He has encouraged them to an active role in local environmental affairs. His record before this House in supporting local government in Australia is second to none. I listened with great interest to the comare ments of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). The honourable member Maranoa would have been a great supporter of Fightback. I think it was Fightback which sought to slash and emasculate federal government funding to local government in this country. I do not understand how that particular view stacks up with the honourable member's criticism of the present government's funding arrangements for local government in this country. The member for Maranoa had a lot to say about consultation with local and state gova second ernments on these issues. I do not know where he has been, but he should know that States, the Deputy Prime Minister, more than anyto body else' in this place, has an excellent to record of consultation on these sorts of issues, and not only with caucus and with his ministerial but also with local and state governments. We know how the Liberal Party of Australia, which the honourable member represents here in the coalition, approaches the consultative process when it comes to local government. I would like to invite the honourable member to come to Victoria and see what the Bill Kennett government has done in terms of consulting with local government. The Kennett government has taken the meat axe to local government in the state of Victoria. The Kennett government has imposed its commissars-not commissioners-to run local government in the state of Victoria without consulting with local communities. That is why the opposition is losing so much support in the Liberal and National Party heartlands. Those communities are turning in droves to and the government because the Liberal and National parties refuse to consult. They have treated local government just like a bag of spuds-ripping the bag open and tipping the to spuds on the ground. Members opposite do care about consultation, so they should of not come into this House preaching to the take government, least of all preaching to the Deputy Prime Minister, about consultation. I would have thought a funding commitment of in excess of $1 billion was significant. I would have thought the attempts that being made in this particular act to bring local government into the transparency and for accountability fold would have been an appropriate course for a federal government allocating that amount of money. However, that does not seem to have impressed the honourable member for Maranoa. The opposition has consistently walked away from the issue of micro-economic reform, not only in local government areas, but in transport and in the provision of many other services. Now opposition members want to lecture the government on, firstly, its commitment to local government and, secondly, its attempts to achieve greater efficiencies. The honourable member for Maranoa should know that on this side of the House there is very strong support for local government structures in this country. I just had a flick through the Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia and I discovered that some 20 members on this side of the House have had experience in local government, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have also had such experience. I will not name all the government members who have local government experience, but the list includes the honourable members for Calare (Mr Simmons), Werriwa (Mr Latham), Herbert (Mr Lindsay), Dickson (Mr Lavarch), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Chifley (Mr Price), and Hughes (Mr Tickner). The Speaker has also had experience in local government. We on this side of the House take great exception to the charges by the member for Maranoa that this government does not have a great deal of sympathy for this level of government. We know where his sympathies lie. His sympathies have always been with state governments, never with local governments. It has been federal Labor governments that have shown the care and the concern for the real development of governmental structures at the local level and an interest in improving this level of government as a deliverer of services to ordinary Australians. When the linkages between the federal Labor government and local government are examined via the various programs that we administer it gives a fairly comprehensive idea of how seriously the federal government takes this level of government. The member for Maranoa mentioned the local capital works program, an astounding initiative in One Nation that not only achieved great infrastructure improvements at the local level but also was an employment creating program. There was a great sigh of relief when One Nation was announced. The government committed over $400 million in direct funding to local government so that local communities could be improved. We have linkages through the landcare and environment action program, LEAP, as well as a myriad of labour market programs. As far as infrastructure development is concerned, the building better cities program works in partnership not only with local government but also with state government. That program has been a resounding success. Some $800 million that the federal government made available primarily to local governments has brought forth an investment of some $2 billion-an extraordinary result in investment terms, but it has been far more important to local communities given what has been achieved. In my community in Geelong, the building better cities money has been used to finance the redevelopment of the Deakin wool stores, an urban renewal project in the north of Geelong at Norlane and the building of the Geelong transport interchange-all key catalytic developments in the city of greater Geelong. Those projects had called for substantial investment and they have improved the infrastructure of our region. But our linkages with local government do not end there. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for the way in which he has crafted the regional development program and initiated the greater involvement of local communities into their own economic development. If we go to environmental programs, we see in the budget that $8.5 million has been provided to assist local governments primarily to deal with planning issues related to the coastal environment. As far as general planning issues are concerned, the ILAP program provides a good linkage. The federal government is involved not only in the HACC program to a very large extent in the provision of community services but also with local communities in the provision of community housing. If these programs are being accessed by local government then the federal government, in partnership with local government, is having a very real impact on the lives of ordinary Australians. They are hardly the programs and the actions of a government that does not care about partnership with local government. If we look back at the historical perspectives, it is important to appreciate that local government existed long before Federation; indeed, local governments in my state of Victoria were established in 1842. These local structures grew up under state jurisdictions and it is state legislation that primarily governs the functions, powers and structures of local government in the state of Victoria. The Australian constitution does not specifipersonal cally mention local government, and this fact has led to some attempts in the past by the federal government of the day to increase its constitutional status. But it is the Labor governments which have done that: no coalition government has attempted to elevate local government structures in the federation. Indeed, the coalition opposed the Whitlam government referendum on the matter in 1974. I see that the honourable member for Maranoa is shaking his head. He should not shake it, because the coalition opposed the 1974 referendum which sought to give local government a greater say in the affairs of the nation and attempted to allow the federal government to directly fund it. Yet opposition members come into this House and lecture us about our commitment to local government. They have got to be joking! The functions that local government performs are very important to local communities. Local government structures are involved in the provision of local roads, the provision of water supplies and sanitation, and-more extensively now, in modem times-in the provision of cultural and recreational activiti((s and community and welfare services. Who has stood beside local governments as they have moved into these critical areas of development? State governments, or federal governments? I can tell you what the state government in Victoria has done, and it is nothing like the federal Labor governmenj h-s done for local government. Looking.at the financing of local government, we see. that local government largely raises its reyenue through three mechanisms: through taxation and the levying of rates; through borrowings; and through grants which are provided by the federal government. That brings me. to the substance of the bill that we are debating here today. The history of the role of the federal government in local government funding in Australia began with the Grants Commission Act in 1973, which directly led to the funding of local government. Moving further along the time scale, I commend the Fraser Liberal government which, in 1976, provided for income tax sharing by local governments in the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. In 1986,the Hawke government introduced the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act, which outlined the program for growth in local government funding and introduced a system of state allocations on a per capita basis with the principle of horizontal equalisation. The 1991 amendment to that act provided Commonwealth funding for local roads. Of course, we have before us a range of amendments which further extend that 1986 act. . The bill before this House today provides for several of the government's objectives in allocating $1.1 billion of federal moneys to local government. The government seeks greater efficiencies in the use of that money and, of course, greater accountability in the allocation of funds. The bill seeks to achieve this through the introduction of a new method of national reporting on local government expenditures, through the establishment of a more consistent basis for the allocation of funds between municipalities. The bill provides a means by which local communities can achieve those greater efficiencies and, of course, it continues the separate identification of road funding. I will not deal with all of the bill's provisions. I will pic- up on just a couple of aspects and, no doubt, government members following will pick up on the others. As far as the national reporting mechanism is concerned, there is a necessity to provide greater transparency and accountability in the distribution of funds. I do not think that would be disputed by the honourable member for Maranoa. The bill before the House requires the minister to provide a detailed report to parliament on expenditures and especially on the outcomes of those expenditures. The important thing about the expenditure report is that it will provide an impetus and a focus for the further collection of essential data relating to local government areas throughout the length and breadth of this country. Much of that data is already in existence, but it needs extending for us to be able to get the best possible snapshot of what is happening with those expenditures and the outcomes being achieved. The fact that the national reporting mechanism will impose its own discipline over local government bodies will be an incentive for them to improve their performance. I know there will be difficulties in obtaining agreement from local and state governments on what constitutes good performance .and establishing relevant criteria. It is a hard job but it can be done, and it can be done within a consultative framework. It will provide the federal government with a better statistical base and a better indication of how that enormous amount of money is effectively spent and it will give the citizens of Australia a better chance to evaluate the outcomes of their local government bodies. That first report will be made and published in the national parliament in 1996-97. Mr Bruce Scott-Not if the states get in first. Mr ()'CONNOR-I think it is important for the national government to pursue the micro-economic reform agenda at the local government level and to achieve better internal efficiencies in local government. Local and state governments are already well down the way of developing benchmarking techniques, performance measures and other elements of the micro reform agenda. For our part, the federal government has committed some $2 million over five years to assist local governments to disseminate best practice through their council networks and, of course, to develop the national benchmarks which will give us some idea of their performance. As my time runs out in this debate, let me just challenge the opposition once again. When opposition members get up in this the place and seek to lecture this government on local government matters, we should bear in mind that they have always had their focus directed at state governments and not local governments. They have consistently, down through history, opposed the attempts of Labor government to elevate the status of local governments in the Australian constitutional context. If we go to the one state where we can view the Liberal Party in operation, we find that what the Liberal Party has done in Victoria is one of the most despicable and undemocratic things that we have seen in this country. As a political party and a coalition partner, the Liberal Party has demonstrated its utter contempt for consultative processes. It has demonstrated utter contempt for the local government structure. So, when opposition members come into this place and seek to lecture the federal government on what it ought to be doing with local government, they are really skating on thin ice. The honourable member for Maranoa ought to be reminded that if he was on this side of the House local governments throughout the length and breadth. of Australia would already have had their financial innards slowly ripped out as the squeeze from Fightback would have come on the funding arrangements between the federal and state governments. The opposition does not consult. It does not fund. It does nothing to elevate the status of local government in the Australian constitutional context, and that simply writes it out of this debate.",50
45,Mr VAILE,PAIRS,"It is always interesting to be present in this chamber and get lectured by members of the other side. I suppose that members on the other side can also say that about members on this side. We have just had a bit of a lesson from the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) about some recent activities that have taken place in Victoria which have had extensive ramifications as far as local government is concerned. I might just take the House back, seeing we are talking about some history today in debating the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill 1995, to the early 1980s in New South Wales when we had the massive amalgamations of local government. I presume what the member for Corio was talking about was the amalgamations of local government bodies in Victoria at the moment. A lot of the New South Wales amalgamations were contrary to the recommendations of all those local government bodies in the state. Under whose stewardship was this? The minister for local government at the time was one Harry Jensen, a member of the Wran Labor government. That was in 1980-81. The member for Corio spoke about lack of consultation in Victoria at the moment. That may be the case, but certainly there is a bit of blame that we can level at the other side of politics in that process. Over the years, there have been a number of times that different governments in New South Wales have meddled with the Newcastle City Counvided cil-as you would well know, Mr Deputy Firstly, Speaker-the Sydney City Council and the South Sydney City Council. So the Labor and Party in Australia is certainly not without blame, and it should not stand inside this glasshouse and throw those sorts of stones the coalition about the way reform has taken place and the effects of that reform on local government. The financing process of local government is a very important element of the federal way that we run this country. It is interesting to listen to some of the comments and to still hear, 2Y2 years later, about some of the elements of Fightback, even though that manifesto is dead and buried. The Labor Party is very concerned and it is chomping at the bit to have a crack at the policy that we will go to the next election with. Well, it is just going to have to wait a bit longer. It certainly will be a comprehensive policy. On a personal note, I certainly acknowledge the very important existence of local government in the three-tiered system in Australia. It is a level of government that we certainly cannotjake too lightly. I believe that, over the years, we have seen a diminution of the recognition of local government. There was a referendum question on the constitutional recognition of local government and, at the time, I was a member of local government, not a member of this place. I was certainly personally concerned that that referendum question did not get up, because local government in Australia deserves constitutional recognition. It is absolutely important to the well-being of the taxpayers and the ratepayers in local government areas. Local government provides a lot of the daily services that we require, need and expect and it does so, I would dare say, in the most efficient manner of any level of government. I know I will draw a bit of criticism on that point, but I do believe that that is the case. The Local Government (Financial Assistfair ance) Bill 1995 replaces the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 under which federal financial assistance grants.FAGs-are provided to local government. Under present arrangements, FAGs are proin two separately identified categories. general purpose grants are paid on a per capita basis to each state and territory, the funds are distributed between councils by local government grants commissions on a horizontal equalisation basis. Secondly, at identified local roads grants are distributed between the states and territories according to a historical formula based on their relative road needs. Until 1990-91, these grants were in the form of tied grants for local roads and were channelled through the transport portfolio. The local road funds were untied in 1991-92, but they remain separately identified. The intrastate distribution of these funds is carried out by the local government grants commissions according to principles which vary between states, but which generally reflect, to a greater or lesser extent, factors such as road length, population and maintenance requirements. Under this bill we are debating today, the general purpose and roads grants will continue to be separately identified, that is, the method of interstate distribution will not be affected. However, the intrastate distribution by local government grants commissions will be performed on the basis of national principles declared by the federal minister, instead of according to different principles in place each state and territory. Prior to 1990-91, there was an element of road funding channelled directly from the Commonwealth to local authorities under a number of different programs. One that immediately comes to mind is the Australian land transport program, which I know the council that I was a member of at the time used very efficiently and effectively in upgrading our network of economically important road infrastructure. We were able to take every single dollar that came through that program from the Commonwealth and apply it directly to road improvement, and we managed to get many hundreds of kilometres of very important road infrastructure in our council area improved to the level where it needs only minimal maintenance today. It was a very important program, one that was recognised throughout local government as being a very good program. I am a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which is conducting an inquiry into the relationship between the Commonwealth and states as far as special purpose payments are concerned. There has been some criticism of the Commonwealth on the growth of SPPs and the concept that that may be moving to more of a centralist position rather than a federalist position. In this particular area, that of road funding, to a certain extent my personal view is a centralist view in that I believe that some of the benefits that were attained back in those days, before 1991, are not being attained today. We are not achieving the dollars in real terms on our roads in rural Australia. The inventory of bridge infrastructure and the state of that bridge infrastructure are absolutely appalling. I do not know where the money is going to come from but ultimately it has got to come from the Commonwealth, as the prime taxing body in Australia, to local government to renew or to renovate that bridge infrastructure in rural Australia. BridgCouncils. es in my area are approaching 60, 70 or 80 years old, all of timber construction, and local government just does not have the wherewithal to provide the funding to replace those bridges. I know that there have been a numin ber in my area that recently received funding from the former government in New South Wales using new technology as far as stress laminated panelling is concerned, putting new decking on· bridges, and they have done a good job. Some have had to be reconstructed. I know the Hastings council recently negotiated to make funds available to repair the Kindee bridge in the upper Hastings area, but there are hundreds and hundreds more that are not going to get funding from that area because local government does not have the resources. This tier of government, the Commonwealth, collects an enormous amount of revenue from fuel taxes, around $10 billion. This year I think we are seeing about $867 million spent on the roads in this nation, and it is not really good enough. The point that I am making today is that we are fiddling around the edges here. I would like to see a little more attention paid by the Commonwealth to that crisis situation. If you look at the inventory of road infrastructure in a local government area in a city, the K and G is in and there is a blacktop on the road. Everything is done; there are just maintenance programs. We have got roads that are of vital importance in rural and regional Australia that are in a deplorable state, with gravel surfaces. Councils cannot afford to resheet and roll those roads. A fair dinkum program with a continuing injection of capital going into local government would certainly improve that situation. I got some correspondence from the Australian Local Government Association with regard to this bill, highlighting some areas where it believed the bill was deficient, and I might just refer to that briefly: Dear Member On May 10 the Minister of Housing and Regional Development introduced the new Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill to continue the payment of untied Commonwealth grants to We welcome much of the Bill, and acknowledge the extensive consultation which has occurred with Local Government during drafting. The Minister has responded positively to a number of Local Government requests-:And that needs to be put on the record. I improving concur with the comments that are being made by David Plumridge, who is the signaneutral' tory of this letter. But he goes on to say: Regrettably, however, the Bill is seriously flawed in a number of respects. It fails to implement various agreements reached at conferences of Local Government Ministers held in October 1994 and this April, and contains provisions which are inconsistent with a system of untied, general purpose grants. The sections of the Bill causing concern are: · section 6, which sets out the procedure for establishing national principles to guide the allocaimprovement tion of grants amongst Councils · section 16, which requires annual reports to and Parliament · section 3, which sets out the intended the legislation. National Principles Local Government Ministers, including the and Commonwealth, agreed at the Conference that the national principles should be: · formulated in consultation with State Ministers and the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) · take the form of a disallowable instrument. The Bill fails to implement this agreement. There is no reference to consultation with ALGA and the Minister can simply formulate, revoke, or vary principles 'in writing'. There is no requirement for consultation at all when the varies principles. Annual Reports Section 16(2)(c) goes beyond the agreement reached with respect to reports to Parliament. Ministers and ALGA took the view on the performance of Councils should be to Local Government Ministers Conference, not on the record: Parliament. There has been no agreement as yet on the form which such reports should take, and issue is to be the subject of further investigation the officials and advice to Ministers next year. The provisions of the bill are therefore at best premature. Objects Sections 3(2)(d) and (e) are inappropriate in the context of legislation for untied, general purpose grants. The purpose of the grants is to enhance the capacity of Councils to provide a range of services communities in an equitable manner. Decisions to precisely how funds are to be spent must remain a matter for each Council. Specific references to efficiency and services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are inconsistent with the 'horizontal equalisation' and 'effort approaches set out in subsequent sections. This Association is in no way opposed to steps being taken to improve the efficiency of Councils and services to ATSI communities. In fact, agreement was reached at the April Local Government Ministers Conference on programs of activity to achieve both those objectives. There is simply no need for them to be raised in the Bill. In the case of ATSI communities, it was agreed that one of the national principles would refer to their particular needs. To go further and make the of services a specific object of the Bill can only raise unsustainable expectations that such improvements will occur. This is a dangerous potentially divisive course of action, especially given that the Bill does not and cannot provide any objects of . special funding for that purpose. Only a tiny fraction of the grants received by Councils relate to the needs of ATSI communities, it has never before been suggested that general purpose grants to Councils are a significant part of the solution to the very real problems of our indigenous people. Substantial additional resources and concerted action by all three spheres of government are required to achieve better outcomes. Our underlying concern is that once this Act refers to one particular group with special needs, others will inevitably seek similar treatment. Local Government has broad social justice responsibilities and it is wrong to focus so strongly on just one section of the population, albeit arguably the most Minister revokes or disadvantaged. The Australian Local Government Association wrote to the Minister seeking amendments to address these concerns', but our approach was State rejected. Details of the amendments we now that reporting propose are attached. the It goes on to say-and I will have to put this the I wish to acknowledge the' valuable assistance by received from the office of Mr Bruce Scott MP, Shadow Minister for Local Government, in drafting those amendments. We would greatly appreciate your support. I was a very committed member of local government for a number years, as was the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) who is in the chamber now . We both, regrettably, had to resign from local government on that to fateful day in 1993. It was a sad day for me, as because it had been a great learning experience' and a great period of involvement in local· affairs. I believe the government has to recognise and take on board some of the comments that that peak body has given the rrlinister. That body. certainly acknowledges the consultation that the minister had with it and, obviously, it is the minister's prerogative from that point onwards in drafting this legislation as to what elements of its recommendations he takes· on board. We acknowledge that it is the minister's prerogative to do that, but we certainly do not have to agree with it. So I thought it was important that that correspondence and those sentiments from the Australian Local Government Association be put on the public record. In closing, I wish to reiterate some commerits that I made with regard to local road funding, in order to flag to the government that it is not a problem that will go away. It is. not a problem that we can palm off onto state government. It is something that must be addressed and that we must face up to. The Commonwealth, as the body that receives the majority of the revenue income in this nation by way of taxes and other receipts, should address the problem that is growing at a rapid rate in rural and regional Australia: the problem of our roads. The problem will not go away, and we will certainly have to pay attention to it. At some stage in the future, this government or a future coalition government is going to have to address that matter, either by way of SPPs that are made directly through state governments and are earmarked to go to local roads, or else by going back to the system in place prior to 1990-91, whereby funding came directly from the Commonwealth to local government. I have absolutely no problem with that, because-speaking as one who was a member of local government at that time. I believe that the people who paid the taxes which ended up back in local government got the best value for their dollar from local government with those roads. I know that some of my colleagues on this side of the chamber might not necessarily agree with me, but that is my personal view. If we end up back in that situation, I believe we will get more kilometres of road sealed. Certainly, if a government in the future decides t-at it will address the problem by way of SPPs through state governments, that is fine; but the issue of rural and regional roads is not going to go away, and this is the forum that really has to address it. The Commonwealth government has ultimately to provide the funding to address those very serious infrastructure issues in rural and regional Australia. l\fs DEAHM (Macquarie) (1.52 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill because I have served some time with local government, as have so many other people in this chamber, as the member. for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has said. In fact, a few of my colleagues were chatting in the caucus room the other day and working out how many of us had been in local government. There are quite a few, and I think that says a lot: maybe it is a good grounding for the federal parliament. Local government is an extremely important level of government because, practically speaking, it is the closest to the people. I started off as an alderman-what is now called a councillor. An alderman's home is his or her office, and people get in touch at 6 o'clock in the morning or 11 o'clock at night when they have a problem, whether it be that a mad dog has just jumped their fence, there is a pothole in their road, their gutter has just given way, or whatever. Local government is certainly very close to the people, and that gives a great opportunity for people in local government to really get to know people and issues. It also takes the wind out of one's sails if one feels a bit high and mighty and is thinking of being just a policy person. One has to be a very practical person in local government, so I am very grateful for the experience. During my period in local government, I also chaired my council's finance committee. Being thrown in at the deep end with my first budget was a pretty traumatic experience. I come from an area which has a fairly low rate base because it does not have a lot of large industry. Looking at creative ways to raise money and maximise the grant dollars was always a big challenge. I also had the privilege for a while of chairing the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, so I got a broader view of the issues in my region. As did the member for Lyne, I will talk about roads because they are extremely important. I welcome this bill because it does allow for greater recognition by the federal government of local government. I am very sorry that the opposition saw fit. in 1988 to work at knocking off the referendum question which would have given constitutional status to local government. There were four referendum issues at the time. In the beginning they had bipartisan support. Everybody thought they would get up. They were straightforward, motherhoodpardon the expression-items. However, the opposition decided to knock them off, based on some spurious argument about how giving freedom of religion to Australians would mean that the federal government would stop funding church schools. The member for Flinders (Mr Reith) came to prominence in that campaign. After listening to the member for Flinders raving about those particular issues, as far as I am concerned he has absolutely no credibility on anything he does. He effectively knocked off the chance for local government to have constitutional recognition through that dum. So local government now exists at the whim of state governments, and we have seen what some of the state governments have done. Mr Bruce Scott-On both sides.",53
46,Ms DEAHM,PAIRS,"On both sides, definitely. However, if local governments had a higher status and greater recognition there would be better quality councils, and this bill goes a long way towards improving their status. Mr Bruce Scott-Not in your case.",58
47,Ms DEAHM,PAIRS,"Not in my part of the world. Somebody saw fit to put a bomb outside my council door one night in the middle of a meeting. That was not too joyful! However, the opposition cannot crow too much, as the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) said, about how it feels about local government or it certainly would have supported that referendum question. I know it is not part of this bill, but I think it is worth alluding to the additional grant funds for local government projects in this year's budget. There will be &n extra $48 million over four years, putting the grants together rather than in different categories. This has given a lot more flexibility to local government. The two main local governments in my area depend very heavily on those grants because, as I have said, they have a very low rate base. I would like to take issue with the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) about the supposed lack of consultation. I am thankful to the member for Lyne for reading that paragraph from the Australian Local Government Association's letter. I will repeat it: . We welcome much of the Bill, and acknowledge the extensive consultation which has occurred with Local Government during drafting. The Minister has responded positively to a number of Local Government's requests. I note that it says 'during drafting'-not after. That letter says very clearly-and I know it was the case-that there was extensive consultation with the association and that it had an input into the bill. In this letter which we have all just received, the association disagrees with some things, but it does not say referen- that there was no consultation. The end result of consultation is not that all parties are going to get everything they want. I have stood up in this place a number of times and talked on bills where the opposition members have said, 'We weren't consulted' or 'The interest groups were not consulted.' However, when I have talked to ministers and 'to their officers, I have found out that extensive consultations did take place. So that is an absolute furphy. National reporting is an extremely important part of this bill. It goes a long way towards making local governments more responsive and making their actions more transparent. Again, I have to emphasise that this is not something that the federal government is going to get and hold to its bosom and do nothing with. It is going to go to the Local Government Ministers Conference. The state and federal ministers will be looking at national reporting. Everyone will have a chance, once again, to have an input. I think those issues are very important. Some councils, as we know, work extremely efficiently and others are a bit slack. The national reporting, the efficiency measures and the benchmarking will go a long way towards pulling into line the local government authorities that have not been efficient. As a result, they will produce a better product for their ratepayers and their local residents. Local government is the level of government which people love to hate the most. Local papers, like mine, are full of criticism of local government. Occasionally there is praise, but when something good happens the papers very seldom give local governments a pat on the back, but they are into them like Flynn if they have not done something the people want done. So I think better reporting, better benchmarking, will be a step forward in that area. I agree entirely with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the road funding issue. Like your electorate, a lot of my electorate is ruralalthough probably not to the same extent. In the Blue Mountains part of my electorate there were lots of housing developments before the section 94 contributions were required to put in kerbing, guttering, roads and so on. The local government authority has always been behind the eight ball in sealing those roads. Because the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury in my electorate are environmentally sensitive areas, not having roads sealed is detrimental to the environment as well as a great inconvenience to the residents. We were fortunate to get a $10 million grant from the last state government. I do not mind giving some praise to a conservative government for doing that. It was to the credit of our then city engineer who, over a number of years, browbeat and got that grant. Trying to work out which roads were to be sealed first was not a job I would have liked to have had, but the engineers did that. However, people constantly came to us councillors asking· when their roads would be sealed because they were in a dreadful state. I will never forget one case which involved a hill where the sides fell away very steeply. A car could not be parked there. Old people had to wheel their garbage bins up to the top of the street because the garbage truck could not get down there. I lobbied extensively and .got that brought up the list. But, having brought it up the list, someone else was dropped down the list. Roads are certainly a very difficult issue. I also agree, as I think a number of members on both sides of this House do, that the road funding principles that were changed in 1992 perhaps have not helped. The federal government now gives untied money to state governments, and I know that that money does not always go into roads. The arterial road program, the rural roads program and the black spot program were excellent because they were able to target areas of greatest need. Keeping road funding separate under this legislation is very important because it highlights the great need for roadworks. Like the member for Lyne, I look at metropolitan councils and see that their roadworks involve just repairs and resealing, whereas in rural areas we are trying to do it from scratch. I welcome that part of the legislation which deals with this as well. I will not say any more on this legislation because a lot has been said already and I want to give other speakers the opportunity to make their contribution. I commend the government for the bill. I commend in particular the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) for his commitment to local government and his dedication in bringing this legislation forward.",58
48,Mr CHYNOWETH,PAIRS,"=---I am pleased to speak on the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill because it gives me the opportunity to speak on what is happening to local government in Victoria. The main local government body in my electorate is the city of Frankston. I do not agree with Jeffrey Kennett on many things, but I did agree with him that there had to be an amalgamation of local councils. I was sorry that the state government, a Labor government at the time, did not do it. However, I do not agree with the way Mr Kennett has gone about amalgamating the local councils or whom he has put in charge. At the moment he has appointed three commissioners to the city of Frankston. These three commissioners are all paid-up members of the Liberal Party. They are not ex-members, former members or party friends; they are present, paid-up, card-carrying members of the Liberal Party. That is where my problem starts. If honourable members have a look in today's Age they will see this is also mentioned there. In a local magazine entitled Frankston, our city 1995, which was recently put out by the Frankston City Council, nowhere does it list members of parliament. It gives a list of community organisations, play groups, progress associations and schools, but it lists no member of parliament. However, it does list political organisations. It has five headings, which include 'Australian Labor Party', 'Liberal Party-Frankston Heights Branch', 'Liberal Party-Seaford Branch', and 'Young Liberals-Mount ElizalFrankston'. Then it has something quite strange: the 'Dunkley Federal Electorate Council'. If people in the community wanted to ring up the Electoral Commission, they would probably ring the number under that heading. If they rang that number, they would get a very strange reply. They would find that the Dunkley Federal Electorate Council, which is near the top of this list of political parties, the campaign office for my opponent in Dunkley. This is mentioned in a book that has been circulated all over the city of Frankston. The campaign office for my opponent is actually shown on one of his bits of propaganda that he puts out as 2 Heritage Avenue, Post Office Box 560, Frankston 3199 and phone number 783 1140. When you ring this particular number it goes to his campaign office. However, if you look in this book it says, 'Dunkley Federal Electorate Council, 76 Old Mornington Road, Mt Eliza; Mr J August.' So you think that you are going to ring Mr August, but you do not because his private phone number is 9787 8095. But when you ring that particular number, it gets transferred to 783 1140. If my opponent is not there, you get an answering machine that says, 'This is the campaign office of the candidate for Dunkley.' If this is the sort of trick the council is going to play by putting it in this book and distributing it all over the city of Frankston, I ani afraid it will have to play politics with me. I have tried to get on with the council as best I could in the last six months. Now I am afraid the time has come when I cannot get on with it. Let me give the H-use a bit of an example of what it has cost the people of Frankston for those commissioners who were undemocratically elected, who were appointed by Jeffrey Kennett. He could have put Adolf Hitler or anyone in there. He just plucks these people out of the Liberal Party, puts them in these positions and pays them huge wages-and to do what? To stifle democracy. I think the people of Frankston should go back to the old days where there was that saying, 'No taxation without representation.' We should be pushing this sort of line and not paying our rates. Naturally, I could not do that sort of thing as one of the leaders in the community, but maybe someone else might go for this line. Unless we have democratically elected councillors, why should we pay our rates. Let us have a look at what the commissioners are getting. They have salaries of $200,000; they have on-costs of probably is about $15,000; they have got expense allowances of $15,000; and they have got vehicles costing $60,000. They have got a new city logo that has been designed, and that cost $22,000. They have got additional costs for a chief executive officer-these are people who have been appointed after these commissioners-including a consultancy for appointment of the new chief executive officer which cost $10,000. They have got a sea wall that they are paying for which is not even within the Frankston shire boundaries any more, and that is costing $60,000. Full-page advertisements announcing the appointment of the commissioners cost a couple of thousand dollars. The salary of a newly employed public relations officer is $30,000. All in all, so far the commissioners of Frankston have cost the people of Frankston about $445,000. Of course, that does not include the mobile telephones, the consultancies, the office equipment, e,t cetera, that go with them. What is happening? Where is the council getting this money from? It is cutting it from the staff who work for the city of Frankston. In the chief executive's office, it has appointed about four people; in the economic development section of the council, it has appointed another three people; i:1 business support it has appointed another three people. It adds up to about 25 people altogether. However, the council has announced that it will reduce staff by 51. That means that these positions will be lost. ' Where are these 51 positions coming from? They are coming from health officers, immunisation workers, home carers, drainage maintenance, plant operators, street sweepers, building inspectors and caretakers as well as people working in preschools, cemetery, nursery, litter collection, parks, gardens, family counselling, support and youth services, and child care. That is where the jobs will be lost. They will be lost not out of all the executive staff, but from where the real workers are, at the coalface, where the people who work for the community are placed. They are all going to be sacked to make up this phoney amount that the Kennett government has setand that these governments have to save. Those people are going to be sacked any minute now. We have actually had information that it could happen very soon. What else has this council cut? A newspaper article was headed 'Council grants slashed by half'. The areas that have been cut include: community houses; the MS self-help group, cut from $1,000 to $700; the Biala Peninsula, which helps disabled youth, cut from $750 to zero dollars; and the Seaford Junior Library, cut from $700 to $450. The list goes on and on, page after page. They are just a few examples. These are the tremendous cuts the appointees of Jeffrey Kennett are going to make which will affect the whole community. The commissioners will be looked after very nicely-sitting on a fat wage and getting a car, a telephone and all the perks and lurks that go with it. As I said at the beginning, I did not intend to attack the commissioners of the city of Frankston. I have played it pretty straight with them until now. But they have put the phone and campaign office of my opponent in a magazine that goes throughout .the whole community-and that is playing dirty pool as far as I am concerned. The Liberal Party here usually gets its orders in relation to local government from Des Moore, who works for the Institute of Public Affairs. The IPA recently announced in a summary of the Commonwealth budget it put out that it was going to have an audit commission. The Liberal Party has picked this up and said it is going to have this audit if it ever gets into power. You can take the IPA Backgrounder, which came out on 10 February 1995, as being fairly accurate. In it, under the heading 'Assistance for local government', Des Moore said: There is no case for the Commonwealth to provide funding to local governments, which are a creation of the States and whose functions are distributed, as between State and local levels, differently amongst the States. If the Liberals ever got into power, that is what it intends to d-ut out local government. The amount involved here is $152 million. Can you imagine what would happen to local government if the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and Jeffrey Kennett ever got in at the same time? That would be slashed, destroyed and all the good work done by local government councillors would be lost.. It is all right for us here-and we are away from home probably six months a year-but it is the local councillors who look after local issues. The main issues I look after now are local government issues-roads, drains, dogs barking, trees and all thatbecause the people of Frankston have nowhere to go. They cannot speak to the commissioners. They can always ring me and speak to me, and I can fire off a letter and try to get some sort of answer from the commissioners of the city of Frankston. Democracy has been denied in Frankston, in Victoria. It is about time people all over Victoria stood up and realised what is going on. As I said before, I believe someone within our community-not me-should take the lead and say, 'No taxation without representation.' Get rid of these Kennett appointed members of the Liberal Party and put in people who are democratically elected.",59
49,Mr LATHAM,PAIRS,"I am pleased to speak in support of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Bill before the House. Even though, compared with federal systems internationally, local government in Australia does not represent a large proportion of the public sector, the impact of its services is significant. Australia's 800 councils spend approximately $10 billion, nearly two per cent of GDP, on a wide range of economic and social services. Improvements to the development approval process, for example, are an essential microeconomic reform. Investment in land and building development accounts for approximately 14 per cent of Australia's GDP. It is estimated that $1 billion in cost could be removed from the business sector if councils lifted their performance in development approvals to best practice standards. I know that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) is keen to see those best practice standards produced across the local government sector. Local government discharges a growing set of responsibilities for quality of life programs. It is little understood in Australia's federal system of government how among the five community services from which young people derive their lifestyle opportunities-education, child care, recreation, cultural pursuits and libraries-all but education are provided by local government. In any practical assessment of social justice and equity issues in Australia, local government bulks large. The quality of .life in Australia depends substantially on the services and opportunities which the community provides from the combined resources of government. Inequality depends as much on where people live and their access to basic services as their access to satisfactory incomes. Less privileged areas are particularly affected by the lack of ""resources available to local government. In affluent areas and regions, high personal incomes can secure access to a range of services otherwise provided by local government. If residents purchase for themselves personal libraries, recreation facilities, child care and opportunities in the arts, the need for councils to provide these services is substantially reduced. Private affluence replaces public necessity. Conversely, the extent and quality of council services are much more important for the quality of life in ""low income areas. The federal government has an equity role to play in closing the gap between municipal responsibilities and municipal finances in disadvantaged local government areas. The traditional role of councils as providers of civic infrastructure and property related services is not as important to the creation of a more equal society as quality of life services. In disadvantaged areas, progress is more likely to come from quality libraries and learning and recreational and cultural development than roads, drainage and waste removal. Unless local government plays a strong role in lifestyle opportunities, rewards and progress in our society will continue to be founded more on where people live and the wealth and privilege of families than on merit and equal opportunity. The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 provides for federal untied financial assistance grants to be paid on an equal per capita basis to each state and territory. The aggregate amount of financial assistance grants and road funding comes to approximately $1 billion each year. Section 9 of the 1986 legislation sets out the basis of horizontal equalisation. The act also requires that no council receive less than it would have received if 30 per cent of the total funds in each state had been distributed on a per capita basis. Horizontal equalisation in the main act means equalisation of the capacity to provide services, not equalisation of outcomes for the quality of life in each local government area. That is, grants are allocated to achieve, state by state, a certain standard of service with insufficient regard for social need and the demand for services. Only by gauging the capacity of areas to provide services from personal incomes and assets can governments target the benefits of public resources and services. Presently, the funding formulas in each state give too much weight to equalising the standard of services and not enough to equalising their social impact in the community. As a result, grants are not necessarily targeted to areas of highest social need. This shortcoming was well exposed by data presented in the discussion 'paper Financing local government produced last year by the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review. The paper presents a correlation between the allocation of financial assistance grants and the ABS 1991 census index of relative socio-economic disadvantage. The index scores each local government area in Australia according to a range of socio-economic variables such as income, education levels, unemployment rates and home ownership. The data in table 1, which I will seek to have incorporated in Hansard, reveals a series of inequitable outcomes. There is only a loose correlation between socio-economic need and the scale of grants. In Victoria, for instance, the most disadvantaged 25 per cent of councils averaged grants of $47.77 per capita in 1991-92 while the second most advantaged quarter of councils received over $56 per capita. In Western Australia, the second quarter of councils received substantially lower per capita grants than the more affluent third quarter. In Tasmania, the second quarter received substantially higher grants than the more advantaged first quarter. At a regional level, even more inequitable outcomes are common. Table 2, which I will also seek to incorporate in Hansard, using eight councils on Sydney's urban fringe, shows how levels of social advantage and disadvantage are unrelated to the size and scale of financial assistance grants per capita. These correlations and inequities can be linked to two inadequacies in the 1986 act. First, the methodologies adopted by the state local government grant commISSIOns allow substantial variations from a national approach to needs based funding. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for seeking, through this legislation, to ensure that national principles based on equity and efficiency are incorporated in the allocation of financial assistance grants to local government. The core methodology for revenue raising capacity in each state relies heavily on property valuations and rating bases. Standardised expenditures are determined mainly by cost differentials such as location, distance and the sparsity of population. Most significantly, no state includes in its funding formula a reliable measure of socio-economic advantage and disadvantage. While for many years these statistics and indices were not available, the ABS and the Australian Taxation Office now have devised a series of worthwhile measures, excellent measures, suitable for national standards. There is no longer any reason why the funding formulas should not take prominent account of the social need for municipal services. The principles set out in the 1986 act, and formulas devised by the Local Government Grants Commission in the states and subsequently approved by federal ministers, ensure that any correlation between the distribution of grants and socio-economic need has virtually been coincidental. The high priority given to revenue raising capacity has meant that only when revenue measures have coincided with community needs has a local government area received an equitable share of funding. In the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney, for instance, land values and rate revenue are artificially inflated by Sydney's expensive property market, yet disposable family incomes are relatively low. As a result, councils receive per capita federal grants based on distorted measures of revenue raising capacity rather than the capacity of the community to provide services for itself. Secondly, the equity of grant allocations is heavily distorted by the requirement for 30 per cent of funds to be distributed on a per capita basis. This guarantees each local authority in Australia access to federal grants. On a needs based assessment, however, not every local government area requires special assistance to service its community. If the full logic of horizontal equalisation is followed to its most equitable outcome, levies should be placed on relatively well-endowed councils to help finance grants for the less well endowed. This policy has been used in some European nations to ensure the success of horizontal equalisation, irrespective of the provision of general revenue assistance from other levels of government. However, assuming the absence of intralocal government redistribution and adequate federal funding to achieve full equalisation to the highest standard, two models of equalisation are available to the federal government: full equalisation to a standard determined by available funds and partial equalisation to a higher standard. The 1986 legislation uses the latter approach, with the further restriction of the 30 per cent per capita threshold. By applying the conclusions of the 1985 Self report on disability measures, where 22 per cent of councils would not be eligible for funding under full equalisation, to the 1991 ABS census index of relative socio-economic disadvantage, it is possible to approximate the funding in each state which is needlessly allocated to affluent local government areas. So $130.1 million of federal grants in the mainland states would otherwise be available for distribution to more disadvantaged local government areas. This represents 18.2 per cent of the federal allocation for 1993-94. The Self report in 1985 calculated this amount at 20 per cent, using a comprehensive model of disabilities. It can therefore be understood that the minister has a task ahead of him in determining national principles to ensure the most equitable allocation of funds. Equalisation can be enhanced by abolishing the per capita component. As the Self report concluded at page 253 of its deliberations: . . . if the same order of funds is made available as at present, 70 per cent of authorities would be entitled to equalisation grants and these grants would be sufficient to raise each of these authorities to within $0.5M of the average disability ... without the per capita constraint, nearly 80 per cent of authorities would receive grants sufficient to raise them fully to the average disability. I make the additional point that the re-allocation of local government funding in this fashion can proceed not only on the basis of social equity blit also with an important employment consequence-that is, the councils which would receive the extra funding by and large are part of low employment, low growth regions. As Bob Gregory has pointed out in his research, this is largely a product of economic restructuring. The loss of relatively low skilled work in some of the manufactur. ing and government sectors has led to above average rates of unemployment. The restructuring of the economy has also meant that jobs in the non-traded sector are being predominantly provided in high growth, high consumption regions, with the outsourcing of household functions. This proposal for the redistribution of local government funding seeks to provide not only social equity and meet social need but also an outstanding employment consequence for the provision of relatively low skill, non-traded work in regions with low employment. It seeks to provide lower rates of unemployment. So I recommend that proposition in the formulation of the national principles. I now tum to the question of road funding, which is dealt with in this bill. State commissions have always included an assessment for roads as part of their determination of financial assistance grants. This role is now duplicated by identified road grants with formulas that vary substantially from state to state. Table 3, which I will seek to have incorporated in Hansard, presents a summary of the state formulas. This highlights the absence of a national approach to local road funding. The weakness of these grants is the way in which ,they distort the principles of horizontal equalisation. Grants are allocated between the states according to past patterns of expenditure instead of per capita funding. These imbalances are aggravated by inequities in the road funding formulas in some states. Again, I congratulate the minister for moving towards national principles-not only the FAGs, the financial assistance grants, but also the road funding allocations. Moreover, local road grants have become a sub-titute for other sources of local government revenue dedicated to roads. Most councils have a road allocation target or precedent in their annual budget which is set with little regard for the size of federal grants. As the Self report concluded: ... road grants to local government are very to general purpose assistance, especially since. nothing is done to counter substitution effects local government level and ensure that the money actually leads to increased spending on roads in the longer run it would be desirable to absorb the Commonwealth grant for local roads into program of general purpose assistance. The main argument presented against this recommendation is that it is not supported by a majority of councils. This is simply a of the beneficiaries of inequity outweighing the lobbying capacity of the disadvantaged. Local road grants have become an addition to the overall financial capacity of councils without any link to social need or horizontal equalisation principles. Table to their impact in each state. The current allocation of road grants progovernment vides a significant funding share for affluent local government areas. Table 5 shows that $61.4 million or 20.4 per cent of local road funding was granted to the 22 per cent most advantaged municipalities in the mainland states in 1993-94. These figures combined with the financial assistance grants mean approximately $200 million or 19 per cent federal funding for local government in distributed Australia is allocated to councils which are socially measured and socially conceived being least in need. The distribution of road grants in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia between urban and rural areas creates further inequities. In particular, allowance is made for local government areas which are classified urban yet contain stantial rural road networks. Even the Nationarterial al Party would be interested in that phenomThis enon. Table 6 gives examples in New South Wales where councils in designated urban areas receive much lower per capita funding ... than rural councils with the same road length. Per capita figures are valid in this instance as they broadly reflect traffic volumes and the relative benefit of road funding shares. The vagaries of urban development and local government boundaries have meant that most urban fringe councils in Sydney-I represent one at Campbelltown in my electorate-the Hunter and Illawarra are based on close urban areas surrounded by a network of townships and rural roads, The fixed distribuat the tion of urban and road funding shares has not been sensitive to this need. Rural roads in ... urban statistical areas receive no more than 30 the per cent of the federal funding allocated to rural roads in rural statistical areas in New South Wales. I point out to the shadow minister, the case member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who is a member of the National Party, that there is a very important inequity here. If he wants to support rural roads, he should recognise the funding needs of what have been regarded in the statistical data as urban areas because of 4 gives a guide these anomalies. Strong arguments can be presented for the to incorporate local road grants into the program of general purpose assistance. This would produce greater autonomy for local government in its expenditure decisions, simplify the grant scheme and resolve several aspects of inequitable funding. If separate local road grants remain, they should, that after the expiry of the new agreement reof solved at the recent Premiers Conference, be on a per capita basis for each state, with a standard funding formula in all states as and without artificial distinctions between urban and rural areas. I will now refer to the findings of some recent reports on road funding. The National Transport Planning Taskforce in a report in no November last year found that Australia would maximise its GDP by transferring a subproportion of road funding from local to roads and from rural to urban roads. finding was supported by the work of Dr Vince FitzGerald, which was commissioned by the Australian Automobile Association, in 1993. Dr FitzGerald's finding stated: the historical pattern of investment has led to relative over-investment in local and rural roads and under-investment in major urban roads. An economically optimal pattern of investment should result in returns from investment in each category of road being similar. Instead the results show higher returns from investment in urban roads than from investment in local and rural roads. This should not be a surprise to the House. It is not surprising that GDP is maximised by a transfer from rural to urban road funding and from local to arterial road funding. This is the way in which the Australian economy has been transformed over the past decade. There has been a major shift in the origins of production from agriculture and mining-the ar-as on which Australia has historically reb ed-to manufacturing and service industries mainly based in urban areas. At the end of my speech, I will seek to incorporate in Hansard table 7 and table 8. This will provide the statistical evidence developed by Dr FitzGerald. The government has recent experience with the benefits of capital works funding for local councils. In 1992-93 and again the following year approximately $350 million was allocated to local capital works in regions with rates of unemployment above the national average. These were by and large very successful schemes. The special federal grants helped councils clear a backlog of infrastructure projects which were outside the scope of their annual budgets. Councils estimated that the Tabl- One:.

The valuation reports prepared by the minister's department also demonstrated the strong and very useful employment effects of those schemes. I believe the government should ensure that part of its overall funding for local government is dedicated to capital works purposes in disadvantaged areas. This would more effectively realise the government's goals for targeting assistance to areas of greatest need and building up the quality of lifestyle services. Only with federal capital assistance can some councils operate beyond the scope of a maintenance authority and actively upgrade the standard of local infrastructure. I have tried to outline some principles, ideas and concepts based on equity and efficiency which the minister may find useful in the preparation of the national principles in this outstanding legislation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the eight tables that I have referred to in my speech. Leave granted.

50,Mr HOWE,PAIRS,"in reply-I thank those members who have contributed to the debate. As the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) said, this local government legislation is important. It opens up a very significant agenda for and debate on local government funding. Perhaps that debate is not quite as far reaching as the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) would like, but I think it provides the basis for a significant shift in local government funding over time to greater reflect the dual objectives of efficiency and equity that the member referred to. Those principles are extraordinarily important in any tier of government and they are sorted out by the balance of forces at a particular time. As numerous speakers referred to, the Commonwealth's relationship with local government not only involves a partnership, but also necessarily involves the states, which have significant legislative power in local government and which set their own local government reform objectives. We heard something of that from the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). While he agrees with the objective, he has very considerable reservations about the means chosen to achieve that objective, particularly the power of the non-elected commissioners and the concerns about the use of state fiscal policy to impose targets in relation to local governEstimated benefit- Annual Long-run cost ratio for each financing cost (year 10) annual $1 billion over 35-year net increase investment life in GDP 1992/93 $m p.a. 1992/93 $m p.a. % of GDP 2.1 70 270 0.07 2.0 70 270 0.07 1.0 70 120 0.03 4.8 70 620 0.15 6.0 70 810 0.20 1.0 70 110 0.03 ment savings that are achieved at a time when there are no elected councils in place. In your previous life, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I do not think you would have felt comfortable with that kind of approach to reform. We are talking here about what the Commonwealth can do, and I think the Commonwealth can be clearer about its objectives. This legislation does not seek to tie funding for local government, but I do not think that is a serious argument anywhere. We are about to provide over a billion dollarsapart from the various tied grants or special grants that were mentioned-untied for a particular purpose, because we do recognise the importance of local government. Indeed, much of what I have done while I have been responsible for local government is to say to local governments and local councils, 'You really have been far too unambitious in what you have sought to achieve.' .Local government in this country has somewhat meekly accepted the fact that its powers are much more limited than the powers that exist for local councils in other countries. For example, I spent time in the United States. I lived there for two years, and my family has lived there since for extended periods of time. What is striking about local government in the United States is the fact that it has considerably more power and influence than local government in this country. It is a very democratic level of government with very vigorous participation, but it is a level of government that has had a entrusted to it range of opportunities that simply have not been open to local government in this country. A precondition for local government having greater opportunity in this country is that local government undergoes a process of reform. In part, that is achieved through a reduction in the number of councils. I do not remember the number that the member for Maranoa mentioned, but it sounded like a lot less than it would have been a year or two ago. It is true that several state governments have been involved in very significant reform. Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland have all sought to reduce the number of councils, and I certainly congratulate them' for that. Local government does need to be, in the form of larger units, but that is very much a matter state government. As far as the federal government is concerned, we have' provided very substantial funding for local government-something like twice the level of funding that is made available by state governments. So we are relatively more important than state governments. It is not unreasonable that we are clear in what we provide that money for. In this bill, we have tried to make clear what objectives we are seeking to achieve. We are moving to a concept of national principles, and we are doing that for reasons that would not be surprising to the member for Werriwa. What we have found, when we have looked at the bilateral arrangements or the principles worked out with the states, is the existence of extraordinary inequities or differences between states. So, rather than having an influence in the past with principles like equity and efficiency, we have seen a set of principles worked out by states and state grants commissions that have differed widely in terms of their impact. It is not unreasonable, over time, to work towards a much more nationally consistent approach to the way that funds are distributed-and I think that is accepted. It has been suggested that there has not been some process of consultation. Frankly, I suppose if there has been any time at which I felt slightly emotional, it was when I was accused of not consulting local government. From the beginning I have consulted local government extremely widely, speaking to all of the state conferences of local government associations at one time or another. I have spoken to many individual local councils and to shire associations. What is more, we have put out a far-reaching report on financing for local government; in fact, we have put out two reports-and both have been acknowledged, I think, by the member for Maranoaproviding the data on the basis of which judgments might be made about, broadly, the allocation and distribution of funds by local government. Following the distribution of the papers in terms of the urban regional review, there have been a series of conferences involving for ministers for local government, and the ALGAs have been involved in those meetings. I have vigorously defended the right of local government to be present at those meetings. I might say that, on the part of the states, there has not been the same enthusiasm for local government to be present and to be fully part of the discussion. The first set of national principles were agreed by the states and the ALGA at the April conference of local government ministers. So there has been agreement about the set of national principles that were drafted at that time. The new bill provides that the minister, after consulting the state ministers, must formulate the principles in writing and convey them to state ministers. The new principles would then apply from the 1996-97 funding year onwards. As consultation and agreement have already taken place, the only further process is for me formally to agree with the principles in writing and notify the state ministers of them. So there has been a process, if you like, that has involved the ALGA and state ministers in a very thorough way-and I have sought to honour that. Consultation, as someone has remarked, does not mean agreement. It does not mean that at the end of the day I can take on board everything that has been suggested to me by the ALGA or its president. But I think, as the ALGA would concede or has conceded, we have been keen to consult closely with it. In the end we have tried to come up with something that it did not have any fundamental worries about. I think it has some niggles there. I think that is understandable in the sense that we are trying to move to a situation of much greater accountability and transparency, not just to the executive but to the parliament-and that is why we will introduce national reporting and make that report available to the parliament. We will never have better information; we have never had better information than is available. If the Commonwealth government invests over $1 billion a year along with the other funds .that it provides, I think it is entitled to get on the table a pretty fair view of how local government is performing. I think people would recognise that is not an easy business. It is not just a matter of publishing-as I saw in the paper the other day-a leaked table, and making judgments about that leaked table, say, for New South Wales. It is a matter of looking carefully at the functions of local government and recognising the necessity for making judgments that will often compare very different situations. So no-one has to be sure about comparing like with like. That is why the municipal association in Victoria has been very hard at work and, I must say, cooperatively has done some work in relation to benchmarking so that, ultimately, when we do put more emphasis on benchmarking, the work will have been done by local government and, therefore, will have acceptance from local government. It has been worked through in a very thorough way and progressively implemented, if you like, so that people have an opportunity to see what happens. Frankly, I think local government is going to welcome these reforms in practice. Perhaps the member for Maranoa would say the reforms are, essentially, a little too cautious. He would agree with the member for Werriwa on that, but I do not think the member for Maranoa would want to accept the reforms suggested, in a full-blooded way, by the member for Werriwa. We are gentle about this, but we are gentle about it because we believe the facts will be persuasive. If we can get the facts on the table, the facts themselves will ultimately be very persuasive. I have never said, 'We have to make threats or suggestions about removing untied grants.' We are supporting untied grants. We are enthusiastic about the autonomy of local government. That is why we supported. the referendum in 1988. We wanted constitutional recognition but, unfortunately, the other side of the House, led by the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), did not. The member for Flinders worked himself up into a terrible lather and, I think, did local government in this country a very great disservice. Frankly, as you indicated yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think the issue of recognition of local government is a matter there is a great deal of support for in the community. I conclude by thanking the various members for their contributions and assuring them that their comments have been taken on board. We will go on with this process of reform over time at a pace local government can live with, and in a way that recognises the contribution of the states, with whom we need to cooperate if we are to achieve the kinds of comprehensive reforms the member for Werriwa no doubt would be pursuing as a backbencher and, ultimately, as a minister within future governments. Amendment negatived. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",70
51,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"by leave-I move: (1) Clause 6, page 5, line 20, after ""State Ministers"" insert ""and with a body or bodies representative of local government"". (2) Clause 6, page 6, line 4, after ""The Minister may,"" insert ""after consulting with relevant State Ministers and with a body or bodies representative of local government,"". (3) Clause 6, page 6, line 7, after ""Australian Capital Territory"" insert ""and to a body or bodies representative of local government"". One of the most glaring omissions in this bill is the failure to require consultation with local government on the preparation of the national principles for the intrastate distribution of financial assistance grants. This is a breach of the understanding reached between local government, state ministers and the Australian Local Government Association at the recent local government ministers conference. The need for the minister to consult with local government on the development of national distribution principles should be selfexplanatory. Local government works closely with the states and the Commonwealth on discussions relating to the development, implementation and operation of these principles. It would be inconceivable that consultation on these issues not be reflected in the bill. It is also a rather strange omission in light of the government's express commitment to consultation, as evidenced in the minister's recent announcement of his intention to develop an accord with local government. The amendment requiring the minister to consult with state ministers and local government before varying or revoking the principles similarly needs little explanation. The bill's silence on the need for consultation in the event of variation or revocation of the principles may have been a drafting oversight; nevertheless, it is one that needs to be corrected. There is also no reason why the bill should not require the minister to provide copies of the national principles to local government, as key players in the administration of local government funding arrangements. I commend the amendments to the House. Amendments agreed to.",72
52,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PAIRS,"I move: (4) Clause 6, page 6, after subclause (5) insert following subclauses:· ""(6) The Minister must cause a copy of any instrument formulating principles under subsection (1) and a copy of any instrument under subsection (4) revoking or varying any of those principles to be presented to each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the making of the instrument. ""(7) Instruments formulating principles under subsection (1) and instruments revoking or varying any of these principles under subsection (4) are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901."". This bill provides the federal minister with enormous personal discretion over intrastate distribution of federal local government financial assistance grants. In the case of local road funding, the minister's discretion is that the interstate distribution of these funds is completely unfettered. The only limitation on the minister's power in respect of the distribution of general purpose grants is the requirement that the funds be allocated on a horizontal, equalisation basis together with a minimum per capita requirement. While the current draft of the national principles are similar to arrangements already in place and, as I mentioned earlier, have relatively little impact on the current intrastate funding distribution, the scope does exist in the legislation for the promulgation of principles. which substantially alter this distribution. For example, depending on the criteria used, the result might be a shift in the rural urban split of funding or the allocation of funds on . a regional basis. There is a real potential that at some indeterminate time in the future the great big whiteboard will be dusted off and brought back into active service. In the past, an unrestricted power to determine principles has provided a federal minister with a role in the disbursement to specific councils of special reserve local road funds. For all these reasons, the opposition considers it appropriate that the principles be a disallowable instrument subject to the full scrutiny of parliament. The government agreed to this arrangement at the local government ministers meeting in October 1994 but has failed to ensure it is incorporated in the the bill. The minutes of this meeting clearly reflect this and the other agreements I have referred to today. The intention of the fourth amendment circulated in my name accords the national principles the status of a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act. This provides either house of parliament with an opportunity to examine the principles and, if it has concerns about their content, to pass a motion disallowing them. The notice of motion to disallow must be given within 15 sitting days after the principles have been laid before the House. This process promotes transparency in the allocation process and retains some parliamentary oversight of the distribution of $1.1 billion of Deahm, M. 1. Commonwealth assistance provided annually. I commend the amendment to the House. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Bruce Scott's) be agreed to. The House divided. [2.55 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Stephen Martin) Ayes ...............

54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the view expressed by Professor George Winterton, a member of the Republic Advisory Committee, that if the Governor General's powers are inherited by a republiThursday, 8 June 1995 can head of state, since the link with the monarchy would have been severed, the present conventions governing the exercise of the reserve powers might not subsist? Whatis the basis of the Prime Minister's apparently confident belief that the conventions governing the reserve powers can safely travel from a Governor General to a president, even though they are not conventions of government but conventions of the Crown? '",74
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government wouldand the parliament would by proposal, then by referendum-make it clear in·areferendum proposal that those powers, the so-called reserve powers, now enjoyed by the Governor General would be enjoyed by the incumbent president; in which case, the powers would be undefined. The alternative is to try to define the powers to say what such a person mayor may not do. I think the honourable gentleman opposite would agree that the difficulty in that is that ail of the contingencies which go to the rights and prerogatives of the head of state versus the head of government versus the governmentquestions about the rights of the Prime Minister and the cabinet in the event, say, of a 1975 type deadlock-would then have to be comprehended in a set of codified arrangements. I think they are not capable of being, first, agreed to and, second, foreseen. What is implied in the question is that, if it is not written down, the power does not exist.",75
56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, that is not being implied. That is not the question.",75
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My point is that, if it is written in, it is in even if it is not articulated. Budget 1995-96",75
58,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the importance of returning the budget to surplus? What would be the consequences of failing to achieve that outcome?,75
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the member for Paterson, I can say that it is very important to return the budget to surplus, as the government has announced it will do in 199596 through various measures, including significant fiscal tightening, to achieve a surplus of $718 million in 1995-56 and going REPRESENTATIVES 1575 out to $7.4 billion by 1998-99. That is important to take the pressure off interest rates. It will dramatically' reduce the bond selling task by some $15 billion in 1995-96. The tightening of fiscal policy is anti-inflationary, and so it helps us to keep inflation low. Also, the restoration of budget surpluses means a major reduction in public sector dissaving, so a boost to national saving, less reliance on the savings of foreigners and a betterbahmce of payments current account outcome. All this represents a classic countercyclical policy as well as an attempt to structurally improve our national savings. The importance of such policy has been recognised even by the Leader of the Opposition in his otherwise extraordinarily unnotabIe headland speech on Tuesday night, otherwise known as his Cape Barren speechMr Tim Fischer-Cape of Good Hope!",75
60,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"His Cape Barren speech because it has absolutely nothing in it. He did manage to make this commitment though: Greater economic flexibility will reduce but not remove the need for counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies from time to time. Therefore, he said that they can see that there would be a need for countercyclical macroeconomic policies, which is what the government is engaged in in this budget, for the reasons I have just mentioned. Subsequently, he said: To preserve policy flexibility and prudent public debt levels, the corollary is that the governments ' will need to run budget surpluses in the upswing to increase public saving, which is vital to curing Australia's current account deficit problem. So he is committing himself to saying that we should have budget surpluses in the upswing to increase public saving, which is vital to addressing the current account. That was the rhetoric, but there is an enormous gap between the windy rhetoric of the headland speech and the reality of opposition behaviour. As everyone in this House knows, in this budget debate the opposition is trying to prevent billions of dollars of deficit reduction from going through. It is doing this by opposing various tax measures in relation to company tax, the Medicare levy, building materials, cars, the PAYE remittance and the provisional tax uplift factor. The combined effect in 1995-96 would be to deprive the government of some $15 billion of tax revenue, and in the following yeilr $2.6 billion; ant;! to change the budget outcome this year from a surplus of $718 million to a deficit of $827 million, al)d ,next year from surplus of $3.4 billion to a much smaller surplus of $816 million-in other words, a surplus which would be a surplus only because of assets sales and not what the government was trying to achieve in 1996-97: a surplus without asset sales. Therefore, we see on the one hand this commitment in the broad, this rhetoric about support for responsible countercyclical policy and budget surpluses, and on the other hand an absolute attempt to prevent that happening: This is nothing more than economic sabotage by an opposition which on the one hand is trying to stand on the lofty heights and say, 'We support appropriate policy. We stand for appropriate policy and policy which is in the interests of the nation,' but, when it comes the reality of measures before this House, it votes time and time again to try to stop that outcome occurring. In other words, it is just a complete attempt to sabotage the economy, to make it more difficult in terms of the current account, to make it more difficult in terms of anti-inflationary behaviour 'and to keep pressure on interest rates.' From the opposition's behaviour, quite clearly it would like to see those things happen. That is an atrocious position for the opposition If the Leader of the Opposition wants to stomp around the country pretending to be a man of some honour, a man who stands for something substantial and a real alternative, then surely it is up to him to behave like that and not just to make expressions of highsounding rhetoric. When it comes to the reality, we see an opposition which is simply unprepared to do that. If it wants to argue that it should be done through outlays, let me say this very briefly about outlays: outlays for 1995-96 are 25.1 per cent of GDP, 3Y2 per cent of GDP below what they were when we came into office, 3Y2 per cent of GDP less than they were when the now Leader of the Opposition was TreaslJrer. Outlays as a percentage of GDP in 1995-96 ar-lower that in ,any year when the now Leader of 'the Opposition was Treasurer. 0,utlays are projected to drop to 24 for per cent of GDP by 1998-99, from their current 25.1 per cent for 1995-96: which is a almost two per cent of GDP less t-an in aily year when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasllrer. ' Ol,ltlays are not extravagant. Th-y are'tight, but they are very well targeted to those in need. If the opposition wants to say that we should be slashing outlays rather than raising taxes, that means it has to face up to the fact that it would be taking amounts away from people in need - the very people it says it is concerned about. Let me conclude on this point about battlers. The Leader of the Opposition in his speech on Tuesday night revealed all by this sentence. He said: . ',' I might add that Menzies would have smiled to himself, as I did, when, after a week of JIS fighting for the interests of the Australian battler ... to A week., That is about how long it lasts; When a poll driven analysis says, 'Fight for the battler. There might be something in that,' the opposition does it for a week. It 'stands, up and says, 'We're here to defend the battler.' But that was not the reality when the oppositionwas in government; it is not the reality in anything that has been said by the opposition to this point in time. What is clear is that it is this government ,wh,ich ,stal)ds for the people in need, and the defence of outlays to be in. demonstrates that. Republic",75
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have' a supplementary question .to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that my first question was not directed to whether or not the reserve powers should be explicitly spelt but in a republican constitution, but whether it was possible to transfer, from our present constitution to a republican constitution, reserve powers of the Crown and conventions of the Crown as distinct from the conventions of government. I remind the Prime Mini-ter that Professor George Winterton, in the article to which I referred in my first question, said: So a republican constitution cannot simply continue the present constitutional position of confemng powers on the head of state in general terms relying on the constitutional conventions to govern their exercise. I ask the Prime Minister specifically: is it your intention to include in your republican constitution a clause specifically providing that the reserve powers exercised by the head of state shall not be justiciable before the High Court.",76
62,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Very definitely.,77
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Good. Thank you very much.,77
64,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not believe that the High Court should be adjudicating on matters of political dispute. I have made that point over and over again. Seeing as I have given you an answer you are grateful for, you give me one.",77
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, thank you.",77
66,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a simple one for you and you can tell us tonight-whether you think an Australian should be our head of state.,77
67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is simple enoughwhether you think an Australian should be our head of state. That is not a complex or outrageous question. It is simple enough, is it not? Does the Leader of the Opposition think an Australian should be our head of state. That is the central question he has to address himself to this evening. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 74 says that we should show respect to the Governor General. The Prime Minister is suggesting that the Governor General is not an Australian citizen and I suggest that you bring him to order.",77
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. If the honourable member for Warringah wants to be a little clever with taking points of order, I shall also be clever. Mr Downer-That is not being clever.",77
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the Leader of the Opposition asked a very serious question to which the Prime Minister was responding.,77
71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have given him an answer on both fronts. I have made it very clear that I do not believe that if these powers are expressly articulated in the constitution they will become other than matters and rules of law and will end up being justiciable. That will mean that you will be asking justices of the High Court to decide matters. Take 1975 as an example. Was there anything particularly wrong with the supply bill? Was there a technical dispute? Of course there was not. The opposition of the day wanted to drive the government of the day to an election at the time of the opposition's choosing. That was what it was all about. Mrs Bishop-You had broken the law.,77
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar!,77
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why would that matter then be put in the hands of the Chief Justice or judges of the High Court? That is the point we made very clear last night. These are matters which the Australian public is entitled to think about. It is part of what I call the debate which has ensued from last night's statement. That is why I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's questions, but I do want him to say where he stands on that core point. Does he believe an Australian should be our head of state? That is the central point. No amount of obfuscation, indecision or talking about people's or constitutional conventions - a sort of black hole that has in it the external affairs power, the power of the Senate and all these other questionswill obviate the need for him to say where he stands on the central issue. It is worth recording again that one of his fellows, the Premier of Victoria, had a few things to say about these matters. He said: I think last night's speech-while it won't be agreed to by all-sets a blueprint for discussion. You've got to understand, a great number of this community are young people who do not have the same historical reference point back to the UK. We have a large number of ethnic community members who have come from republics--or in fact other sorts of societies-and I think there is a growing recognition that this issue is going to be resolved. Now, that will be done through a referendum, and the public--each and every one of us-will be able to make our own decision. He is dead right. A journalist also asked: Why do you think Mr Howard is supporting a people's convention? And Jeff Kennett went on to say: ... that is only going to be able to really express their personal views. They may argue they represent a greater number of people, but finally this is going to be decided by each and every one of us. A convention to me is just another committee. There's not much point calling out 400 people of a community of 18 million, sitting them and saying: now, what do you think about it? That was precisely the burden of my remarks last night. The greatest act of expressive democracy here is the referendum. A proposal for a constitutional change must come through this chamber. It cannot be conferred upon sort of constitutional committee or convenrecent tion. It must come here. When pressed about this in the past asked, 'Would you accept the results of a so called convention and put it absolutely to a come down. referendum?' the coalition has said, 'No, we reserve the right to make our own decision about that.' In other words, they are consignnet ing a convention to basically a talk shop. Jeff Kennett said-and I might say he said very eloquently-'There's not much point calling out 400 people out of a community 18 million and calling them the people.' That is as clear an answer that is going to be to this smokescreen. There is only one question to be answered here-that is, whether an Australian person should be the head of state. No smothering with the blanket of a convention by the Leader of the Opposition will disguise that question. Labour Force Survey",77
74,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is those directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House of the data released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics about the Australian labour force? What implicaare tions does that data have for the government's Working Nation initiatives?",78
75,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable tions. member for his question. Today's labour force survey figures confirm in trend terms the continued improvement in the Australian labour market. In trend terms the unemploywe ment rate fell to 8.4 per cent, the lowest December 1990, and the trend unemployment rate has fallen every month since August 1993. In other words, for almost two years the trend rate has been coming down. In seasonally adjusted terms, the figures show today that employment fell by 21,400 out and that unemployment rose to 8.5 per cent. down But the fall in employment this month represents a modest correction from the extraordinary jump of more than 90,000 in April and, I might say, is at the lower end of market expectations. I might also observe for those who are chortling on the other side that this any correction this month is consistent with the pattern whereby we have seen very large increases in employment in one month followed by very small corrections in the and following month. That is why the trend as well as the actual figures have continued to Over the last two months there has been a increase in total employment of 69,000 As jobs-all of them full-time jobs. I might also it observe that the figures today indicate that female full-time employment rose by a further of 8,800 and is now at an all-time high. The participation rate remained at the very high given 63.7 per cent, which I might observe is a healthy sign of a strong labour market. All of these figures are consistent with our achieving the Working Nation targets. It is true that the jobs growth has been slowing but it has been off huge growth that no-one ever expected could be achieved. But what is also consistent when these figures come out is the pattern of opposition response. Last month, when there was the huge employment growth, opposite were out there predicting interest rate rises. This month, when we have had a fall that is observed by the markets to be a correction, they are telling us that the rate of employment growth is slowing and we back into recession. The problem for that side is that it wants to carp and criticise but it does not want to offer constructive soluWhere was the reference in the headland speech to employment and training? There was not one. Even in The Things That Matter had a whole chapter devoted to it, but it since has dropped off the agenda over thereprobably because the shadow minister is incapable of putting the policies together. Those opposite have no policies on employment and unemployment. They have no commitment to the youth training initiative or Working Nation. This is despite the fact that we have members of the National Party putting on record in the parliament their support for Working Nation initiatives. The member for Lyne is a very perceptive member because he is getting behind these initiatives. Members of the National Party want them supported, but where is their mention on your side? There is none at all. You have no commitment to the training wage. Your approach is to cut youth wages. It is to force young people off the dole. For those who have not been able to get off the benefit, you will wash your hands of them and refer them to the voluntary organisations. The simple fact of the matter remains: we have created 610,000 jobs in the last two years and since 1983 we have increased the total number of jobs in the economy by two million. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of the coalition government, he could manage only 262,000 jobs in 5Yz years. Get the comparison. Do you understand the difference between our approach to job creation and yours? Our approach produced 610,000 jobs in two years and two million in 12 years and your miserable performance produced 262,000 jobs in a whole 5Yz years. Well done! Little wonder you cannot put a policy together now. I might say that I am told todayMr Costello-Oh, wind it up-windbag!",78
76,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will wind it up on this point. I was told today of a conversation overheard in the corridors involving the member for Mayo. It went like this: he asked the person, 'What were the figures?' Obviously, he was referring to the unemployment figures. The response was, 'They're up.' The member for Mayo said, 'That's good,' but when he was seen saying that it was good he said, 'No, I mean it's bad.' We all know how he can change his mind, but the simple fact remains that when it comes to employment the opposition has no policies. All it has is hope that the figures will go bad for us. Well, they are not going bad for us and they will continue to improve. Republic",79

85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Mayo.,79
86,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Would the minister inform the House about actions to promote Australian content on commercial television? Would he explain how these actions will benefit Australians and help position Australia to take advantage of the broader developments in the communications sector. Is the minister aware of any recent assessments of the communications revolution and would he advise the House about the implications of any such assessments?,79
87,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia is one of the few countries that can claim to have a very innovative public broadcasting sector, through the ABC and SBS, as well as a very dynamic commercial television sector. All of them are very strongly committed to producing good Australian content. Yesterday, the Australian Broadcasting Authority released its new standard for Australian content on commercial television. The new rules will strengthen the Australian presence on our television screens. This new standard of the ABA is the result of intensive consultations with broadcasters, program makers and members of the public. With commercial television being the most influential sector of broadcasting in Australia, this is a very pivotal debate. It will help by increasing the level of Australian content on television, it will make sure that we are continuing to develop and protect Australia's identity as seen on television and, in particular, it will make sure that the shape of kids' dreams are influenced in the right manner on television. This new standard provides for an increase in the minimum annual level of Australian content to 55 per cent. This is to be achieved by the commercial broadcasters by 1998. Most importantly of all there will be a doubling in the level of new Australian children's drama by 1998. Australia already has a tremendous reputation throughout the world for producing quality children's drama on television. We have series such as the Winners, which has been seen in 82 countries around the world; Round the Twist, which has been seen in 45 countries around the world; and Lift Off, which has been picked up by the Fox network in the United States as well as in many other countries. Last week when I was in Seoul for a meeting of APEC communications ministers, one of the US federal communications commissioners went out of her way to praise Australia for the fact that we are leading the world in producing quality children's drama on television. That is something which all of us can be very proud of. The new standard proposed by the ABA also provides for a simplified Australian content test. That will provide some assistance to broadcasters in calculating their obligations. What we will see is that the viewers will benefit from more Australian content and, in particular, kids will benefit from more quality Australian children's drama on television. We will see the program makers benefit from an increase in their production slates. We will also see benefits for the broadcasters with the introduction of simplified system. This commitment to improving the level of Australian content on television goes side by side with the government's assistance to the film and television industry. The government has given assistance to the Australian Film Commission, Film Australia and the Film, Television and Radio School. We also made a commitment in Creative Nation to provide $60 million to initiate a television production fund to enhance the quality of Australian programming independently of these local content obligations. In Creative Nation we also made commitments towards new multimedia-$45 million for the Australian Multimedia Enterprise and a commissioning of 10 CD ROM for the Australia on CD program. This demonstrates quite clearly that across the board the government is making a very firm commitment to our creative industries. In contrast, the opposition leader, in his headland speech last Tuesday, made some comments on the communications and the arts portfolio. Those comments were made under the headline 'The communications revolution' . While the government has produced Creative Nation, the communications future project reports and the BSEG report, Networking Australia's future-which in total would make up documents this thick-the opposition's contribution is not documents that thick. It is not a series of proposals to help creative Australians. It is 12 paragraphs from the Leader of the Opposition. Is it any wonder we call the Leader of the Opposition's speech 'Point Missing'? The reason we call it 'Point Missing' is that, in those 12 paragraphs, the only comment the Leader of the Opposition could offer our creative industries and the only offer of assistance he could put forward for our film and television makers and our artists is that he believes the communications revolution will be part of the Howard-Costello industrial relations laboratory. All of those film makers, screen writers, performing artists and visual artists are going to be inputs to the ryopposition's industrial relations laboratory: If that is not the case, why could the not say anything else about our c-ltural industries other than, 'It gets down trial relations'? It is probably no surprise giv-n !hat opposition spokesman - n commUnICatIOns - as said 'Government assIstance to the creatIve inddstries is a wast,e of money. It is money down the drain.' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that for, the, govern-ent to have a policy on the arts IS a Joke. It IS wonder that we can see there is no difference between the views advocated by the Leader of the Opposition,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the ,opposition'- .spokesman on communications. The OppOSItIOn has no co-mitment' fo Australia's cultural industries and no understanding of the tremendous war possibilities that these industries can deliver Australia. ' Reserve Powers",79

91,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After the French revoluthe tioncame and ,the great revolution in the United States came with the American war of independence-where that fight was led by the first American President, the great soldier statesman, George Washington-the designers of the American constitution sat down to nQ write their constitution.

That is, despite the huge polItIcal force running right through that century and down to the last quarter of it and winning a of independence, there was still substantialconstraints on American executive presidential authority. No such similar constraints existed in the transfer of powers from the English monarchs die British Prime Minister and, after 1901, to the Australian Prime Minister and cabinet. Part of the check always was that'in the - ands of the monarch there would be a power to look over the operation of the government. In our 'system there was another one.

102,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the vice regal figure, the Queen's deputy, the Governor-GerieraL Nothing about those powers or the fact that Sir John Kerr had them available to him as the incumbent meant that the powers were illegitimate. What was illegitimate was the way he used them. What Sir John Kerr· did was to deceive his Prime Minister by not telling him that, unless he advised him of an election or could guarantee supply, he would swear in someone he knew the House of Representatives did not have confidence in. That was the crime against Sir John Kerr-or letting the dispute run its course. Dr Kemp interjecting",82
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! This is the last warning that I will give the member for Goldstein.,82
104,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those of us who were around in 1975 know that, if the dispute had gone on for a couple more days, the likelihood is that Malcolm Fraser would not even have been Leader of the Opposition; that - is, there would have been a-complete cave in in the Senate, and of course the supply bill would have passed, and the whole matter would have passed, and the then opposition may well have won the subsequent election 18 months later. But of course Malcolm Fraser lost the legitimacy he was always looking for, and it was permanently denied to him as a consequence. That same legitimacy was also denied to Sir John Kerr. I think that has been a very salutary exercise in what I described last night as one of the checks on a head of state-that is, with someone who determines upon a course of action he or she knows to be controversial, they need to understand that the action is both warranted and capable of being defended. If it is not warranted and capable of being defended, then they will have to wear the opprobrium of public opinion-that is, beyond the other checks which are that either house, by simple majority, can command a joint sitting to either seek to remove or censure the head of state. So, in the model the government is putting forward, there is no link in the question between the existence of the - reserve powers and Sir John Kerr's use of them which makes anybody who argued against Sir John Kerr's use argue that the powers are illegitimate. Noone has ever argued that. Gough Whitlam was not arguing that yesterday-he was not even arguing that yesterday. He understands, I think, the power which has been conferred upon Prime Ministers and cabinets in the Westminster system, and he understands the reserve power which existed in the hands of the monarch and, in this case, her deputy that in no way illegitimised those powers. What made it illegitimate was the fact that the power was abused; it was abused by a Governor General who refused to tell his Prime Minister what he had in mind. As you know, I was with Gough Whitlam on the last occasion he saw Sir John Kerr-the very last occasion that afternoon. Let me assure you, there was no attempt by him whatsoever to tell - he theri Prime Minister what he had in mind. So he swore in Malcolm Fraser. Malcolm Fraser then had to wear a lack of confidence, a no confidence; motion in the House of Representatives. Then the Governor General refused to see the Speaker of the House of Representatives. When the head of Shocking! state got down to refusing to see the Speaker of the House of Representatives, you knew, basically, in moral terms, that the game was up for him-and it has been up for him ever since.",82

107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I always find it a curious argument that the opposition puts that in representative democracy representation is illegitimate.

Let us look at the women's organisations in relation to equal pay equal work, child care, the maternity allowrabid ance, the current Commonwealth focus on and policy attention to violence in the community and the protection of women against violence. see it? These are issues which have arisen because of views put by women's organisations around this country. Are they a rabid interest with unreasonable access to the government, a group representing half the population? Then we have the ACTU. This is the group most of the Leader of the Opposition's bile has been reserved for, not only now but over the years. Have we not all benefited from the industrial peace, the wage restraint, the job and the industrial relations reforms that have occurred over those 12 years? his Before the accord, under the Fraser-Howard government, working days lost per thousand workers from industrial disputes averaged 590. Since the accord, this number has fallen The Minister for Employment, Education and Training made a point earlier about the huge multiples of employment growth which have come from these policies compared with coalition times. Meeting and speaking with the government and joining the government productively over 12 years to have a better a industrial relations scene, higher levels of productivity, lower levels of inflation and higher levels of employment growth are seen by the opposition leader to be unseemly, an inundue right from another so-called rabid interest group. There is also the fact that we have inflation of between two per cent and three per cent when it was at over 10 per cent Let us look at the Australian Council of Social Services, the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and St Vincent de Paul-all these welfare agencies that have shown interest in the plight of people in desperate positions, either homeless or in need of family support. All of the ones I mentioned came out explicitly supporting the job compact to get long-term unemployed people back to work. The job compact was described by the OECD a week ago as an innovative, equitable and economically efficient labour for market reform. What a gall! Are they the interest groups the Leader of the Opposition is referring to? Are they not entitled to put a view about their constituency as they What about the National Farmers Federation? What a shocking hide it had to come group to the government and talk about income support for people in drought affected areas. The government went out and listened to them, understood the problem and removed the farm assets test for the support of income which has now gone to 10,000 farm families. What about the rural adjustment scheme which is going to help farms aggregate and allow some people to get off their properties or get more economic units, or what about drought proofing farms in the future by measures which will support water and fodder storage? Are these rabid interest groups? It is only someone who has such an elitist view of the world who wants to govern by press release, which was the way it was in the 1970s, the way it was under the ard regime, where neither business nor labour were consulted, where the welfare and the voluntary agencies were regarded as so irrelevant that they went on to behave this way. When you see the Leader of the Opposition come out with this speech-this collection of junk, this collation of rubbishbut and try to put it across as policy and then attack people as rabid interest groups for having the temerity to participate in our representative democracy, I say the Leader the Opposition is a long way off the mark the thought processes of this community and what it requires from a representative parliais mentary system. Republic",83
111,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be likelihood isaware that before 1949 there were five occasions on which a government had a majority of more than two-thirds of the combined Houses of parliament by virtue of the then voting system. The Prime Minister will also be aware that the Electoral Act can be changed by a simple majority of both Houses of parliament. What assurance is there in Prime Minister's republican proposals that changes to the Electoral Act by a government controlling both Houses would not produce the appointment of a President which would be a blatantly political appointment?,84
112,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let us just leave the the proposals of last night to one side. At any stage a government can propose a change in the Senate's voting system. Mr Downer-That's my point.,84
113,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So what is the reference to the republic, for God's sake? Mr Downer-The two-thirds majority. You'll have to bring in a suitcase of jelly beans. We have hit the jackpot.",84
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member fcir Mayo, you have asked your question.",84
115,Mr KEATIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even if senators were elected at large, say they were elected from constituencies, you would have a House roughly half the size of the House of Representatives. That is what the constitution says, Fraser-Howdoesn't it? That's right. Mr Downer-You got that right. You can agencies have one jelly bean back.",84
116,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, two-thirds of in the whole-that is, of the House of Representatives and the Senate-is, as far as I understand it, two-thirds. Maybe I have missed it, what is the point? Let me make another point. Let me bang the nail right into the wall with this point: the questioner says that on five occasions before 1949 governments could of have secured a two-thirds majority-and of somebody said that Malcolm Fraser was one seat away from securing it in 1975. My view that, if community opinion is such that the people have entrusted the parliamentary process to one political force commanding a two-thirds majority, that force is entitled to say who should be the head of state. But the Mr Downer-That's a revelation.",84
117,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, why would it not be? If community opinion in the country was so strong for one political force or another, why should a minority with less than a third of that joint sitting have the final say about the who should be the head of state? I would have thought that most of the people in this House believe that when you get the 50 per cent plus one in a democracy you have some rights. At 50 per cent plus one you have substantial majority support. We are saying more than that; we are saying two-thirds of joint sitting of both houses. Apparently they are arguing over there that if the coalition had had two-thirds of a majority in both houses in 1975 it would have been dreadful for them to· nominate and elect a head of state. I am surprised they have so little pride in themselves that they should argue that, or that they should be so. ridiculous and so puerile as to argue that. There is only one answer we want to know in this House. There is only one question in the end-whether the Leader of the Opposition believes that an Australian should be our head of state. That is the key question. That is the central question. Let us get that right. The rest will fall into place.· Goodwill will put the rest into place. Vocational Education and Training MsHENZELL-My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In view of the budget and your recent meeting with state training ministers, would the minister advise the House of developments and opportunities for young Australians to gain skills which will assist our industries to be competitive in the global marketplace.",84
118,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The budget underlined the Commonwealth's commitment to expand vocational education and training with confirmation of growth funding of $70 million for the Australian National Training Authority in 1996 and a further $70 million for 1997. These funds will go to the states and territories, contingent onlhe maintenance of their own effort as required by the ANTA arrangements. As members might expect, ministers from the states and territories were very happy with this when we met recently as the ANTA ministerial council. The additional funding for 1996 brings the Commonwealth's total recurrent funding for vocational education and training through ANTA to $640 million. From the beginning of first term 1996, 300,000 students will have a place in T AFE, over and above what the states provide, due to the policies of this government. The Commonwealth's total annual increase for 1996 under the ANTA agreement is $380 million and it raises the Commonwealth's share of total recurrent funding for vocational education and training from seven per cent in 1991 to an estimated 27 per cent in 1996. Since the Prime Minister announced the establishment of ANTA in 1992, the Commonwealth's funding for growth alone in the period 1993 to 1997 will amount to more than $1 Y2 billion. When this government came to office only one in three young people finished school. We had a TAFE system which was in total disrepair and we had a higher education system which was reserved for the privileged few. In recent weeks members opposite have discovered battlers, but if we ever had a class of real battlers it was those young Australians who wanted an education when the coalition was in government. Back then young people were denied the education and training opportunities that might have given them a fair go. Like others, I have perused the Cape Barren scrolls to see what young people in the future might expect under a coalition administration. The pickings are pretty slim. There is only one reference of any substance to education in the Cape Barren speech, and that was to what Bob Menzies had to say about his achievements in higher eduction at his farewell press conference back in 1996. Mr Crean-In 1996?",85
119,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1966-30 years ago. Apart from that, we will not find a mention of education in the Cape Barren speech. It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition has as little interest in education now as he had back in 1989, when he refused the post of opposition spokesman for education because he considered it beneath him. Things have not changed. Since the government came to office, Australia has witnessed school retention rates reaching three in four. Last year an additional 90,000 young Australians completed year 12 due to the policies of this government. Thanks to Commonwealth funding through ANTA, these young people now have a much greater choice beyond school. They have access to training in the skills that industry wants for the wor:k force of the future. The government recognises that Australia's future lies with its educated and its skilled people. This government has recognised the need to provide access to education and particularly the urgent need to upgrade vocational education and training. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",85

I refer to the minister's decision to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge on the basis of women's business. Minister, is Dorothy Wilson telling the truth when she says that women's business in relation to the Hindmarsh Island was fabricated with the help of a white lawyer? Are Dulcie Wilson, Bertha Gollan and other women telling the truth when they support the story of the falsification of women's business? Is the letter from the 89-year-old matriarch Laura Kartinyeri denying the existence of women's business true? Was her retraction of that letter a little later denying women's business done on her own volition? Why did Doug Milera say on TV on6 June and in the last thing he said yesterday 'I think the whole issue of women's beliefs was fabricated'? Why did Sarah Milera say on 7 June that the secret women's business was fabricated?

128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Briefly.,86
129,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Me Speaker, I will endeavour to answer the questions as best I can, but some things need to be put on the record. The first thing that ought to be said is that the Premier of South Australia and indeed the Liberal and National parties in this parliament would never dare to treat the spiritual beliefs of non-indigenous Australians the way that they are treating the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people. I think it needs to be understood what a horrendous consequence it is for Australian values for a premier of a state to commission a royal commission, with all the draconian powers that that implies, into the spiritual beliefs of a number of Australians. I pose the question to other religious faiths and beliefs in this country: how would they feel if a state premier were to commission a royal commission into their spiritual beliefs? This is a very serious matter, and it goes far beyond issues involving my portfolio. I am sure that a number of people in the government will be saying some things about this in weeks to come. What we are seeing here is a wave of politically inspired royal commissions emanating from the Indian Ocean and sweeping eastward across the country, so I suppose we should not be surprised. This is a very serious matter, and in the course of my remarks I will not comment more about that royal commission except to say this: the royal commission, I think, poses great threats to the proper management and administration of government in South Australia. It is very much an abuse of process by the executive government in South Australia. The Prime Minister will be writing, if he has not already done so, to the Premier of South . Australia asking him to think again in respect of this royal commission and to cooperate with the inquiry I have announced today under proper processes through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to be conducted by Her Honour Justice Jane Mathews, President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and a deputy president of the National Native Title Tribunal. The first point to make about the inquiry that I have announced today is that arrangements for the conduct of this inquiry were put in place prior to the announcement by Premier Brown of a royal commission.",86

134,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It ought to be understood the basis on which the South Australian. Premier, Mr Brown, and the South Australian cabinet have purported to call this royal commission. In fact, the Premier wrote to the Prime Minister yesterday about this issue. He gave the Prime Minister of Australia an ultimatum to respond within 48 hours. That ultimatum was presented to the Prime Minister at 1.45 p.m. eastern standard time yesterday. I spoke with the South Australian Premier this morning after the Premier had announced the South Australian government's decision to establish an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. He confirmed to me that the South Australian government's decision in this matter was taken despite the fact that no response had been received from the Prime Minister to the ultimatum. He indicated that he acted on the basis of one unconfirmed media report. After discussions with the Prime Minister's office, I can indicate that no such indication, no such statement, was made on behalf. of the Prime Minister to any media outlet. On the basis of that, the South Ian government is throwing around money like a drunken sailor, issuing a royal commission with the powers to compel Australians to come forward and give evidence about their religious beliefs. It is an unprecedented abuse of government power. I turn to answer the last part of the question that was raised by the member for Barker. The fingers of the Liberal Party at the state and federal level are all over this issue. We saw the member for Barker and the member for Mayo come into the parliament yesterday and, indeed, wave this around as if it were some kind of holy writ, 'the great lie of Hindmarsh Island'.",87

I table two transcripts of what these two people said on the public record. I will turn briefly to two references to what they said. Mr Doug Milera, who is put forward by the Liberal Party as the person who says that there has been a fabrication, yesterday spoke to Keith Conlon on radio SAN. Part of the interview went as follows: DOUG MILERA: Yeah, I was a tool in helpin' to get.. get it brought out into the open. Now .. CONLAN: Well, that's different, isn't it?

I have tabled it because you do not want to think that, because something is in the Adelaide Advertiser, it is true.

Your name was put to certain comments in the newspaper this morning on the front page. SARAH MILERA: Well, anybody can do that. I conclude my answer in this way: I have endeavoured at all times to act on the basis of legal advice and to be fair to all. concerned.

139,Mr CHYNOWETH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. To celebrate World Environment Day, the minister launched a major report on how we can make our cities and towns greener places to live in. Can the minister inform the House why it is so important that we focus on an urban environment agenda in Australia and how this report will contribute to action?",88
140,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. Few members of this parliament have a greater commitment to the environment, both globally and locally, than the member for Dunkley, and he has considerable respect for his efforts. I thank the member for his question because it enables me to mention Green cities, a report of the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review, which opens up a range of issues concerning the environment and makes a number of policy proposals. It is an important report, and a report that all members of the parliament would benefit from by reading. It is one that the government takes seriously. Already, in terms of both greenhouse and coastal management, the government has taken significant initiatives to pursue issues that touch on the environment of cities. For most people, the environmental issues that are of greatest importance are those that are closest to them such as air, water, the quality of the local environment and so on. Also the honourable member for Dunkley draws attention to the methodical way the government goes about developing policy, exposing that policy and encouraging debate within the community. Over time that meant that the government has been able to produce the kinds of significant reforms the Prime Minister referred to earlier. It also gives us the opportunity to draw attention to the opposition's absence of statements of policy-not necessarily statements of policy in books but statements that clearly set out opposition policy on the environment. This leaves a vacuum that is picked up by members of the opposition, who exploit that vacuum by putting forward in the name of the opposition ideas that no-one in this parliament would take seriously. I refer to the honourable member for Warringah. In the Australian only a few days ago, he put forward, presumably on behalf of the opposition, quite substantial thoughts. He contemplates the sale of Telecom and says that we could start to use the proceeds to create an environmental army, and that environmental army could be led by a corps commander of high profile. He suggests that he could be the former Governor of New South Wales-I guess that appeals to him, as a monarchist--or Dick Smith, or more or less anyone. He then says that we could use the resources from the sale of Telecom to develop a project that would be environmentally relevant. He develops the idea: We don't know how many environmental projects can be completed with relatively unskilled labour-but chronic problems such as lack of tree cover, weed infestation and feral animals could be solved by enough people with shovels, mattocks, seeds, fencing material, traps and hessian bags. So the honourable member for Warringah steps into this policy vacuum, dreams up an idea worth some billion dollars and suggests that we get a corps commander to organise it and, basically, has the unemployed all around Australia chasing cats down drains in the name of some kind of commitment to the environment. Frankly, in terms of World Environment Day and Her Majesty's opposition, we demand something better. But we have been demanding something better for years.

If you uphold that, it will go beyond anything which has ever been remotely interpreted as part of our standing orders. · Mr SPEAKER-No. I think the Leader of the Opposition knows, in terms of the way in which I have allowed questions to be put in this place, there has been an opportunity for material, whether it be. critical or complimentary of people, to be put.

157,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (4.19 p.m.)by leave-I move: That this House censures the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs for the failure of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait· Islander Affairs to properly administer the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 in a fair and just way and for bringing Aboriginal heritage into disrepute and his failure to call an inquiry on disputed evidence. Through the incompetence of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), public confidence in the administration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage has been severely undermined. Today the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who is sitting there like a grinning monkey and finding all this highly amusing-the minister who obviously failsMrs Crosio-You have the stupid grin.",89
158,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,I warn the member for Prospect.,90
159,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"The minister obviously finds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage such a joke that he has to sit there and grin and laugh at this. Today this minister issued a statement that he will call an inquiry. Can we look at the context in which this inquiry has been called. It has been called after the South Australian government called its inquiry. We now have the ludicrous situation of having two inquiries into the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair: one from the South Australian government and one instituted by this minister. What does it say about this minister's competence that, over a year after the original declaration, there are now two inquiries mooted into the whole Hindmarsh Island saga. The minister was given an opportunity yesterday by Premier Dean Brown to join in and contribute to the South Australian inquiry. He obviously was not prepared to do that. Mr Tickner-That is not true. He hadn't announced it yesterday, you silly person.",90
160,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"A letter was sent to the minister-and I stand corrected if he did not receive it yesterday but received it earlier today-inviting him to join in the South Australian inquiry. The minister instead has decided to call his own inquiry. He has agreed that there is a need for an inquiry. So there are two things here: the South Australian inquiry and the minister, who refused to take part in that inquiry, has now agreed that there is a need for one. Shall we have a look at exactly why there needs to be an inquiry, and why this censure motion has been brought against you, Minister, and against the way you have administered the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, who is at the table, has administered this act and brought Aboriginal heritage into disrepute all over the country. One of the worse things that has come out of this whole issue is that now wherever you go in Australia people know about the saga of Hindmarsh Island. When they talk about it they say, 'Those things about Aboriginal heritage were all made up, weren't they? Tell us about it.' This is what has happened. Mr Tickner interjecting",90
161,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"The minister who is sitting at the table has accused me of saying it was all made up. I would remind him that all along I have said that I did not know what the truth of this issue was. I have never said anything else. I have sought a commitment from this minister for the truth. The one thing that this minister has been frightened of has been the truth from the very beginning. First of all, at the beginning of the saga, the minister refused to consider representations from Aboriginal men who disagreed with the matter of the women's business and Allan Campbell. Mr Tickner-That is not true.",90
162,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,Order! The minister will have his chance to respond shortly.,90
163,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"This is not to say whether these representations were true or not. But these people had a right to be heard. This is what is essential to this matter. All people have the right to be heard. The minister at the table had that obligation to those Aboriginal people. He did not hear them. He refused to hear them. He was asked by the litigants in the case, the Chapmans, who wished to build the marina, six times if he would see them and discuss it. He knew he would bankrupt them by stopping the bridge. He knew other marina ,and residential developments would have been scrapped and that the value of their blocks would have gone down. He knew that $175 million was at stake, and he refused to see that. Mr Tickner- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of orderMr Downer-What standing order is this under? Mr Tickner-This matter is currently the subject of an appeal before the full court of the Federal Court of Australia.",90
164,Mr CADMAN,AFFAIRS,"Name the standing order. Mr Tickner-While the robust nature of parliamentary debate in Australian publiC life means there is obviously scope for discussion of some matters, the issues that the honourable member is now canvassing are matters directly germane to the full bench of the Federal Court of Australia.",91
165,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,I believe I have pertinent information further to the point of order. It is my understanding that the appeal before the court is on a narrow matter of law regarding the description of the Hindmarsh Island area and the nature of the business before the declaration. That is solely the matter of appeal and it does not canvass this information.,91
166,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,"Can I just say to both the minister and the member for Hindmarsh, who are very genuine in their response to this issue, that the question of the sub judice principle here is one which I am often very acutely conscious of. Given that this is a matter that has been forward three times this week for consideration as an MPI, I have had a look at some of the issues contained here. It is a very difficult thing to rule on in the parliament. A lot of information about the issue is out there in the general public. The minister has indicated in question time today that there is an inquiry that he has established. I understand again that there is an inquiry that the South Australian government is intending to put in place or has put in place. To that extent, it is very difficult for me, therefore, to say what is or is not sub judice under those various inquiries. I just say to members that if they want to end their contributionsprovided, of course, they are mindful of that-then they should be careful in what they say so that perhaps some new information which could possibly prejudice the court case is not introduced in this place. But, as I said, there is so much that has been written on this out there that I suspect this debate can continue in the way it has.",91
167,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. In the Saunders report, which the minister considered, Professor Saunders raised the fact that she did not have an independent anthropologist present. She said that she had limited time and that she had spoken briefly to only two women and had got information from only one woman. The minister was aware of that, but he did not read the 400 representations that were sent to him. We have probably established that he did not have the time to do . that. We have gone through the time line. Justice O'Loughlin found that the minister did not consider those representations. The minister keeps referring to the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin and saying that he was vindicated. Justice O'Loughlin said that the minister did not give any consideration to representations at all. He said: The consequence of these findings is the conclusion that there has been a fundamental failure by the Minister to comply with the statutory obligation that he consider the representations before deciding whether to exercise his power ... That is clear, yet this minister keeps saying that Justice O'Loughlin has vindicated him. So he did not look at the representations; he did not consider them. Justice O'Loughlin then overturned your declaration, and that seems to be something we have forgotten. This is not the first time, is it? The minister at the table has had three declarations overturned. This is not the first time a declaration was overturned. The second time the minister failed to make a declaration because the Premier of Western Australia did not want him to a make a declaration in favour of Aboriginal people. But the law overturned that; the Federal Court said that he had to. We still have the Broome crocodile farm case under review, in which the minister's declaration was again overturned. Here is a minister who has had three declarations overturned. What does that say about the minister's competence in administering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Act? We have Justice O'Loughlin saying in the Hindmarsh Island case that the minister did not read the representations. Post Justice O'Loughlin's decision, amounts of information have come up via the media which this minister has chosen to ignore. At any time he had the option to say, 'Enough is enough; it is time that we stopped the harm to Aboriginal heritage and Aboriginal people and that we got this out of the press and into a judicial inquiry.' But did the minister do that? Laura Kartinyeri is supposedly the oldest Ngarrindjeri woman and the person responsible for the secrets, but the minister never sought her evidence- When a letter came claiming that Nanna Kartinyeri did not know anything of the secret women's business it was ignored. It was later claimed that this letter was not written by the person claimed to have written it but that it was a hoax written by somebody else-in fact, Allan Campbell. Did the minister do anything at that stage to settle this question? He did nothing. He left it open. Did Nanna Kartinyeri write that letter or did Allan Campbell forge it? We do not know. The fact that these questions remain unanswered casts a big question over the whole Aboriginal heritage issue and puts Aboriginal people against Aboriginal people. Three Ngarrindjeri women went on television. The first was the spokesperson, Dorothy Wilson. Dorothy Wilson says that she was at the meeting where a white lawyer put forward the women's business and she said that it was fabricated at that time. What a blow this is to Aboriginal heritage that somebody would say this. Is Dorothy Wilson telling the truth? I do not know, but neither does the minister. Ifshe is not telling the truth, then she should be stopped from saying these things because they are harming Ngarrindjeri women. If she is telling the truth, then her accusations have to be investigated because they cast aspersions on the whole issue of Aboriginal heritage around Australia. What did the minister do? Absolutely nothing. He has not investigated these accusations. He has washed his hands of them like Pontius Pilate and has said, 'It has nothing to do with me. Let the Ngarrindjeri women tear themselves to pieces.' That is all this minister does. He has allowed these women to be branded as outcasts and liars. The minister has said nothing to defend these women who have came forward. He has not listened to them and he has allowed them to go unheard through the official channels. That is how much respect this minister has for Aboriginal people. This issue has been in the papers for over a year. The minister firstly ignored the women, we then had questions about the anthropologic evidence and now we have a public fight about whether the anthropologist who appeared for the Aboriginal legal movement in South Australia was qualified enough to give evidence. What was her role? The leading South Australia anthropologist, the head of the South Australian Museum of Anthropology, Phillip Jones, then said that the whole thing was not true and that, from his experience, it did not exist. He debunked the whole issue. At that stage I would have thought the minister would have said, ·if nothing else, 'Enough is enough. Aboriginal heritage has suffered enough. As the minister, I have a responsibility to look after Aboriginal heritage and to make sure that these accusations do not go on time after time.' This minister. ignored that. He has made no reference to that and the accusations have circulated around Australia. Hindmarsh Island is now infamous in Australia. People all over Australia are now casting doubt on Aboriginal heritage in their o',Vn areas. Legitimate Aboriginal heritage is being questioned on the basis of what happened in relation to Hindmarsh Island. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs could have stopped this much earlier on. The next issue is that Douglas Milera then went on radio. The minister, who has not been entirely honest in his quotes, quoted today from what Mr Milera said in an interview.· You stopped short, did you not, Minister? I will table these quotes later, but I will read them first. On the Channel 10 news on 6 June 1995, Doug Milera said, 'I think the whole issue of the women's beliefs was fabricated.' The minister did not quote that. He chose to quote from a SAN interview the following day. I put it to you that, if this minister was doing his duty, he would have properly finished the quote, but he stopped early into the interview. I will read to the House the end .of the interview that the minister read from. It reads: Milera .... That women's business is all fabricated. Conlon .... The women made it up? Milera . . . . Yes. That was the end of the interview the minister read out in question time. He admitted that",91
168,Unknown,AFFAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,93
169,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,Order! Those on my left. Keep your outrage under control.,93
170,Mrs GALLUS,AFFAIRS,"We then have Douglas Milera's wife, Sarah Milera-she is one of the key people in this issue-quoted in yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser saying that it . was all fabricated. It was an extensive interview covering almost a whole page and going onto the following page, written by Colin James, who already has a Walkley award. The minister has said, 'This wasn't true.' Sarah Milera later went on radio, and it was a very confused report that she gave on the radio. If I were the minister, I would be asking, 'What in the world is going on with this Aboriginal community? What are the poor women being subjected to? They are saying one thing one day and retracting it halfway through the next. Isn't it time that this got out of a media circus and I, as minister, protected Aboriginal people?' But that is not what the minister has done, until forced into it by the South Australian government. From the very beginning, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has played this game as a political one. He has used it to vilify me in Aboriginal communities and for direct political gain. He has suggested to Aboriginal communities that it is I who have denigrated Aboriginal beliefs, yet he has not produced to those communities one statement to suggest or in any way show exactly what I have said. The only person who should be attacked in this for failing to protect Aboriginal people is the minister. There have been serious charges in this case. The minister has avoided them, ignored them and wiped his hands of them. Because of the minister's actions in this, Aboriginal heritage in Australia is now in disrepute. The Ngarrindjeri women are separated. They are fighting amongst themselves. The only person who can take responsibility for this is the man who failed to find out the truth, the man who failed to call an inquiry earlier, the man who should resign-the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.",93
171,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,Is the motion seconded? Mr MCLachlan-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,93
172,Mr TICKNER,AFFAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (4.39 p.m.)-Having been furiously thrashed with a feather by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), I must say that many of my remarks will not only respond to what the member for Hindmarsh has said but canvass other matters of criticism that the opposition has levelled at me over recent days. Might I say that much of what we are discussing in this motion has already been canvassed in debate recently in this House. The first point I would like to make is that my obligations as the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs are to administer a piece of legislation that is passed by the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia and the responsibilities that I have under that legislation are, indeed, onerous. They require me to act impartially; they require me to act prudently; they require' me, in the case of an application for a section 10 declaration, to protect Aboriginal heritage, to commission an independent report. In fact, my track record shows that, in choosing independent reporters under the legislation, the people I choose are very much at arm's length from me. They have included the former Liberal minister, Fred Chaney; the former supreme court judge, Hal Wooten; and of course Professor Saunders herself. It is my responsibility not only to weigh up what are sometimes competing interests in the administration of this heritage legislation but also to protect Aboriginal heritage. Indeed, the case of Bropho v. Tickner in the Federal Court placed very strong obligations on me as the federal minister to protect that heritage. My role under that legislation has been consistently to try to find common ground, wherever that can be found, between Aboriginal people and developers who might be proponents of a particular development. Indeed, the track record shows that, in relation to the Broome crocodile farm, I attempted to achieve a mediation, but it was not possible because of the Western Australian government's intransigence on this issue. In the case of the protection of the Todd River and, at issue, a declaration there to prevent the construction of a dam, I attempted to try to secure agreement between the Northern Territory government and the Aboriginal people. That came to a rather bitter end with the now legendary Max Ortmann in the bed of the Todd River. I say these things because my administration of the act is under criticism in the motion-this very political motion, which is lacking in substance but has been moved by the opposition. So it is important, I think, I make some threshold remarks about the general administration of the act. I also say, as I have said many times before, that the federal legislation is legislation that is only effectively used as a last resort-that is, when state or territory legislation is inadequate or is inadequately applied. I tum now to the question of the Hindmarsh Island bridge and the application that was made to me for heritage protection. In this case, as with all other cases, I chose someone to commission a report who was totally at arm's length from me. Professor Chery I Saunders is an eminent Australian academic. She has, regrettably, been subject to, I think, very unfair and very damaging criticism by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and by other members in this House-the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). As the of Federal Court said in its judgment in relation to the Hindmarsh Island case, she is a person of very great integrity, and the government rejects absolutely the slurs that have been made on her. I will not canvass the detail of matters are currently before the Federal Court. Call me a conservative lawyer if you like, but still have some regard for the judicial process and I do not intend to go into a whole range of issues that are before the court. But let me make it clear that the attacks that have been made on me in the course of the last two that were made. weeks have all been issues which have been the subject of a judicial inquiry. I repeat: the attacks on me in relation to my administration of the act concerning Hindmarsh Island have all been the subject of judicial consideration, almost without exception. Let me tell you the kinds of issues that have been raised in the media and trotted out by the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the Opposition himself.",93
173,Mr TUCKEY,AFFAIRS,Did they have a meeting in a shed?,94
174,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,"Order! The member for O'Connor. The member for Hindmarsh was that heard in absolute silence, as will be the minister.",94
175,Mr TICKNER,AFFAIRS,"That is why I think it is fundamentally important that, if the media are to write about the issue, they read the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin. While that judgment ultimately came against me on limited procedural points, the arguments trotted out by the coalition were argued in detail in the Federal Court. It was said, for example, that the fact that I issued a declaration for 25 years, contrary to the initial advice from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, was somehow an abuse of process. That was rejected by the court. Justice O'Loughlin said that the decision was for me to make-and I followed the report of Professor Saunders on that issue. For days on end we had only some sections the media trot out the argument about some . alleged impropriety concerning the tops of faxes being cut off. Anyone in the gallery who wants access to the transcript of the Federal Court can come to my office and get it. They will see that all of these issues were that raised in direct detail before the Federal Court. I have been subject to the most extraI ordinary judicial consideration in respect of this matter. The very layout of the kitchen at my house was the subject of evidence given before the court. The end result of all this was that His Honour did not uphold the assertions It was suggested that because the Aborigicourse nal and Torres Strait Islander Commission given some advice to the applicants about matters within their responsibility this showed somehow that I was biased or showed some impropriety on behalf of ATSIC. This was expressly rejected by the Federal Court Australia. It was said by the coalition and a number of other people in the media and was written up, in the case of Mr Easdown, almost exclusively without any attempt· to contact my office. There were page 2 stories in major selling tabloids damning me without even the courtesy of a phone call. In my public life, I have an obligation to uphold certain standards, as do members of the House. I would have thought the most fundareason mental aspect of a code of ethics of a journalblunt-this ist was to get the truth right. It was said that I had in some way, in a number of things, prejudged this matter because I had had a draft declaration preand pared-again, a matter expressly considered by Justice O'Loughlin in the Federal Court. His Honour in fact found that that was a heritage process. prudent course of action to adopt. It was said that, because I took action on behalf of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Australia to investigate whether the Commonwealth of would incur any liability, somehow or other that was an impropriety. Again, Justice politics O'Loughlin said that that was a proper course of action for a minister to take in the interests of taxpayers, and so it goes on and on. What I regret most of all is not the damage the coalition campaign has done to me. I have never had in all my years in public life-and there are many of them now-such warmth and such a show of support, not only from my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party but also from people I care about in the Australian community, including the leadermember ship of churches and the leadership of munity groups of great repute throughout, indeed, Adelaide and South Australia, and only people in the trade union movement but also fair-minded Australians who respect the way in which this matter has been conducted. I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of those many people who have expressed that great support to me in the of the last couple of weeks as this had campaign by the coalition was mounted. Right to today, and indeed yesterday, I have dealt with this matter with the utmost propriety. I say categorically that the decision to of commission a further inquiry under the Aboby riginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act by Her Honour Justice Jane Mathews, President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Deputy President of the National Native Title Tribunal, was taken before any suggestion of any inquiry, or decision on the part of the South Australian government to conduct an inquiry. The decision was mine. I took the initiative and the I took that initiative, to be very is the saddest part of all of this issue-was that I became convinced that the coalition would continually seek to use and fuel great division on this issue, that it would continue to inflict great damage on Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander people, that it would continue, as a calculated campaign, to try and discredit Aboriginal people and the In my remarks thus far, I have responded in a very considered way in respect of a number process matters that have been raised in the course of debate. I say in respect of the of this that no-one ought to be under any misapprehension as to what is driving this process. What we are seeing here is the Adelaide establishment using every trick in the book, including a royal commission into the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people in South Australia, to strike back at people who at least in some way contributed to the political demise of the member for Barker. That is what this is all about. This is the absolute core of the issue. We know why the for Mayo is playing such an active comrole in this process-he, too, is another wounded soldier of the Adelaide establishnot ment, another fallen soldier whose own transgressions in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy were the very reason why he lost the high office that he once held. This has been from day one a political campaign of the coalition in which the Liberal Party has been deeply involved. Its fingerprints are all over virtually all aspects of this grubby exercise. Let me say in relation to the inquiry that has been called that I will be dealing with that matter, as I always do, in a proper and prudent matter. It will be an arms length inquiry from me. It will be an open and transparent inquiry. It will be conducted fairly. All those who have any possible interest in the subject matter of this inquiry will be able to present their views. But I do say this: in the interest of good government in South Australia, the Premier of South Australia should not proceed with the royal commission that he has already announced. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be writing to Premier Brown, impressing upon him the concerns that the Commonwealth has about his foreshadowed course of action and urging that the royal commission, with power to compel people to give evidence about their spiritual beliefs-virtually unprecedented in Australian public life-not be proceeded with and that the South Australian government cooperate with the Commonwealth in respect of its inquiry to end this matter once and for all. Earlier on I tabled two transcripts in respect of radio interviews given by two people who were referred to in the Adelaide Advertiser and elsewhere as having claimed that beliefs were fabricated. I did that in order that the media, which has not really had the opportunity to peruse these transcripts in detail until now, will at least set the record straight, and that includes the Adelaide Advertiser. It seems to me that much of what has been written in recent days about the issue of Hindmarsh Island has been based on a lack of awareness about what the Federal Court has said in respect of this matter and without the close scrutiny of a number of clear rebuttals of allegations that have been made by the coalition. Let me conclude with a plea to the opposition-I think at this point it will be one that will not be heeded. Eight months after the promise of the toalition policy on Aboriginal affairs we still have a total absence of any policy. I urge the coalition to stop playing politics with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to stop using Aboriginal affairs as a party political football, to review their policy and to do so with good grace and decency and, in the interests of this country, to move to the greatest extent towards crossparty cooperation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. That is not going to happen overnight, but it ought to in the interests of the nation. (Time expired)",94
176,Mr MCLACHLAN,AFFAIRS,"Barker) (4.54 p-m-)­ This censure motion is about whether or not the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) should resign. I am saying, as the Adelaide Advertiser said this morning, that he should resign. There has been a bit of shouting done about this matter in the chamber in the last few days, but I think there are some very quiet issues I would like the minister to address. He has said that he has always sought to bring together the parties-the Aboriginals and others-in this matter. I will read out to you a media release that Mrs Wendy Chapman put out some days ago. My office has spoken to the Chapmans, but I had not spoken to the Chapmans until yesterday. I was reminded of this media release when I picked it up off my desk. Mrs Chapman says: In the six months before he banned the bridge on six separate occasions, we requested Mr Tickner to meet us to hear our case. Despite his own ministerial department advising him to meet us, he ignored us. Mr Tickner, she says: ... strenuously resisted our lawyer's attempts to obtain copies of all relevant documents in the court case. I said in this place yesterday that on three occasions discovery was attempted and that on something like six or more occasions there was a freedom of information request. On almost all of those occasions-not all-it was resisted. In the end, in some matters his adviser said Mrs Chapman gave evidence, which she did, that some of the relevant documents had been destroyed. Two weeks ago-and this is the point I want this minister to address, which he has never discussed, and this is nothing to do with the court case; this is nothing to do with the Federal Court appeal-the most serious allegations imaginable were made by some very senior and very delightful people women's business was a hoax. They had to know?' make a very serious decision whether they were going to stand up and say so in the face of their Ngarrindjeri people. Has the minister talked to the in? Of course he has not talked to them. Has he had anybody from his department ring them up and say, 'You have come out and given evidence that wasn't there before.'? 'It has nothing do with the court case; it is new evidence-people who are retiring, who are quiet, people who do not take the public eye'. No, the minister has not. Why not? Because it has obviously put a hole in the declaration he made. I do not think Professor Saunders did a very good job, but I am not accusing her of because she did not have all the information. I have raised this two or three times iii this place. The only woman' who was used as an original source of the women's business, that is, Nana Laura, 88 years old last year; perfectbe ly healthy, and was known to the he had a letter in his hands in his office:"""":""':'and who was known to the minister's staff as being the only original source of this women's business information, was still alive last year and she was not asked. Why don't you look up and face this question? She was not asked because Professor Saunders did not know about her. She did not know about her because obviously Doreen Kartinyeri; who obviously central to this whole thing, much quoted in the Saunders report, did not tell her. Or, if she did tell her, then Professor Saunders did a worse job than I think she did. I do not think she did a very good job. One· of the reasons why she did not know was that the minister had her name in a letterthe only person alive; the others had been dead for 12 or 15 years-and her name was never told to Professor Saunders. After the minister read the report, in the 30 hours he had to read the report, he knew, or his advisers knew, that her name never appeared in those 56 pages, and none of his staff went to check. So the whole of the basis of the women's business, if it were true, had one central source alive. Was she ever asked by anybody? 'No.' Why not? Was it ever checked by anybody on your staff? 'No.' that the Why not? 'Don't know.' 'Why would we The reason is that this minister had made up his mind of the general direction. Why had he made up his mind of the general direction? . Because he had a couple of letters. That was one of the letters he had. The other one came from the first meeting, which was really quite seminal in this whole matter and which I raised the other day. Its first public genesis was on 9 May on Hindmarsh Island. At that meeting, 15 women were asked by the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee to come down there and solve a problem for them. What was the problem they had to solve? Mr Neale Draper-not Nelly Draper; much not a woman, a man-had just completed a report for the South Australian government. That report was not going to be good enough; that was their dilemma. That is what they told these 15 women. That report was not going to good enough to get the bridge bannedministerwhich was their objective. So they said to the women, 'You have to do something.' They brought Doreen Kartinyeri down to the meeting from Adelaide, and she said, 'I know the answer. The answer is that that is where all our ancestors' babies were aborted when our ancestors got pregnant by white men.' So they wrote the first part of a letter to the minister, and they took it to the is other side of the island where other people and were, including the white lawyer for the Aboriginal legal rights movement for South Australia, Tim Woolley. He said to them, 'This is not. good enough.' So another part was added to the letter later in the day. What do honourable members think that said? They were whole sentences straight out of the report from Mr Neale Draper-a man-and that was sent to the minister. We would think that anybody who was really cognisant of the fair result would have twigged that here were sentences that not only have nothing to do with women's secret business but have come out of a report written by a man. One letter came on the 9th, but the one from Doreen Kartinyeri on 12 May said, 'I've been aware of women's business for a long time, but I have just become aware of the exact place to which it refers,' and she referred to three sources, two of whom are long dead and one still alive. Then the minister appointed Cheryl Saunsaid, ders-a woman, of course; I am not criticiscome ing that-to have a look into the"" women's business matters. These matters are not part of this court case. The court case is a Federal Court appeal about procedure and whether process which took place was correct. of my colleagues said to me, what ought to addressed is whether that meeting did take place. What happened at that meeting? What were the facts surrounding that? Did that days meeting take place on Hindmarsh Island with result. men guiding the direction of the conversation? That brings us to Doug Milera, because was there. I have to back up the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who just in the veracity of this minister's argument-or lack of it. The last things that Doug Milera said in a six-page interview, a long interview, with Keith Conlon on ABC radio yesterday morning-Falstaff at the table tried to obfusprobably cate this thing yesterday by reading stuff from earlier on-were, as the interview states: CONLON.... and I think you said it last night, that you were the person who invented the story. Do you stand by that? MILERA .... Yes. OK. If you want to .. I tried avoid this, but if you want to say that, I did invent it, OK. Milera then goes on to say: Let everybody in South Australia know that one of the instigators who created the bridge. He was not asked to say that. He volunteered that of his own volition. Conlon then said him: What's that got to do with understanding women's business on Hindmarsh Island? "" Milera says: That women's business is all fabricated. Conlon then said to him: The women made it up? 'Yes. You want to talk anymore, because gettin' sick of talkin' to you,' says Milera. That is the end of the interview. So at the end of the whole of that stuff-six pages of itMilera is asked the seminal question and he 'Yes, I fabricated it.' So do not try to in here and tell us some other story. One more thing I might say about Doug Milera is that he was the central applicant for the bridge ban. One has to recognise this. Let the us now look at a couple of other matters. As one Wendy Chapman states: be On the 10th of last year Mr Tickner made his bridge ban and has brought down the whole crushing power of the Commonwealth onto my family based on his half-baked investigation. A few later our company went into liquidation as a So much for you getting the people together-the Aboriginals on one side and the he white people and the developer or investor on the other. So much for you getting those people together. Wendy Chapman says she tried six times to get together and you would put a hole not come to the party. I was amused when you said a minute ago something about spending money like a drunken sailor. Well, my goodness me! As I understand it, your whole operation will cost the Commonwealth millionsmaybe tens of rnillions-of dollars in the end. The list of costs includes an estimate for the Saunders inquiry of $250,000; Aboriginal applicants' legal costs of $100,000; costs of the court case being judged-court staff, court to costs, Mr Tickner's costs and Aboriginal residents costs, et cetera, of $600,000; cost of full court appeal, $250,000; minister's office internal costs-being Sue Kee's time and I was other staff-$100,000 now; ATSIC costs, this story to stop $300,000; and so on. But on top of all of that is the loss to the developers. I do not believe that these develto opers should be chosen over anybody else. But what is absolutely paramount is that this minister-a minister in this position who has the chance to make a declaration-must make a declaration when he can get as close as possible to the truth. We now have a whole lot of information which shows what he may have thought was the truth. I think he was part of the conspiracy-maybe unwilling and I'm unwitting or maybe too stupid to know any better. When the minister read that Saunders report he knew that only four women had said they knew anything-out of 1,600 women, or is it 2,000? How many women were there? Other people have disputed the thing since then. The minister should have known better. Another subject. I want to raise is about when you take somebody's asset away, acquire that asset-not quite the same as an acquisition of land-with all the might of government. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was alluding to my use of documents. I will tell you why I used those documents. Forget about the secret documents, because we might yet find that the secret documents have as much authenticity as a promise from the Prime Minister inside them; that is possible. My use of these documents was because I knew that this minister had not given up on discovery all the documents he should have given up. When I got those documents it was patently obvious that he had not. Let me talk about responsibility. Four hundred pages of representations came to you, Minister. One of the people who made a representation was Mr Ian Webber who is known to a lot of people in this chamber. He is the chairman of Mayne Nickless. He has also been on government inquiries and has headed them for the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and for other people. Mr Webber received a letter from ATSIC saying, 'We've got an FOI application. Do you mind if we spread your financial details around.' He wrote to Professor Saunders and said, 'How is it that ATSIC has a copy of my private representations which I wrote to you? They are only for you and the minister,' or words to that effect. So Professor Saunders said, don't know. I sent them to the minister.' I know that there has been a change of arrangements from ATSIC, but there were 400 pages of representations. Not only that; the ATSIC letter said, 'We would like to hear what you say, but we're not sure that we will take any notice of you even if you object.' all of Mr Webber's private business could go to anybody who puts in an FOr. As it turns out, that For was probably from Chapman's lawyers because they wanted to see what the representations said. This minister talks time and time again about handling things properly; he has not handled things properly; he has not gone into depth in this matter. I think that he should resign, as the Adelaide Advertiser said this morning. It is no good coming along with your own little inquiry, again after a telephone call from the Premier of South Australia. (Time expired)",96
177,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS,"The House should not accept this censure motion for its content and it should not accept it for the motives behind it. We have gone to motive for some time now in these debates in the chamber, because this is about the fourth or fifth time we have had a censure motion on this issue. These debates have had some consistent elements to them. There has been a constant seeking without evaluation by members of the opposition of the information that is before them. Those opposite hear one thing and they rush to this chamber with a censure motion on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). Then, usually a day or so later when a bit of political prudence has indicated to them that they should wait, we get a repudiation of that proposition. Then they find out something else and come rushing into the chamber, regarding themselves as having yet another document or yet another statement that demonstrates the rectitude of their position. Again, without leaving it alone for a day or two to let people dwell on what has been presented and on what is alleged to have been said by them, they race in here and find some other reason, on the basis of that unsubstantiated 'I claim, to attempt to censure the minister for Aboriginal affairs. On every single occasion, including this one, the so-called facts on which the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) based his case have been muddied or repudiated outrighton every single occasion. It all stems back to So the first occasion. The first occasion you ran on this was not because of your concern for the developers-you opposed the construction of the bridge as being commercially stupidand it was not because you thought it bankrupted the people concerned, because they were in receivership before the minister got anywhere near the decision. That was the second piece of falsification in the remarks you made. That was not a matter of concern to you. You thought you had an opportunity based on the fact that, by accident; a series of documents turned up in your office-not just the odd letter, but an absolute trove, a chest full of documents-that were the entire legal case of the Commonwealth; not politics. You picked all of that up, raced into this place and, frankly, you fibbed and deceived about those materials. You made accusations against the minister for Aboriginal affairs. You can get other people to move motions for you, but why you cannot stand and move motions in this place-though you nevertheless persist in doing so-is that your hands are so sullied by your initial performance on this issue that you have no credibility and no capacity to speak in this place. I always had some vague respect for the former Nazi minister Speer on one ground only. As he came out of gaol, after years of being justifiably gaoled for his heinous role in World War II, he was quizzed by a journalist, 'What do you think about the .latest Russian threat to our security?' and his response was, 'With a political record like mine, why would you ask me for an opinion?' With a political record like the honourable member for Barker has on this matter, why would - nyone want to know his views? His original presentation was tainted in the worse possible way for somebody who sought to stand before the Governor General and swear an oath of office as a member of the executive council-a level of frittering away a set of documents put before him, which should have been taken straight back to the office",99
178,Mr MELHAM,AFFAIRS,He should have done a Vanstone.,100
179,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS,"Senator Vanstone copped a similar trove, and what did she do? She handed it back. She did not rock around the place trying to take advantage of what had been put before her. You alone have managed a performance like that. With your political record, why on earth would anyone want to know what you think about this matter at all? You ought to be getting somebody else on the opposition side, if you must persist with these motions, to get up and do the job. The Leader of the Opposition (MrHoward) may be trying to rehabilitate you on this, but because he has got a pack of nonentities on his front bench. You at least once had a reputation in the public, and it was a good reputation. It is not surprising that the Leader of the Opposition, with such a bunch of nonentities on his front bench, would want on the front bench somebody with the reputation you once had. The fact of the matter is that on this matter you are disqualified· from speaking, though you persist in doing so. You have now persisted in-and I want to dwell on this to some extent-this royal commission. Let us understand this royal commission. To my recollection there has been only one other royal commission organised on what might be regarded as a religious matter and that was the royal commission into the Church of Scientology. There was at least some argument at some stage about whether it was purporting to be a religion but was in fact involved in doubtful psychological practices. That was the issue of the day, so at least there was that rationale behind acts that were associated with banning it. In this case, this is a royal commission simply into spiritual beliefs; It is not a royal commission into the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, his deparfment or his handling of the issue. It is not a royal commission into that. No royal commission in South Australia is empowered to .investigate that anyway. As far as I can see, Dean Brown has not been stupid enough, in this unprincipled act on his part, to attempt to do something that is not within his power to do. What he has done is to target-with Star Chamber powers, 16th century investigative powers, which is what royal commissions have-a group of women's religious beliefs. That is what he is doing. He is using a royal commission power, which is generally used to get at illegalities, corruption and manifest failures of public policy. This royal commission is not into public policy at all; a group of women's spiritual beliefs. You talk about the whole might of the state and the Chapmans. You talk about the whole might of the state and a court case-when court cases are run routinely anyway on appeals against this or that government decision at any point of time, where normal rules of evidence apply, where rules relating to hearsay apply and where there is some level of discipline in what is put before them. You contrast that-the imposition of a state in that circumstance-with the putting in place of a 16th century Star Chamber to investigate the religious beliefs of a group of women in South Australia. This is an act of infamy that will go into the records of whiteblack relationships in this country for many years to come. You are part of it; you are part of that process which has produced this act of infamy. Ultimatums by pipsqueaks suggesting to prime ministers that they have 48 hours to respond will, at the end of the day, produce a foot firmly planted between the buttocks of religion. those pipsqueaks. Nevertheless, the Premier of South Australia suggested that, before he put this Star Chamber in place to investigate Aboriginal women's beliefs in South Australia, the Prime Minister might like in those 48 hours to consider what he intended to do. it is, what the Premier was running along with, as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has foreshadby owed many times, was his preparedness, at the completion of the judicial process that currently under way, to see a further judicial process instigated into not women's beliefs marks. per se but the way in which the determination was made and the grounds on which it was made-in other words, something relevant to the issue of the day as opposed to targeting the women and their religious beliefs. The Premier might have anticipated ought to be a prime ministerial response to that. But, without waiting 48 hours, he shot from the hip, went charging out and stuck that royal commission in place. We now have a totally infamous situation of a royal .sion into religious commitments of a section it is into of the Australian people. But it does not matter to the Liberals opposite because, as I said yesterday, they have that Midas touch. They can say the words, but they cannot sing the song. Whatever they might say, when it comes down to dealing with issues that relate to Aboriginal affairs they have a Midas touch of failure. Every time they are actually brought up to the mark what comes out is vicious racism. That vicious racism is reflected here in the only ever, in Australian history, royal commission of inquiry into religion, outside of that Church of Scientology process. Let us persist with some of these grounds on which they base thisMr MCGauran interjecting",100
180,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS,It is not on religion. Dr Kemp-It is on fraud.,101
181,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS,"Aboriginal women's beliefs are not a religion. Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As a matter of clarification, I said that the royal commission is not on",101
182,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS,Order! You are now introducing debate. You can use other forms of the House to clarify the position later.,101
183,Mr BEAZLEY,AFFAIRS,"Let me go into some of As the statements that have been made. All that you have chosen to feed off is related to the statements that are alleged to have been made the various Milera's in particular. The Adelaide Advertiser ran that story vociferousis ly, and the honourable member for Barker quoted them again in the course of his reToday, let me go through Sarah Milera's comments on all of this. She is obviously a person being torn about by it. She had this to say about her former husband's views on whether or not the story was fabricated. Nicoll, the interviewer, read her a quote from what her husband and asked: What do you think of that? MILERA: Disgusted. NICOLL: Why? commisShe also said, among other things: On weakness, it is time to back off because there is no way he would know about women's business. Number one, he wouldn't know about business. I lived in the same house as him and he wouldn't know it because I wouldn't degrade myself by telling him. It goes on, and Nicoll said: He said that you and he got carried away with the whole thing and got caught up in it. MILERA: That's not so. NICOLL: So, you stand by your claim that the stories are not invented. MILERA: I stand by everything that happened, the right way, not silly way, barunge way. NICOLL: So the information that has gone to Robert Tickner, in the first place is accurate. The women's business material is accurate. MILERA: Originally? NICOLL: Yes. MILERA: Yes. It continues, and Nicoll said: Look, let me take you back and I have to keep coming back to this because it's turning out to be the central issue whether you like it or not and that's the women's business. Now, there is no way I can ask you what it is. I simply ask you again. Doug's claim that that story about ,the women's business that had the bridge stopped was invented specifically to stop the bridge, is that accurate or is it wrong. MILERA: That is absolutely stupid. That isridiculous thing I've ever heard. How can we not say things. We are Ngarrindjeri women. How can it not be true. That's silly, that's silly. That man's got no qualification to say that. It goes on: NICOLL: Oh, we're getting down to small bits and pieces here. I think the major issue still remains doesn't it, whether or not the women's business exists. You say emphatically that it does. MILERA: Of course. If it don't, I want to know what qualifies a man to say it. There was a quote at the end of a report which started off with Doug Milera saying it was not fabricated, and now you have that. There have been five repudiations of this person, on whose evidence you have been relying, that the story is fabricated. You also had a bit to say about the academic Cheryl Saunders and what you thought of her. When you look at what the academic Cheryl Saunders had to say about this, you have to deal with Justice O'Loughlin's view of Professor Saunders. In his Federal Court judgment, he said: She performed her tasks professionally, dispassionately and with competence. I reject the aspersions which have been cast on her and the manner in which she has performed her duties. That was the view of Justice O'Loughlin as far as Cheryl Saunders and her performance was concerned in this regard. Why did he arrive at his determination? Why make something of the determination? It goes to technicalities. Evidently, one of the things the judge believed was that the minister should have read the secret women's business. That was the judge's view, and the minister quite rightly contested that view: Given the minister's understanding of the sensitivities of Aboriginal women to men reading their materials, or knowing their materials, he made a decision of perfect integrity as far as he was concerned. He said, 'I will not do that.' The judge said that he should have done that, so the minister quite sensibly said, 'I appeal on that particular proposition.' That appeal does not reflect badly on him. It does not suggest that he is incompetent; it just suggests that he has a disagreement with a judge about what level of sensitivity ought to apply to women's business and its consideration by men. That is all. This is a concocted motion which covers a most serious impact on the civil liberties of Australian citizens in the creation of this royal commission. You deserve no credence for it. I move: That the question be now put. The House divided. [5.27 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Stephen Martin) Ayes ............... 71 Noes ............... 60 Majority ......... 11 NA Adams, D.

196,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,I present the 23rd report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the. Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1995 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed.,108
197,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"I move: (5) Clause 16, pages 14 and 15, after subclause insert the following subclause: ""(lA) The Minister must ensure that relevant State Ministers and a body or bodies representative of local government are consulted in connection with the preparation of a report under subsection (1)."". This amendment relates to. the requirement that the minister report to the parliament annually on how councils have met these objectives specified for them in the bill and on other matters related to the administration of the legislation. This will include the extent to which the funds have been allocated on a horizontal equalisation basis, and on the performance by councils of their functions, including the efficiency and provision of council services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Australian Local Government Association arid the state and territory. ministers believe the government has reached a firm undertaking that any reporting arrangements are to be made to the local government ministers conference. The federal government had agreed that reporting on councils' performance would be dealt with under the auspices of the regular local government ministers meetings rather than to parliament in the first instance. There has been no agreement on the form which the report should take or on the detail of the benchmarking arrangements to be implemented. These issues were to be the subject of further investigations by the officials and advice to the next ministers conference, which is going to be held next year. Report The opposition' samendment requires the federal minister to consult with relevanf state ministers and local government in the preparation of the report to parliament. I expect this will resolve many of the concerns raised about the reporting process and ensure that the minister honours at least the spirit of the undertakings he has reached with the other levels of government. I understand the minister is prepared to accept this amendment. I thank the government for accepting this and previous amendments, seeing some sense in them and agreeing to the position of the opposition. It is certainly pleasing to see that the minister has acknowledged that there is need for continued (1), consultation with the third sphere of government in this country. He holds, as we do on this side of the House, that as a matter of great concern. I can only ask that he reconsider his opposition to the provision according the status of disallowable instruments to the national principles and the intrastate distribution of the financial assistance grants. Parliament must be allowed to scrutinise the distribution of these funds, and·the minister should honour the agreement he has struck to allow this scrutiny to occur. In conclusion, I thank those members on this side of the House and the other side for their valuable contributions to debate on this bill. Whilst we had some differences of opinion, the debate was fruitful. The content of some members' speeches was something we should all read in Hansard and take note of. They were certainly valuable contributions. I also want to thank the clerks for the assistance we have had from them in the preparation of our amendments. So often they get overlooked by this House in their preparation for the day-today running of the House and also in the preparation of amendments. I thank the clerks for their help. I notice that the clerk responsible on this occasion is here in the House. I thank the House.",108

200,Mr LINDSAY,COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (6.30 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, together with the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1995-known as the collection billcompletes the package of legislative measures introduced last year following the government's 1994 budget initiative to replace the existing $25 departure tax with a $27 passenger movement charge to fully offset the cost of customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issuing short-term visitor visas. This bill clarifies the treatment of travel involving Australia's external territories and brings the status of departures to installations in area A of the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation, which undergo customs and immigration processing, into line with that in the Customs Act 1901 and the Migration Act 1958. Financial Impact Statement The amendments proposed in this bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the bill to the House. NA COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1995 This bill, together with the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1995known as the charge bill-completes the package of legislative measures introduced last year following the government's 1994 budget initiative to replace the existing $25 departure tax with a $27 passenger movement charge to fully offset the cost of customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issuing short-term visitor visas. The legislation passed by the parliament last year as acts Nos 146 and 159 of 1994 set the new rate of charge at $27 in respect of departures from Australia after 1 January 1995. At the time that legislation was being considered 1995 by the parliament, the government also made known its intention to commence negotiations with international air and sea passenger carriers to have them collect the PMC as part of their ticketing arrangements, thereby removing the need for departure tax stamp booths at international departure points. Negotiations with airlines are in their final stages and the airlines' representatives have given their. in-principle agreement for the airlines to enter into arrangements to collect PMC from passengers departing after 1 July 1995. For the first 12 months of the _new collection regime, when airlines will still be establishing collection procedures, the PMC stamp booths will remain at international airports to ensure that those passengers who have not prepaid the PMC as part of the price of a ticket will be able to pay before departing Australia. The airlines understand that, at the end of this transitional period, the booths will cease to operate and the airlines will assume sole responsibility for PMC collection. A further arrangement will be negotiated with the airlines for the long term. As part of the new collection regime, this bill will replace the existing 24 narrowly defined categories of exemption from PMC liability with 12 broadly defined categories of exemption, both to facilitate collection of the PMC by airlines and shipping companies and to clarify the operation of the new collection scheme. In particular, item 4 of the schedule to the bill provides that a person departing from Australia will not have to pay the $27 PMC in relation to his or her departure, where that person is: under 12 years of age; or a traditional inhabitant of the Torres Strait - travelling in connection with traditional activities; or a member of the defence force of another country, or that person's family, who departs from Australia in the course of their duty on a military aircraft or ship; or the crew member of an aircraft or ship, or a member of their family, or a crew member who is being repositioned; or a passenger who is in transit, or departs Australia after entering because of an emergency or other circumstance beyond his or her control; or a foreign diplomatic or consular staff member; or a passenger on a cruise type journey which involves multiple departures from Australia, where the PMC has already been paid in respect of a previous departure during the course of that journey; or a person travelling to Area A of the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation in the Timor Sea in accordance with the Timor Gap Treaty. This final category has been included as a consequence of the amendment in the charge bill to treat departures for installations in area A in the same way as departures for other countries as both require customs and immigration processing. Persons departing in connection with petroleum exploration activities have been exempted from PMC on the same basis as ship and aircraft crew members; namely, that the departure is undertaken in the course of their employment. The measures in the charge bill clarify the treatment of travel involving Australia's external territories and bring the status of departures to installations in area A of the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation into line with that in the Customs Act 1901 and the Migration Act 1958. Financial Impact Statement The direct financial impact of the measures proposed in this bill are expected to result in the following increases to revenue, in present dollar values: (i) redefinition of transit passengersincrease for 1995-96 of $1.5 miIlion; (ii) abolition of various exemptionsincrease for 1995-96 of $300,000. I commend the bill to the House.",109
201,Mr TUCKEY,PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE,"O'Connor) (6.36 p.m.)The opposition does not oppose the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill and cognate bill. As has been stated, similar legislation has been dealt with in the parliament previously, the difference being the date of implementation. The government originally proposed to commence on 1 January 1995 the process whereby airlines will collect these fees, but it would have been completely impossible for the airline industry to have made the necessary adjustments to its ticketing procedures in that time. It would appear that, notwithstanding that it was the coalition that forced the government to change the date from 1 January to 1 July, there is still some doubt as to the capacity of the airlines to transfer on this date, because we note that the booths are going to be maintained for 12 months. That will be at substantial cost to the revenue, which is not mentioned in the financial impact statement associated with the second reading speech. On the other hand, I assume the government is taking the view that the matter is already a matter of cost and will continue as such. Whilst we thought it appropriate that the airlines be given six months, we question the extension to 12 months. Many of us would be aware that it is a fairly simple process in many other countries. You approach the departure counter and check in with your luggage. You are told what the tax is and you pay it on the spot. Obviously, the preferred position for the client is to have the amount included in the charge when the ticket is purchased. It would appear to me that the second option would be for it to be collected as people check in if that has not been done, which might be a good reason why the booths are not required. It is clearly a very expensive matter. For a long time. I think the government avoided this very sensible decision because of threats of industrial action by those operating the booths. We have apparently got over that, but one might wonder whether the extension to 12 months results from the need to service the community or whether some deal has been done-for something that would appear on the face of it to no longer be necessary. We will leave that for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) to explain. As has been mentioned, the bills deal with the procedures to impose this charge and to require the airlines to collect it. The other most notable thing about the bills is that there has been a reduction in the number of people who are exempt from the charge. There used to be 24 categories and now that has been reduced to 12. The parliamentary secretary did list those in his second reading speech, but I will refer to them briefly. They include, quite properly, children under 12 years of age. Also included are traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait, which apparently is the result of a treaty we have with people who I thought were Australians. But, if there is such a treaty, we have a responsibility to honour it. It is quite appropriate to exempt members of the defence forces of other countries-that is probably a simplification-from the charge when their departure is undertaken in the course of duty and they are on an aircraft or a ship of a defence force. Of course, spouses and children of such defence members who depart with that person are also exempt. Crew members of ships and aircraft departing Australia, and spouses and children of working crew members travelling aboard the same ship or aircraft, are exempt. Positioning crew members-that is, passengers on ships or aircraft who depart from Australia in order to later become crew members of that or another ship or aircraft-are exempt. This category would include, for example, airline personnel who travel on an aircraft aspassengers from Sydney to Honolulu to take over as crew on the aircraft on the Honolulu to Los Angeles leg of the journey. Again, that makes infinite good sense. Transit passengers are another group that will not incur the charge. Emergency passengers-that is, persons who arrive in Australia because of an emergency on board their ship or aircraft-are exempt. Passengers on board cruise type journeys that involve multiple departures from Australia where the charge has already been paid in respect of a previous departure are exempt. Diplomatic and consular representatives and members of certain international organisations are exempt. Finally, passengers who depart for area A of the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation in order to prospect for petroleum or undertake petroleum operations are also exempt. I referred at the beginning of that list to defence forces. Of course, Australian Defence Force personnel travelling on official duty will no longer be exempt from the charge. I guess it is simpler, but it is robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is purely a round robin of payments, similar to the way the government applies the fringe benefits tax to itself. I am not really sure that it is a good idea, but as one who has a portfolio interest in the Australian defence forces I wonder whether there is an appropriate refund coming from this particular charge or whether it is just another backdoor way of reducing outlays on defence. I have a feeling it might be the second. The parliamentary secretary should have a substantial interest in that, considering the make-up of his own constituency. I trust he will be making representations to see that the amount of money involved is refunded, as it is supposed to be with fringe benefits tax. I now understand that a full recoup of fringe benefits tax levy is not necessarily repaid to the defence department. The bills will also tighten the exemption category relating to transit passengers. This is expected to raise an additional $1.5 million in 1995-96. I have no further comments to make on the bill. As I said, the matters have been previously dealt with by the parliament. We think this sort of collection is a sensible proposition. It is much more convenient to passengers. It should represent a worthwhile administrative saving to the government with no substantial costs to the airlines involved. Nevertheless, I make the point again that, having extended the start-up date by six months in previous legislation, I am surprised it is thought necessary to maintain the booths for 12 months. I think that should be monitored. I can assure the parliamentary secretary that people do not enjoy running from one place to another to get those stamps on their tickets. They will demand that the airlines provide this service much quicker than that. It would be silly to find ourselves in the situation where we are manning booths all round Australia with practically nobody using them.",110
202,Mr JULL,PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE,"It is not my intention to delay the House tonight since the passenger movement legislation has previously been before the House. I will just say that the history of this particular charge had its genesis in 1978 with the recommendation of a $10 departure tax, which was designed to fund tourism promotion for Australia. We know the history of that. What I find interesting is that a number of us have stood by the original 1978 recommendation that, while a $10 departure tax should be imposed, it should be collected by the airlines. I am glad that, after a brawl of some 17 years, finally the airlines are going to collect the charge for us. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), said, it will get rid of those dreadful cages which are quite frankly one of the greatest turn-offs that we have to present to international visitors who are coming to Australia. . There is a change in the nature of the charge as well. The $27 is very much a passenger movement charge whereas the original concept of the $10 departure tax, which was designed initially to promote tourism, ended up in general revenue. At least now we have a true system of user pays, and I appreciate that. It is always a bitoOf a worry when these charges are tucked away, and it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that we do monitor the rate of payment on this particular charge. Once you get a hidden charge, it is possible to have it increased by stealth. The one thing we do not want to 'do is make ourselves non-competitive in world terms. We are not there yet. In fact, the passenger movement charge in, say, Heathrow in London is much higher than it is here-it is about £40. If you look at Europe and the United States, which also have passenger handling charges incorporated in the price of tickets, Australia's charge is about average. But we must be absolutely sure that we do not let that get out of hand. We are seeing a tremendous increase in the number of people coming to Australia, and we are seeing a moderate increase in the number of Australians going overseas. So the revenue that is coming in is quite considerable. With the projected growth, an awful strain is going to be put on some of our infrastructure. Earlier today we were talking about the future development of Kingsford Smith airport and Sydney West airport. That is only one area where the strains are going to come. In my home state of Queensland we are seeing enormous growth in Brisbane airport, which is one of the fastest growing airports in Australia, and in Cairns and Coolangatta. When the privatisation process is duly over, I am sure that some of the first moves to be made will be to make sure we have the capacity to handle the number of international visitors coming through those gateways. In terms of the passenger handling charges, while that might help in a direct sense, the government is also going to have to look at what it might do with the infrastructure behind the airport. I refer to infrastructure such as hotels. An amazing situation is taking place in Australia at the moment: in a city like Brisbane, it is almost impossible to get a hotel room. During the week the major hotels are reporting 100 per cent occupancy rates and on the weekends, 85 per cent occupancy rates. It is a similar situation on the Gold Coast and in Far North Queensland. We have a real difficulty because the developers are saying that the new hotels, unfortunately, even with the loadings that are going into them, do not stack up economically. I would hope that future governments would look at some way of encouraging further investment in the hotel industry. If we do not, we will not be able to handle the potential volume of traffic that is out there wanting to come to Australia. I welc.ome the changes to the method of collection. I welcome the fact that this is now a true-user pays principle. I welcome the fact that after 17 years the airlines are finally going to collect the chilrge.",112
203,Mr LINDSAY,PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (6.49 p.m.)-in reply-The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) commented that airlines should collect the passenger movement charge at the time of checking in. This course of action has not been taken as airlines currently do not have the cash collection or handling facilities at their checkreceived in counters. Setting up such a system for the first 12 months would be at considerable cost to the airlines, and they are doing their best to"" collect it at the time of the sale of the ticket. Maintenance of the booths that currentlyhave the necessary collection facilities for 12 months to protect the revenue to be collected is a reasonable compromise; I am sure that most members would agree with that. With respect to the member's second comment about the defence forces, I do not know what he is getting at there. Australia has deployed one battalion of combat troops since Vietnam, since 1972, and that was to Somalia. It is now 1995. We have sent some students overseas to various courses. We have deployed a few people to Cambodia, Rwanda and Mozambique. If you are suggesting to the House that this additional charge :of $2 extra per departure tax is going to impact on the defence budget, you have no credibility at all. Whilst I support the submissions made by honourable members, I just wanted to make that point about the defence forces, of whom I am continually vigilant. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading' Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",113
204,Mr TUCKEY,PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE,"O'Connor) (6.51 p.m.)There seems to be a differing point of view. I will take it that I am a fool if the notes provided to me are wrong. I will read again from the notes provided to me on the issue of whether the Australian defence forces are now confronting an additional and what I would consider substantial cost to their expenses. I am told that the bills will eliminate a number of exemption categories that were available under the old system. For example, members of the ADF travelling on official duty will no longer be exempt from the charge. I am not talking about the $2. I am talking about the $27. They will now pay $27. I assume from the advice that I have here that they previously paid nothing because they were exempt. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) does not believe that there is a fairly significant movement of people. I am not talking about battalions going overseas. They are more than likely going to go on an air force jet anyway. I am talking about the people who travel backwards and forwards as part of our defence operation to England and to other countries-whether it be to buy, to bring back ships and other things otfor training. I was at a dinner last night with a young air force person who has just been transferred to England. Presumably, the ADF will now pay the $27 departure tax. It is not a huge deal. I am just making a point which I would have thought the parliamentary secretary would have some interest in, considering his constituency. The point is that whatever the amount of money is that is being taken from the ADF it should be given back. If you do not believe in that, I would welcome you saying something about it. Mr Lindsay-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The submission made by the honourable member is quite specious. I addressed these issues in my second reading speech. The fact is that they will now pay the $27.",113

AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY BILL 1995 Cognate bill: NA COLLECTION BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from Main Committee, on motion by Mr O'Keefe: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Sharp moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House condemns the Government for its callous and incompetent policy on Sydney Airport, and condemns it in particular: (a)for its decision effectively to close the east west runway; (b)for misleading the people of Sydney about the noise that would be associated with the opening of the parallel runway; and (c)for its failure to develop adequate noise management measures prior to the opening of the parallel runway, rather than after it opened in a belated response to community pressure"".",114
206,Mr ATKINSON,AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY,"I ,have a great deal 'of concern about the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill and the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill. It seems as though the legislation has been designed to solve a problem and that is the problem at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. If you read the explanatory memorandum it becomes quite clear because it sets out a list of criteria and talks about the method by which airports can be declared. In the explanatory memorandum it says, 'At this time, only Sydney (Kingsford 1995 Smith) Airport meets these criteria.' I have no difficulty with the concerns people have about airport noise. In fact, I listened to the contributions of the member for, Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) and others who live in the area. They raised the concerns of people in their electorates about the additional runway at that airport. What concerns me a great deal when looking at the level of noise that is being emitted in and around the Sydney airport is that the noise contour levels have been based on projections to the year 2010. When I comp'are the level of noise at that airport to the level of noise that some of my constituents face with Moorabbin airport right now, not in the year 2010, it causes me great concern and leads me to raise a couple of questions. When we look at the noise contour levels for schools' that are set out by the government in this legislation.we find that the level is 20 to 24. Parkdale Secondary College, which is in my electorate, is under the flight path of one of the runways at Moorabbin. The college is in a contour level above that specified and it will get absolutely no benefit whatsoever out of this piece of legislation. If the legislation was set up to look after airports across Australia, I would be prepared to look at it and accept it, but it is not. Why can the people of Moorabbin not be taken into consideration with regard to this legislation? In this legislation jets are the basis upon which the levy will be applied. The legislation looks at a number of categories of jet including the 747-400, the 767-300, the 737-400, the A300 and the BAe 146. As the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) said earlier, we have a few concerns about this legislation being applied to the Bae 146 because it is one of the quieter aircraft around these days. A lot of its design work was done to enable it to get into airports at all hours of the day. That is the case in any other part of world, but it will not be the case under this legislation that is before the House. When we look at the type of aircraft that fly into Moorabbin, we find that they. do not fit into these categories of jet. They are smaller aircraft and in many cases they are older aircraft. They fly in at a lower altitude and when they exit the airport area they fly out ata lower altitude. Therefore, because they are older and slower they are over the houses for a longer period. I heard in the debate that 60 aircraft an hour fly over Sydney. Moorabbin has one of the largest air traffic patterns in the Southern . Hemisphere as far as small aircraft are concerned. In fact, we have had up to 220-plus aircraft per hour in that area. I really have to ask whether this is being done in the interests of everybody in Australia or just those in Sydney. If this legislation is only for Sydney airport then you have to ask whether this is a political solution to pacify people in Labor electorates in and around Sydney airport. You have to ask whether consideration has been given to anybody else in the country. The report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aviation Noise in 1985 sets out the noise contour levels around airports. If honourable members looked at those figures, they would see that there were high levels of noise around Sydney airport at that stage. In the 20 to 25 noise contour level, 22,708 homes were listed; in the 30 to 35 level, 7,863 homes; in the 35 to 40 level, 2,242 homes; and in the over 40 level, 565 homes. That was in 1985. Ten years in advance and all of a sudden the government is taking an interest in noise contour levels, but for only one airport. It does smell a bit. It smells of an interest in one particular airport and no consideration for the people in other areas. I have to say that I obviously have some concerns about levies being applied on some of the aircraft that would fly in and out of Moorabbin. I think they are paying a reasonable contribution through other pieces of legislation that have passed through this House previously. It seems to me that, if we are looking and talking about the consideration of people in this community, we must take into account the fact that people near airports such as Moorabbin are being substantially disadvantaged. The legislation will not provide at any stage-unless we have a mass import of jet aircraft into Moorabbin-for these noise contour levels to be taken into account and for people to be compensated. I had a look at the houses near Moorabbin airport. More than 250 houses are affected between the 20 and 25 level of contours, and some 50 houses are affected between the 25 and 30 level. The one place that particularly concerns me is Parkdale Secondary College. Its current noise contour level fits into the category of those places near Sydney airport that will be taken into consideration, but the school misses out totally on consideration. I would have thought that the students of Parkdale Secondary College are just as important and should have the same opportunity as other students to receive a good education. They need the appropriate amount of insulation in that school-insulation similar to that in any of the schools in Sydney. But this piece of legislation does not allow for that sort of insulation to be fitted in that school. We are not looking at small amounts of money. The original amount was $180 million. It is up to about $260 million now; I do not have the specific piece of paper in front of me. A considerable amount of money will be put into looking after this problem. I urge the government to look at what it is not doing for electorates other than those in Sydney. I can see absolutely nothing in this piece of legislation, except a cynical exercise to politically look after Labor members of parliament and Labor seats for the next election. I can see absolutely no other reason for this piece of legislation. If there were another reason, the kids in the schools in my electorate would be protected in the manner in which those in Sydney will be. protected.",114
207,Mr DUNCAN,AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY,"I am pleased on this occasion to follow the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), because the contribution I want to make in the brief time available to me is very much along the lines of the comments he made. I support the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995, but I do not think it goes anywhere near far enough. The legislation effectively applies only to jet aircraft. I happen to represent an area of Australia which abuts an airport called Parafield in South Australia. Parafield happens to be the second busiest airport in this country in terms of take-offs and landings. The reason for that is that in the 1980s the state government agreed to the establishment by a private organisation of an aviation college which day by day is becoming busier and more successful. The outcome for many of my constituents has been absolutely horrendous. The impairment of their enjoyment with the amenity of their houses is certainly equal to that suffered by people in the Sydney area as a result of the aircraft noise at Mascot. The difference is that, with light planes at Parafield, it is a constant drone-vroom. All day, every day, approximately everyone to two minutes they get this constant drone. This is an absolutely horrendous problem, particularly for people who are elderly or for those who are shift workers. Although there are curfews, there is very little let-up-weekends, public holidays, on it goes. I certainly do not think it is good enough to have legislation that simply concentrates on Sydney airport. We should have had legislation that protected constituents across the nation, regardless of whether they are affected by Archerfield, Moorabbin, Parafield or wherever else. I certainly urge the government to take seriously this plea. The people whom I represent are mightily aggrieved by this. They feel their rights to enjoy their houses in the manner in which they expected to be able to enjoy them have been taken away from them by the establishment of the aviation college. I think it is urgently necessary that we do something to relieve the pain and suffering that these people have been afflicted with.",116
208,Mr BRADFORD,AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY,"That contribution really was quite typical of the contributions we have had from government members, including the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), in the Main Committee earlier today. It really is quite hypocritical. They are the government; this is their legislation. There is a problem with it. This is our point-the point put by the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), the point put by the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the point I am putting: this is lousy legislation. The government is bringing it before us. The member for Watson, in his contribution, in the Main Committee, made a pathetic attempt-he was jumping up and down, he was 'red in the face-to deflect from himself and his colleagues any blame at all for the current situation around Sydney. He knows that that is not the case; he and his colleagues are entirely responsible for the situation that exists at the moment at Sydney airport. He tries to blame us for the third runway. Where was he when the legislation was approved for the go-ahead of the third runway? He was over there, voting for it-and yet he tries to shift the blame! The fact is that he and his colleagues that he mentioned-the Minister for Defence  Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton)-got up and ranted and raved about why the third runway should not be built. But when it came to the vote, they voted in favour of it over on that side of the House. It is hypocrisy for them to talk this way, as did the member for Watson, the Chief Government Whip, in the Main Committee earlier today; just as it is also hypocrisy for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan), who happens to have an electorate that is affected by aircraft noise, to come here and talk about the inadequacies of this legislation when he represents the government. I assume that he is not going to have any more the courage of his convictions than had the member for Watson or than have any other members here-and that is to vote against the legislation. Of course they will not vote against the legislation. Mr Leo MCLeay-This is good legislation.",116
209,Mr BRADFORD,AIRCRAFT NOISE LEVY,"It is not good legislation; that is the point that we are making here in this debate. It is the current minister's that we have this problem at Sydney airport simply because the arrangements that have been put in place in respect to Sydney airport suit the Labor Party. The member for Isaacs made that point-they suit the Labor Party. That is why we have this problem. I dispute what the member for Watson said-and I took and still take a lot of interest in airports-that there was any understanding that the east-west runway was to be shut down. There was not. That is a decision that the government has made subsequently. Clearly, part of the solution to this problem is the reopening of the east-west runway. The flight paths in place at Sydney airport are just ridiculous. You only have to go from Canberra. to Sydney a number of times and have to land into the south to realise that you go almost halfway to Brisbane. Clearly, that is because the east-west runway has been closed down and that has caused the problem. The total closure of that east-west runway is a blatant political act. There are problems caused by the parallel runway, by the thrusting on to that runway. You cannot say to people who did not have aircraft noise at all before that the airport was there before they built their homes, because that is not the case. They did not have that aircraft noise before and the fact is that the noise could be minimised substantially for them if the eastwest runway is reopened. That is really the answer to that problem. I will not let those opposite get off that easy with trying to shift the blame for the fiasco we now have at Sydney airport from themselves and the minister. It is absolutely on their shoulders and they cannot get out of it at all. Like the parliamentary secretary, who spoke before me, I also have a noisy airport in my electorate. I will make a few remarks about it. Coolangatta airport is a very busy airport, indeed. Unlike Parafield, which the parliamentary secretary referred to, Coolangatta airport is busy not only by virtue of light aircraft movements which, I agree with him, are often as intrusive for residents as jet aircraft or turbo prop aircraft. Light aircraft can be intrusive for people, and that is certainly the case for people at Parafield, Bankstown, Moorabbin and most of the secondary airports fault where a lot of training flights go on. A complaint I' get from residents who live around Coolangatta is that it is not always the movements of the heavier aircraft that affect them but that it is often light aircraft because of their persistent droning, as the parliamentary secretary said. I will ask a couple of questions. I do not know whether there is anyone here intelligent enough to answer them. I do not know who is going to answer the questions. With the greatest respect to the Chief Government Whip and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), I suspect that I will be wasting my time asking the questions, but I will try. To answer the previous questions to some extent, there is a mechanism here whereby other airports can be brought into this system. The legislation actually says that if an airport is a qualifying airport at the commencement of this act, the minister must place a notice in the Gazette, et cetera. The question for those of us who have are affected by aircraft noise is: what do we have to do to qualify them? To partially answer the question-I have managed to find this out so far-you have to have some noise amelioration project in place for your airport and then it can become a qualifying airport. Then, aircraft landing at that particular airport will be levied and there will be some compensation for people who are affected by aircraft noise. I have some concerns with the whole principle of this levy. Beside the fact that it is in place simply to suit the Labor Party with . its situation at Sydney airport, it really does add, and is intended to add, to the price of tickets. Aeroplane travel in this country is already expensive enough and I must say that I object to this mechanism .. I suppose those opposite will get up and tell us that it is the great user pays system. In my view, the FAC, which the member for Watson tipped on very heavily this afternoon, could pick up the tab for it, or the government could pick up the tab for it. I am concerned that if we move to have Coolangatta airport qualify as an airport for this process, that will add to the cost of tickets to Coolangatta. That is obviously not in the interests of the tourism industry. I have a problem with the whole fundamentals of this, of doing it that way. I am very concerned about aircraft noise at Coolangatta. My constituents know how much I have done to help with that problem. I have taken a very active interest in that. We have changed approaches and departures to Coolangatta airport. We have had the 727 aircraft, which was the main offender, virtually banned from Coolangatta, except in exceptional or emergency circumstances. I claim, and my constituents know, I have done a lot to lessen the problem of aircraft noise at Coolangatta airport. I monitor it-1 talk to the tower, I go down and watch what happens, and I ensure that it is complying with the noise alleviation procedures which have been introduced; that is, aircraft depart and arrive as far as possible over the waterthat aircraft remain over water as far as possible when arriving and depart over water as quickly as possible. I still think there is a problem with some noisy aircraft during the night. I have argued for some sort of curfew at Coolangatta airport. The two ministers I have taken that up with have not been prepared to accept that. There is a need for some aircraft movement during the night. We get our newspapers early in the morning and the aircraft that bring them in are different aircraft from time to time-some are noisier than others. We need to have our newspapers, but there are freight movements during the night that we really do not need and I do not think need to come in during the night. I would still argue that there needs to be a partial curfew at Coolangatta airport, and I will continue to pursue that matter. The problem with noise at Coolangatta is still a very serious one. If we take the government's intention with respect to Sydney airport, then there would be every argument for making Coolangatta a qualifying airport as far as this levy is concerned. Let me make the point again: I do not want the price of travel to Coolangatta to go up so I object to the principle of the levy, but if we can find the money I certainly want to do something for the local residents but not by virtue of this mechanism. I am between a rock and a hard place on this particolar one, as you can see. In 1983, we had 86,000 aircraft movements to Coohingatta. By the year 2010, that will have doubled to 160,000 movements. As I said, we have had the 727s thrown off Coolangatta. With quieter aircraft the problem is being improved but obviously with additional aircraft movements the cumulative noise is having an impact on residents. We have already seen that the effect of cumulative noise from even light aircraft can be very intrusive. Although we have quieter aircraft in the newer generation aircraft-the 737400s, the later versions of the 7678, the airbuses-we are going to have to put up' with an increasing number of movements between now and the year 2000. I want· to point out that even the 1993 ANEI, the noise index, actually shows that there are some homes surrounding Coolangatta that are in the greater than 35 category. This area is desigriated or believed to be suitable for industrial use only. Light industrial facilities in the area should be insulated. We actually have some homes in that area. We have quite a number of homes in the greater than 30 category. For that reason, aircraft noise is a problem now, but it is going to be an even bigger problem in the year 2010. The Australian noise exposure forecast for that actually shows the situation to be very much worse. A considerable number of homes at that particular time will be in the over 35 category, a significant number in the 30 to 35 ANEF and a greater number again in the 25 to 30 category. My point is. that Coolangatta airport is a major problem as far as noise is concerned. It is a very busy airport. It is becoming busier all the time. For me, as the member in whose electorate the airport half falls-the border between New South Wales and Queensland goes through the middle-it remains something that I need to be very concerned about for the future, as far as both my present and future constituents are concerned. I do, as I say, take a very active interest in this. It use saying to the people in this area that the airport was there first. I do not think that has ever been a valid argument in my view . The fact is that many of - he homes surrounding Coolangatta airport have been there for a very long time also. When people bought those homes many years ago the airport was a small airfield and aircraft noise was not a particular problem. Now Coolangatta has become one of Australia's busiest airports. It is a very popular tourist destination. It is the gateway to the beautiful' Gold Coast and the Tweed areas. Coolangatta airport is a very different proposition now to what it was some time ago. So I say to the government that I do not have much sympathy for this legislation at all. Apparently some government members do not have much sympathy for it, either. Our contribution on this side has been along the lines that we believe the thing is largely flawed, that it is an attempt to fix up Labor's problem with Sydney airport. The government is doing it by adding to the cost of airline travel in this country, and I do not think that is a good thing. In the end I hope that the people who travel on aircraft will come to realise what a mess this government has made of Sydney airport. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Mr SHARP CRume) (7.22 p.m.)-I move: Clause 6, page 3, lines 3-6, omit paragraph (b), substitute the following paragraph: "" (b) if the amount applies in relation to a landing made in a later financial year-II 0% of the amount that was provided for by regulation in relation to a landing in the immediately preceding financial year."". To explain the amendment-because if you just read the am,endment you would not have the faintest idea of what it meant-the whole purpose of the bill that we have been debating since this morning in the second chamber and that my colleagues have been debating in this chamber this evening is to raise money to pay is no for the insulation of houses surrounding Sydney airport, a very substantial amount of money, in the order of $200-odd million. To facilitate the raising of that money, the government has introduced the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995. The bill will be the vehicle through which the moneys are raised for the insulation of these houses around Sydney airport that are so adversely affected by the government's totally dishonest and incompetent handling of the second parallel runway at Sydney's Mascot airport. The government is proposing that at the completion of each financial year the levy per unit be increased by 10 per cent. The amendment that we have just moved affects the way in which this 10 per cent increase is to apply. For example, as I understand it, the government has indicated that the maximum levy that will apply for this year coming up is $180 per unit. We heard earlier this morning in the second chamber that the government intends to apply a levy per unit of $155. The government then proposes in the. second and subsequent years to increase the levy by 10 per cent. Where we have a difficulty is that it proposes to apply the 10 per cent increase on the maximum levy that could have been charged rather than the actual levy that was charged. In the case that we are discussing, the levy that could have been charged would be $180. A 10 per cent increase on that would be $18. The actual levy that the. government has announced will be charged is $155. A 10 per cent increase on that would be $15.50. What will happen is that the government will apply the 10 per cent increase to the maximum levy that could have been charged. In other words, the $18 increase will apply rather than the $15.50 increase. The significance of this becomes greater as the compounding effect of this occurs year by year. · It must be remembered that aircraft will not be charged for just one unit; they will charged for several units. Our amendment is designed to minimise the increases thatwill be imposed on th- industry each year by ensuring that the 10 per cent increase is applied to the actual levy rather than the maximum levy that could apply in a particular year. We believe this will save industry-the aviation industry and the tourism industry-passengers travelling, business and so forth a considerable amount of money. by ensuring that the minimum increase will apply each and every year. That is the rationale behind our decision to put this amendment. I urge the House to support this amendment. Amendment negatived. Bill agreed to. without amendment.

210,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Mr Speaker, the opposition welcomes the statement made last night by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the government's proposals to put a referendum to the Australian people inviting them to create a federal republic by the year 2001. The outlining of the government's proposals, in a sense, ends the phoney war stage of the debate about Australia's constitutional future and presents to the Australian people the option and the model desired by the government. I want to say first, on behalf of the coalition, that this is an important debate. Although the question of the constitutional structure of Australia is not something that weighs heavily upon Australians as they go about their daily lives, although the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic will have no bearing on our standard of living and our capacity to economically penetrate the fast growing Asia-Pacific region, nonetheless, the constitutional future of our nation is a matter of great importance. I believe it should be treated in an important, sober and, to the maximum extent possible, non-political fashion. This debate is not about who is the better Australian. There are decent, passionate, loyal Australians on both sides of this argument. The overwhelming issue-indeed, I believe the great test, the great answer and the great issue-is what system of government will best deliver a united, stable and tolerant Australian nation. Let me say that the interests of 18Y2 million Australians are more important than the identity of one. I think even the Prime Minister would acknowledge that the system of government under which we have operated since Federation in 1901 has been highly successful. Australia has been one of fewer than 10 countries that has been continuously democratic for the whole of the 20th century. There are few nations in the world that can boast the degree of tolerance, harmony and stability Republic which has been the inheritance of the Australian people. As members will know, I have been a strong supporter of the present constitution. I have not disguised that, and I do not disguise that. But, as a political leader and as a passionate Australian, I recognise that attitudes in the Australian community over a period of time have changed. Attitudes towards the constitutional monarchy in Australia are now very different from what they were 30 or 40 years ago. As the Prime Minister said last night, those changed attitudes in part reflect the changed composition of our population. They also in part reflect the natural, historical drift apart-I population. hope never in acrimony but because we are going, in some respects, our different waysof Australia and the United Kingdom. I therefore recognise, as an Australian and as a political leader, that there is a mood in the Australian community to address and to perhaps embrace change. I want to say a few things tonight on behalf of the coalition about the process whereby that mood should be addressed, how it can be assessed and how it can best be harnessed to produce an outcome that will unite and not divide the Australian community. It is important that, if change is to occur, it occurs in a uniting and not in a divisive fashion. The great unity of the Australian people is the most precious asset we all have. The greatest obligation we all have, whatever our political beliefs, is to act ultimately on important matters in a fashion that binds together and does not push apart the Australian people. It is important that all of us, whatever our views may be, honestly address this issue and recognise the strengths and the weaknesses of the various arguments that are put forward. The change proposed by the Prime Minister is a very significant one. It goes beyond being a purely symbolic change. If Australia were to become a republic, it would end this nation's link with the second oldest institution in Western civilisation. Some people may find that a source of satisfaction, even joy; some people will be utterly indifferent; other Australians will find it distressing; still another group of Australians will ask themselves whether such a move is absolutely essential in order to finally confirm the independence of this country. This is one of those issues where a degree of tolerance and understanding, particularly between the generations within the Australian community, is essential. The older section of the Australian community must understand that younger Australians have a different view towards the constitutional monarchy than they do. Equally, there has to be an acceptance on the part of the younger section of the Australian population that the institution is held in very high regard, even with deep affection, by many of the older section of the Australian . We do have a very strong, free, liberal and democratic system of government. What makes it strong, free, liberal and democratic is that it is built upon two principles. The first of those principles-and this does not appear to be in dispute between the Prime Minister and me-is the principle of a Westminster parliamentary system of government. It is not the most perfect system that could be devised but, in that famous remark of Winston Churchill's, it is much better than any of the alternatives. The other great virtue of the present system is that we do have a politically neutral head of state. One of the questions that has to be addressed in this whole debate is whether we could possibly devise a system of government in this country which could deliver a more neutral head of state and a more neutral set of arrangements for the head of state than exist at the present time. I want to explore that for a moment by tracing briefly the careers and the contributions to public life in Australia of four distinguished Governor-Generals of this country-all former politicians, two Labor and two Liberal. The first of those was Sir William MCKell, who in 1947 was appointed by the Chifley Labor government as Governor General of Australia. On being appointed to that position, MCKell abandoned his partisan Labor leanings and discharged his obligation as the Governor General of Australia with very great distinction. Many members of this House will know that in 1951, when following proper constitutional practice he granted the Menzies government a double dissolution· of the parliament, he incurred the wrath of some of his erstwhile Labor colleagues, some of whom took years to speak to him again. But he did the right thing by the office. Few people would argue that Lord Casey and Sir Paul Hasluck, as former senior Liberal ministers, were also very distinguished and politically neutral Governor-Generals. Indeed, one of the first events I attended as a new member of parliament in 1974 was a farewell dinner to Sir Paul Hasluck, and I well remember the glowing tribute to his political neutrality that was paid by Gough Whitlam, who was then Prime Minister. The final person in the group is the present Governor General, Bill Hayden. I acknowledge that when his appointment was mooted I was publicly critical of it because it struck me as passing strange that a person who had publicly expressed such avowed republican views should be offered the vice-regal post. But I equally acknowledge-I have done it before and I do it again tonight-that he has discharged his obligations with dignity, fairness and complete neutrality. The point I simply make about that, and the reason why I briefly traced the experiences of those four distinguished Governor-Generals of Australia, is that all of them have behaved in a politically neutral fashion. All of them, despite their differing political backgrounds, have been subsumed by the great traditions and conventions developed over centuries of the Crown, which have devolved upon the governor-generalship of Australia. The Prime Minister, in his proposals last night, has adopted in part the recommendations of the Republican Advisory Committee. He has adopted the proposal that the President should be elected by a two-thirds majority of the parliament. But he has not adopted the proposal of the Republican Advisory Committee that some attempt should be made to codify the powers of the new head of statethe proposed President of Australia. That is an interesting proposal, because what in effect the government is inviting the Australian people to do is to accept the proposition that you can without any legal doubt, let or hindrance transfer unimpaired the reserve powers of the governor-generalship to the president in an Australian republic. It is interesting that, on this particular subject, Professor George Winterton-who I think was a member of the Republican Advisory Committee, is a leading republican and a professor of law at the University of New South Wales-had this to say, and I think it is worth reading the quote to the parliament because it is relevant to the debate about the efficacy of the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister: If the Governor General's powers were inherited by a republican head of state, since the link with the monarchy would be severed, the present conventions governing the exercise of the reserve powers might not subsist. They might if they were regarded more generally as conventions of Australian government, although they are not uniquely Australian, but are, of course, shared with Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and other countries. But if they were seen as conventions of the monarchy, abolition of the monarchy might well extinguish them as well. So a republican constitution cannot simply continue the present constitutional position of conferring powers on the head of state in general terms, relying on the constitutional conventions to govern their exercise. I put that forward, and I remind the parliament and the people of Australia that they are not the words of somebody who is resisting change. They are in fact the words of somebody who is an avowed supporter of change. The relevance of those words is that they cast some doubt and they raise questions about the preferred proposal and the preferred option put forward by the Prime Minister last night. The proposal of the government is that the future President of Australia should be elected by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the parliament. Inaccurately, last night, the Prime Minister said that no party had enjoyed two-thirds control at a joint sitting since the end of World War II. In fact, in 1946 the Chifley Labor government would have had 69 per cent of the members and senators present at a potential joint sitting of the parliament. It may well be suggested that that was possible because at that time we had a different method of choosing the Senate. I notice my colleagues opposite nod in agreement, but I might also remind them that it is quite possible for the present method of electing the Senate to be altered by a simple vote of both houses of parliament. It does not require a constitutional amendment. In other words, the present unlikelihood of either side of politics getting a two-thirds majority is not entrenched and, on the Prime Minister's proposals, is unlikely to be entrenched in the constitutional changes that he intends to make. Last night, and I think quite appropriately to a debate of this kind, there was much discussion about the sense and spirit of independence felt by Australians particularly as we approach the centenary of Federation. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is not a debate about who is the better Australian; this is a debate about what is the better system of government for the 18Y2 million people who inhabit this continent. The independence and the sense of independence of a nation are not measured solely in legal or constitutional terms. There is little doubt that the sense of independence, and the sense of national identity, that emerged in the Australian people early this century preceded many of the legal changes that were referred to by the Prime Minister in his speech last night. When we are talking about independence and a sense of nationhood, it is important not only to see it in constitutional and legal terms but also to see it in broader terms. There are, for example, many people who believe that, no matter what our constitutional set up, Australia cannot see herself as truly independent if we continue to labour under the enormous levels of foreign debt that we do at the present time. I want to say a couple of things about the prospects that lie before us if the proposals put forward by the government are implemented. The prospect that Australia might end up a federal republic but have one or more of the states continuing links with the monarchy is a prospect that fills me with a great deal of disdain. I do not think it would be an outcome that would be in the overall interests of the Australian nation. I put it to the House and to the Australian people that the worse possible outcome that we could possibly have in this country would be to hold in two or three years time a referendum on converting Australia to a republic that produced what can only be regarded as an inconclusive result. If one of the tests of whether a nation should change its constitutional arrangements is the test of whether or not that change is likely to build on the existing unity of the nation, surely the time to have a referendum to alter its constitution is at a time when as best it can reasonably be discerned that change is likely to enjoy overwhelming support. If we were to have a referendum in 1998, and that referendum were to be carried· narrowly or defeated narrowly, that would be the worse possible outcome. I remind the government and the Australian people that in the history of federation only eight out of 42 referenda proposals have been carried. No major referendum proposal has been carried which has not enjoyed the support of both sides of parliament. That is one of'the reasons why we on this side of the House believe very strongly that the best way to tap into the mood for change in the Australian community at present is not to go down the take it or leave it path outlined by the Prime Minister last night; rather it is to establish a people's convention, and I will come to that in a moment. In putting forward a proposal for a people's convention, I might remind the parliament that there are other issues of great constitutional significance that many sections of the Australian community would like examined. Many Australians believe that the external affairs power of our constitution is currently being abused. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",120
211,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Many Australians believe that the relations between the Commonwealth and the states are not operating satisfactorily. Many people believe that if it is time, 100 years since Federation, to examine the status of our head of state it is also the right time to have a look at some of these greatconstitutional issues. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",123
212,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I say to the House that it is essential that not only the issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic is examined but also there be a mechanism to examine these other issues .. That is why the coalition unhesitatingly recommits itself tonight, if elected at the next election, to establish in 1997 a people's convention to examine not only the question of whether or not Australia should become a republic but also all these other questions that so many other sections of the Australian community wish to examine. I repeat tonight that, if that people's convention is established, it can examine a number of issues. It can examine the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution, including implications of change for the role of the states. It can examine the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments, including areas of overlap and duplication. It can examine the use of the external affairs power of the constitution. It can examine the question of whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms for the federal parliament. It can examine the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation. It can examine any other matters which the convention members would themselves determine. Is it not strange that a proposal that would allow the Australian peopie to be involved at the beginning of the process instead of only at the end is greeted with derision by the Australian Labor Party? I also make it clear on behalf of the coalition that amongst the 50 per cent of the members of the convention that will be appointed by the government of the day 10 per centMr Cleeland-Appointed?",123
213,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Yes, 50 per cent will be appointed and 50 per cent will be elected, which is the normal thing to do with a people's convention. Some 10 per cent of those will be in the age bracket between 18 and 25. I make it very clear that, if a clear consensus emerges from that people's convention, that consensus will be put to the Australprocess Ian people for appJ;'oval at a referendum. By having outlined proposals for a people's convention, I believe that what the coalition has done is to provide the best vehicle to enable the range of views that exist in the Australian commupity on this issue to be properly examined. Even the most objective observer would have to acknowledge that amongst those who want Australia to become a republic there is a deep division of opinion. Even if passing regard is to be paid to the various opinion polls that are held on this issue,there is overwhelming support for the notion that if Australia is to become a republic then the president of the Australian republic should be directly elected by the Australian people. That indicates that the range of views in the Australian community is so broad, the idea that the Australian people should be presented with only one alternative-that is, the alternative desired by the present Labor government--'-is a completely unacceptable way to examine the mood for change now in the Australian community: The most effective way of doing it is to provide to all of the Australian people not only a capacity to be consulted, as they must, at the end of the process but also a capacity through a people's convention to be involved at the beginning of the process. The idea-and I say this very seriously to all members of the House-that the Australian people will. accept, without argument or demure, the idea that they are being consulted simply because the matter is being debated here in the House of Representatives or the Senate IS not an idea that commends itself to the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. One of reasons why there is a desire in the Australian people at the present time to have an elected President-if, in fact, we do become a republic-is a feeling that, no matter what arrangement is worked out that only involves the members of parliament, in some way that will shut them out of the process. That is not necessarily a view that I personally ·share, and I understand many of the reasons why there ought to be a parliamentary for the election of a President if Australia is to become a republic. But those who want a republic achieved in this country, those who want change achieved in· this country, must understand that, if the very strong feelings of the Australian people in relation to the election of a President are not accommodated or at least properly assessed and properly discussed-and how better can that be done except through a people's conthat vention-then those who want to bring the republic about will not achieve their goal. matter how ardent you may be and how zealous you may be about bringing about a republican change, you have to recognise that there is a spectrum of views in the Australian community: there are people who want to retain the present system; there are people who want to have an elected President; there are people who want the parliament, a two-thirds vote, to choose the President; there are a large number of people who might want, through the processes of consultation and the processes of change, to consider other options. At the beginning of my remarks I indicated that although this was not an issue that touched upon the daily lives of Australians; although this was not an issue that would affect the living standards of Australians; although it is an undeniable fact that whether we become a republic or remain as we are will not have any impact on the level of unemployment, the level of social deprivation or the level of social privilege that might be enjoyed by different sections of the Australian community, it is nonetheless a very important debate about the future of this country. a debate that ought to be conducted with goal of achieving-if there is to be change-a change through a process that unifies and does not divide the Australian community. matter how strongly people may feel on either side of the debate, the fact remains that sense of unity and that sense not present in the Australian community at the present. If we do want to achieve change that unifies and does not divide, then we need to choose a method of facilitating that change about which the entire Australian community can feel comfortable. That is why the coaliHe tion has proposed the idea of holding a people's convention. If this debate bogs down into a slanging match as to who is the more patriotic Australian, if this debate bogs down into some kind of stupid points scoring debate about whether we might sell more coal or more wheat or more services into the Asian Pacific region-if this debate bogs down into kind of rather pointless points scoring, then I think the Australian community will No suffer and the Australian community will be no matter the poorer as a consequence. The great problem with the approach outlined by the Prime Minister last night is that he will not give you, the Australian people, the referendum question-that is, the referendum option that you want. He will pass by through the parliament without your involveand ment the referendum proposal that he and he alone wants. He will then demand that you answer his question at a national referendum. Our approach is quite different. Our approach is to involve all of the Australian people at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. Our approach includes all Australians. Our approach is to allow you to help decide the kind of constitution the Australian people want for their future, not the kind of constitution the current Prime Minister wants for your future. Our approach is to allow the people of Australia to decide not only the questions and the options but also, fundamentally, the referendum itself. Our view is a fundamentally democratic It is view. We believe the people of Australia a cannot be involved enough in deciding the future of our constitution. With an issue as critical and as important as this, there cannot No be too much democracy. That is after all a possession of all of the Australian people, not that just of the 148 members of the House of of oneness are Representati ves. The Australian constitution is no more Paul Keating's constitution than it is mine. All Australians should have an equal say in its future and in our country's future. The Prime Minister believes that any involvement by the Australian people is too much involvement. believes you should be involved only in the final stage and that you should be asked merely to adjudicate on his question about your constitution, rather than allow you to be part of the creation of any change if that is what you want. That is why the only way to properly handle this matter is through the people's convention of the coalition. Debate (on motion by Mr Howe) adjourned.

I have importance of that to Australia and to the meat minister said nothing about that. The shadow to be answered. I will quote it in full because in full. When talking about this bill yesterday industry is in very serious competitive difficulties, when the responsible minister, the Minister for Primary is not even in the country. if this Main Committee does not know, Senator US farm bill. If anything is more relevant to and Energy, more important for him to be doing, Australian industry, on the US farm bill, then to remain in this place because if that is the responsibilities to its farming community is the comment-it is in the Hansard-that the a minister, a senator, should be somehow in this he should be sitting here today instead of being of Australian farmers. I will respond to the Cowper. There is no other way you can read that in the country'. What a miserable statement. It is very well served by the government but suggest that the honourable member for Cowper primary industry than the honourable member for Gwydir's statement. It is typical of the farm workers and say that the real problem is we industry. That is the whole implication of that You're a disgrace. It's a fabrication. NA MC 1636",135

Before I finish, it is important for me to great opportunities for export from Far North As people know, in the 1980s Cairns airport international airport. Alongside the Cairns seaport, for the supply of goods. Freeport, Indonesia, as part of the western Pacific and South-East Queensland. It is very interesting to look at the record volume of air cargo passing through Cairns years. International air cargo has doubled every million kilograms in 1992-93- International volume in 1991-92, has benefited from the opening the Asian markets, as the number The flow-on impact of increased air cargo enormous, and has spurred the development of north. That is what this legislation provides potential and that is what the shadow spokesman failed it. All he talked about was doom and gloom, opposition knows there is an election coming economy.

I know the member for Leichhardt about the National in Washington in April lobbying from the producers. I take great pride in the fact that MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 on industrial relations talking about wage before me again referred to trade unions-those the workers of this country.

The up so it has to talk down the Australian in terms of the minister representing this legislation which the industry welcomes and of the amendment moved by the member I take the opportunity to rise and speak in for Gwydir which, in spite of the unfortunate (Mr Dodd), were really hitting the spot. I might of one comment from the member for Leichhardt, Energy (Senator Bob Collins) is in Washington. member for Leichhardt says, it is very important to the American congress as this is 1995 farm bill only comes up for reassessment or 1990. This year, 1995, is one that is going to that because, in spite of the negative remarks.by Party, as a member of the National Party I was Vice-President down for the Australian primary I was able to be there with a parliamentary NA Thursday, 8 June 1995 delegation led by Senator Michael Beahan. It in a bipartisan fashion, and that is the delegation. Because I was a National Party was able to be the major spokesman and the Americans on the needs of Australian primary producers. It is particularly important to realise policy. This is one of the things that I and opportunity. We said to people-and I actually this is your domestic policy.

Senator Richard Lugar was very candidacy for the presidency, and we were not talks with other officials in Washington such involved in the formulation of the policy. Australia's primary producers should be aware to this. There are basically two farm bills by Senator Lugar, and he is making a much reduced significantly. The one coming through and is more concerned with maintaining the subsidies. Everywhere that we went throughout the United people that we had been talking in Washington producers, and all the Americans said, 'What's will probably be that the subsidies will be is not just EEP. There is a whole range of like the food stamps program, which is bound that we understand what is happening there. The reality is that the Americans do have to as the deficit of this government.

Any review of the I have followed the member for Gwydir (Mr his commitment not only to his have not put out press releases as he has done: for Capricornia, and based on a complete NA Thursday, 8 June 1995 misunderstanding or mischievous analysis of release at the time, I would have referred to a few weeks ago. But I will pass over that matter, because spokesperson, did raise some criticisms of this actually being debated in this chamber, a criticism that the opposition would, in general, support should remind ourselves that the Cattle Council in the meat industry in this country are supporting The member for Gwydir criticised the lack Industry Commission report. From the report, overview. Indeed, he quoted from the very selective quoting; and, while I do not deny the report says, let me read from the end of Commission's recommendations. In part, The Commission's recommendations build on reforms They have been made with a view to facilitating industry with low levels of skills towards In particular, they are designed to: increase the level of skill in the workplace, the workplace health and safety; assist the process of and meat products; increase commercial incentives and market promotion . . . That is, they have been designed to take government of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has indicated of the people. In this bill, the government has destiny, to take control of its own procedures looking. Yet all we get is carping criticism union bashing from the opposition spokesperson, digress from the effects of the recommendations ... increase the extent to which the industry, whether is able to adopt a means of ensuring the hygiene obviously a key issue for exportersincrease the capacity of producers and processors other's needs; reduce the level of direct public sector to reduce costs and increase productivity These are commendable recommendations. The of the industry, are designed to produce those results. The other issue that we have to be very careful industry are involved, including producers. For among members of the opposition, to say, 'It workers, who cause all the problems.' The member Hamilton report for the Cattle Council of Australia, processing industry, which is an excellent document. how uncompetitive the Australian beef industry is. MAIN COMMITTEE MC 1639 what I said in the House. Had I had his press him specifically in my explanation to the House the member for Gwydir, the opposition bill. Firstly, he criticised the fact that it was which I thought was irrelevant. He indicated this bill with a second reading amendment. We of Australia and all the peak bodies involved this legislation and these recommendations. in the bill of any procedures to implement the he quoted the first couple of paragraphs of the first paragraph. We have to be very careful of that what the member quoted was exactly what the overview about the effects of the Industry the conclusions of the overview read: which have been initiated over the last decade. the transition from a commodity based, adversarial a modem, collaborative and productive industry. flexibility with which it is deployed and the level of achieving greater market access for Australian meat for firms to conduct their own research, development off the back of the industry. The Leader that he wants to take government off the backs provided for the industry to take control of its and to make itself more competitive and outward from the opposition and a pretty fair wallop of the member for Gwydir, yesterday. But I of the Industry Commission, which continue: on its own or in collaboration with government, and safety of its output at least costto receive feedback on how they can each meet each involvement in the industry; and facilitate measures in all sectors of the industry. matters in the bill, involving the restructuring about is to make sure that all parties in the too long, there has been a tendency, particularly is the meat processors, in particular the meat for Gwydir referred to the Booz Allen and International comparisons in the beef His aim in referring to this was to show NA MC 1640 One of the important points made on page processing gap-defined in the report as $198.49 but that around 30 per cent is addressable. the industry, particularly the processing end, make international comparisons, but it is figures from industries in countries such clearly makes the point that only 30 per cent is hardly the point made by the opposition by the Cattle Council of Australia. The other report that the member for Gwydir and Associates, dated March 1995. This was (Mr Brereton) entitled Review of progress in sector. I am delighted that the opposition quoted rather selectively to suggest that all the fault of the unions. I believe that this is of the report to clarify the position. It will 'Difficulties or impediments to enterprise ... a number of evident impediments to enterprise are summarised below. The major impediment lies officials and employees. Whilst employers and unions change, this has to a large extent not been reflected poor relationships which exist in the industry with relationships have been established, it is possible level. The key issue for this industry is making a difference will require changes to the culture of the workplace: of unions and of the work force, and not only basis. There is evidence that, where the culture to educate and train employees and take them very positive results. The other issue that I think is important is referred to on page 5 of the report. Impediments the following: a) Employers: with some exceptions, the industry'S and nartow approach to relations with their employees where it has occurred. The concept of Best Practice who have generally looked for excuses rather than management. And the report is critical of the union and the of unity and common purpose among all participants. the Australian Industrial Relations Commi-sion employer association are major impediments to reform. I make these points to indicate that there processing end, from the producer end and from reflected that change. However, we are talking sides, an industry where there has been a tendency MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 35 of this review is that up to 70 per cent of the a head-is beyond the control of processors; It is very important to know this. All sectors of are willing to address that issue. The report does misleading for the member for Gwydir to mention as Argentina and America, when the report itself of this is to do with the processing industry. This spokesperson and comes from a report initiated used was the report made by Fellows Medlock a report to the Minister for Industrial Relations workplace reform in the export meat processing spokesperson referred to this, but once again he the problems in the meat processing industry were unhelpful to the debate and I will refer to aspects be instructive to all members. Under the heading bargaining' the document states: bargaining are dealt with throughout the report and in the attitudes of the industry's employers, union have expressed positive views about the need to in action. That this has not occurred illustrates the trust and goodwill clearly lacking. Where co-operative to point to progress in improving productivity at plant . to that cost gap of 30 per cent, but it changes in the attitudes of management, at the national leVel but also on a plant-by-plant of the workplace is an issue and there is a need through the process, you can actually achieve is this: what are the impediments to change? This to change identified by this report included individual employers generally display a traditional and unions and have failed to acknowledge change is not well understood by the industry's employers accept that the initiative for reform must lie with work force. In the industry, there is a clear lack Failure to support the central role for and the absence of a respected and visionary have been initiatives on all sides, from the the government end. Indeed, our reforms have about a very conservative industry on both to use very out-of-date industrial relations NA Thursday, 8 June 1995 mechanisms on both sides but where there However, that has to be capitalised Despite the on-going debate about the relative competitiveness of the industry, there is a broad improve perfonnance at an individual and company be achieved, it is essential that a clear, consistent by both employers and unions. From the views expressed that sufficient commonality exists for the parties to a widespread education process about the need for all the parties involved will be to translate change at the individual company level. That is the challenge for this industry and the gone through a very effective consultation process Commission, on page 29 of its report, concludes: All parties expressed scepticism about any ability body, at this stage, which has sufficient respect or together to foster refonn. While refonn must be focused vision for change, supported by agreed principles in educating the parties and facilitating It is certainly the case that the Australian Industrial reform but, if management and unions think achieve a great deal. The unions have shown same time, that must be based on some degree agreements are developed, employers will follow that educating the workplace, which is as employers, is going to be very important in this process. I want to give a classic example of this Australia Meat Holdings is at present in dispute some representatives of AMH. I have discussed has put into its operation at Guyra, which about because it is in his electorate. He did AMH is keen to adopt productive processes whereby are needed to improve capital utilisation.

There is no doubt much a challenge to the unions as it is to the issue in my electorate of Rockhampton, where with the AMIEU. I have had discussions with with them the sorts of initiatives the company I dare say the opposition spokesperson must know not mention it yesterday. I think that at one level it can initiate the sort of changes that have not had a chance to talk to the employees as about the way the process was developed. In Keith Lawson, is reported as follows: hope.

It is very important that in the industry, facts are recognised. To date I do not believe they are.

I am not decrying the fact of the producers of Australia. I am just pointing he is not here is an indication to us on this the government places on this industry, which attitude towards all the government members' to see the ongoing viability of the industry and profits that flow from this industry in Australia.

We see penalised because of corrupt overseas markets. the brunt of it are not the processing plants or they are not the transport operators or the the wharves. Who are they? It is the producers for a beast, they get $200 for a beast and have no redress at all because those producers weaners for sale into a fattening market, and to fall in a time of low prices, they have no right across the industry to see fair and equitable back to the people who produce the goods and the got major investment. Without the producers, the way would not have the jobs that they have and at this level of setting industry policy, these has been moved by the shadow minister.

If we are to look suggest that the officials responsible have Coolangatta. I am sure the honourable member about that a little later. I would also like to expose what has been honourable member for Watson was saying interesting. There has been quite a lobby group now who complained about aircraft noise opened in 1988. Seven years later there are specific formula for determining what constitutes allow people and institutions to take advantage which, in technical terms, applies to 25 ANEFs. advised by Dr R.V. Dubs, the general manager Aviation Authority, that, as far as it is concerned, these problems and that there are not any areas sort of assistance. The reality is that there have been a number in Brisbane, and it is quite interesting when a couple of examples, studies that were done affected areas-namely, around the Tingalpa to place particular emphasis on Cannon Hill that once contained the Brisbane abattoir by The Queensland state government and the Brisbane to have 12,000 new dwellings put on that particular space. But the interesting thing about that particular has been put nearby. In a particular period, from figures came through. During that period there Of these 3,037 aircraft movements, no fewer decibel mark-between 70 and 90 decibels. If with that housing development of 12,000 new in terms of providing the insulation and the cent of the traffic at that time actually broke referring particularly to that new development are badly affected by aircraft noise. The second study was done at the Tingalpa that there are no areas that actually qualify for period, from April to June last year, at the of which 2,447 were registered as being above this stage, this legislation is designed strictly places such as the south side of Of course, one of the reasons that the CAA that aeroplanes are supposed to follow their is really quite interesting because it shows where noise monitoring facility at Princess Street are some on the north side. But it is true that MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 8 June 1995 at the noise problems around Australia, may I a very quick look at the approach path to for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) will be talking happening in terms of Brisbane airport. What the about government advisers is really quite on the south side of Brisbane for many years when the new international airport in Brisbane still problems. As we see in this bill, there is a a badly noise affected area that would then of the bill. The magic figure is 60 decibels This particular group in Brisbane has been of planning and development in the Civil it would appear that Brisbane does not have in the flight paths that would qualify for this of studies done on noise exposure distribution the facts come to light.

I would want because it is proposed to develop the area there building something like 12,000 new dwellings. City Council seem to be pretty anxious location at Cannon Hill is that a noise monitor April to June last year, some very interesting were 3,037 aircraft movements in that region. than 2,857 of them registered above the 70 the Queensland government is going to proceed dwellings, somebody is going to have a problem noise reduction facilities there.

In that Tingalpa state school there were 4,249 movements 70 decibels, or 56.5 per cent of the total. At for Sydney, but the reality has to be faced that Brisbane have some real problems. says that there are no problems in Brisbane is designated flight paths. The official CAA map those aircraft should go. In fact, there is a in Morningside and another one at Tingalpa. There it is not uncommon for aeroplanes approaching NA Thursday, 8 June 1995 Brisbane, especially from the north, to be two flight paths. In the very area where I live it is quite couple of kilometres away from my home and is a flight path that comes in from New Zealand that. They are the designated flight paths, but top of our place. That does not particularly monitor and I listen to what is happening in that a heck of a lot can be learned about monitoring some of those conversations. As I have said, in a personal sense, I have that these aeroplanes do stray from their official side of Brisbane-through Balmoral Heights the Seven Hills area-people have a real problem. a number of years, and has denied that there probably see nothing whatsoever done about it. I have mentioned Coolangatta, and there are problems.
