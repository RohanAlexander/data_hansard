2,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not recollect the cablegram referred to, but I ' Bhall inquire about it , I see no reason why, should it be on the records, a copy of it should not be laid on the table. COCKATO O ISLAN D DOCKYARD .",19

9,Mr RYAN,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Will the Acting Prime Minister inform honourable members whether the Government is defraying any of the expenses of a member of the staff of a Melbourne daily newspaper who left for England almost simultaneously with the Prime Minister?,20
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"So far as I am aware, the answer is "" No . "" PACIFIC ISLANDS MAIL SERVICE.",20
11,Mr WEST,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Can the Acting Prime Minister inform me what subsidy will be paid to Messrs'. Burns, Philp, and Company for the Pacific Islands mail con. tract?",20
12,Sir JOSEPH OQOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"No contract has yet been made. The company, ss I told the honourable member yesterday, proposes a five-weekly instead of a twc''monthly service, so that undoubtedly there must be a substantial increase in the subsidy. The amount paid under the last subsidy was £40,000.",20
13,Mr WEST,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,The company is doing very well out of it ,20
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"As soon as the contract has been arranged, I shall make a statement to the House, when I think I shall be able to show that, although the company may be making good profits out of its business interests,' they are not making anything, out of the mail contract. PUBLIO ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE. AGE. PURCHASE ' OF TIMBER AREAS AND SAW-MILLS.

PAYMENT FOR RESUMED ESTATESPENSIONS.",20
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Hav e steps been taken to make money available for the payment for estates purchased from persons in New South Wales for the settlement of returned soldiers?,20
16,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Mone y is made available for every certified case. The delays that are occurring take place in the public offices of the States. I know of cases in New South Wales which have been hung up for two years.' There is a long delay in the Lands Office, where the principle of priority is applied, and then another delay in the Treasury. It is easy to blame the Federal Government because payments' are not made more speedily, but the reason why payment is not made is not that the money is not available,- but that the cases are not dealt with more speedily by the State officials.",20
17,Mr CAMERON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation furnish a statement to the House showing how many returned soldiers have been settled on the land in each State, how many remain to be settled in accordance with the . arrangement between the Commonwealth and State Governments, and the average cost of settlement in each State per man?",20
18,Mr RODGERS,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,I shall be pleasedto furnish the information desired.,20
19,Mr LIVINGSTON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Will the Treasurer make clear the reason why the payment for estates resumed in New South Wales for soldier settlement does not^ proceed more speedily ? There is an estate near Parkes, in New South Wales,, belonging to a South Australian, which two years ago was sold for the settlement of returned soldiers. One of them has taken a crop off 2,000 acres of that land, which were fallowed by the former owner, yet nothing has been paid for the land. The estate was sold at a reduced price on the understanding that spot cash would be paid.",20
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"The Commonwealth Government have nothing to do with the Settlement of soldiers on the land, beyond finding the necessary money. We have to pay up and look pleasant while the State Governments spend our money for us, as may seem best to them.",21
21,Mr LIVINGSTON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,They are putting on the Commonwealth the blame for delays in the payment of purchase money.,21
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"I know that they are, and it is easy to do so. Some of these cases want looking into. The other da}' I saw a list of purchases in New South Wales which seems to show that the State Government is doing its best to disparage the Commonwealth Government in this matter.",21
23,Mr RYAN,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Do not say that.,21
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"But it is so. The State Treasurer (Mr Lang) is at this every day. I do not see why I should not mention these cases. The list came from an agent in Sydney, and showed .that, apparently, provision had been made for the settlement of - fortyone soldiers on the land at a cost of about £130,000-a n average cost of about £3,500 a man.",21
25,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Why do you agree to that sort of thing?,21
26,Mr RODGERS,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,We have not agreed to it .,21
27,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"If the State the authorities want to have these things talked about, all the facts had better be stated. The list I referred to accompanied a complaint that the Commoning wealth would not pay what was duethe usual statement scattered throughout the country by Mr Lang.",21
28,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,It is a political stunt.,21
29,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Every knows that it is, and it is a very mean one. The list surprised me.",21
30,Mr FLEMING,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,There is a good deal more about these cases which would surW prise the right honourable member if he knew it .,21
31,Mr GIBSON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,The men . who sell perties are not to blame.,21
32,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Certainl y A returned soldier who at the beginning is faced with an interest charge of £220 is likely to be "" settled "" in real earnest. I regret that there are these cases.",21
33,Mr LIVINGSTON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"The State Government is paying only 4£ per cent, on the money owing.",21
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"I do not, and cannot, know anything of the arrangements. What we do is to pay when certified accounts are presented to us for payment.",21
35,Mr LIVINGSTON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,The case to which I have referred has been certified for two years.,21
36,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Is it not about time that the arrangement with the States was reconsidered ? I think that they are treating the Commonwealth badly:,21
37,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"We are in the hands of the States in this matter, because it. is the State authorities who control the lands of the Commonwealth. We cannot settle soldiers on land that is not ours, and, therefore, made the best - arrangements we could with the State Governments. Now we seem to be the burden bearers, and the people to be shied at. Mr HECTO B LAMOND - The State Governments are buying most of the land 'on which settlement is taking place; they are not putting soldiers on the lands they own. They are making big deals in land.",21
38,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,I believe that most of the State Governments are doing best they can with a difficult problem.,21
39,Mr LIVINGSTON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"They >are using the Commonwealth money, and are not paythe land-owners from whom they buy estates. *",21
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,If the honourable member will give me particulars of the case to which he°has drawn attention pure I shall have the matter looked into.,21
41,Mr BLUNDELL,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Yesterday I menone tioned that a pension had been refused to a soldier - because the - Repatriation Commissioners said that he should not . have been accepted for active service. ill the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation lay on the table of the Library the report of the medical proman who passed this soldier into camp; and the reports of subsequent examinanot. tions prior to his going away?,21
42,Mr RODGERS,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"I shall be pleased to do so'. Every soldier is entitled to the fullest statement of the reasons for the refusal or reduction of a pension. SHIP - BUILDI NG BOARD . Mr Riley ; - Is it a fact that one of the members of the Commonwealth Ship-building Board has resigned? If so, what is the reason for his action?",21
43,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"It is true that Mr A i r d has resigned from the Board. He interviewed me about a week ago, - and, after a talk over the matter, I told him to do nothing hastily, but to give further thought to his position. Later I received from him a letter which, if honourable members so desire, I shall get and read to the House. Mr A i r d feels that as he is, connected with a private firm it would be better for him not to continue in the service of the Government, although the interests of the Com- monwealth and the firm in no way clash. As, however, his position, on the Board is only a consulting one, at' a very nominal salary, he prefers to resign that rather than his other employment.",22
44,Mr RILEY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Is there any conflict with the Navy Board ?,22
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Not the slightest. I think the Government are - Unfortunate in losing his services.,22
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,He is a first-class man.,22
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,Fro m what I have seen of Mr A i r d I have formed the highest possible opinion of his character and capabilities. TAXATION COMMISSION .,22
48,Mr GREGORY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"In recent conversations with the Chairman of the Taxation Commission was the Treasurer promised that anything in the nature of an interim report, particularly in relation to the averaging system, would be submitted by the Commission before the House - reassembles in September?",22
49,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"I had an interview with the whole Commission in Sydney on Monday, and I found that there was a slight disinclination on their part to present an interim report. them of my difficulties",22
50,Mr GREGORY,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,The Government will have to stop the Commission's suppMes.,22
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"No ; they have a very big job on hand. Por instance, although they had previously taken evidence in Sydney, they had still eighty witnesses to hear in that city!  obvious.",22
52,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"No ; all, like the honourable member, grumbling about; what they have to pay! Those eighty witnesses are presenting' memorandaof cases and principles. A f t e r completing the evidence in Sydney the Commission will go to South Australia. '",22
53,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,This shbuld-be au education to the critics as to the in formation necessary to form an opinion.,22
54,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"The Commission has a very big job, and we must nof'be too impatient; but I am hopeful that before the Budget is presented they will have presented a report to me on two or three niatters, including the averaging principle. I have intimated to them that if they do not I shall have to procsed oh my own account. There is no misunderstanding on that point. I have told the Commission that the matter must be dealt with in the Budget, and if they are unable to report to me before I prepare my Budget. I shall have to deal with the matter myself. I have, however, the greatest hope that the Commission w i ll report before that time. SUPERPHOSPHATES .",22
55,Mr FENTON,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs information, that 6ome of the islands over which Japan has been given a mandate possess very rich phosphatic deposits, which the Japanese Government are working ? Now that the duty has been removed from superphosphates, will he see that the Tariff Board keeps a keen eye on the operations of the Japanese in connection with the importation of superphosphates?",22
56,Mr MASSYGREENE,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,I am aware of the facts stated by the honourable member. The Government will exercise all necessary supervision to insure .that the Australian superphosphates industry does not suffer. WORKS ATCANBERRA .,22
57,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"In view of the probable early adjournment of the I told House for some weeks, will the proposed works at Canberra be referred to"" the Public Works Committee before that adjournment?",22
58,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"I hope that may be the case. Unfortunately, the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Groom) was called to Queensland on account of a bereavement. When he returns I shall consult him immediately about the matter. KIDMAN AND MAYOH'S SHIP-BUILDING CONTRACT.  steps have the Government taken, following upon the very definite report submitted by the Public Works Committee in regard to the Kidman and Mayoh shipbuilding contract?",22
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF ELECTORAL,"The Government have refused to take over the ships, and the contractors have been asked tc refund the money advanced to them. The matter is now in the hands of the lawyers. NA STEAMERS.",23
60,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,Is the reported statement correct that one of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers is unable ta take a cargo of flour to India because the cost of running the. boat would be greater than the earnings?,23
61,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,"That is true, having regard to the fact that it is almost impossible to get back loading.",23
62,Mr GEEGOKY,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,"In view of the Tariff, how can the Government expect backloading? Sir - JOSEPH COOK - The trouble is that there is cargo only one way, and the freight chargeable on that cargo has to pay for the voyage both ways.",23
63,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,Goo d old Tariff!,23
64,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,This has thing to do with the Tariff. Shipping all countries is experiencing trouble. ALLIED ARMIES IN GERMANY. EXCESSES BY COLOTJBED TROOPS ,23
65,Mr MAKTN,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice Whether, j view of the shocking sexual n excesses and atrocities reported of the Army of coloured troops at present placed the Army of Occupation in the Rhine proSuperannuation. vinces, the Government will communicate to the Prime Minister the distinct disapproval of the Australian people of this circumstance, and request that he make the strongest representations to the Allied Councils to have such coloured - troops withdrawn, and thus afford protection to the white women of these pro-' v.inces;' and, further, if an Army of Occupation is deemed necessary, of troops of the white race? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I invite the honourable member, if he has the proof of these charges, to furnish it. Until he does so, I will take no step in connection with the matter. I disbelieve the allegations. ADELAIDE TAXATION OFFICE.",23
66,Mr BLUNDELL,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. What action has been taken to appoint officers to fill the - positions in the Adelaide Taxation Office which the Treasurer said would be filled on the return of the Commissioner of Taxation from Western Australia? 2. As many of these positions have been vacant. for upwards of two years, and it is reported that applicants have thereby lost seniority over officers appointed to Fourth Class positions in other Departments during that time, what action is being taken to preserve the seniority of the appointees in South Australia?",23
67,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The matter of filling the vacant Fourth Class positions in the Taxation Branch in South Australia is now being dealt with, but it is being delayed somewhat owing to the necessity of making inquiries as to the relative qualifications of officers. 2. The matter of preserving relative seniority will be considered on the merits of each case when filling the positions. NA SOLDIERS. no- . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN asked the in Minister representing the - Minister for the same Defence, upon noticeWill he inform the House when the promised proposals for superannuation for our soldiers will be submitted to Parliament for consideration?",23
68,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,"The proposal of the Government in regard to superannuation is for the Public Service generally,- and would include the Permanent Allied Military Forces. It is not possible yet as to fix a date for the introduction of the Bill, which is still under consideration by the Government. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",23
69,Mr MAKIN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"the Treasurer, that it be composed upon notice I. Whether the Government will definitely indicate their intentions concerning an increase in the amount of the invalid and old-age pension, in view of the improved financial position? 2. Will the .Government introduce during this, or early next, session an amendment the Invalid and Old-age Pension's Act to increase the earning allowance to pensioners, to make a further provision that 'pensions widows be not subject to any deduction for the list? ' earning rental 'values of the original homes of pensioners, of which such widows, owners, and who through enfeeblement are required to live with relatives or friends?",23
70,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,"The answers to the honourable member's questions as follow:1. This question of increasing the rate of invalid and old-age pensions has been sidered by the Government' on several Occa. sions, 'but as even a slight increase cause a heavy additional charge, upon revenue, it is not possible to make any increase - at the present time. The yearly pensions' ments now reach a total of nearly £5,500,000; .and, although the financial position is sound, it ' does not admit of additional expenditure being made, particularly in view of a pective falling off in the revenue. I is undoubted; Customs receipts are already declining very sharply. 2. For the same reasons as in No. 1, I am unable at the present time to reply affirmative. CUSTOMS TARIFF .",24
71,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Richmond-Minister Trade and Customs) [11.28] - I move That the' Resolution with respect of Customs be now recommitted for the further consideration of item 53 (Dried fruits), substrictly in order? item (A) ; item 105 (Piece-goods), sub-item (E) ; item 136 (Iron and steel), sub-item paragraph (1); item. 179 (Electrical and appliances), sub-item (D) ; and item 365 (Pianos and piano-players). The purpose of recommitting item 105 is to bring the duty on - velvets into line with the reduced duty on silk. On item 136 I propose to raise the gauge of wire, so that it will include smaller wire and exempt fencing wire from the ad valorem duty. The proposed amendment to 179 is consequential upon something the Committee did last night in confor nexion with X-rays apparatus. We deadd two"" items sire the Committee to reconsider the duties on pianos and piano-players.",24
72,Mr BLUNDELL,SUPERANNUATION OP,Adelaide) [11.30]. - - I wish to move That item 24 (Cigars) be added to motion. Amendment (by Mr GREGORY) posedThat item 171 (reapers and binders) item 334 (news print) be added.,24

74,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I could not, today; I are the do not know enough about the matter. - Mr BELL - Thes e machines are not . manufactured in Australia.",24
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,If they are not manuare factured in Australia they may be admitted free in any case.,24
76,Mr FRANCIS,SUPERANNUATION OP,"He n t y) [11.32] con- ""When item 300 (spokes) was before us would I handed some figures to the Minister the (Mr Greene), who said that if they were correct a duty of 5 per cent, was not suffipaycient to protect the industry. Further, when I rose to speak on that item,, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr . prosWatkins), who was in the chair, through think that some misunderstanding, put the item, and it was allowed to pass. Under the circumstances, I suggest that the item, in the and also item 116, parasols, be recommitted to give opportunity for further discussion. I move. That items 116 and 300 be added.' RECOMMITTAL . Mr MASSYGREENE - I rise to a point of for order. I wish to* know how we stand in regard to this motion, because it appears to me that we are opening up a very wide to Duties field. of debate. Is what is going on I have submitted a definite motion, are the .various sugges(E), tions . made to be added to my motion, machines or what is transpiring? So far as I understand the position, the only thing that can be done is-to amend the motion. Is that the position?",24
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP," The - Minister (Mr Greene) has proposed to recommit certain items; the numbers of which he has mentioned. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . item Blundell) proposes to add item 24 to which that motion, and the honourable member, Dampier (Mr Gregory) proposes to Several honourable members interjecting. .' ",24
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,"If honourable members are not inclined to obey the the Standing Orders, I shall have to take some other steps. It is usual, particuprolarly when the Speaker is asked for an explanation as to procedure, for honour and able members to listen to the explanation. It is quite competent for the honourable member for. Adelaide to move for the recommittal of a certain item., and it is quite competent for any other honourable member to move the addition cf others; it is then - within the province of the House to accept or reject the proposals.",24
79,Mr MATHEWS,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Melbourne Ports') [11.34] - I desire to give notice that I shall move for the recommittal of item 160, with a view to the increase of a duty on threshing machines.",25
80,Mr RILEY,SUPERANNUATION OP,South Sydney) [11.35]. - I give notice of my intention to move the recommittal of item 291 (timber).,25
81,Mr WEST,SUPERANNUATION OP,"East Sydney) [11.36] I should like to move that the whole Tariff be recommitted and the items considered seriatim. Mr MoGRATH (Ballarat) [11.37] I desire to give notice that I shall move to recommit item 320, in order to reconsider the duty imposed on films.",25
82,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"So that we may know where we are, can we not have each amendment proposed put to the House and voted on? Otherwise we shall be here for ever.",25
83,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I submit that this procedure is quite irregular. So far as I have always understood, the proper procedure on recommittal is that while each proposed addition is quite in Order, each must itself form the subject of a separate amendment and'be voted on before it is added to the Minister's list.",25
84,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,"That procedure will be. followed. The Minister has submitted a motion, and these various motions, of which notice is being given, are proposed as additions and will be put in their turn - I 'am prepared to amend my motion so.",25
85,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,I submit that no other proposed additions can be submitted u n t i l the Minister's motion is dealt with.,25
86,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,May not the Minister's motion have amendments moved to it ?,25
87,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,We cannot have a group of amendments added; each individual member must have his proposed addition decided by a specific vote of the House.,25
88,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,SUPERANNUATION OP,"It is my wish to propose that the item of pianos be omitted from the Minister's proposed, recommittals. Shall I have to move that separately ?",25
89,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,The honourable member will have to move an amendment to omit that item.,25
90,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,SUPERANNUATION OP,Shal l I need to move an amendment?,25
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I - have already intimated to the House that it is in order to propose any addition to. the motion of the. Minister. I intend to put thoseproposed additions to the House separately, and put the Minister's motion as ha has proposed it .",25
92,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,SUPERANNUATION OP,"- I am not yet quite clear. The Minister has proposed to recommit three or four items, one of which I wish to have omitted. Will the Minister's list be put seriatim, or shall I have to move the omission of the item ?.",25
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,"When that question comes before the House, the honourable member wilL^ be in order in moving the omission of any item.",25
94,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"If the Minister will place before the Committee only those items in regard to which there is some doubt, or some errors we can rectify, I shall be only too pleased to withdraw my amendment to permit of such items being dealt with. But if the Minister is going to contest the decision of the House as arrived at the other night in regard to pianos, I shall feel quite justified in asking for the recommittal of the items I mentioned.'",25
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,I shall agree not to raise the question of pianos at this time. Mr GREGORY;-Then I shall withdraw my notice of amendment for the time being.,25
96,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.41] -(B y leave). as to provide for the recommittal of item 53, dried fruits, according to a definite promise which I made to the Committee. There was some doubt about the item at the time which I could not clear up, and I promised to recommit it . The next item is 105,' sub-item E, piece goods, and it is simply an adjustment for departmental purposes, making the duty 5 per cent, lower, so as to bring it into line with another item. The next item I propose to include is 136, iron and steel, sub-item E , paragraph 1, and this represents an adjustment, which I promised to make. Then there is item 179, sub-item D, electrical machines and appliances. This is a consequential amendment, this result of something we did in Committee last night in connection with X-ray apparatus and induction coils. Induction coils were included with X-ray apparatus, and the 'object now is to make it quite clear that this item does not include them. If honourable members are satisfied with my motion as thus amended, I shall so limit it.",25
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,Do I understand the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) to withdraw his amendment ?,26
98,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Yes . Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",26
99,Mr MATHEWS,SUPERANNUATION OP,Do I understand that the discussion on which we 'are now apparently entering will prevent honourable members from giving further notice of motions to recommit items? . I desire to give notice of a further recommittal.,26
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,There can be no discussion.,26
101,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,West Sydney) [11.45] Am I to understand that this motion is for a recommital of the Tariff.,26
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,In respect of certain items.,26
103,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"To consider certain items which the Minister has mentioned? Do I understand that if an honourable member desires to have other items reconsidered, he must move an amendment to the motion of the Minister ? That is what I understand the position to be; otherwise we should.be precluded from debating the question in the ordinary way. I have an amendment of the Minister's motion which I desire to move, and I propose to do ""so before I sit down; but I do not wish to raise any question that will lead to the due protraction of the consideration of the Tariff. At the same time, it would be unfortunate if , by the procedure we are adopting, honourable members could only rise in their places to refer to certain items which must be put without debate.",26
104,Mr MCDONALD,SUPERANNUATION OP,Why not recommit the whole Tariff?,26
105,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,Why not? ',26
106,Mr MCDONALD,SUPERANNUATION OP,That shows the absurdity of the whole procedure.,26
107,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Exactly . We have a motion before us to reconsider certain items, and I understandthat every motion submitted to the House is subject to amendment - I would like to know the position. Will the amendments of which honourable members have given notice simply be put to the House without debate, or will the honourable member who moves an amendment have the right to submit reasons to show why any particular item should be recommitted? I contend that he can do so.",26
108,Mr MCDONALD,SUPERANNUATION OP,Then there will be no finality.,26
109,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"There will be finality when every honourable member who wishes to speak has done so; and a vote is taken. To test the matter, I wish to move That item' 291, sub-items (I) and (J) be added to the motion. These sub-items referred to are timber, sawn or dressed, imported for the use of box making.",26
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,"The honourable meinoer must not debate the merits of the duty he may propose to recommit. He may only give reasons why - the, item should be recommitted. Mr Ryan"" - I propose merely to relate the circumstances which I think justify the recommittal of the item. When the Tariff was before the Oommittee of Ways and Means the duty on timber in the rough was raised, but no corresponding increase was made in the duty on timber cut into sizes for box making, the result being that there is every inducement to have that timber sawn into sizes outside Australia. Unless a corresponding increase is made in the duty on this timber great injury will be done to the box-making industry, and a large number of men will be thrown out of employment.",26
111,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"When anhonorable member is moving for the recommittal of un- an. item, is* he permitted to discuss the merits of his proposed alteration to the duty?

Honourable members could hardly know what the various items proposed to be recommitted Tefer to without information upon them, or without hearing the reasons in the mindsof the honourable members who desire the recommittal.

He promised that he would recommit the duty on dried fruits, and the .other items which he proposes to recommit are to be amended simply for.the purpose of making re-adjustments, but now every honourable member wants to open up a new Tariff debate on a matter on which he has not been able to convince the Committee of Ways and Means. This is not playing the game. I appeal to the House to allow the Minister's motion to pass so that he may make these simple re-adjustments which raise no new principles, but at the same time enable the Minister to keep faith with the Committee of Ways and Means. Then le,t us finish ofi the Tariff. It is not fair at this stage to introduce new matters, or to re-open items already decided upon. No one wants a Tariff debate over again. In any case, there was an understanding that we would try to close this matter up. It will be absolutely impossible to do so if honourable members continue as they are doing this morning..",27

146,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Because he has not been afforded an opportunity to do so. He probably thought that he would be allowed later ""on to give his reasons for submitting the amendment. That is why I object to the procedure that has been adopted of simply allowing an honourable member to move an amendment providing for the recommittal of a particular item and not permitting him to state his reasons for doing so. I am prepared to remain here for a fortnight, if necessary, to deal with recommittals, rather than that any injustice should be done.

170,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I shall be very glad to hear the reasons that actuated the honourable .member in moving to have these particular items included in the motion for recommittal. I find that item II 6 refers to parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas, while item 300 refers to woodware for vehicles. But how can we give an intelligent vote on this or any other amendment unless we are permited to debate it? If we are to be called upon to vote without any debate whatever, we shall be voting in the dark.",30
171,Sir ROBERT BEST,SUPERANNUATION OP,We have spent six weeks in discussing the Tariff.,30
172,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Havin g regard to the large number of items included in the schedule, the discussion has been very short, and the Minister (Mr Greene) should not be impatient of a little further discussion in order to clear up in this Chamber what he may not be able to clear up in the Senate. We have no guarantee that the items covered by the amendment, if not recommitted here, will receive any consideration in another place. We have no undertaking from the Minister that he will ask his representative there to take up any particular attitude in regard to them. If , in respect of each amendment, he would state what attitude his representative in the Senate is likely to take up, it might'lead to a speedier decision of the question here. I do not desire to delay the House, but I hope we shall deal with each amendment on its merits. It might take a few days to discuss all the items proposed to be recommitted, but, at all events, their discussion would not take very-long.",30
173,Sir ROBERT BEST,SUPERANNUATION OP,Why not move to recommit the whole schedule?,30

175,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Dampier) [12.14]:I have taken a very keen interest in the debates on the Tariff, and, save in respect of anomalies that have occurred, and which, as the Minister has said, should be rectified here, I am quite content. I took strong exception to the proposed re-opening of the-piano duties when they had been settled after a long discussion in Committee, feeling that if they Were to be reconsidered I would be justified in asking for the reconsideration of other duties of importance to those whom I represent. If members are going to propose item after item for reconsideration, merely because they were dissatisfied with the decisions of the Committee on those items, we* shall find ourselves committed to the reconsideration of the entire schedule. I ask the Minister not to permit that.",30
176,Mr MCGRATH,SUPERANNUATION OP,Ballarat) [12.17] - What is in the mind .of the honourable member for Henty in asking for these recommittals ?,30
177,Mr FRANCIS,SUPERANNUATION OP,"The Minister told me that, if I could show that my figures were correct, he. would give me a higher duty.",30
178,Mr MCGRATH,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Then the honourable member should be permitted to give reasons for asking for the recommittal of the items. The recommittal of about twenty items has been proposed, and they should be disposed of in Committee of Ways and Means in a couple of hours. The Minister and his officials cannot know the effect of every duty, and members who have other information should be permitted to bring it before the Committee, so that anomalies may be rectified. So far as parasols are concerned, I object to an increase of the duty; but the schedule should not be sent to another place until we have made it as perfect as possible. If a member is not allowed to give reasons for moving for the recommittal of an item, the parliamentary institution becomes a farce. No member can vote honestly on a proposal for recommittal without knowing why it was moved.",30

180,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION OP,"No . Mr ANSTEY'(Bourke) [12.20] - I do not know what reasons actuated the honourable member for Henty in moving for the recommittal of certain items, though they may be supposed to be obvious. It seems to be thought unnecessary for a member to be informed on these questions. Therefore, I can only say that, in my opinion, the items should be recommitted for the reasons which have not been allowed to be stated, and which, therefore, I do not know. Incidentally I should like to give notice that I propose to take certain action.",30

As the Minister has a majority in this Chamber, he can do what he likes; but if he will give an assurance that he will give serious consideration to the items which have been made the subject of amendments to his motion for recommittal and, if necessary, have them dealt with in another place, that should be satisfactory to honourable members.",32

It should further be borne in mind the orchardist has tb wait'eight to ten years before his .trees reach d full y productive The above costs are based on a daily wage 12s. for casual labour. As you are no doubt aware, large areas of prune orchards have planted for returned soldiers. In view of that estimate of £46 per ton, a duty of 6d. is not unreasonable, particugrowers larly in view bf what we have already done in regard to bananas and modities.

223,Mr CUNNINGHAM,SUPERANNUATION OP,"The amendment only asks for fair treatment of those who have put their money into these orchards; and here I may say that I do not observe any general desire on the part of honourable members who have city in terests to rush into avenues of industry in the country. This is not a mere matter of enabling a man to earn sufficient to live on, but one of insuring him a return on the money he invests. We have to remember that many returned soldiers are being settled in this industry, and°it is only just that they should be given adequate protection. It was not u n t i l the f r u it growers got their associations to act that they were able to make any headway at all, and I think the prune-growers have put forward a good case for an increased duty. The figures presented today show that it costs at least 5d. per l b . to prepare the f r u it for the market, and when American prunes can be landed here at 6d. a l b . , what chance has the local'grower V The orchardist on the' Murray, has to send his f r u it , to Sydney, or to some of, the other great cities, and I dare'say ' that it costs just as much for carriage in Australia as ' it does from California.

I have gone carefully into the whole matter since it was first raised in .the Committee,' and am sorry that I do not feel justified in the circumstances in recommending a higher duty than that of 4£d - per lb., which I have proposed. I ask the Committee to accept that duty. Mr HILL . (Echuca) [2.16] -^1 regret that the Minister (Mr Greene) cannot [Quorum see his way to accept the amendment of the amendment moved 'by, the honourable  Moloney). We have been working on this matter for a considerable time, with a .view to securing something like reasonable protection for our fruit-growers* I have here some correspondence on the subject, which I think puts the position of the fruit-grower better than I could hope to do. Mr J. M . Sinclair, president of the Bamawm District Fruit-growers Co-operative Association, under date 29th June last, has written to me as follows:Dear Sir - At the last meeting of the Bamawm District Fruit-growers. Co-operative Association, a motion was carried that the Minister for Customs* be asked to place a duty of 6d. per lb. on. imported prunes. The position is exactly and correctly stated in the at-' tached press extract. During 'the. past two years, returned soldiers engaging in fruit growing have, both; in Victoria and New South. Wales, planted large.areas of prune trees. Victorian nurserymen sold out all their prune, trees last season.' . Ofl& nurseryman informed me that 20,000-trees-were sold for'planting lastseason. ' This season, with Californian prunes beingdumped on the Australian market, Victorian growers are finding a difficulty-in finding a. market for their, prunes at payableprices. The prune-grower is entitled to protection, in - the same degree as the currantgrower .until the industry is more thoroughly' established. Wetrustthat you, with the Country representatives, will take action;' while the Tariff is being considered,, in the. direction of having-a duty of 6d' - per lb. placed , - o.n imported prunes. The newspaper extract refered to is from the P r in t World of 1st ultimo, and is as follows-:- -' DRIED AND CANNED FBUIT NOTES, IMPORTATION OF PRUNES. Urging' an Increase of the Duty to 6d. per lb. % A 'well-known prune-grower writes:f "" The position is this; that each year, before' the. new season's prunes come ih in America, they (.the .Americans) endeavour to export' , their carry-over of prunes,, and, needless to.sayj. they' cut prices to niake sales. "" When they are making their efforts to clear up stocks at the reduced prices, our prunes are just ready to Be put on our markets, and we have to meet the cut prices quoted by Americans. "" As you know, their new season's prunes come in August-September. Well, in 1920, their opening prices, which are maintained for the full season in America, were, for prunes going 80-90 to the 1 lb., 8d. c.i.f. Sydney, and today their price for same grade prune is 4d. c.i.f. "" Although they will maintain their opening price throughout the year for their, home market, they reduce their price by 50 per cent, for the Australian market. "" To verify my figures, apply to Brown and Dureau for c.i.f. price prunes 80-90 for August last and c.i.f. prices for same prunes today. ""The fact of the price dropping to such an extent, and it being well known amongst merchants that California is likely to have a big carry-over, makes it hard to sell Australian prunes at anything like a fair price, because merchants expect America to force sales by further reduction as their new season approaches, so as not to have any carry-over'. ""New South Wales growers are very much concerned, and feel that' if they are not properly protected they will not be able to stand the competition. "" They are not financially .strong, and are not able to hold their fruit until after the American price cutting is over, therefore have to realise just when the competition is keenest with Americans forcing sales. "" The Coastal Farmers Co-operative Company, who sell most of the New South Wales produced prunes, we believe, are very much concerned about this matter, and are, I believe, approaching the Minister for Trade and Customs. If the duty is raised to 6d. per lb., growers would guarantee not to' take full advantage of duty and, would 'sell below the American landed prices. "" The Australian production 'has,- we believe, just about overtaken the demand.' "" We carried over from last season 20 tons prunes, and all merchants carried over stocks from last year, the shortage of sugar having restricted the sale of dried fruits last winter. "" We are today offering our prunes, which are better and fresher than Californians, at 8*d. per lb., delivered in stores Sydney or Newcastle, but whenever we quote the Americans undercut."" That, then, is the position. The Americans can land their fruit in the stores, Sydney, duty paid, .at from 6d, to 6£d. per lb. I have in my electorate a large number of fruit-growers-probably larger number than is to be. found in any Blundell, R. P. other Federal division in this Quite a number of them. are soldiers, who have planted large with prunes. Some of the older areas are Hill, W. C.' now coming into medium or full and, to use a colloquialism, the owners of Mahony, W. G. these areas are ""up against it."" Mr Bill. Shepparton Co-operative Fruit. Preserving Company, the shareholders in which are largely returned men, who are struggling financially, has still on hand large quantities of ordinary fruits, together with a fairly large quantity of prunes, for which they Cannot obtain a market. The Americans are dumping prunes here at exceedingly low prices, and are getting the trade. No matter what price our growers quote, the Americansundercut them.",34
227,Mr BAMFORD,SUPERANNUATION OP,In that case an additional duty would not help them.,35
228,Mr HILL,SUPERANNUATION OP,Yes ; it would keep out these imports. The price at which Californian prunes are being sold here would return the Californian grower only | d . per lb. for his green fruit. Even with black labour that would not be a payable proposition.,35
229,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,"If it is a clear case of dumping, the Anti-Dumping Bill will deal with it .",35
230,Mr HILL,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I do not care how it is dealt with as long as our local growers are properly^ protected. I hope the Minister will agree to increase the duty to 6d. per lb.

231,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 2 . 3 0 ] - I propose to amend sub-item E of this item, because it is very difficult to discriminate between some of the materials that are included in sub-item D, and others that are included in sub-item E, and the Department thinks it better, therefore, to apply the same rates of duty to both. For this reason I move That the item be further amended by adding the following words to sub-item (E) (general Tariff) :- "" And on and after Oth July, 1921, 20 per cent."" Amendment agreed to. Sub-item, as further amended, agreed to. Item 136 (as amended)And on and after 9lh June, 1921(E) (1) Wire of No. 14 or finer gauge, ad val., British, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 per cent.; general, 35 per cent.",36
232,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.35] - I promised the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) that if it were found that certain classes of fencing wire were included i h paragraph E , as amended, I would recommit the item. As this does occur, I move That the item be further amended by adding to sub-item (E) 1, the following words:""And on and after Oth July, 1921, Wire of No. 16 or finer gauge, ad val., Britisli, 25 per cent.; intermediate, 30 'per cent.; general, 35 per cent.""",36
233,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Dampier) [ 2 . 3 6 ] - I thank the Minister for having proposed this alteration. When the item was originally amended, honourable members could not know what the effect of the amendment would be, but the new rates had hardly been put into force before it was found that a good deal of 14-gauge wire is used for fencing, and that the duty levied on it amounted to no less than £18 per ton. I ask the Minister if he will agree to lower rates than 25 per cent, and 35 per cent; on wire of finer gauge, which is used by the farmer for the trussing of straw and for many other purposes, and by makers of cages and other manufacturers. Wir e imported for the manufacture of barbed wire and netting is exempt, but many other manufacturers import wire as their raw material, and, probably, as the rates stand, the duty on the finer gauges runs to £20 or £25 per ton. I have, here an article written by Mr . Brownlie, one of the big Labour leaders of Great Britain , who made an inquiry into the economic and labour conditions of America. It is dated 21st May last, and contains the statement that the average wage of the steel worker in the. United States of America is 3s. l d . per hour, while that of the British worker is about Is. 8d. per hour. I do not think that our workers are better paid, on the average, than those of England. Surely! therefore, our manufacturers do not need a protective duty of 35 per cent, in addition to the natural protection which they enjoy by reason of the heavy freight charges on transport of wire from abroad. I do not like the ad valorem rates, but the Minister has pointed out that the length of wire contained in a ton increases with the fineness of the gauge, and that, therefore, specific rates would be unfair. While file American firms have wonderf u l plants, I think that with the up-to-date plants such as the Broken Hill Company and subsidiary companies use duties as high as those proposed are unnecessary.",36
234,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 2 . 4 0 ] - I shall look into the matter, and if it is thought that the duties are unnecessarily high, I shall ask for a request for alteration in the Senate.",36

Ordered: That Mr Greene and Sir Joseph Cook do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolutions. Bill presented by Mr MASSYGREENE, and read a first time. "" Mr MASSYGREENE (Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [2.42] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time.. Clauses 1 to 8 and 14 are the ordinary provisions for giving legislative effect to the Tariff schedule, and clauses 9, 10, and 11 deal with the application of the preferential and intermediate Tariff rates. Clause 9 provides for the application of the British preferential Tariff, wholly or in part, to any part of the British Dominions, and for the application of the intermediate Tariff, wholly or in part, to any part of the British Dominions or to any foreign country. Negotiations may be undertaken and arrangements entered into tentatively for the' application of the British .preferential' or the intermediate Tariff rates either in* whole or in part to any part of the British Empire, and in regard to foreign countries power is given to negotiate on the basis of the intermediate and general rates. In regard to foreign countries, British preferential rates cannot be conceded; the negotiations must be on the basis of the intermediate Tariff or the general Tariff. The Bill further provides that after the Minister has negotiated with a British Dominion or a foreign country, as the case may be, and before he brings the proposal to Parliament for ratification he must obtain a report from the Tariff Board. ""We are endeavouring to insure that. Parliament shall have at its disposal a complete re1 port by an independent body on the proposals which the Minister is submitting. Presumably the Minister will bring up with his proposal to Parliament the report of the Tariff Board. We do not lay a definite obligation upon him to do so, but Parliament can ask for the report, and no doubt will obtain it .",36
236,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,Why not make it mandatory for the Minister to produce the report to Parliament?,37
237,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I do not see any necessity to go as far as that. We make it mandatory upon the Minister to get the report, and no doubt Parliament will take all sorts of care that it has an opportunity of studying it. The only other provision of any moment is that which provides for the application of deferred duties. It will be noticed that if the Minister gets from the Tariff Board a certificate that goods are not being manufactured in this country in sufficient or of satisfactory volume^ he may defer from time to time the operation of the deferred duties. I have repeatedly traversed this ground in the course of. the debate on the Tariff, and I think members are generally familiar with the provisions of the Bill.",37
238,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"Dampier) [2.48] Does the Minister propose to pass this Bill this afternoon? If so; why? Unless there is a special reason for theimmediate passage of the measure I think it might well be arranged to consider it simultaneously with the Bills relating to the Tariff Board and dumping. Moreover, I have a great objection to passing legislation which honourable members have not had an opportunity of perusing, let alone understanding. This Bill refers extensively to the Tariff Board, but the House may not agree to the appointment of that body.",37
239,Mr GREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,The only reason why we want to get the Bill passed this afternoon is that until it is passed the schedule cannot be sent to another place.,37
240,Sir JOSEPH COOK,SUPERANNUATION OP,There is no debatable matter in this Bill which cannot be debated on the measures which are to be considered later.,37

243,Mr GREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"If another place has agreed to the Tariff before the Tariff Board Bill is disposed of we can introduce another Bill to amend this measure. But as the Senate is not likely to dispose of this Bill before we have come to a decision in regard to the Board, our decision can be expressed by an amendment in another place.",37
244,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,If we do not agree to the creation of a Tariff Board the references to it in this Bill will be rendered nugatory.,37
245,Mr GREGORY,SUPERANNUATION OP,"I accept that' explanation ; but I always like to have an opportunity' of reading, a Bill. ' This measure includes new provisions relating to Britishpreference.

246,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPERANNUATION OP,"The Minister cannot 1 vary the rates of duty imposed. Mr GREGORY.^-But, of course, the Minister can refuse reciprocity without consulting the House.

247,Mr RYAN,SUPERANNUATION OP,"West Sydney) [2.52] I was allowing this Bill to pass without debate, because I understand that the Minister desires it to be' agreed to today so that the Tariff might be sent to the Senate. I apprehend that the reference in this Bill.to the .Tariff Board,, although such a.body has not yet been created, would be rendered nugatory if this House subsequently, decided not to. pass the Tariff Board Bill.

Then, because of alleged misdemeanors committed after the war, deductions have made from the amount of gratuities is a due to certain returned men. When the is men complain, they are referred to a section of the Act which in no way does When the Minister (Mr Eodgers) .is present next week . shall join with the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) in supplying further information in regard to these and other matters. Mr irVTUGSTOH (Barker) [3.16] - This morning I addressed a question without notice to the Acting Prime Miuister (Sir Joseph Cook) regarding the delay that had taken place in making payment for a property near Parkes, New South Wales, whioh had been purchased any by the New South Wales Government for repatriation purposes. The property, I.find, was sold for cask on ,11thApril, 1920, at a reduced price. The clearing Bale.,,of stockon the property. took place' on 2nd June, 1920, and: the returned soldiers, settled upon it. took possession, of their land on the following day. The Minister's' approval was given on 5th November, 1920. Although the,vendors sold at, a reduced price , on the understanding that it . was - to be; a cash transaction, they .have had to stand out of their money, for over fourteen months. During that time they have been allowed. oni*' 4.$. per cent, on the money owing. That,. I thnak, is very unfair. Two widows are interested in this property, as well as boys who went to the war. I hope that the. Acting Prime Minister willtake the matter, in hand and Bee that payment is. made,without further delay, since;I am sure , that it is neither his wish nor-that of Parliament that Commonwealth money, received by the New.South Wales, G<o> vernment for soldier settlement purposes' should be withheldfrom, those who have sold their land legitimately for repatriation purposes. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.19 p.m.",40
