The reasons for fixing the Excise duty at the lower rate have been given upon two or three occasions, and honourable members, by a large majority, have supported the recommendations of the Tariff Commission in this Unfortunately, the division which place in the Senate showed a majority of more than two to one in favour of imposing the increased rate, and it would appear to be hopeless to expect that decision to be reversed. It is not necessary to reand peat the arguments that have been used Excise Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.;] with regard to the expensiveness of the materials which have to be used in the tillation of the spirits used for making blended whisky, as compared with those utilized in the manufacture of other spirits. I move That the Senate's requested amendment leaving out "" II "" and inserting "" 1 2 "" be agreed",16
30,Mr TOSEPH COOK,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Parramatta) This [3.56] - I shall support the motion, because I think that the amendment will make the whole scale of Excise duties more symand metrical than before.",17
31,Mr DEAKIN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,The Tariff Commission took the contrary view.,17
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"In view of the composition of blended whisky, I do. not know how the Tariff Commission could orable come to any other conclusion. We proposed to charge an Excise duty of 11s. per gallon upon blended whisky containing 25 per inferior cent, of pure barley malt whisky dutiable at ios., and of 75 per cent, of spirit n.e.i., most which, under ordinary circumstances, would be subject to an Excise duty of 13s. per gallon. Averaging the duties over the two classes of spirits contained in blended whisky, the Excise duty would amount to about 12s. 3d. per gallon, which would proximately be the amount fixed by the Senate.",17
33,Mr KENNEDY,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"The blended whiskv must be composed entirely of grain spirit, apprehension. namely, of pure malt and other grain spirit.",17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Any kind of grain, except barley malt, might be used in the manufacture of spirits n.e.i.",17
35,Mr KENNEDY,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Grai n spirit is much more expensive than that made from mothe lasses or other cheap material, and that is Tariff why the distinction was made in regard the Excise duty.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Yes ; but the whisky blenders would be required to use only 25 per cent, of pure barley malt spirit. Therefore, the Excise duty would, as have stated, average out at 12s. 3d. per gallon upon the blended article.",17
37,Mr GLYNN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"But the distillers would oppositionTariff not have to pay 13s. per gallon upon the 75 per cent, of n.e.i. grain spirit beforehand.",17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"No, there would be no actual payment; but I contend that an Excise duty of 12s. per gallon upon blended whisky would make the whole scheme more harmonious and symmetrical. (Spirits) Bill. - There is another point which ought to weigh diswith us, namely, that if the Excise duty were retained at 11s. we should lose many thousands of pounds of revenue annually. I do not think that we ought to needlessly sacrifice revenue. The difference between the 12s. Excise duty and the 14s. per galto. lon levied upon the imported article would afford the local distillers ample protection. consideration no doubt weighed with the Senate, and I am glad that it did so. I think that the Bill has been improved, I shall therefore support the motion.",17
39,Mr MAHON,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Coolgardie) [3.58] - The decision of the Government to concede the request of the Senate is regrettable, because I believe that the majority of honsenators voted for the increased Excise duty under the impression that blended whisky is composed for the greater part of spirit. As a matter of fact, blended grain whisky is the commodity which is acceptable to the public taste. According to the information which we had before us, and which honourable members accepted, pure malt spirit by itself would not be consumed by the public. It seems rather curious that the Government should abandon the recommendation of the Tariff apCommission, which was twice adopted by this House without a division, and at this stage ask us to yield to the opinion of the other Chamber, arrived, at under a mis",17
40,Mr GLYNN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"And in a taxation matter, too.",17
41,Mr MAHON,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Exactly. Honourable senators were under the mistaken impression that they were acting in the interests of revenue. All the inquiries made by the Commission tended to show that the revenue would not be benefited by the into crease of the Excise duty to 12s., but that, on the other hand, the higher duty would probably lead to an increase in the importations. I believe that if proper representations were made the decision arI rived at by the Senate would be reversed.",17
42,Mr MAUGER,DATE OF THEGENERA L,The members of the Commission in the Senate voted into their own report.,17
43,Mr MAHON,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Yes ; there has been the most extraordinary change of front on the part of some senators who are members of the Tariff Commission. I suppose that under the circumstances there is nothing O do but submit, but I feel inclined to move an amendment, which I think would probably, be accepted, namely, that the Excise duty should be us. 6d. per gallon.",17
44,Mr KENNEDY,DATE OF THEGENERA L,Moira) [4.3] - I cannot understand the action of the Government in giving way in this matter.,18
45,Mr DEAKIN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"-The Senate decided by a majority of more than, two to one to press their request-w e have not altered our opinion.",18
46,Mr KENNEDY,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Judgin g from the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission, and the facts disclosed in the course of the discussion in this Chamber, the increased duty will preclude the possibility of manufacturing whisky of a marketable character ip Australia. It is provided that blended whisky must be made purely of grain spirit, of which 25 per cent, must be distilled from barley malt, and it will be impossible for the local distillers to manufacture such a blended article under an Excise duty of 12s. per gallon, and successfully compete with imported whisky. The Tariff Commission were unanimous in recommending an Excise duty of us. per gallon on blended whisky, and the members of that body in this Chamber stood Iovallv by that decision. As far as I can see, the Australian distillers will occupy practically the same position that they did under the old Tariff, and will not be able to place upon the market a popular blended whiskv.",18
47,Mr DEAKI N,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.5] - We are proposing that .the request should be acceded to, because of the stage of the session which we have now reached, and also for the reason that the decision of the Senate was of such a decisive character. The matter, however, cannot rest where it is. and an alteration will have to be made when the Tariff is revised during next session. Motion agreed to. Reported that the Committee had modified two requested amendments, and had made the third. Report adopted. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",18
48,Mr CROUCH,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Corio) [4.7I-Las dav, upon the motion for adjournment, I referred to the difficultv which members of the Roval Australian Artillery at Queenscliff experienced in qualifying themselves amendment. for positions in the police force. I stated that seventeen men had not been given permission to attend a recent examination. The forthwith. Minister representing the Minister of Defence promised to make inquiries, and today he has laid on the table papers which contain a statement by Major B ruche, D.A.A.G., directly contradicting my assertion. Major Bruche saysNo soldiers have been refused permission to attend the examination recently held for appointment to the police force. I am now in a position to support the statement. I made by quoting a District Order, issued at Queenscliff on the 24th September, 1906, and which reads as follows:I . Public Service - R.D.O. , Part II . , No. 45, of 18th April, 1906, is hereby amended as follows :In future applications from N.C.O.'s ancl gunners to present themselves for examination for employment in the public service, police, & c , will , if of good character, be recommended if applicant has three years' service in the R.A.A.

H . Cox TAYLOR, Captain R.A.A., Staff Captain and Adjutant. It appears from this that, unless a man can show that he has three years' service to his credit he is not to be'permitted to present himself for examination.",18
49,Mr GB EDWARDS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Where is the personal explanation, so far as the honourable and learned member is concerned ?",18
50,Mr CROUCH,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"The Minister has laid on the table a statement to the effect that the assertion I made last Friday, was incorrect.",18
51,Mr GB EDWARDS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,But that does not affect the honourable and learned member.,18
52,Mr CROUCH,DATE OF THEGENERA L,I wish it to be placed on record that the statement made by Major Bruche is incorrect- a very serious position for any officer to take up in regard to this House - and that my assertion is supported by an official document. I hope that the Minister will make further inquiries into the matter.,18
53,Mr EWING,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"There is no objection to t Frimaking further inquiries. PATENTS BILL. Bill returned from Senate with an Ordered That the Senate's Message be considered In Committee: Senate's Amendment - After clause 3, add new clause :"" 4 . No application shall be revived under this Act if the Commissioner is satisfied that the invention is already patented in Australia, or that another application for the same 'invention has been lodged and will be unfairly prejudiced.""",18
54,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Indi-Attorney-General ) [4.10] - The Senate has made an amendment in this Bill which I am going to ask the Committee to accept. As it left the Chamber the Bill provided that in certain cases under section 29 of the Patents Act 1903, and in other cases where an error, or omission, on the part of the officers of the Patent Office had occurred, /certain - steps might be taken to revive an application. The Senate has agreed to those provisions, but has added a new clause providing thatNo' application shall be revived underthis Act if the Commissioner is satisfied that the invention is already patented in Australia, or that another application for the same invention has been lodged and will be unfairly prejudiced.",19
55,Mr KELLY,DATE OF THEGENERA L,What is the meaning of the reviving of an application?,19
56,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"An application may have lapsed by reason of the omission to do some act or to take a step within a prescribed time. This Bill provides that in certain cases under section 29 the language of which is ambiguous, and may have misled the people, lapsed applications may be revived where there has been an error or omission on the part of some officer of the Patent Office. The intention of the Bill is to prevent the public suffering from an official mistake, and the amendment made by the Senate provides a sort of safeguard. I do not think that there is any harm in it, ancl I therefore move That the amendment be agreed to. - Mr FOWLER (Perth) [4.13] - Whil e I entirely agree with the improvements which this measure is designed to effect in the patent law, I think that a rather unfortunate omission has been made. The Minister admits that there has been great difficulty in construing various alterations in the patent legislation of Australia, and he has provided in this Bill that applications which have lapsed owing to mistakes on the part of the Patent Office, may be revived. If Government officers, notwithstanding the facilities at their disposal, have made mistakes in interpreting the principal Act, and also the regulations, surely it is not unreasonable to assumethat mistakes may also have been made by outside persons. As a matter of fact, owing, to the confusion that exists, mistakes similar in kind and degree to thosethat have arisen in the. office itself, have been made by persons outside the Department, and yet no attempt has been made to remedy these. If it be right to .make good the claims of an inventor, who has suffered by-an error on the part of the Patent Office, surely it is alsoreasonable, as a matter of equity, that any one who has suffered by reason of the action; of his attorney should have his application righted in the same way.",19
57,Mr CROUCH,DATE OF THEGENERA L,O r who has suffered by his own act or failure to act.,19
58,Mr FOWLER,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"That is another case. If an inventor has thought fit to make personal application for a patent, and has made a mistake similar to anv of those made in the Patent Office, there is no remedy for him under this Bill. I propose, if I am in order, to remedy thisobvious defect.",19
59,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"This House determined a few days ago not to do that which the honourable member proposes, and the Senate last night rejected by an overwhelming majority a similar proposition.",19
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"We could not do what the honourable member proposes, since we are confined to a consideration of the Senate's amendment.",19
61,Mr FOWLER,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"I ask you, Mr Chairman, whether you can accept the following: amendmentProvided also that the error or omission having occurred wholly or in part through inadvertence of the applicant shall be no bar to an application made by him, when, in the opinion of the Commissioner, it is not shown that any other person will be detrimentallv affected.",19
62,Mr CROUCH,DATE OF THEGENERA L,That would be a limitation of the proviso inserted by another place. - Mr FOWLER - I wish! to know whether the proposed amendment of the amendment is in order. I believe that it is.,19
63,Mr GLYNN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Aneas) [4.16J - I recognise that there will be great ""difficulty in insertinrr such an amendment, unless it be attached to that made by the Senate. I understand that the Attorney-General is prepared to accept the amendment made by another place!",19
64,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Yes , but I could not cept the amendment of the amendment as suggested by the honourable member for Perth. - Mr Glynn - The virtue of the - amendment made by another place will deblack-mailing. pend upon the administration. I cannot see how the Minister can accept the ment made by another place, and at the .same time carry that proposed by the orable member for Perth. The only course - open, to us is either to amend the amendbe ment of the Senate or to reject it.",20
65,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Indi-Attorney-General ) {4.18] - There are several reasons why would ask the honourable member for not to press his proposal. In the first place, I would submit that it is out - order, since it is not relevant to the amendas it stands? ment made by another place. It is an absolutely new provision, and I doubt - much whether, even if. it were carried, a proviso to the new clause, effective. It would simply be a proviso to the effect that an applicant should not be disentitled to do certain things, but at the same time there would be nothing in the Bill to entitle him to do those things. The provision would therefore be nugatory. I would point out that if it is proposed put it as a substantive amendment, it must be out of order, since it is irrelevant the amendment made by the Senate. pointed out to the Committee a few days ago that it is one thing to say that the public shall not suffer from any mistake made by the Patent Office or its representanot tives, and quite a different thing to say that where an individual has through any mistake of his own, given the public rights, and his invention-i vention-ha s passed into public use, that the Parliament should step in and remedy his mistake. Companies mav have been formed, and businesses enteredlrito, in sequence of an invention having passed into public use,- and if there is to crop of litigation all over Australia determine who has any right to an invenof tion-to decide who is prejudiced and is not-w e shall have such a state of fusion that no one, not even inventors, know where they are. It was for this son that the House determined the other evening not to take the course proposed the honourable member for Perth, Senate last night, by a majoritv of something like sixteen to nine, arrived at similar decision. I have no hesitation in any. acrepeating what I said last week, that I should not proceed with the Bill if it were amended as the honourable member proposes. It would throw the patent law into a state of confusion, and might lead to",20
66,Mr FOWLER,DATE OF THEGENERA L,Le t us make the proviamendsion operative for only six months.,20
67,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"We might do more dahonmage in six months than' we could remedy in six years. If the suggested amendment agreed to, I shall not feel justified in proceeding further with the Bill. I tell the Committee absolutely that it would lead I to much danger to the public, and might Perth interfere with public rights.",20
68,Mr FOWLER,DATE OF THEGENERA L,Does not the same arguof ment apply to the provisions of the Bill,20
69,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Not in the same degree. very We have some idea of the cases to which as it applies, and know that they are of a it would be very limited class. proposal Mr FOWLER - And those to which my would apply are also limited.",20
70,Mr ISAACS,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"The honourable member will recollect that when we introduced this Bill it simply contained two clauses. It to was only as the result of extreme pressure that I consented to clause 3, in its limited to form, being inserted. I declined to go I any further. The honourable member now asks me to take a step further, and I say frankly that if the clause were amended as the honourable member proposes I should proceed with the Bill. On all grounds, first of all on the point of relevancy, and, secondly, on the merits of the proposal itself, I would ask the honourable member not f it be an into press his amendment.",20
71,Mr GLYNN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"Angas) [4.22] - I do not think there is very much merit in the position taken up by the Attorney-General. The conoriginal suggestion that the ""Bill should apply to applicants who had made mistakes be a as well as to those who had been misled, to or had suffered by the omission of'error the officers of the Department, was a who good one. It is natural that at a time of contransition mistakes should be made by apwill plicants, and I cannot imagine that, simply reabecause certain applications have lapsed, huge businesses have been started. I unby derstand that only a few cases are covered and the by the proposed amendment Mr ISAACS^ - I asked for some particua lars the other night, but have not obtained 3 Patents Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] «",20
72,Mr GLYNN,DATE OF THEGENERA L,"I have none to give; but I have heard the statement made that only a few cases-and cases of extreme hardship^-woul d be affected by this measure if it provided that all applications that have lapsed, either through the fault of the Patent Office or because of mistakes on the part of the applicants themselves, might be revived within a prescribed time. do not know that the honourable member for Perth might not succeed in securing the insertion of his proposal.

I understand that the revival of an application under the Bill can take place only where, owing to an error on the part of the Patent Office, certain proceedings in taking out a patent have lapsed. As I read the. last part of the clause, an application which has been irregular through no fault of the applicant, but solely by reason of an error or omission on the part of the patent officer, cannot be revived if a third person who has recognised the error or omission is unscriiDulous enough to pirate the invention, and, after the lapse of the first application, immediatelv registers another in the proper form.",22

Mr '-DEAKIN (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.46] - The amendments of the Senate embody in the form of law recommendations which it was the intention of the Government to follow. A Royal Commission appointed by the Queensland Government made elaborate inquiries into the circumstances of the Kanakas, and a series of recommendations. A parliamentary paper, which has been printed, contains a communication from the Premier upon the subject, and my reply, to the effect that we would adopt the recommendationsof the Commission, except with""' regard to two causes of exemption, as to which we indicated our intention to make inquiries in each individual case - The Senate has considered it advisable to in Australia prior to the first day corporate in the Bill the grounds of exof September, One thousand emption recommended by the Commission. eight hundred and seventy- Sub-paragraphs 1., 11., v., and v i . nine ; or of the new paragraph a practically emage, or is suffering from such body recommendations a, b, e, and / of the bodily infirmity as to be unable Commissioners, sub-clauses in. and i v . to obtain a livelihood if re- varying recommendations c and d, by conturned to his native island; or fining ""the exemption to labourers married before the 9th October of this year.",22
101,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"What is the definition of "" Pacific Island ""?",24
102,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"rf bourer '' is defined in the original Act. A definition of Pacific Island is not needed. The Commissioners also recommended exemptions in the case of labourers, whose offspring has been educated in State schools, or who are the holders of unexpired leases to whom compensation has not been paid. We did not accept those recommendations, but expressed our willingness to consider them in. respect to individual cases. There are a few instances in which the children of Pacific Island labourers^ having been educated in State schools, have become, in a sense, members of our community, and it would be a hardship to separate such children from their parents, or to send them back with their parents to conditions of .life of which they have had no experience. I move That the Senate's amendment substituting a new paragraph for paragraph (a) be agreed to, and that the following words be inserted after the word "" s i x "" in the last line, "" o r whose name the Minister directs to be included in a list to be laid before both Houses of Parliament."" These words will appear, not as an additional paragraph, but as a general conclusion to this portion of the clause. provision will enable us, if any cases - i special hardship are brought under our notice, to lay a list before Parliament of the names of the persons affecied, giving reasons in each case for issuing a general certificate. I take no exception to the conditions embodied in the Bill, because thley are similar to those we have already indicated as necessary. But under the Senate proposals we should be deprived of the power to consider instances in which the circumstances are exceptional, and which appear to call for the issue of a certificate. I therefore propose that the Minister shall have power to issue certificates in! special cases to Pacific Islanders whose names are to be included in a list to be presented to both Houses. This will give us the necessary measure of elasticity. Instead of absolutely tying the hands of the Minister, we should give him power to act subject to the control of Parliament.",24
103,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Corio) [4-5 ]-- 6 like to know whether sub-paragraph i v . refers only to male Kanakas? When and a number of other honourable members were recently in Rockhampton, a case was brought under our notice in which a white man was married to a Kanaka woman, and Pacific Island la- had a large family.",24

111,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"If my amendment is agreed to, I shall have exactly the same power as was previously proposed.",24
112,Mr MAHON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I think the Bill, as originally introduced, was preferable to the The measure in its present form. I wish to know whether the provision made in subparagraph vi. does not cover the cases provided for in sub-paragraph 1.",24
113,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Sub-paragrap h (»') was inserted merely with a view to put the position clearly. The Queensland law compels us to exempt Kanakas who were introduced into Australia prior to the ist day of September, 1879.",24
114,Mr MAHON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Would not those cases be covered by sub-paragraph vi., which provides for the exemption of Kanakas who have been continuously resident in Australia for a period of not less than twentv years.?",24
115,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,No . The Queensland law givesthe Kanakas provided for in subparagraph (?) a legal right to remain in that State.,24
116,Mr MAHON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,I presume that very few Kanakas who came here prior to 1879 have not been continuously resident in Queens1 s h o u l d land for twenty years.,24

119,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Yes .,25
120,Mr MAHON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"A question may be raised as to whether a tribal marriage would not come within the meaning of the provision. I think that we should insert the term "" l e g all y "" before the word ""mai riaee.""",25
121,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,1 think that the term as it stands is sufficient. Marriage means legally married. If Kanakas are not legally married they are not married.,25

I should like to know, what would be done if it were discovered eighteen months or two years after the general deportation of Kanakas had been) completed that a certain islander had obtained his certificate by false and fraudulent representation? Would the Government send him back by special steamer or ship, or would they provide for his punishment? It appears to me that our troubles in connection with these Kanakas will never cease. We passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act under the impression that we could clear out the whole lot from Australia, but owing to the exemptions now proposed, it is quite possible that any number up to about r.ooo may remain in Australia. I think that we should be informed as to what would happen in a case such as I have' suggested. The punishment proposed to be inflicted upon any person aiding, or abetting a Kanaka in uutaining a certificate, namely, a fine or £ 5 0 , or uiree montns' imprisonment, or both, would not be sufficient. At the outside we could not recover more than £ 5 0 , and the cost of sending an islander Pack to his native home might exceed that amount ",25
127,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,I think that we could send back an individual Kanaka tor £ 7 or £ l ios.,25
128,Mr MAHON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"If that is so, we ought not to be called upon to pay £ 5 10s. each for sending back the large number who are about to be deported. 1 think that the expense would very much exceed the amount mentioned by the Prime Minister, particularly if the man belonged to one of the remote islands rarely visited by trading vessels.",25
129,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"'Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [5.5] - The honourable member is quite entitled to ask for information. I consulted Mr Brennan, who has been in charge of the Pacific Islanders in Queensland for many years, upon this very point. It was thought well to make some provision against deceit, but Mr Brennan states that under the system hitherto adopted in Queensland the entries are so complete that they can very easily bowl out any islander who may be attempting to practice deceit upon the authorities. He says that it is only upon very rare occasions that an islander can tell a consistently untrue story for any length of time under the system of examination adopted by those accustomed to deal with them. The Kanakas are simple-minded, and if they are not telling the truth are easily led into committing themselves. Cases of successf u l deceit are practically unknown. Mr. Brennan does not' anticipate any trouble. The list of exemptions appears very formidable, but the number of islanders affected by the provisions other than those in subparagraphs 1. and v . will be very small in number. I would point out that very few women have accompanied the Kanakas to Australia, and that only 2 or' 3 per cent, of them are married. The race is a disappearing one, because very few of the natives have any families, or are likely to have any. It is confidently anticipated that in the course of a few vears they will almost disappear. Amendments adding new sub-clause 4 to clause 2', and new clause 3 agreed to. .

131,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [S-n]--In connection with first request made by the Senate, a very BILL. important and unexpected development has occurred. The effect of the amendment requested by another place would be to postpone until August next the operation of the provision as to the employment of British ships manned exclusively by white seamen. That is an amendment which I should have been happy to accept, as affording, at all events, an opportunity to another Parliament to further consider this phase of the question. But since Saturday last, I have become acquainted with certain facts which will render it necessary for me to propose in this connection a more serious amendmentI have received a cablegram to the effect that the Board of Trade, in examining these proposals, has discovered that the discrimination that we propose in favour of British ships is forbidden by a number of treaties, several of which are binding on some, if not all, of the Australian Colonies which assented to them prior to Federation. Those reciprocal concessions cover such countries as Honduras, Morocco, Egypt, Austro-Hungary, Paraguay, and Greece, and include covenants of a mutual character providing that the ships of neither nation shall receive an advantage when trading in the waters of these countries.",26
132,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,I think there is a reference to thatmatter in the Merchant Shipping Act.,26
133,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The Customs 'Department did not furnish me with any record of the particulars of these treaties, if it had them. There is also the difficulty that in a number of cases they are drawn in general terms, and apply or may apply in a way determined by the British Government. No circumstances have hitherto arisen in Australia rendering it necessary that we should make ourselves acquainted with the terms of these treaties.",26
134,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Do they apply under our Constitution Act?,26
135,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Some of the Australian States actually entered into these agreements, which are still binding upon them.",26
136,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Does this objection apply only to the amendment inserted on the motion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the preference shall extend only to British goods brought out in ships manned exclusively by white seamen?,26
137,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"J . regret to say that it applies to my own proposal that the preference shall be granted only to British goods brought out in British ships. The granting cf a preference to British goods is clearly within the terms of the agreements, but we are directly forbidden to discriminate between British ships and those of quite a number of nations, with whom we have entered into various commercial treaties.",27
138,Mr MAUGER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,What is the currency of those treaties?,27
139,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Some will soon expire, and others are for longer periods. We have not full particulars of all of them. The index has been made up to 1895, and since then a number of treaties have been made. There is a network of obligations which will have to be considered before it is possible for us to discriminate in favour »f British shipping. That being so, convinced as I am of the wisdom of the proposal we originally submitted, I am now forced to ask the Committee to agree to an amendment.",27
140,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Coul d we not pass this scheme of preference as a superior treaty, and allow it to be applied so far as it can be?",27
141,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"No ; the treaties are so numerous that it would be almost impossible to discriminate between them. These questions, as I said when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie submitted his amendment, must be considered at the Navigation Conference which is to meet next year. They are matters to be dealt with in a Navigation Bill. The effect of this discovery will be that the Navigation Conference will undoubtedly have brought before it the operation of these treaties upon any such proposal as we may desire to make in respect to any particular part of the Empire. In the meantime, the only course open to us is to remove from the schedule the whole of the provision relating to British shipping. I therefore move That the request be disagreed to, but that the schedule be amended by omitting from the first sub-heading to the column headed ""Duties"" the words "" and imported direct in British ships manned exclusively by white seamen,"" and by omitting from the second sub-heading to the column headed "" D u t i e s "" the words "" o imported direct in British ships."" The result of this will be that we shall simply discriminate in favour of British' goods, without regard to the vessels by which they may arrive. We shall adopt this. course for reasons which honourable members will see are entirely beyond my control. Mr. JOSEPH CO'OK (Parramatta) [5.20] - I am glad that the Prime Minister has adopted this course.",27
142,Mr MAUGER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,He cannot help himself.,27
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Apparentl y not, otherwise, judging by what he has said, he would not have submitted this proposal.",27
144,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Hear , hear.",27
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I am unable to subscribe to the wisdom of a stipulation as to the employment of white British crews in connection with such a Bill as this. It occurs to me that the provision, which happily has been amended in another Chamber, instead of fostering British seamen and assisting the trade of the Empire, would have had the opposite result. I am unable to appreciate the statement of the Prime Minister that such a step would have been characterized by wisdom. 1, for one, am glad that the Board of Trade, or, in other words,, the Imperial Government, hascalled our attention to the false position in which we have placed ourselves, and hasbrought us back to reason. It seems, after all, that it was necessary for the Imperial"" Government to save the dignity, of the Australian Parliament, and, through us. the dignity of the Australian nation. Had the provision as to British shipping been carried info effect, it would have been a blow to the sentiment of Empire. The whole preference proposed to be given is; so small that no shipping company would find it worthwhile troubling about seeking to comply with the conditions we sought to impose. We provided that as to 2 per cent, of our trade with Great Britain a preference should be granted conditionally on the re-arrangement of the manning of British vessels to carry this small percentage of goods to Australia. Obviously, from a commercial point of view, there is nothing in such a provision that would warrant the re-arranging of the crews. It would pay the owners better, commercially speaking, to retain their present crews and suffer the disability consequent upon the increased r not duties. The range covered is so small as not to make it worthwhile for shipping companies to re-arrange the crews of thaivessels to enable them to cater for the trade on the conditions laid down. By the carrying out of the provision in question, we should have invited the British, who, we are told, cannot man their ships with their own labour, to discharge their coloured labour and take on foreign labour in its place. No increase in the employment of British seamen would Save been secured. If we could have insured such an increase, it would have been worth for, but I understand that 50 per cent, of the men on British boats today are foreigners. It is true that they are white foreigners, but are we, for the sake of 2 per cent, of our trade, to say to Great Britain, "" You must remove coloured crews from your vessels, and put on foreign - seamen."" I could have understood the insertion of this provision if we had made it imperative that Great Britain should employ only British seamen on these vessels. There would have been some sense in that, al-. though I am told that such a provision could not be carried out. But since the Bill , as passed by us, would have had the result of giving employment to more foreign labour on British vessels, it would not have - contributed anything to the cause of Empire. It would have meant training on our vessels an increased number of German, French, or Russian sailors, who in time of war would step from these vessels into those of their own country, and fight against us.",27
146,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Lord Brassey says that that is what we are doing now.,28
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I think that we are doing so to some extent; but that is because Britons will not take to the sea as they used to do. The better condition of things keeps them ashore. The provision under discussion would aggravate instead of improve the present state of things. No - one desires that the number of foreigners on British ships shall increase. The problem how to deal with our mercantile marine is one which, in mv judgment, will have to be faced by the Imperial authorities sooner or later.",28
148,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,The sooner the better.,28
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I think that it - should be faced very soon. Personally, I should not be averse to paying a prettystiff price to increase the proportion of British seamen in our mercantile marine, if only for the better defence of the Empire. It is because I feel that the provision would have hindered the bringing about of an improvement that I am glad that the Board of Trade has taken action. We need not trouble about what the reasons were. The great point is that we have been prevented from making a mistake.",28
150,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,We have been prevented from doing what ought to be done in the interests of white workers.,28
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The right thing to do is to increase the proportion of Brifighting tish seamen in our mercantile marine. The provision which we are considering would not have done that, but would have resulted in an increase in the number of foreigners employed on British ships. If the object was to secure a larger proportion of British seamen on British ships carrying British goods the subject of a preference, a different course should have been taken. I hope that on the next occasion when we try to pass legislation of this kind, we shall do it by a definite and specific proposal, not by negative proposals. I am glad that the amendment is to be made, because I believe that the provision as it came from the Senate would, if adopted, do .more harm than good, without achieving the end in view, at the same time laying us open to charges of inconsistency and of want of consideration for the Empire and its obligations. I do not believe that honourable members wish to disregard our obligations or those of the Empire; but they 'were so anxious to do something in a tentative and partial wav that they did not wait to ascertain the full effects of their proposal. It is best not to pass legislation in this form unless we can be sure of securing our ends - the increasing of the number of British seamen in the British mercantile marine.",28
152,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Angas) [5.30] - I regard the provision that the importations in respect to which a preference is given must come here in British ships as most short sighted, and inimical to British interests. As was plainlv pointed out by an English Royal Commission which reported on the matter a few years ago, the best way to encourage the manning of British 'ships by Britishers is to offer better wages than are now Daid. It is because the wages on British ships are higher than those paid on foreign ships that foreigners are so ready to enter the British mercantile niarine; but these wages are not as good as, during the last twenty or thirty years, Britishers have been able to secure on land. Therefore, notwithstanding the strong desire of many youths to go to sea, there are not proportionately as many Britishers offering as seamen as there were previously. The London Times, in its new zeal for protection, beginning with preferences, a few vears ago appointed a Commissioner to inquire into the effect which the policy originally proposed by the Government would have upon British trade. pointing out that more than half of the carrying trade of the world is done by British ships, he had to admit thatSo important a change as that of a system preference may involve gravest dangers .to British shipping. He went on to say thatA change in the British fiscal policy lines of Mr Chamberlain's proposals would be a great and growing benefit tQ about 32 per cent, of British shipping, would injure 47 per cent., and would have little or no effect upon 14 per cent. This leaves out of account possible retaliation by other Governments the form of. tonnage dues. A memorandum on the subject prepared by the Board of Trade was published August, 1903, in a Blue Book' numbered 1761. That memorandum is, no doubt, ties? familiar to all who have looked closely into the question of Imperial preferential trade. be discussed. It shows that British vessels constitute 91 per cent, of the shipping with cargoes 76 per cent, of the shipping in ballast between the United Kingdom and the colonies and possessions. In the coasting trade of tion. the United Kingdom 99 per cent., and of the colonies 96 per cent, of the tonnage with cargoes is British. These figures show that not much is to be gained by requiring that the imports in regard to which a preference is given must be in British ships, since in the proper way. nearly the whole of our imports now come in British ships, even though part of them may have come originally from foreign State. ports. When the matter was originally under discussion, I pointed out that, unless there is a change of date, several vessels - among them an Italian vessel-now ing British goods from Great Britain would of treatiesbe prejudicially affected. In 1900, of the total tonnage employed in the foreign trade of Germany 26.9 per cent., of France 40.6 per cent, of Belgium 44.6 per cent., of Holland 41.7 per cent, and of the United States 55.8 .per cent, was British. wonder, therefore, that the Times adof mitted that the influence of the preferential system was exaggerated. Inasmuch as Brimembers. tish vessels in some instances carry the bulk, and in nearly every case almost half of the foreign trade of other countries, the British mercantile marine affords an admirable target for retaliation such as the pro- Mr Glynn. vision now in the schedule might provoke, without benefiting to any appreciable extent the trade and commerce of the mother country. Therefore I am glad that an opportunity has been afforded by the request of After the Senate to reconsider the whole position.",28
153,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Corio) [ 5 . 3 7 ] - I feel that the Prime Minister would not have taken the step which we are considering of had he not felt it his duty to do so; but I should like to know what pressure was put on the members of the British Board of Trade from this end to induce them to send on the a cablegram to the Government.,29

Egypt, Morocco, Honduras, and other places have been mentioned being affected by these treaties.

Are we to up our right to legislate as we think proper merely for the sake of , £ 3 6 ? No doubt we should regard our treaty obligations; but we might very well pass the Bill as alter the whole schedule. k stands, giving the preference to British ships, and exempting Egyptian imports, the claim were made that the treaty Egypt overrides our legislation.

Let us provide for a preference to British shipping, and when a case arising under a treaty comes before us, recognise our obligations, if any. I do not like to suggest that possibly the Government are less anxious to secure preference to British ships, because of the possible complications which the white labour provision create. If , in spile of that provision, they are desirous of adhering to the important policy of giving preference to British ships, I counsel them to accept the Senate's request, and to deal with special cases as they arise, in accordance with the principles of international law.",30
174,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I rise to a point of order. The Prime Minister has moved to leave out f so of the heading all the words after the words ""United Kingdom,"" and thus to the whole effect of the schedule. The House has already affirmed the principle that preference shall be granted only in respect to goods imported direct in British ships, and the Senate has agreed to that proposal, only requesting that the proviso cut which this House had added, that the solely of white sailors, should not come into operation until a certain date, which I submit that now we can deal only with the Senate's Conrequest, and such amendments as are reledid vant to it. The Prime Minister's amendgoes far beyond the Senate's request, and strikes at the root of a policy adopted to by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Therefore, I ask your ruling, as Mr Chairman, as to whether we are not acconfined to the consideration of the Senrequest, and whether the amendment we of the Prime Minister is in order.",30
175,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"A little consideration will give show that the power of dealing with requested amendments undoubtedly covers an amendment like this.

180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"-He , in conjunction in. order. with the Prime Minister, is supposed to protect us in regard to all external affairs. Our Standing Orders assume that, when we have amended the latter portion of a vision, we have in effect affirmed the part of it and cannot go back.

181,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"If it were possible for us to go beyond the amendment made by the Senate, that Chamber could follow a similar course in regard to any amendsorry ment made by us, and our proceedings would be interminable. We can only deal with the amendments submitted by the Preference) Bill. Senate. We could not possibly strike out words which both this House and the other Chamber have already deliberately accepted. I am opposed to the provision as it stands in the Bill, but as it has been accepted both by this House and the Senate I do not see that it is open to us to make any amendment prior to that effected by the Senate.",31
182,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I think that the deputy leader of the Opposition has taken I up a correct attitude. You, sir, have ruled time after time that it was impossible for us to go back beyond the point in a They clause where an amendment had been made. The same rule would apply in case.

186,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I do not wish to do that. Mr TUDOR fYarra} \6.o-} - I am very that the Prime Minister has moved his amendment. The honourable member for Parramatta has stated that the provision, in its original form, would have the effect of benefiting the foreigner instead of British sailors. I do not share that opinion. When we endeavoured to make provision that ships carrying goods entitled to preference should be manned by white British seamen, neither the honourable member for Parramatta, nor any of his associates in th© Opposition, helped us in any way. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - I was not here.",31
187,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"So much the worse for the honourable member-h e should have been here. It appears to me that if the Prime Minister's proposal be agreed to, the whole of the advantage conferred by the agreement will be derived by British manufacturers, and that British ship-owners and white British seamen will not receive any consideration. We should never! have heard of the present amendment if it had not been for the success which attended the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. There would have been no cables despatched, and we should not have heard of the treaties entered into with Honduras, Egypt, or Morocco. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that we should adopt the provision as it is, and permit it to operate so far as it will do so.",32
188,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"How can it operate in regard to British ships ? Seeing that the Imperial Government are bound by the treaties into which they have entered, they could not allow it to operate in regard to British ships.",32
189,Mr TUDOR,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Then the whole agreement would lapse, and I am not sure that that would not be a good thing. I am not greatly taken with the agreement, and I regard the time spent in its discussion as having been very largely wasted. I shall call for a division against the amendment, because I consider that once both Houses have agreed to. a particular proposal, it should be adhered to.",32
190,Mr KNOX,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Kooyong) [6.3] - It seems extraordinary that any point of order should have been taken in regard to this matter when we are all anxious that the preferential proposals shall have some good effect. the provision passed by this House had been adopted by the other Chamber, we should have occupied an absolutely ridiculous position, and I am gratified to know that the amendment was made.",32
191,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Lang) [6.6] - I think that the Committee will be wise if it adopts the amendment proposed by the Prime Minister. As the Chairman has ruled it in order, we have to remember that the schedule does not provide that the ships carrying preference goods shall be manned by British seamen, but by white seamen. Therefore, instead of operating to the advantage of British sailors, the provision would tend to confer benefit upon foreign seamen. That was not the intention of the Committee. It is well known that British vessels are manned very largely by foreign seamen, principally Germans, because it is found that not more than 52 per cent, of seamen required for the British mercantile marine are available for such service. If the schedule were adopted in its present form, it would practically provide for a subsidy to German seamen, and the British mercantile marine would be used for the purpose of training men who would be withdrawn in time of war to man vessels belonging to the German Navy.",32
192,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Wentworth) [6.8] - This Chamber and the Senate have endorsed the principle that British goods shall not be entitled to a preference unless they are imported direct in British ships manned exclusively by white sailors. In the first place, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie sought to insert a provision that the ships carrying British preference goods should be manned exclusively by white British seamen. That proposal was rejected by twenty-seven votes to eight. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney then proposed that 80 per cent, of the crews of the ships referred to should be white British seamen. The House would not entertain that proposal, and the honourable and learned member withdrew it. At page 3521 of Hansard he is reported to have said:I am afraid that there is little chance of the amendment being carried, and while I feel very strongly in regard to it , yet as the proposed preference affects only 2 per cent, of the imports of Great Britain, it is not likely to have any considerable effect, while ineffective legislation tends to bring Parliament into contempt. Therefore, although I shall not withdraw it , I shall not press it to a division. If The honourable member for Kalgoorlie then moved that the ships should be manned exclusively by white seamen-no t white Bri tish seamen-fro m which it appears that this House is more anxious about white foreigners that white Britishers ! His speech occupies only a few lines of Hansard. No member of the Government replied to his observations, and a division took place in a thin House of thirty-four, resulting in the proposal being carried by a majority of one.",32
193,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"When was that division, taken ?",33
194,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,After dinner on 25th September.,33
195,Mr HARPER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,And the Government voted against it.,33
196,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Quite so; also the Opposition. The leader of the Opposition pointed out that there was only a small number of honourable members present, and suggested that the Government might ask the House to reconsider the matter. He pressed the Prime Minister three times, to take this step, but without avail. When the Bill went to the Senate the Government endeavoured to have the provision excised, but without success. The Prime himself now proposes, to omit it, and something more. He has taken this on his own initiative, but upon that of a body in no wise responsible to the people of Australia.",33
197,Mr HARPER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Does the honourable member wish the provision to be retained ?,33
198,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"No ; I am merely pointrejected. ing out the absurd position into which are drifting. The Government have mitted that it has been ignorant of our treaty obligations, and we have to wait for the (Board of Trade, 10,000 miles away, to point out the facts and save the dignity of Australia. While congratulating Australia upon having the Board of Trade United Kingdom. to remind her of her treaty obligations,, I congratulate the country on the step that puted. has been taken, but not on the means it has been found necessary to adopt to have this provision rescinded.",33
199,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Moira) [6.13] - The discussion which has taken place on this question is another illustration pf the that the Opposition are always ready to avail themselves of an opportunity to seek to discredit the Government.

I fail to see why we should take anything for.granted in this way. I have received information which I have not vet had an opportunity to verify, to the effect that a certain quantity of strawboard is manufactured in the United Kingdom, but that there are no imports from that country into Australia; because it is said, that the freights on such goods from Germany to Australia are infinitely cheaper than are those from England to Australia, and that this absolutely prohibits British competition. If this be true, it shows that the proposed preference be of no benefit to the British manufacturers. To make it effective, we should grant a very substantial reduction of the duty in favour of the British strawboard, or remove the impost altogether. I understand that a certain quantity of strawboard of good quality is manufactured in Victoria, .and that the industry here is thriving under the existing duty. Honourable members whose fiscal views differ from say my own, often urge as a reason for and increasing a duty that increased protection of leads to improved local production. my unsubstantiated information to the effect that locally-made strawboard is of actually better quality than that which is imported, and that therefore, from the protectionist point of view, no further duty is required.

262,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Angas) [10.12] - I think that we made a great mistake when we not insist upon these provisions being r stored to their original form. We deliberately agreed that the maximum strength at which pure malt whisky should be distilled should not exceed 45 per cent, over proof. That suggestion was made by some honourable senators who are now objecting to the compromise proposed by the Prime Minister, under which the maximum strength would sir, may be be fixed at 40 degrees over proof. We understood the Prime Minister to say that one of the senators who had originally taken objection to the provision for the higher alcoholic strength had written a letter stating that he had acted under a misapprehension, and that if this House insisted upon the maximum being increased to 45 per cent., support .would be given not for to the position taken up by us,. Now, however, the Senate have rejected the proposed compromise. If the Senate are going to quibble about their rights, we ought to take up a firm attitude. The maximum strength of 45 degrees over proof was decided upon after due deliberation, and after the most elaborate evidence had been taken by the I am merely Tariff Commission. It may be all very fine in the-closing hours of the session to accept amendments in order to avoid any fuss or trouble, and so that we may have opportunities for making longer speeches to our constituents. But I would point out that in this matter the Senate are imposing their will upon us in a matter of taxation, and that the Government should have adhered to their original proposal. I previously mentioned that some weeks ago a wine expert wrote to me stating that the provision in the Distillation Act that wine should not contain more than 35 per cent, of alcohol was operating detrimentally to the production of wine for export. He represented that if wine were kept for four or five vears it reached a strength of 37 or 38 per cent, of alcohol, and was then by-law unsaleable. I do not know whether the deputv leader of the Opposition would care to take action in the direction, of insisting upon the adoption of the original provision in the Bill , but my feeling is that that course should be followed.",37
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Parramatta) [10.15] - I am afraid that we cannot insist upon anvthing in this Chamber, because we have become merely passive resisters. All that the Senate has to do in the closing hours of the session is to insist upon anvthing that it pleases, and its will did must be done. That appears to be the e - attitude assumed by the Government, and the sooner that this House closes the better. We are rapid] v becoming a mere registering machine for the decisions of the Senate.

They state that they were informed by Messrs. BrothersThat most of the grape wine brandy and malt .whisky now in stock at the Federal Distillery at Port Melbourne has been distilled at a strength from 30 under proof to 40 over proof. Mr A. R. Read, of South Australia, was of opinion that the average run of a still a compromise? engaged in the production of brandy should not exceed 35 degrees over proof.",39
290,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,What about whisky?,40
291,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I am dealing now with brandy, but the same conditions apply to whisky distilled from malt. Mr E. P. Clarke, according (o the report, said-The very best brandy, in his opinion, averaged about iS degrees over proof. He considered that brandy was an article made from the pure juice of the grape and pure wine, and that it should not be over 40 degrees over proof. blending purposes he would not think of ing a brandy exceeding 30 degrees over proof. It is also stated in the report thatThe Senior Inspector of Excise, Queensland (Mr W. E. Burrell), being asked whether would recommend that there should standard strength up to which brandv, rum, and whisky should be rectified, in order to maintain their natural ethers, said he favoured establishment of a standard of strength. suggested that 35 per cent, over proof would be a good standard for brandy. That would rectify the spirit, ancl allow the natural ethers and flavours to be retained. In paragraph 16 of their conclusions Commission point outThat brandy and whisky distilled at holic strength not exceeding 35 degrees proof, shouicl in the scheme of Excise duties, ceive a distinct advantage over spirits distilled at a higher strength. In paragraph 18' they point outThat no spirit shouicl be recognised as a blended brandy unless it contains at per cent, of grape wine spirit, the product of a separate distillation, at a low alcoholic strength. That is the point to which I desire to direct the attention of the House.",40
292,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Is this why the Governinundated ment originally proposed that spirit should be fortified up to 45 per cent. ?,40
293,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I honestly thought at the time that some mistake had occurred, and it may be that those who in another place contend that the alcoholic strength - should be only 35 per cent, are perfectly justified. I am not going to quarrel with another place as to its right to exercise independent judgment. 1 honestly believe that it has taken up the right attitude. The Joshua Commission point out that the same conditions apply to blended brandy, and that a spirit made from malt for pure or blended whiskv should not be distilled at a higher strength than 35 per cent.",40
294,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Why did not the honourable member point out these facts when the Prime Minister asked us to agree to accept,40
295,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The honourable member might as well put the same question to other honourable members. I do not profess to know everything, nor am I so obstinate that when I find that I have made a mistake I am not prepared to admit it .

That is a course which it is entitled to take, though at this stage of the measure and of the not a desirable one.

There is an evident desire to , feat this measure in some form, or by device, so as to get rid of the proposed British preference, and advantage has taken of the fact that we have unwittingly included in the Bill a desirable provision forbidden by engagements which we overlooked. I therefore move That the Bill be returned to the Senate a message informing it that the House presentatives has thought fit, at the present of the Bill, lo make the requested and desires to inform the Senate that, in its opinion, the amendment previously made was clearlv a mollification of the amendments requested. We join issue with them on their interpretation of the requirements of the Constitution, and re-assert in express terms that which we had by implication asserted by our previous action. The effect will be an adoption of the provision requested by the Senate, extending the time for the coming into operation of that part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie until the end of August next. This, as I said yesterday, is an improvement. Although it does not remove the provision which - I originally objected to, it postpones its operation long enough to allow of its reconsideration in the next Parliament. Although I now invite the House to make the requested amendment, I do not think, it is possible for us to stop there. We have received a clear intimation from the Board of Trade that there are treaty obligations which require to be taken into account. There is not the least doubt that if the provision as to British ships be allowed to remain in the schedule, even as the Senate wish it to be amended, and without our amendment, the fate of the Bill would be imperilled. should be wanting in our duty to ourselves and to the people if we allowed it to pass in an imperfect state. While, therefore, assenting to the Senate's proposal for the time being, I intend to ask the House to take advantage of the powers which it possesses to make the amendment [221] . in another form. We proposed yesterday to strike out all the words in the provision which after the words ""Unite d Kingdom,"" so necesthat we could grant a preference in of respect to British goods, no matter what views vessels were employed to bring them That amendment was The designed to meet the treaty obligations to of which I have referred. By making the Senate's amendment, the condition in redegard to British ships will remain, with the some further condition that only white seamen are to be employed after a. certain date been next year. I therefore propose to submit, when the proper time arrives, an amendment which will have the effect which we had desired to accomplish yesterday by our amendment of the amendment requested with by the Senate-that is to say, I shall proof Repose the removal of all jthe words after stage the words "" United Kingdom "" from the amendment, column headings to the schedule.",41
304,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Does the honourable and learned gentleman suggest the introduction of a. new Bill?,42
305,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Not necessarily. That course may be adopted if we have to sit next week in order to push this business through, though I am anxious to avoid it . The first step I propose is to take advantage of the constitutional provision allowing us to advise the Governor General to recommend the alteration by message. Under the circumstances, we are clearly entitled to take that step-. The maintenance of , treaty obligations is clearlv obligatory upon us all. I shall ask that his message be sent to both Houses, and shall move its adoption. This is the shortest and most expeditious means wherebv we can attain our end. If its failure can be conceived there remain other means, though I shall regret the continuous prolongation of our sittings and the postponemnt of the elections which they might involve. There need be no mistake as to the issue. The proposal of some of our opponents is fo defeat the Bill , and it sha.ll not be defeated, so far as the Government can prevent it. We Mr TOSEPH COOK - This is disgusting party clap-trap.",42
306,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The epithets used by the honourable member describe his speeches on this nuestion. Those who are opposing preference must come out into the light of day and do so. If they can obtain the support of the majority, they are, of course, entitled to succeed.",42
307,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,The whole business is a sham:,43
308,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"We intend to make evident who is responsible for the fate of the Bill . No step will be wanting, and no resource left untried, to give effect to this measure, which was introduced as an instalment of preference to British trade. It asserts a principle which will be adopted on a far larger scale, and in more thorough fashion, after there has been an opportunity to consult, early next year, the statesmen of the mother country and of the rest of the Empire. In the meantime, I submit this answer to the message from the Senate.",43
309,Mr MCLEAN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,What will be the ultimate effect of the course which the honourable and! learned gentleman proposes? In what form will the Bil l finally leave us?,43
310,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Precisel y in the form in which we desired yesterday fo pass it.,43
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,That wil l not the effect of what the honourable and learned gentleman is proposing to do now.,43
312,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Not by this amendment alone. <,",43
313,Mr MCLEAN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,But I understand that the Prime Minister intends that that shall be the ultimate effect of his action.,43
314,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I not only intend, but undertake, to do what I have suggested.",43
315,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The honourable and learned gentleman said the same about the compromise yesterday. - Mr DEAKIN - My proposal yesterday would have accomplished the same end. We asked then for all that we desired, and for all that we now seek, and we are determined to obtain it, if it be in our power to do so.",43
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Parramatta) [1.0.43] - Wit h the desire of the Prime Minister to return the Bill to the Senate in the form in which he thinks it should pass, I have the greatest sympathy, but for the means which he proposes to adopt to secure his end I have the greatest contempt. Whatever we mav do in a legitimate way to achieve our object and our party purposes, we have no right to drag the Governor-Generaj into our politics as the honourable gentleman proposes. The honourable and learned gentleman has no right to suggest this way - out of the troubles which he has got himself into bysheer political ineptitude and inability to see his measures properly through the two Giambers. Now, in the dying hours of a dying Parliament, he wishes to call the Governor General to fas a i d ; to drag him into the mire of party politics in order, as he clearly expresses it , to defeat some machinations which he - says are working against the measure. Has it come to thisthat the Governor General is to be brought into defeat those who are opposed to a party measure? To make such a proposal is to descend to a depth to which no member of this Parliament or of any State Parliament has ever previously descended in order to realise purely party aims. Yet it is the cool and deliberate proposal of the Prime Minister, which I presume he has been sleeping over, to use the Governor General to further his partu ends, and to defeat those whom he alleges are opposed to the granting of preference to British trade. If anything could prove the need for the dissolution of this House at the earliest opportunitv,t it is the desperate shifts, resorts, and devices to which the be Prime Minister is descending- His proposal degrades this House, its politics, and its conduct of business, and, if adopted, will make us the laughing stock of those whom he seeks to propitiate by this trumpery means. I use the word ""trumpery"" because the Bill affects only 2 per cent, of our imports from Great Britain. For the sake of this 2 per cent, the Prime Minister wishes to set aside the authority of Parliament. Why does he resort to these courses ? Simply to obtain a placard with which he can go to the country. There is nothing in the measure to make any one proud of it . The honourable ""and learned gentleman has described it , in his euphemistic language, as an instalment; we, on this side, call it a miserable apology for preference, introduced so that it mav be used for political party, ends. The Prime Minister and his supporters have a right to use the resources of their brains in attempting to defeat those whom they think are against their proposals.",43
317,Mr RONALD,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Who m they know to be against them.,43
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"If the honourable member wishes, I will say, "" Whom they know to be againstJhem."" But we have no right to inquire Into the motives of the members of another place. Honor. able senators have done what we declined to do. They have obeyed the rules of Parliament clearly laid down in the Standing Orders. Last night we ienored and set aside those rules, although the members of the Opposition tried to have them observed and obeyed. The amendment of the Government covered entirely new ground, no matter what its intention may have been, and in the interpretation of our Standing Orders, no regard should have been had to their effect upon matters of policy. They must be applied as methods of procedure, irrespective of their effect in regard to the policy of measures under consideration, which it is the duty of the Government to look after as best they may. ""What would have been the result if the Senate had acted differently? There could then be no finality in regard to any Bill . provisions of the Standing Orders clearly prohibit the introduction of new matter in any measure as to which this House is in conference with the other ; and we are practically in a form of conference when messages are passing to and f r o between us. The Government deliberately introduced new matter, and the Senate, I conceive, was entirely within its rights in asserting that its, and incidentally our, Standing Orders should be' - obeyed. The Government, owing, in the first place, to ignorance of our treaty relations with other parts of the world, and, in the next place, to the ineptitude which has characterized their conduct of business, now find themselves in a difficulty. In order to save this apology for preference, which makes no substantial concession to the United Kingdom, and to make good their placard for electioneering purposes, Ministers are trying to drag the Governor General into the political arena. hope, by this means, to influence another Chamber. It may be that they have the technical right to do so, but the Prime Minister is deliberately creating the necessity for the Governor General to"" step in. He is placing His Excellencv in an entirely false position, by making him the instrument of political parties in this House, and asking him to helD him out of the hole into which he has fallen, owing to his own political ineptitude and his ignorance of our treatv obligations.",43
319,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,The honourable member does not even know the Constitution.,44
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,I know that it is the very spirit of the Constitution that the Governor General should be kept far and away above all partu politics.,44
321,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,So he is. [221]- 2,44
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"He will not be in this particular case. He is to be invited to plunge himself into the vortex of party politics, in order to help the Government out of a hole.",44
323,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,To no greater extent than he does in connection with every message that he sends down to the House.,44
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The position is quite different in this case. Had the Government proceeded with this measure in the ordinary way, and worked within the limits of the Standing Orders, this trouble would never have arisen. If the Prime Minister wants to get out of the hole into The which he has fallen, let him withdraw the Bill , and introduce another. If we are to meet next week, in order to deal with this matter, we should proceed in a regular parliamentary way, and no attempt should be made to drag the Governor General into our party political arena, for the purpose of influencing this Chamber, or the other. That is the one thing that the Constitution is intended to preserve us from, and the Prime Minister will be straining both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution if he adopts the course that he is now proposing.",44
325,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Indi) [10.53] - Wit h all respect to the honourable member for Parramatta, I contend that he is absolutely mistaken. According to his reading - of the Constitution, the Governor General is empowered to advise an alteration in a Bill of his own personal will, apart altogether from the lines of responsible government. I would point out, however, that the ConThev stitution says that the Governor General may make recommendations, and it naturally follows that he would take that course upon the advice of his responsible Ministers. The whole working of the Constitution depends upon the exercise of the functions of . responsible government, and the representative of the Crown does not exert his Dersonal will in the matter at all. He m we have the very strongest case we can possiblv have.",44
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Does the AttornevGeneral say that the Governor General mav not. without the advice of his Ministers', interfere in connection with treatv obligations ?",44

333,Mr MCDONALD,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,They had no right to discuss our procedure.,45
334,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I do not wish to deal with that point, because we now have a larger question to consider.",45
335,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,We made a mistake - ther e is no doubt about that.,45
336,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"In my opinion, we made no mistake. However, I do not desire to quarrel over mere technicalities. Prime Minister has adopted a course which would overcome all technical difficulties. It is our desire to grapple with the substance. Tn order that this question, which is of Imperial as well as of Australian importance, may be settled, we desire to remove from our path any mere obstacles of procedure. We have in our possession the knowledge that this Chamber, without divergence of opinion, desires the law to'be adopted in the form in which it was sent up to the Senate, but a difficulty has arisen in regard to a question of procedure.",45
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Unfortunately , this is not merely a matter of procedure. The Prime Minister told us that the predesiring sent course was being adopted to defeat some party ends.",45
338,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Sectio n 58 of the Conment. stitution enables technical difficulties of kind to be overcome-it is intended for purpose. It provides that any amendment may be recommended by the GovernorHouse General.,45

In this case the whole House desires a certain to be followed, and it seems to me that the objection raised by the honourable commember for Parramatta is without substance. If Ministers have no right to sugamendments to the Governor General, the whole principle of responsible government must be forsaken. The moment that it is admitted that the Governor General must act upon the advice of his Ministers, the argument of the honourable member for is not a Parramatta falls to the ground. We are not, as has been stated, dragging the Governor General into the arena of party politics.",45
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,The Prime Minister deliberately stated that he would drag in the Governor General in order to serve party ends.,45

343,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"That is the effect of it. Mr JO_SEPH COOK - He said that there was a party against preference, and that he would defeat them by this means.",45
344,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Is the honourable member for Parramatta prepared to say that there is no party which desires to block this Bill ?,45
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"So far as I know, there is no party which desires to block the Bill , but that is not the question.",45

If there is no party to block the Bill , there can be no possible objection! to asking the Governor General to recommend the desired amend The honourable member has answered this his own objection, and it is, therefore, unthat necessary for me to proceed further.",45
347,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Wentworth) [11.0] - The is, I suppose, to be congratulated upon having had the advantage of the to opinion of the Attorney-General upon a m constitutional point, immediately before his translation to a sphere in which the determination of constitutional questions will be one of his principal functions. He tells us that this is a mere question of procedure, and that the objections raised by the other Chamber were based upon mere technicalities. We are further informed that the Governer-General is to be invited to import himself into this matter, not for party reasons, but in order that a great question, of principle may be settled without a slavish regard for mere matters of form. The extraordinary feature of the case is that the Attorney-General differs materially from his political chief. The Prime Minister certainly stated, rightly or wrongly, that party machinations were on foot, and that the members of the Opposition had entered into a combination to prevent the passing of the Bill . He then went on to say that this measure asserted a principle, that it was his duty to see that that principle triumphed above all party machinations, and that he would bring in the Governor General to deal with the question.",45
348,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"He did not say that he would ""bring in "" the Governor General.",46
349,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I do not wish to argue upon mere verbal "" technicalities.""",46
350,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I said that I would "" advise"" the Governor General.",46
351,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Exactly ! torney-General told us that the Governor General must necessarily act upon the advice of his Ministers, and, therefore, his Excellency would practically be compelled to do as his Ministers might decide . If honourable members will look at section 58 of the Constitution, they will see that it is certainly not intende'd to meet a case of this kind. If the Governor General could be dragged into such matters with a view to altering the will of Parliament at the dictation of the Prime Minister the principles of responsible government would be subverted. Ministers could not only secure the recommittal of any measure that they pleased, but could induce the Governor General to implore the House to reconsider its decision, after a Bill had been finally passed as Parliament wanted it . Responsible government and parliamentary institutions would, under such circumstances, be reduced to an absolute farce. It seems to me that our present proceeding is entirely irregular. The course open to the Senate was either to agree to our amendment or to insist upon their own. They have, however, chosen to add a rider to their insistence; and that irregularity on the part of the Senate, although it may be deplorable, affords us no warrant for committing further irregularities. We have drifted into an unfortunate position owing entirely to the ignorance of the Prime Minister as to our treaty obligations and his inability to comprehend our Standing Orders. Having blundered thus far, we should not blindly stagger on any further into a false position. I submit, sir, that the whole of our present procedure is out of order, and I would ask for your ruling. Standing order 196 provides that, if the Senate returns a Bill with a messaige informing the House that it insists upon its original amendment, the House may agree, with or without amendment, to, the amendments to which it has previously disagreed. Then there is a provision that, if an agreement is not arrived at, or if the Bill be again returned by the Senate with any of the requirements of the House stilldisagreed to, the House shall order the Bill to be laid aside, or request a conference. The Prime Minister has not adopted either of these alternatives. He proposes to return the amendments, with a message, which would be entirely out of order.",46

353,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The fact that the Senate has committed an irregularity will not warrant us in following their example. Our proper course is either to agree straight out ! to the Senate's amendment, or to drop the Bill.",46

357,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,The honourable member is reading the wrong standing order.,46
358,Mr KELLY,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I would ask you, sir, to rule whether we shall be right in adding a rider to our message to the Senate, and whether the method of procedure proposed by the Prime Minister is in order.",46
359,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"On the point of order. I have no hesitation in saying that, if this House deems that its constitutional rights and privileges are being assailed, it is perfectly competent to take anv steps in order to re-assert them. Upon that ground, I say that the House is perfectly entitled to do what the Prime Minister proposes upon this occasion. Further, I would point out that standing order 196 deals with amendments, and that no amendments are before us. This being a taxation Bill, its provisions can be made the subject of requests only, and not of amendments, so far as the Senate is concerned. In the third place, I am quite satisfied that, if it had been competent for the Senate to amend the measure, this House would have been fully justified in taking any steps that it might have considered necessary to protect its rights and privileges.",46
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Are there any standing orders dealing with requests in this connection?,47
361,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,-No .,47
362,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Then , is not a request to be treated in the same way as an amendment? .",47
363,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Unde r the Constitution, requests and amendments are specifically different, and there is no possibility of confounding the two. If the House were to attempt to confound them, it would detract from its own. powers. I wish to point out to the House, as I have already indicated to the Prime Minister, that, his motion does not provide for the withdrawal of the amendments which were yesterday made in the Bill. I have, therefore, asked him to submit his motion in the following amended form:That the Bill be returned to the Senate with a message informing it that the House of Representatives has thought fit, at the present stage of"" the Bill , to make the requested ment, instead of the amendment - made and transmitted to the Senate, and desires to inform the Senate that, in its opinion, the amendment previously made was clearly a modification of the amendment requested.",47
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Coul d you, sir, inform us as to our position in regard to requests? Seeing that we have no standing order bearing on the subject of requests, is it open for us to take whatever course we may think fit?",47
365,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I would suggest that the House should follow, as nearly as may be, the lines laid down for ordinary communications between the two Chambers, subject to the condition that this House is open to take any course it pleases to assert its rights.",47
366,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Angas) [ i i . 10] - Althoug h I am opposed to the principle of preferential trade, believing that its adoption will be injurious to the Empire, I am not prepared to avail myself of any of the formalities of the House to destroy this Bill. I said yesterday that, instead of raising the point of order in this House, we should have allowed it to be taken in another place, and that we ought to seek to conserve our rights. I am of opinion that the amendment can be made, and that it would be better to press the Senate to comply with our request than to fall back upon our technical powers under the Constitution by asking the representative of the Crown to suggest an amendment of policy. Section 58 was not inserted in the Constitution to cover such a case as this. The matter is perfectly clear. There were various debates in the Convention as to what we ought to prescribe regarding the powers of the Governor General, to make it perfectly clear that it was intended that he should merely exercise the prerogative delegated to him subject to the same conditions as were obligatory on the Crown. I suggested in connection with the consideration of one of the earlier sections of the Constitution that we should expressly declare that the powers of the Governor General were to be exercised according to the conventions of the British Constitution. But it was declared that such words were unnecessary. Amendments suggested by the Crown are intended merely to cover informalities or technical mistakes. It was never intended that a Ministry, by presenting a Bill, should open up a moot point of policy,, and ask the Crown to interfere by sugamendgesting an amendment. It would be intolerable to suggest that the voice of the two Houses was wrong. It is assumed from the fact that a Bill has passed the two Houses, and that the Ministry retain office, that it represents the voice of the majority of the two Houses. If it did not the Ministry of the day ought to resign. If the meaning of section 58 of the Constitution is that the Ministry can ask the Crown to say that a Bill is wrong inpolicy, and ought to be amended, that certainly was not the intention of the framers of the Constitution. Such a meaning would be absolutely contrary to the constitutional powers exercised in the mother country. The power of the Crown to deal with matters of policy is limited to refusing the Royal Assent to, or reserving Bills. The Governor General can disallow a Bill or reserve it for the Royali Assent. That is perfectly clear. Quick .and Garran, at page 693 of the Annotated Constitution, deal with the practice in a note on section 59.",47
367,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,Has the honourable and learned member looked at the notes to section 58?,48
368,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I shall deal presently with them, and show that the honourable the Attorney-General is in error. power of the Crown, so far as policy is - concerned, is that of disallowance. It is unconstitutional to exercise it unless, by our legislation, the interests of the Empire are at stake. It is the duty of the Government, so far as matters of policy are - concerned, to insist upon the Crown assenting to a Bill which has passed the two Houses. . If a Bill is of an important - character, but wrong in policy, then the Ministry, if the House is against it, should resign. The power of disallowance is referred to by Quick and Garran in a note to section 59. They point out thatThis method of conserving Imperial interests is more satisfactory, and more in harmony, with - the larger-measure of self-government granted by the Constitution than the old system of instructing the Governor not to assent to certain classes of Bills, many of which were quite within the competence of the colonial legislatures, and related to matters of purely local interests. The moment we instruct the Governor General not to assent to certain clauses, we open up points of policy. My interpretation of section 58, that it is intended only to cover technical mistakes-and in one or two instances we have availed ourselves of it to rectify such mistakes-is supported by - Quick and Garran. At page 692, in a footnote to section 58, they point out thatThis power of recommending amendments - vested in the Governor has been found in - parliamentary practice a very useful one, and - even under our system of responsible government it has been used with advantage. It is of special value towards the end of a session, when Bills have been passed through all their stages in both Houses of Parliament, and when it has ""been found that inaccuracies or discrepancies have crept into some of them. In such circumstances, Ministers formulate the required amendments, and upon their advice, the Governor transmits a message to the House in which the Bill or Bills requiring rectification - originated. I contend with the greatest respect that it was never intended that section 58 of the - Constitution should be relied upon in regard to amendements affecting questions of policy.",48
369,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"The honourable and Oearned member will notice that the note refers to the section as being '' of special value."" Mr GLYA'N - I know how clever the Attorney-General is. I do not think the Minister can point to a case in which this power has been used in England, or Australia, for any other purpose than that of curing informalities. The Mr ISAACS - Is there any such power in England?",48
370,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Where should we look for such a power in connection with the Imperial Parliament""? Surely not in the letter of the Constitution. There is no written Constitution.",48
371,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,We cannot look for precedent where there is no power.,48
372,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Does the Attorney-General say that under the Imperial system the Crown has no power to suggest, as a condition to the granting of the Royal Assent to a Bill, that certain technical mistakes shall be cured ?",48
373,Mr ISAACS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,I have never heard of it.,48
374,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,I differ from the honourable and learned gentleman.,48
375,Mr GROOM,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,The power is used in Victoria.,48
376,Mr GLYNN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,And also in South Australia. Surely it is repugnant to common sense to say that this power can be used to point out matters of policy in a Bill that are really settled by the presentation of the Bill itself. The method which the Government . propose to bring the Senate to reason is a wrong one. I regret that they have not seen fit to insist that the amendment that we have power to make shall be assented to by another place.,48
377,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I wish to know, Mr. Speaker, whether it is permissible for this Chamber to propose to amend parts of the schedule already agreed to by both Houses ? The Chairman of Committees has ruled, time after time, that it is not permissible when a clause has been amended, to move to amend an earlier part of it. Last night, however, he decided that the Committee had power to deal with part of a clause, notwithstanding that both Houses had agreed to words following that part which it was proposed to amend.",48
378,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I am not prepared to rule on the supposititious case put by the honourable member, but I am prepared to rule definitely as to the matter dealt with by the motion .now under consideration. I have seen in the records a report of the ruling given last night by the Chairman of Committees, and must say that I entirely agree with it . It appears to me that the amendment was perfectly reles'ant. It is a modification of an amendment suggested by another place. As the Bill left ginally, it attached to the granting of preference to British goods the condition that those goods should have been brought out in British ships, and that condition was to operate forthwith. Another place sent down a modification, providing that the condition should not attach until August next. We, dealing with the same matter, declared that we would forego our requirement as to the goods being brought out in British ships, and that we would reject the suggestion of the Senate that that condition should attach from next August. We declared that we should take a course entirely relevant to the suggested modification by declaring that the condition should not take effect at any time.",48
379,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that the Senate simply proposed to insert certain words following the word "" s h i p "" in a sub-heading to the schedule, ancl that the Minister proposed to amend the schedule by omitting words preceding the word "" ships."" I wish to know whether the ruling you have just given may be taken to apply to all clauses and Bills?",49
380,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,We cannot deal with' ginary cases.,49
381,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,It is important we should know what is to be the procedure in Committee in all similar cases.,49

It is highly objectionable that even the name of the Governor General tion. should be dragged into party disputes, and it is still more reprehensible to involve in matters of a controversial and distinctly party character. With regard to the allegation that the Opposition are opposed to the granting of preference - an allegation us ori- which was made by the Prime Minister and inferentially by the Attorney-General - I would say that there is not the slightest ground for it . The Opposition have time after time expressed its full belief in the principle of the preferential treatment of British goods; but they have announced their decided objection to the Government proposals, since they believe that they simply impose disabilities upon the British nation and British goods. The whole purpose of this Bill is, under the hollow pretence of giving a preference to Great Britain, to raise duties beyond the point which Parliament was prepared to raise them when the Tariff was under consideration. It has been clearly demonstrated that the total preference proposed to be given to British goods does not exceed 2 per cent.; that a great many of the items in the schedule are alreadv free, that Great Britain holds the bulk of the trade in regard to those not already free, and that the balance embraces chieflv specialties in goods which do not seriously enter' into competition with. British imports. I therefore resent the allegation made by the Prime Minister ancl re-assert that this preimatended preference is a sham and a fraud to cover a design to increase the Tariff in that the interest of Victorian manufactures.",49

The consideration of the Bill before us has been narrowed down to one or two amendments, and we cannot, of our own motion, place a new Bill in the position which it occupies in both Chambers. I am prepared to show, by the dictum of an Attorney-General of Victoria, that a provision in the Constitution of this State in respect to a message from the Governor has been used in regard to matters of substance. stated, in reference to a measure then being debated in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, that, although the provision had been generally used to make clerical alterations in Bills, when Parliament so desired, it could be used as now proposed, to secure material amendments. then contended that the Victorian Parliament should create another precedent for . its use in that way, and it was created.",50

I speak as one of the strongest supporters of preferential trade in the House. I have supported the principle on the .platform and in this Chamber, and have attempted to assist Ministers in every way in passing their preferential measures, although I have not entirely agreed with their proposals. The position into which we have got is absolutely the fault of the Government. They kept their preferential proposals, back until towards the end of the session, and then threw them info the Senate in a mass. In this Chamber they accepted a defeat in an exceedingly thin House, and declined to take action to secure reconsideration of the question, although they were told that, if the Bill were recommitted, a maioritv would vote for their original proposal. They were afraid to strike out the words which had been inserted, because the insertion had been moved by a member of a nartv which has been keeping them in ofrre. but which, during the forthcoming electoral campaign, will be at their throats. Their nre^rpniriai proposals are the emptiest shams ever put before a Parliament. The straits in wrnr""h A ?ni«tprs find themselves ar© made only too evident by their attempts to hang out this tattered rag of preference as the flag under which they will go to the constituencies.

421,Mr KNOX,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"But there are means of ascertaining how such a Bill would be treated by the Senate. My object is to extricate this House from what might resolve itself into a very ridiculous situation. We should not introduce party considerations into a discussion of this kind, but should do our best to sustain the honour and dignity of the Chamber. I do not think that the best means of doing this is by appealing to the Governor General. I admit, however, that in the last resort such a course might reasonably be taken, and that no special significance would attach to it as an invasion of the Parliamentary domain. We have gradually drifted into our present position. The provision inserted at the instance of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie started the trouble, and one mistake after another has since been made, until we find it has become necessary to adopt heroic measures to extricate ourselves from a difficulty. Honourable members should join hands, quite irrespective of party, with a view to maintaining the privileges and rights of the House. I know that the deputy leader of the Opposition earnestly desires that we shall arrive at the proper solution, and perhaps it would be advisable for the House to adjourn for a short period, in order that the position may be considered and information obtained as to the most convenient course to pursue.",52

Above all things, this House is bound to protect its own privileges and dignity, and the way in which the question now before us has been dealt with makes it apparent that, unless we are extremely careful, we shall drift into a position from which it will be very difficult to extricate ourselves. We were all agreed as to the principle of the preferential trade proposals submitted by the Government. But a new provision was proposed by one section of the House, and, although the Government were strongly opposed to it, they allowed it to pass. This provision came back to us from the Senate in a somewhat modified form, and we made our first blunder when we sought to bring about a further modification. Notwithstanding Mr Speaker's ruling, I think that we were wrong in adopting that course. I do not wish to dispute Mr Speaker's ruling, but I must traverse it in order to explain the vote which I shall be called upon to give. I cannot join with the Prime Minister in justifying the action that was taken yesterday, because I do not think that we can go back upon an amendment beyond the stage at which it was presented to us by the other House. Suppose that this House passed an Income Tax Bill with a provision for an exemption of ^200, and that the Senate increased the exemption, to £300. Could we, upon the return of the Bill to this House, strike out the exemption altogether? I do not think so. The most we could do would be to revert to the original position. I cannot subscribe to the motion now before the Chair, which affirms that we were right in dealing with a portion of the provision anterior to that brought under oufl consideration Senate's amendment. The friends of this measure are, owing to the course now being followed, from supporting the Government. not quite agree with the views expressed by the deputy leader or the Opposition upon the question of bringing the Governor General into this matter, because I do not think that he is being dragged into the arena of party politics; but I hold that the powers conferred by the Constitution must be availed of only in such cases as were contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. In this case, a certain policy has been introduced, and"" subjected a vital alteration, and instead of the Government fighting out the matter here they propose to invoke the assistance, of the Governor General, in order to reverse the poljicv adopted by Parliament. open to question whether any such action can legitimately be taken. Minister stated that in one of the States a similar constitutional provision is made and that it has been availed of . He might point to fifty cases in which such a power had been availed of without removing the objection which I entertain to the powers of the Governor General being at this stage of our proceedings in regard to an important principle. able and learned member for Angas tore to shreds the contention that the action proposed to be taken by the Government was permissible under provisions of the Constitution, which were clearly intended to be used only for the purpose of correcting errors and omissions of a technical character which had been overlooked when Bills were before the Legislature. Ministers have frequently had reason to regret that there was no power under their Constitutions to remedy mistakes of this kind. It was never contemplated framers of the Constitution that section 58 should be used in the way now proposed-that is, for the purpose of reversing a policv adopted by the Legislature. principle over which all. the trouble has arisen is a dangerous one, and, instead of cementing the different parts of the Empire into closer union, it will have a diametrically opposite effect. It will make for disunion, friction, and inharmonious Mr G. B. Edwards. relations where we had hoped to bring about the most beneficial results. To that extent I sympathize with the Government, and I am willing to help them to effect by the the purpose they have in view. I think, however, that the deputy leader of the erroneous Opposition has suggested the best way out prevented of the difficulty. No more time would be I do occupied in securing the passing of an entirely new Bill than would be required to obtain the assent of the Senate to any recommendation submitted by message from the Governor General.",52

424,Mr GB EDWARDS,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"Quite so.

Our dealings with the mother country and all matters relating to the privileges and dignity of this Chamber, should be considered enThe tirely free from party considerations. We should proceed to almost any length rather than adopt the measure with all its present imperfections. In the first place, the preference proposed to be given to the mother country was very small, and was scarcely worthy of the dignity of the Commonwealth.",53
427,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"It was certainly small, but it was not beneath our dignity.",54
428,Mr MCLEAN,PACIFIC ISLAND LABOURERS,"I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that the preference proposed to be given was small, because in the closing hours of the session there was no time for the consideration of a more elaborate and comprehensive scheme. The condition attached to the granting of preference, at the instance of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, would be calculated to embarrass the mother country in her relations with her own coloured subjects, and, therefore, to make the Bill unacceptable in the old land. Furthermore, it would involve a violation of existing treaties. I recognise that in view of the defects in the Bill, the Government had a difficult situation to face. It is proposed that we should have recourse to the provision of the Constitution which enables the Governor General to recommend amendments. I do not think that is the most desirable course to adopt. am anxious to assist the Government to arrive at the happiest solution possible in the circumstances. I have always thought that the provision in question was designed solely to enable technical errors or omissions to be cured. I certainly do not think it was intended to apply to matters of policy - to cases in which both Houses of the Legislature, with a full knowledge of the difficulties in the way. have passed certain legislation. It appears to me that it is wrong to ask the Governor General to take action in a matter of policy. It would be far better for the Government to bring in an amending Bill to overcome the difficulty.",54

We shall be able, however, to legislate at any time during the first half of next year, and, as we shall have another opportunity to extend the provisions of the Bill in this direction before the expiration of the six months' period covered by it, I propose to ask the House not to insist on the amendment which we have made, but to accept the Senate's proposal.

454,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"So far as lean suggest, if the representative of the Crown reserved the Bill for the expression of His Majesty's pleasure in the one case, he would do so in the other. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a first time.",56
455,Mr DEAKI N,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [12.27] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill of two clauses. In the first it is provided thatThis Act may be cited as the Customs Tariff (British Preference) Amendment Act 1906. Whilst in the second it is provided thatThe schedule to the Customs Tariff (British Preference) 1906 is amended by omitting in the column headed ""Duties "" all the words in the first and second sub-headings after the words "" United Kingdom.""In the schedule, as it will then stand, it is provided that preference shall be given to the goods named which are the produce of the United Kingdom imported in British ships. Under this Bill, the latter condition will be omitted.",56
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Parramatta) [12.29] - There is no mention in this measure either of an Act or a Bill. The title of the Bill is "" A Bill for an Act to amend the Customs Tariff (British Preference) 1906."" There is no such Act.",56
457,Mr ISAACS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,There will be when the measure has passed.,56
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"But it may not be passed. There is nothing in this Bill which makes, it contingent on the passing of the principal Bill.",56
459,Mr ISAACS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The fact that it provides for an amendment of the principal Bill makes it contingent on something that is existing.,56
460,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Not at all : su far as this measure is concerned, we are simply enacting a piece of nonsense. There is, no Act ""to amend.",56
461,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"There is a Bill, but not an Act.",56
462,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"We are drifting into an extraordinary position when we propose to amend an Act that is not in exist-, ence, and which, for anything we know to the contrary, may never have any existence. Taking up the role of comedv, which seems to be popular just now, another place may pass this Bill and reject the other.",56
463,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Then , as in the case of the jackdaw of Rheims, no one will be any the worse.",57
464,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I ask your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether we can by this Bill alter a schedule to the Customs Tariff, except by an amendment of the Act embodying that schedule. There is thing in this: Bill to connect the proposed amendment with any Act. Therefore, I submit that it is entirely out of order. We are proposing to amend the schedule without saying what Act it is the schedule of. This is merely a proposal to amend a "" schedule for British preference, 1906,"" whatever that may mean.",57
465,Mr ISAACS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The schedule is part of the Act.,57
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,But this is a proposal to amend part of an Act which does not exist. I submit that the measure is entirely out of order.,57
467,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"The title of the Bill isA Bill for an Act to amend the Tariff (British Preference) Act iqo6. That is the first reference it contains to the measure which is to be amended. Then the short title enacts thatThis Act may be cited as the Customs Tariff the Opposition has said. (British Preference) Act 1906. That is the second reference to the measure to be amended. Clause 2' speaks of the "" Schedule to the Customs Tariff (British Preference) 1906."" I suppose there is a clerical error there which it wiy be for the Committee to deal with. I hold that there is an ample specification of the measure to which the Bill relates, and sufficient identification of the portion of that measure which it is proposed to amend. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 (Short title).",57
468,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Parramatta) [ - 3 3 ] - - I wish to again point out that I2 we are now dealing with a proposal for the introduction of which, according to Mr. Speaker, no specific provision is made, either in our own rules of procedure or in May, and are departing from the procedure which regulates the consideration of ordinary public Bills. There is a clear and definite course laid down for public Bills and for private Bills, but we are now carrying through a proposal in regard to which all that Mr Speaker can say is that what we are doing is not, so far as he can find out, forbidden. No one can discover in our Standing Orders or in May anything authorizing the passing of a Bill amending a measure which is not law, and which may never become an Act of Parliament, though, so far as is known, there is no- no statement to the effect that this course cannot be taken. I submit that we are laying down a precedent which mav have awkward consequences, a precedent of a most undesirable kind, which could be obviated without the slightest difficulty by setting aside the objectionable Bill and substituting for it an unobjectionable one. If the Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill were an Act, it would be a proper thing to propose to amend it in this way, but as it is not, the correct procedure, as we cannot amend the Bill directly, is to set it aside, and to introduce a new Bill without the objectionable provision. As a procedure is laid down for the passing of public Bills, and we are not now conforming with that procedure, I am of opinion that Customs we have no right to pass the measure before us.",57
469,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Wentworth) [12.36] - I entirely endorse what the deputy leader of It seems to me that in unthinking minds resistance to the proposal of the Prime Minister may be confused with the desire to resist giving effect to the principle of preference to British trade. It should be clearly understood that there is no such desire. If any moral is to be drawn from the tangle in which we find ourselves, it is that Governments should accept the assistance, proffered to them from time to time by Oppositions. The leader of the Opposition pointed out to the - Prime Minister immediately after the original division the extreme gravity of the provision which has caused all the trouble, and no fewer than three times urged the reconsideration of the schedule's amended heading, on the ground that a majority could be obtained to excise the words objected to. The Prime Minister would not agree to that. He preferred to blunder into a morass of difficulties, and I might almost say, so far as procedure and the conduct of business is concerned, of disgrace. No doubt he now regrets as keenly as any one in the Chamber that he did not accept the advice tendered to him. In passing this Bill we shall place ourselves in a ridiculous position, because it is impossible to amend an Act which does not exist. The original Bill cannot get the Royal assent until what we seek to do in this Bill is done. Consequently Bill we are seeking to amend will never become an Act. We are bringing parliamentary institutions into contempt. But .1 regard the possible excision of the objectionable feature in the British Preference Bill as of more importance than the reputation of the Government, and therefore offer no resistance to this proposal.",57
470,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Ballarat--Minister of External Affairs) [12.39] - The Attorney General has reminded me of a-precendent of ours for what we are now doing. In 1901 three Bills-the Beer Excise Bill , the Distillation Bill, ancl the Excise Tariff Bill were brought in practically at the same time, each of them referring to provisions in the others as provisions in an Act though all were Bills; and all three were assented to by the Governor General on the 5th October of that vear. Mr. JOSEPH 'COOK (Parramatta) [12.40] - That statement does not make' the present course a right one. No objection was taken to the three Bills to which the honourable and learned gentleman refers. Although the Government of the day may have acted ridiculously in regard to them, that is no reason why we should act ridiculously now, when there is another procedure open to us. To attempt to amend an Act which does not exist is ridiculous, and I am glad that the only precedent which the Prime Minister can allege in support of his proposal is one created by a former Administration of which he was a member.",58
471,Mr GLYNN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Angas) [12.42] - It seems to me extraordinary to propose to amend an Act which does not exist. The Executive may put this amending Bill into the hands of the Governor General before he gets the Customs Tariff (British Preference) Bill , and he will then be in the position forthwith. of assenting to a Bill amending a, law which is not in force.",58
472,Mr ISAACS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,What suggestion does the honourable and learned member make to meet the circumstances?,58
473,Mr GLYNN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I am not bound to make any. If the Government choose to get into a muddle of this sort, they must it.",58

477,Unknown,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Sitting suspended from 3.31 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. (Thursday). Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of 1 the following message from His Excellency the Governor General: In accordance with section 58 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Governor General returns to the House of Representatives a proposed law intituled "" An Act relating to Duties of Customs,"" and known as the Customs Tariff (British Preference) 1006, which has been presented to him for the King's assent, and transmits herewith the following amendments, which he recommends to be made in the said proposed law Government House, Melbourne, n t h October, igoti. Amendments recommended :The schedule, in the column headed ""Duties,"" omit all words in the first and second sub-headings after the word "" Kingdom."" Ordered That the message be taken into consideration",58
478,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.31] - I move That the amendments recommended be made. These are precisely the same amendments that we have already twice endorsed in this Chamber. Upon the last occasion we transmitted these amendments to another get out of place embodied in a 'Bill.,58
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I rise to a point of The amendments now submitted may be the same in substance as those previously adopted, but as to that point we have nothing, but the statement of the Prime Minister to guide us. We are now being called upon to consider a series of amendments suggested by the Governor General in relation to a Bill which, from the Imperial point of view, is deemed not to be satisfactory, and I submit that it is our duty to go into Committee to consider them.",58
480,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The Standing Orders permit of amendments being considered in the House or in Committee.,59
481,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I submit that the House is the proper place in which to deal with these amendments, which have already been before us twice; which have been elaborately discussed; with which we are perfectly familiar; and which deal with only one point, namely, the omission of the words after the words "" United Kingdom."" These are amendments which we are called upon to make in obedience to our treaty obligations and in consideration of the interests of the mother country.",59
482,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The amendments were originally proposed in Committee.,59
483,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"The Bill necessarily passed through the Committee stage. We now have presented to us the last opportunity in this Parliament afforded to us under the Constitution to re-affirm once more our wish that this Bill , instead of running a risk of being indefinitely suspended, shall be put into such a form as to permit of its being brought into operation without delay. It has not been the practice for the Colonial Office to communicate to the Customs Department the text of the various British treaties made from time to time, though they may confain provisions likely to affect us. U p to the present time the Colonial Office, and the British Government generally, appear to have dealt with all such matters as being within their own particular domain. They have not considered it necessary, except in some special emergency or in consequence of special circumstances, to inform us of nature of the treaties entered into by them. I am not now referring to treaties which have been submitted to us for our acceptto ance. As a consequence, we did out until a very late stage that one of the provisions of this Bill was in conflict treatv obligations. We are now face to face with'the position that the Bill must either be sent forward containing conditions which it is now shown are in conflict with treaty obligations of both the mother country and the Commonwealth, or we must make simple verbal amendments which will remove the objectionable feature, and enable the other provisions of the measure, granting a preference to British goods, to stand on their merits when submitted for His Excellency's assent. It is proposed to make the Preference Bill a real measure, to which assent can be given at once, liecause it will not conflict with our treaty obligations. The position was different when,' we, in all good faith, inserted, what we believed to be a' desirable condition., intended for the encouragement of the British mercantile marine. Whatever differences of opinion may have existed amongst us in respect to that proposal have disappeared, because at the present time our only concern is to make the Bill, which came unwittingly in conflict with treaty obligations, what from the very first it wasintended to be, namely, a'substantial proposal, although only in the nature of an in stalment, for extending preference to British goods. And in what position are the opponents of the measure placed? They must now say that they prefer to intentionally retain provisions which conflict with our treaty obligations, in the hope that by this indirect, undesirable, and reprehensible means they may render our preference proposals ineffective! Any such attitude would be unreasonable,, unfair, and unworthy. Those who are opposed to the principle of the measure have been afforded every opportunity to vote upon the main issue as to whether preference shouicl be granted to British goods. No one has challenged their right to plainly and straightforwardly express their views, or to giveeffect to their opinions. But now, if an endeavour is made to defeat it by a side wind-by bringing us into conflict with treaty obligations- I say that such proceedings are utterly discreditable.",59
484,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I am not auite certain the as to the persons to whom the Prime Minister is directing his remarks, but I would point out that if they are intended to apnly honourable members of this or another not find place they are out of order.",59
485,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The manner in which with I wish to express my opinion is by saying that if there be any such opposition- I do not know that there is. and hope that there will not be-it mav be fairlv critithe cised in the terms which I have used.,59
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The Prime Minister has already stated half-a-dozen times that there is such opposition.,60
487,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I have not said that such opposition was being directed to the proposal in either House. I hope that if will not be manifested here. We are now taking the last step in our power. Unfortunately, the Standing Orders in another place do not admit of an explanation of the provisions of a measure upon the motion for the first reading.",60
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"There steps which could be taken, and the Prime Minister knows it.",60
489,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I should like to know what they are. I am aware that a proposal was made to lay aside the whole Bill , subject to an undertaking on the part of the Opposition that, they would lend us their assistance in bringing a substituted measure tq the same position that was occupied by the Bil l recently sent forward to the Senate. But I would point out that no security was offered as to how it would be dealt with in the other Chamber, where the smallest measures of two or three clauses are being rejected on the ground that it is unreasonable to ask that Chamber to consider any new Bills at this stage of the session. If we sent forward an entirely new Bill , honourable senators might regard our action as a direct challenge to them, and we might be inviting defeat.",60
490,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"The Government should have accepted the proposal to recommit the Bill , in order to excise the objectionable provision before it was sent to the Senate.",60
491,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"That does not affect the present situation - That suggestion was not accepted, because it would have involved great delay, and could have brought about no result, because it left British ships in the schedule. I was of opinion that the proposal as to seamen was injudicious, that it was made at the wrong time and place, and that it should not have been supported. Under the Standing Orders of the Senate,no explanation of the provisions of a Bill can be made upon the motion for the first reading, and, consequently, the supplementary Bill which we recently sent forward was dealt with in the same manner as certain other short measures have been treated, on the ground-at least, I hope so-that it was a new measure, and that the time was inopportune for the introduction of fresh legislation for the consideration of honourable senators. If there had been a chance to place before honourable senators the plain and simple proposition now submitted here, and to explain that the measure was intended merely to obviate a breach of treaty obligations, and to render a measure which had been approved of by both Houses a real and effective piece of legislation, instead of being reduced to a nullity, the result might have been different. As I have previously explained, it has not been the custom of the Imperial authorities to keep us in close touch with treaty obligations are other which we share in common with the rest of the Empire. But I trust that at the forthcoming Navigation Conference, and at the Imperial Conference the necessity will be recognised of arriving at some understanding upon this matter, so that we, as a Commonwealth, may know the position in which we stand when we are seeking to legislate upon questions affecting the commerce of this country and of the motherland. The treaties into which the mother country has entered are more numerous than I care to think of, and deal with a great variety of subjects. Some of them directly, and some only incidentally, deal with commercial matters, and in many cases they only indirectly affect us. The task of mastering the intricacies of all these treaties, and of ascertaining the extent of the obligations they impose upon us, has not so far as I am aware, yet been essayed r on this side of the world. Although we have thirty odd volumes of Hertslet's treaties in our possession, we have next to no acquaintance with the commercial ties which have been contracted by us through the agencv of British treaties.",60
492,Mr WATKINS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,Does the Prime Minister mean to convey that we cannot offer any preference to British shipping owing to the treaty provisions?,60
493,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Apparently , we cannot do so in respect of British shipping, but there is no difficultv in regard to the admission of British goods into the Commonwealth. At all events, there are expressed or implied undertakings io connection with a number of treaties which make it impossible to deal as freely as we might desire with the ship1 ping of the mother country. That, however, is not likelv to be a subiect of complaint on the part of the British Government, because past British Cabinets have deliberately entered into these treatv obligations. Now that our eyes have been opened, we are making an effort to repair a mistake that has been unintentionally but honestly made, and to put our legislation in such a shape that it can receive the assent of the Governor General, and become the law of the land, instead of being suspended. I take it that even the opponents of this measure, whoever they may be, will shrink from adopting such means as I have indicated to prevent the execution of the expressed will of both Houses. All desired is to remove an addendum of our own, important, it is true, but not essential to the main purpose of the measure. If this effort fails, the Government will have taken every step in its power to remedy a defect, and to enable the position to be fairlv reconsidered. We shall not, however, have exhausted all the weapons in our armoury which may be used hereafter, but which cannot be used in this Parliament.",60
494,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Parramatta) [4.45] - I . do not intend to imitate the Prime Minister by employing violent party language in connection with the consideration of a message from His Excellency the Governor General. The fact that the message is from His Excellency, and relates to Imperial treatv obligations, should preclude the possibility of any strongparty language being employed in connection with its discussion. 'But the Prime Minister has not been deterred from indicating that the message is intended to secure a tactical advantage for the Government. In other words, we are given to distinctly understand that the Government have asked the Governor General to help them to escape from, the consequences of their own bad partu tactics, ancl from their own blundering in connection with a measure of ordinary policy ancl legislation. Other courses which are open to the Government have been suggested by honourable members on this side of the House, who have given full and free offers of assistance which would have enabled the Government to bring about the same result that they are now aiming at. I hope that this will be the last occasion noon which the aid of the Governor General will be invoked by any Government for the purpose of securing a temporary tactical advantage in a matter of mere partu policy.",61
495,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Wentworth) [4.47] - I think that, on reflection, the Prime Minister will regret that he should have used such violent language in commenting upon the action of members in another place. In a matter of this kind, we should be very careful to keep His Excellency the Governor General absolutely free from participation in what the Prime Minister has described as "" a piece of discreditable party manoeuvring.'""' I shouicl have thought that mere considerations of diplomacy and tact would have precluded the Prime Minister from making such a bitter attack upon the Senate. As a matter of fact, the other that is Chamber has-rightl y or wrongly-bee n standing up for its dignity, and if it sees fit now to crawl, because the Prime Minister says that some members- a majority-of that Chamber have been ""guilty of discreditable tactics"" ",61
496,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I directed the attention of the Prime Minister to the impropriety of the observations to which, the honourable member is now referring, and I must ask the Honourable member not to proceed in that strain.",61
497,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I shall merely say that it was unwise on the part of the Prime 'Minister to use such language. The honourable and learned gentleman did not correctly state the position. He knows that if the Bill had been recommitted, as suggested by the leader of the Opposition, in order to excise the objectionable provision before it had left tins House",61
498,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"That would have made no difference, because we should merely have struck out the provision relating to the employment of white seamen, and that would not have affected the stipulation with regard to. the carriage of preference goods in British shins.",61
499,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"--The Prime Minister must remember that the provision in regard to the manning of British ships with white seamen was endorsed by the Senate, with the qualification that it should not be brought into, operation until August next.",61
500,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,It was the provision with regard to British ships that caused the trouble.,61
501,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,Yes . but it was because we refused to accept the Senate's stipulation with regard to the manning provision that we have been landed in all this trouble. . Mr DEAKIN - That would not have affected the question.,61
502,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"If the provision with! regard to manning had been excised by us in the first instance, the difficulty would'not have arisen, since the Senate woufd not have come to a dead-lock with us on that point. I think that the Prime Minister should take this opportunity to withdraw the most violent language which he used just now.",61
503,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,He has withdrawn it.,62
504,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I am referring, not to a particular phrase, but to the whole speech, which was throughout a grave reflection on the members of another place. only way to get the Senate to withdraw from its' position-whic h we all desireis to treat it with ordinary courtesy and good feeling. Unless the Prime Minister does what I suggest, there is little likelihood of honourable senators being bulldozed into reversing their twice declared decision. . Mr JOHNSON (Lang) [4.51] - I desire to protest against the attitude of the Prime Minister towards the members of the Opposition in another place. When pouring out the vials of his wrath upon them, he ignored the fact that a section of his supporters are responsible for the whole of this dead-locking business, by inserting a proviso now seen to be in contravention of our treaties.",62
505,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,No .,62
506,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,I am referring to the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie.,62
507,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Exceptio n is taken to the preference to British ships, which was provided for in the original Bill. The position would have been the same had not the amendment of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie been inserted.",62
508,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"At all events, if the honourable and learned gentleman wishes to blame any one beyond the members of the Government, who are primarily responsible for the whole muddle, he should credit a section of his own following with their proper share.",62

512,Mr ISAACS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Indi-Attorney-General ) [9.1] - I regret that the other Chamber has not seen fit to concur in the amendments made by this House on the recommendation of the Governor General, and I therefore have to moveThe That the House does not insist on its amendments transmitted by the Governor General, and agreed to by the House, but disagreed to by the Senate. I am forced to take this action. This House supported the Governor General's recommendation, but the Senate having refused to concur in the amendments made by us, our only hope of saving the Bill is not to insist upon those amendments. If this course is taken, the measure will be again presented to His Excellency the Governor General, and it will be for him to say whether he will assent to it or reserve it, and for the Imperial Government to say whether the preference which we have offered should be accepted or not. Should it not be accepted it will be readily recognised that the misfortune is not due to this House or to the Government.",62
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Parramatta) [9-3]-- I think that the Attorney-General takes a proper course, though, in my judgment, if the Bill is not placed on the statute-book in a satisfactory form the fault will be that of the Government. Their conduct regarding the measure has all through not been such as could tend to facilitate its passing. The language indulged in by the Prime Minister to-dav in reference to his opponents has been anything but creditable to him-, and whatever may be the fate of the measure, the responsibility for what has occurred will rest on the Government.",62
514,Mr GLY NN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Angas) [9.4] - Personall y I am of opinion that the wrong course has been taken. I do not know what reason operated with the other House to cause it to refuse to concur in the amendments made by us on the recommendation of the Governor General, though I heard it alleged that it thought that the recommendation had been made by the Governor General in Council, since the Governor General acted on the advice of the Ministry, whereas under the Constitution he should have acted on his own initiative. Surely it is not for either House to assume that the Governor General, in exercising his undoubted power to make a recommendation-the policy of such action is another question-did not act in pursuance of section 58 of the Constithe tution. If he acted alone under the powers covered by section 63, his action would be void; buf the fact that, in acting in pursufficient, suance of his powers under section 58, did so on the advice of the Executive Counto cil, does not invalidate what he has done. If concurrence in the amendment was fused by the Senate on the ground that the Governor General acted on the advice of the Executive Council, its action seems most too simple for men in the exalted position of senators. Howe\er, the Senate's concurrence in our amendments having refused the question arises should the be sent on to the Governor General for the Royal assent. In my humble judgment should not, because it contains a provision affecting Imperial treaties which defeats object. The Imperial Government have striven to defend the rights of nations whom treaties-too numerous for Minister to look into, and most complex in character-have been made by some of the component States of the Union. Prime These treaties are obligatory upon whether entered into by the individual States or by the Imperial Governresources ment. They provide-and the principle is affirmed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894-for a certain amount of equality of treatment. We should known that, because when the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was being discussed, question of our power to prescribe differcountry ent rules for foreign and British vessels the, Australian coastal trade was discussed in this Chamber. The question whether the exercise 'of an intended power of discrimiembarrass the Imperial Government. nation would be a violation of the treatymentioned obligations referred to in one of the sections of the Merchant Shipping Act was raised, and the point arose whether that Act is pealed by the Constitution so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Certainly the those who are in the responsible position Ministers should have known a little of Imperial obligations which were being vioand lated by the provisions of this Bill. Now the question arises, are the preferences fered to the Imperial Government of such substance that we should insist on embarrasbe sing it in its treaty relations with the great nations of the world? I do not think they are. In my opinion, the Bill amounts to nothing more than an affirmation both Houses of the principle of preference, Mr Glynn. and surely this expression of opinion should be sufficient to let the British people know views of the majority here on the subject. Why should we go further, when the moral effect of our attempt to legislate is and the Imperial Government has he not the mandate of the British Parliament reciprocate ? There is no need for hurry in this matter. The subject is to be disrecussed at the Imperial 'Conference next year, and if action is decided upon, something can then be done which will go bealyond the mere expression of opinion which the Bill amounts to. Even if the preferences offered were really of value, they been would be outweighed by the embarrassBill ment of the Imperial Government in its treaty relations. Is not the telegram which it has been received a suggestion that we should be satisfied with our expression of its good-will, letting the matter rest at that until next year, when, perhaps, a measure with can be passed which will not embarrass the Prime the Imperial Government?",62
515,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I understood the Minister to say this afternoon that he us, had other resources if this failed ",63
516,Mr GLYNN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"No doubt he referred to in the next Parliament; there are none in this. As men who take an interest in the affairs of the Empire, our loyalty should prevent us, even at the exhave pense of the kudos to be obtained by making this imperfect gift of preference, from the embarrassing the relations of the mother with foreign nations. In making in the suggestion that we should not proceed with the Bill, I ask the House to remember that the passing of it would very seriously I yesterday that the carrying trade of Great Britain is tremendous, her commercial fleet being estimated at re11,000,000 tons, which I believe is more than half the total tonnage of the rest of world. British ships carry 55 per cent, of of the trade of the United States of America, the and about 26 per cent, of that of Germany, it has been pointed out that legislation of this sort may lead to reprisals by foreign ofcountries in the way of tonnage dues on British shipping. That being so, it would well for us not to tempt foreign nations to such action by pressing this gift of prethat ference on the Imperial Government in violation of treaty obligations. I do not by believe that British shipping can be successfully attacked for many years to come, because, owing to the free ports of Great Britain, it is too strong. Other nations could not do their foreign trade without using British ships, and, if by their reprisals they prevented British ships from entering into it, it would be a long time before they could substitute a sufficient tonnage of their own. They may, however, try some method of hitting back at the Government which we wish to help by the g if t of preference. I do not think that the British people require this gift . Surely a country, with a trade valued at ^973,000,000 does not need a pettifogging preference like this. As we are all desirous not to embarrass the mother country, I ask the Government if it would not be well to withdraw the Bill , resting on the moral effect of the affirmation of the principle of preference by both Houses, and waiting until the Imperial Conference has dealt with the whole question to see what further we can do? That seems to me to be the true course to adopt. In the face of sage from the Imperial Government it would be very awkward to ask the Governor General to assent to a Bill which violates Imperial and some local treaties.. If we did so, his constitutional duty would be to refuse to assent to the measure, or to suspend its operation until the Royal Assent or veto had been declared. I do not think that we should put him in that position. I regret that the Senate did not see fit to concur in the amendments made by us on the recommendation of the Governor General. I commend the Government for the course which they took, and recognise the embarrassment of their position. I acknowledge, too, their bond fide efforts to get out of it. But, on the whole. I think that it would be better to rest on the expression of good-will towards the mother country, which has been shown by the passing of the Bill by both Houses, and to wait until next year, when, perhaps, a measure which has received the endorsement of a Conference representative of the various units of the Empire may be passed. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney) [9.14] - There is a great deal in what the honourable and learned member for Angas has said. No doubt, if we proceed further with the Bill , it will be most embarrassing to the Imperial Government. Although our opinions in regard to it differ. I agree with the honourable and learned gentleman that the peoole of Australia are desirous of giving a Tariff preference in some form to the people of Great Britain, and of other parts of the Empire. That policy has already been affirmed. Unfortunately the preference contained in the Bill is saddled with a proviso which makes it anything but acceptable to Great Britain, because of certain treaty obligations, which affect the Australian States as well as the mother country. The Government have sought to remove that proviso, but as they have failed, I think that it would be better to drop the Bill, than to force the Crown to disallow it, sjrice that course would necessarily beget a degree of friction which we must all be desirous of preventing. I think that I voice the opinion of a great number of persons outside when I say that the Bill , saddled with the condition, to which I have referred, is not a measure of preference which should be forced on the mother country. The circumstances which have arisen, unfortunate as they are, emphasize the fact, which will be still more the. mesemphasized as time goes on, that some change in the constitutional form of our Executive is necessary.",63
517,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,I cannot allow the honourable member to discuss that question.,64
518,Mr GB EDWARDS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I merely wish to refer to what would have been the action of the Government if this House had insisted on the provisions which it has desired to eliminate. Under those circumstances the occupants of office would have felt called upon to resign. But the provisions having been insisted upon by another branch of the Legislature, the Government cannot take that step, because no Administration could be responsible to both Houses, and they are, therefore, in, the position of having been flouted by the Senate in regard to a matter of grave public policy. If we are to continue our present system of Government, it will be necessary to have Ministers-whose views are in accord with those of the majority of this House.",64
519,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,I cannot allow the honourable member to proceed.,64
520,Mr GB EDWARDS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I am very sorry, because this is one of the most important considerations: arising in connection with the event which has transpired. A position such as that which has just occurred is likely to arise again and again from time to time, until we shall be forced to acknowledge the necessity for making some constitutional change.",64
521,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,Wentworth) [9.18] - I think that all will recognise that the Government is in a rather awkward position.,65
522,Mr ISAACS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Not at all, though British preference is in an awkward position. - Mr KELLY - A great number of the people of the country will recognise that the Government are entirely responsible for this position. Not only must we consider the embarrassment which the passing of the Bill will occasion the Imperial Government ; but we must also have regard to the good name and credit of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister yesterday explained to the House that the Australian States had entered into certain treaty obligations which would be absolutely infringed if this system of preference, hampered as it is by certain obnoxious details, were given effect to. He therefore strongly urged us, for the sake of the good name and credit of Australia, to make every effort to eliminate these provisions. We have done so, but our attempt has been frustrated, and they still remain in the Bill. Now it is the duty of the Attorney-General to see that the good name of the country is not imperilled by passing the measure as it stands. That duty is higher than his duty to the Ministry's reputation, and what is at stake is more important than the electioneering success of Ministers. The first thing that we should seek to do is to fulfil our obligations. Political parties may occasionally f all short in that regard, but surely the Commonwealth Government will not be found wanting when the good name of Australia is at stake. Why should we endeavour to throw on the Governor General the onus of getting us out of this difficulty? We have too often seen an inclination on the part of some honourable members to allow the High Court to act for us in deciding constitutional questions; but I hope that the House will not descend to the depth of calling upon the Crown to decide Australia's obligations of honour, which is what will happen if the Government seek to pass the Bill in its present form. The only way to safeguard the credit of the Commonwealth is to adopt the course suggested by the honourable and learned member for Angas. The Government have done their best by these proposals to grant a preference to 2 per cent, of British trade. I admit that their best was not well advised or well thought out, but they have done what they could according to their lights; and the duty now devolves upon them to secure the honouring of the obligations of Australia, and thus to safeguard the good name of the countrycommitted to their charge.",65
523,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,Franklin) [9.20] There is just one point that I think we should carefully consider.,65
524,Mr MAHON,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,That is the matter of going home ,65
525,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Yes ; and it is .regrettable that so many important measures should have been submitted for our consideration after the majority of honourable members have gone to their homes. We are now proposing to place the Governor General in a position that he should not be asked to occupy. The Prime Minister very distinctly pointed out that the treaty obligations of Great Britain would preclude us from imposing certain conditions. We know very well that in the pre-Federation days the States gave in their adherence to the treaties entered into by Great Britain, and there is no doubt that these agreements are binding on the Commonwealth, which took over the obligations of the States. The two Houses have disagreed with regard to the provisions which should be embodied in the:Bill-tw o Houses elected on exactly the same franchise. One would imagine from the way in which some honourable members speak that the Senate was a kind of Legislative Council, but it is returned by exactly the same electors as are the members of this House. The Senate has taken a view different from that adopted by us in regard to the measure, and the Governor General is to be called upon to override the decision of one House or the other. The British Board of Trade have told us that the Bill in its present form will not prove acceptable, and yet the Government propose to ask the representative of the Crown to assent to it.",65
526,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,Who prevented the Bill from being made acceptable ?,65
527,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"The prime cause of the difficulty was the amendment proposed by a member of the Labour Party, a partu that has been applying the spur to the Government throughout this session. The Government were told by the Opposition, that if they cared to recommit the Bill , in order to remove the objectionable provision, the Opposition would assist them; but they had not the pluck to adoDt that course. Instead of the present difficulty being due to the action of the Opposition, it is solely attributable ""to the ineptitude of the Government arid to their inability to properly carry on the business under the spur of the Labour Party, which is now springing at their throats. The preference proposed to be given to Great Britain is a mere sham, and a deliberate insult to those who are really desirous of conferring upon the mother land some reallysubstantial commercial advantage. The Government have gone the length of dragging the Governor General through the mire ot party politics, in order to secure the passing of a measure which could not, under any circumstances, confer an appreciable benefit.",65
528,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"Moira) [9.30] - It is quite refreshing to hear honourable members opposite bemoaning the loss of a measure; in regard to which they have throughout taken up an attitude either of hostility or indifference. The first evidence we had ot the - desire of honourable members for preferential trade was that afforded by their honest efforts to provide remuneration for professional burglars in connection with the Preservation of Australian Industries Bill. When the British preference proposals were introduced, objections were raised by honourable members opposite, one after another of whom uttered the old Darrot cry that no preference could possibly be given to the old country without a reduction of duty in every instance. We were told that the increase of duties against foreigners to the extent of 10 per cent, would confer no advantage upon the manufacturers of Great Britain. The deputy leader of the Opposition directed ^articular attention to the fact that if these preference proposals were lost-and I admit that the'- have been rendered absolutely valueless-the blame would rest entirely unon the Government. But, as a matter of fact, the present position has been brought about by the action of the Opposition. What course did they adopt when the vote was taken upon the proposal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie? With one or two exceptions they absolutely refused to vote.",66
529,Mr KELLY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"That statement, is absolutelv incorrect.",66
530,Mr HUME COOK,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,It is quite true.,66
531,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I say without hesiI tation that in mv humble opinion the that this Bill has been rendered valueless is wholly duo to the action of honourable members opposite. They have merely acted in accordance with the crv of their leader at the last election, that no preference could be given to the mother country.",66
532,Mr SPEAKER,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,The one question before the Chair is. whether or not we shall insist upon the amendment recommended by the Governor General. The honourable member must not debate any extraneous matters.,66
533,Mr KENNEDY,PACIFICISLAND LABOURERS,"I agree with much that was said by the honourable and learned member for Angas. I have a great Tespect for his opinion, because I recognise that he is absolutely fair. He put the question before us very clearly and concisely. No ope realizes more fully than I do that the Bill, even if it be assented to, will not confer anything like the modicum of preference that we desire to give to the old country. I trust that the next Parliament will be able to carry into effect the principle to which we have given our adherence. I am sure that any Government that will make oreferential trade one of the principal planks in its platform will have the country solidly behind it. Question resolved in the affirmative.
