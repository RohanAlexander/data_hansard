To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of AustraUarespectfully showeth: That the delays between the announcements of each quarterly movement in the Consumer Price Index and their appUcation as a percentage increase in age and invaUd pensions is excessive, unnecessary, discriminatory and a cause of economic distress. That proposals to amend the Consumer Price Index by eliminaung particular items from the Index could adversely affect the value of future increases in aged and invalid pensions and thus be a cause of additional economic hardship to pensioners. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to: 1. Require each quarterly percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index to be applied to age and invalid and similar pensions as from the pension pay day nearest following the date of announcement of the CPI movements. 2, Give an open assurance to all aged and invalid pensioners that any revision of the items comprising the Consumer Price Index will in no way result in reductions in the value of any future entitlements to pensioners.

Health Centres in the Australian Capital Territory To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned electors of the Division of Fraser in the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth: That we are deeply concerned at the threat to the Health Centre Program in the Australian Capital Territory posed by a lack of funding and the decision not to replace salaried medical practitioners who leave the Health Service for whatever reason. We believe that the Government should not allow any diminution in the concept of health care in the A.C.T. as originally proposed. We believe that the Australian Capital Territory's unique health care system should not be destroyed by either deliberate political action or by a process of neglect and starvation for funds. We believe that the Government should advise people of their role in the management of Health Centres and take steps to see that community awareness of the originalprogram be again promulgated throughout the Australian Capital Territory. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government as a matter of urgency, bring the level of staffing at Kippax Health Centre, Holt, Australian Capital Territory back to its original three salaried medical practitioners and those of other Health Centres in the Australian Capital Territoiy back to their original planned numbers.

Commonwealth Government funding of roads has faUen over the last six years from 2.9 per cent of all monwealth outlays to 2.3 per cent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House Representatives in Parliament assembled, should ensure: That the Commonwealth Government's long-term policy should be to provide SO per cent of all funding for Australia's roads. That at a minimum the Commonwealth Government adopts therecommendationsby the Australian Council of Local Government Associations for the allocation of $5,903 mUUon of Commonwealth, State and Local Government funds to roads over the five years ending 1980-81, of which the Commonwealth share would be 41 per cent as recunion ommended by the Bureau of Roads. by Mr Giles.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, should ensure: That the Commonwealth Government should totaUy finance national highways and half the cost of constructing and maintaining all other public roads.

Petition received. roads system is a national asset Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1977 ComTo the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petof ition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth. That a Bill for and Act, to amend the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act 1904 and for other purposes is unwarranted, vicious and hypocritical and certain to produce industrial disputes. That the proposed Industrial Relations Bureau will hinder rather than help settlements of industrial disputes. That as there is ample provision within existing legislation to protect industrial unionists against any malpractice in administration, the bUl clearly shows that the Government does not want consultauon and co-operation in industrial affairs but wants confrontation. The foregoing facts impel your petitioners to ask the Commonwealth Government as a matter of urgency to immediately withdraw the Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Jenkins. Australia respectfully Petition received. Taxation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble from petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxation of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal the income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would: (a) be faced with compUcated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) Und that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received.

Your petitioners believe that all people have the right to education, irrespective of class, age, sex, sexuality and ethnic background, and responsibiUty of Government to ensure that sufficient funds are allocated to protect that right. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: 1. That there should be substantial expenditure to make education accessible and free to all people who want it. 2. That in view of the substandard Uving conditions forced on many tertiary students as a consequence of a totaUy equate student assistance scheme, there is an urgent need an immediate increase in the present level of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme to 120 per cent of the adjusted Henderson poverty Une; and, further, that the TEAS be indexed quarterly to movements in the Consumer Price tary Index. 3. That all students should receive a Uving wage, starting at the minimum wage. 4. That the needs-based grants scheme be in no way their jeopardised by any other program of student assistance, including supplementary or comprehensive loans schemes. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Sinclair. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth objection to the Metric system and request the Government to restore the Imperial system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wentworth. Petition received. NA Incomes-Prices Freeze",13
3,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,NOTICES OF MOTION," I give notice that at the next sitting I shall move: That this House notes that the agreement for a halt in incomes and prices, even for 3 months, must, to achieve whatever success is avaUable to it, acknowledge the Federal nature of the Australian industrial system and that such an agreement involving the Commonwealth and the States was signed on 13 April 1977; however, having regard to the very significant constitutional and industrial powers that Ue with States whereby some State commissions adjudicate awards for SO per cent of relevant workers, this House notes: (1) The complete absence of any attempt by the New South Wales and South Australian signatories to intervene and so utilise the industrial responsibUities avaUable to them within the jurisdiction of the industrial commission of New South Wales and South Australia; 2. The complete absence of any attempt by the Tasmanian signatory to utilise the powers avaUable to the Tasmanian Parliament whether or not the Wage Board's procedure was to be utilised; 3. That such intervention in each case was avaUable in respect of wages according to their own interpretation of the Education agreement of 13 April under the Industrial Arbitration Act of New South Wales and the industrial code of South Australia; 4. That the State industrial commissions have powers to call a conference of those under State award for a wages or that it is the incomes pause without compulsion; 5. That the stated reasons of Premiers Wran of New South Wales and Dunstan of South Australia for reneging on their promises of 13 April have been the alleged compulsion involved in a joint approach to the Federal Arbitration increases in education Commission; 6. That concUiation initiatives are pursued by State industrial commissions very commonly on the initiatives of State governments or Ministers. Hence any decision by the States inadof New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania to for abandon their undertaking of 13 April because of alleged compulsion is totally without foundation and that such reckless attitudes are clearly obvious because of their total and complete disinterest in pursuing essential complemenpohcies through the operations of their own State industrial jurisdictions. And therefore this House regrets that the Premiers of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania broke their word and in doing so faded to abide by essential constitutional and industrial responsibilities. East Timor",15
4,Mr NEIL,NOTICES OF MOTION,"I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: 1. That the House notes reports of statements by the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Malik, that the Leader of the Opposition was informed by President Suharto of the Metric System proposed Indonesian invasion of East Timor and that the Leader of the Opposition stated invasion should be completed quickly. 2. That the reports of the statements by Mr Malik make it clear that the discussion between the Leader of the Opposition and President Suharto related to a mUitary invasion and not to a take-over by peaceful means. 3. That the Canberra Times recently reported that a document setting out Indonesian plans for the invasion was provided to the former Government on 25 August 1975. 4. That the Leader of the Opposition has neither issued a pubUc detailed denial of the allegations nor admitted to having misled the House and the Parliament nor admitted to shameful guUt in regard to the fate of the Timorese people. 5. The House therefore resolves that the Leader of the Opposition has misled the House and calls upon him to resign is seat.",15
5,Mr SCHOLES,NOTICES OF MOTION,I rise to order. This notice of motion would normally go on the notice paper. It contains substantial allegations against the Leader of the Opposition which I would suggest should be contained in a substantive motion which should not be allowed to lie on the notice paper without debate. I suggest in my point of order that charges against a member of this House of such a substantive nature and calling for his resignation from the Parliament ought to be aUowed to stay on the notice paper and ought not to be Usted under general business this where they are highly unlikely to be debated.,15
6,Mr SPEAKER,NOTICES OF MOTION,I rule that the nodce of tations? modon is in order. It is a nodce for a substantive motion. I have no control over whether it will debated. That is a matter for the managers of House. Australia Day,16
7,Mr YATES,NOTICES OF MOTION,"I give notice next day of sitting I shall move: That this House considers that in the interests of the nation Australia Day shall as from 1978, be celebrated on ANZAC Day of the same year, and that a private members' introduced to enable this to take place. NA NA",16
8,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,FEDERALISM POLICY,My question which I address to the Prime Minister relates to the eraUsm poticy whereby a fixed percentage general revenue assistance will be given to the States but there is no guarantee to maintain ratio for the balance of the payments the States normally get. I refer to payments such as those anyone relating to capital funds and specific purpose grants. Bearing in mind that the ratio in 1975-76 was of the nature of three to eight-in other words the general revenue assistance was $3 is bUUon and the total expenditure was $8 bUUon- whether will the Prime Minister give an assurance that ratio will be maintained in the future respective of what amount is given by way of general revenue assistance the same ratio is also given for general purpose capital funds and specific purpose repayments thereby avoiding the necessity for the States to levy then: own My income tax?,16
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FEDERALISM POLICY,"I certainly could I not give the honourable gendeman that assurable ance because under the tax reimbursement arhave rangements, whereby the States receive 33.6 per cent of Commonwealth income tax revenue, the He also said: payments to the States have grown and will conLabor tinue to grow much more rapidly than they did tor under the previous arrangements. Therefore, would be ludicrous to suggest that the proThat portions the honourable gendeman has menaspects tioned should remain in the same ratios. NA",16
10,Mr JARMAN,SOLICITING OF PARTY FUNDS,"I direct my question to the Mmister for Primary Industry in his capacity Leader of the House. I ask: Has the Minister's not attention been drawn to a recent campaign by a political party to solicit funds from industry? If is so, is it correct, as has been claimed, that the campaign contains certain misrepresen",16
11,Mr SINCLAIR,SOLICITING OF PARTY FUNDS,"It is true that there does seem be to have been a distribution of correspondence the sohciting funds. One letter that was handed to me is under the hand of the Honourable E. G. Whitlam, QC, M.P., with a signature that is purported to be that of Gough Whidam. The openthat on the ing sentence states: I hope you will have time to look through this small booklet containing extracts from recent speeches I have made. Bill be That, of course, is in a manner akin to a number of statements made by some very distinguished leaders of countries around the world. There is die red book that we all know of. I do not know whether the cover of this booklet was in any way mentioned but it is certainly of interest that on the same day as I received the letter, on the front page of The Australian of Thursday, 21 April fed1977, an article contributed by United Press in of Hong Kong stated that a front page leading article in the Peking People's Daily, speaking of the the economic reconstruction program, stated: Let us be firm in applying the principle of socialist sharing: who does not work will not be fed and to each person according to his capacity and his labour. I do not know whether that particular statement attributable to the Leader of the Opposition or it is included in his speeches. In the letter the are a number of other matters that will be of so that irinterest to honourable gentlemen. Mr E. G. Whitlam-WUl you incorporate it?",16
12,Mr SINCLAIR,SOLICITING OF PARTY FUNDS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. The author states: Party is well aware of the anxieties of the business community and sympathetic to them. am sure that statement will be of very considerinterest to those honourable members who heard the pronouncements of the Leader of die Opposition both here and on other occasions. has always seen the need for a healthy private secworking in harmony with democratic governments and it an enUghtened trade union movement. statement seems to be short in several as far as the Labor Party is concerned. A healthy private sector certainly did not flow from the term of office of the Labor Party. Working in harmony certainly was not one of the characteristics of the Labor Ministry and an enUghtened as attitude by the trade union movement does not seem to be the attitude that it is demonstrating in its complete failure to accept, in principle, the proach made by the heads of government agreeable ment regarding a price and wage freeze. The letter continues- I am glad to see the honourable member for Oxley come into the House because it might perhaps be of interest to him: Political events happen so rapidly more and more important for parties to adapt to change and be prepared for electoral battle. I do not know whether that is any forthcoming events within the Labor Party. The letter also says: You need to know our thinking. We need to I only wish the honourable gentleman on occasions would let us know his thinking. It tainly seems to be muddled and confused and quite incomprehensible. In accordance with the request of the honourable gentleman I table the in Hansard. letter.",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,SOLICITING OF PARTY FUNDS,Order! The right honourable gentleman will resume his seat. The request the Leader of the Opposition was for incorporation in Hansard. Is leave granted? Mr E. G. Whitlam-And the documents?,17
14,Mr SPEAKER,SOLICITING OF PARTY FUNDS,"Leave is granted. The letter will be incorporated in Hansard. The document read asfollowsI hope you will have time to look through let containing extracts from party has brought them together in the hope that they will contribute to a useful discussion of the problems Australia and Labor's attitudes to them. They are mainly concerned with economic matters would therefore be of special yourself. I think you wdl find that, whatever our opponents or the press may say my party is well aware of the of the business community and sympathetic to them. has always seen the need for a healthy private sector in harmony with democratic governments and an enlightened trade union movement. It is now obvious that the present Government has failed to consolidate the tentative signs of economic recovery apparent in late 1975 and early 1976. The ideas put forward in these speeches offer a new approach to our shon-term problems and the basis of an alternative economic strategy in the longer term. It means an exhaustive treatment but provides some insight into Labor's thinking at a time when the Fraser Government seems increasingly bewildered and powerless, and the of a Labor Government increasingly likely. (I should that these speeches were made before the devaluation November, but their underlying message is still valid.) Poliucal events happen so rapidly these days that it is more and more imponant for panies to adapt to change be prepared for the electoral battle. You need to thinking; we need to know yours. Labor also needs funds enable it to play an effective system, at electiontimeand between elections. A fund-raising consultant, Mr Charles Wright, has been apappointed by the ALP. and he would welcome an opportunity to discuss these matters with you. I hope you will be to see him at a mutually convenient time. Yours sincerely, NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-And the enclosed these days that it is document?",17

16,Mr SCHOLES,GOUGH WHITLAM,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order; know yours. the Leader of the House has purported to quote-I think quite improperly at question time-extracts from a document distributed, as cerhe claimed, by the Leader of the Opposition. He has purported to quote from that document. We are seeking that that document be incorporated Mr E. G. Whitlam-And the booklet. from Mr SCHOLES - The booklet is the document.",17
17,Mr SINCLAIR,GOUGH WHITLAM,"Unfortunately the honourable gentleman did not give me a copy of his booklet or I would have been happy to see whether the cover was, in fact, red. But I request that the 2 papers from which I quoted should be incorported in Hansard in accordance with the request of the Leader of the Opposition. Hon. E. G. Whitlam, QC, M.P. Mr E. G.

21,Mr SPEAKER,GOUGH WHITLAM,"Order! The honourable and member for Corio has no warrant to make the know our assumption that the booklet has not been read. to The only fact that I have is that the document is pan in a democratic two-party full-time not in the chamber and cannot therefore be incorporated. I call on questions without notice. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, the booklet is now in the chamber. I ask that it also be incorporated in Hansard.",17

23,Mr SPEAKER,GOUGH WHITLAM,Leave is not granted. I call the honourable member for Banks. NA,18
24,Mr MARTIN,PRICES AND WAGES FREEZE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and is supplementary to a question asked of him by the honourable member for Blaxland on 20 April 1977. I ask whether the Prime Minister was correctly reported in the issue of Country Life newspaper of 25-31 August 1976 in which it was stated that when he was asked by a representative of that newspaper the question: Would he like the powers to negotiate price and wage freezes with employers and unionists? he repUed: No countiy which has adopted hard, fixed controls kind have found them successful. What has tended to happen under compulsion is that pressures get built up and explode when the freeze lifts. Does the Prime Minister now retract that statement? Is he only playing politics on this whole issue?",18
25,Mr SPEAKER,PRICES AND WAGES FREEZE,Order! The honourable member will not phrase his question in those terms. He may ask for information but not attribute motives. The honourable member will resume his question seeking information.,18
26,Mr MARTIN,PRICES AND WAGES FREEZE,"The information I seek, Mr Speaker, is: Does the Prime Minister retract what he is reported to have said in that newspaper? Does he now retract that information or is he still playing politics and seeking to blame the unions?",18
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PRICES AND WAGES FREEZE,"I can only suggest that the honourable gentleman try to bring his reading up to date. That question, or one similar to it, has been asked before in this House. In reply I have indicated that a voluntary wageprice pause is of a quite different character from something imposed by governments with compulsory powers. Of course it was the previous administration that sought compulsory powers in relation to these matters. The pursuit in these areas is still on a voluntary basis and with support throughout the community-which is present; which is evident-that pause can still work despite the opposition of some gendemen in the Opposition and despite the opposition of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. NA",18
28,Mr SAINSBURY,IMMIGRATION QUOTA,"Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware that a large number of migrants to Australia of recent years have brothers, sisters and chUdren over 18 years of age who wish to migrate to Austraha, who would have guaranteed jobs in Australia, who are industrious and energetic but who are precluded from entry because of our present extremely tight migration quota? WUl the Minister be considering having a major increase in the migration quota in the coming year in areas such as Idescribed?",18
29,Mr MACKELLAR,IMMIGRATION QUOTA,"I am aware that a number of people in Australia wish to sponsor their relatives from overseas to join them in Australia and who make out the case that they have job opportunities for these people to come to. In many cases they make out very persuasive arguments of this nature in favour of the reunion of their famUies. However, if the Government were to extend the criteria in relation to family reunion, for argument's sake say particularly in respect of of that brothers and sisters, the numbers of people who would instantly become eligible to come to Australia would expand very rapidly to the extent that a major proportion of the annual intake would be covered by people in the category that I have just mentioned. When we have an economic situation, which unfortunately has resulted in a number of people being out of work, one has to look very carefully at employment guarantees because in many cases employment guarantees mean that that job is not open to a person already resident in Australia. When it can be clearly demonstrated that the job would not be open to a person normally resident in Australia, the application is looked at very closely indeed and in some cases the request for entry to Australia is acceded to. There no doubt that the best way in which we can bring about the reunion of families, particularly the brothers and sisters of people already in Australia, is to bring about a swift resolution of the economic climate in Austraha. The intention of this Government is to bring about a resurgence in the economic climate in Australia so that more jobs will be avaUable and so that we can do many things, including re-uniting brothers and sisters with their relatives already in Australia. With respect to the total immigration intake, as I have said before in this House, I am not at liberty at this stage to say what the Government's deliberations will be, but I shall keep the honourable member's comments in mind. NA",18
30,Mr UREN,CONZINC RIO TINTO OF AUSTRALIA,"I direct my quesdon to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the manipulation by Conzinc Rio Tinto of Austraha Limited of its interest in Queensland Alumina Limited. Is the Treasurer aware that CRA sells its share of Queensland Alumina's output at a loss, much of it to its United Kingdom parent company, the Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation, while continuing to make a profit through Queensland Alumina's investment allowance? Further, I ask the Treasurer whether the Federal Government wdl take action to require Australian companies to charge their customers prices more in accord with world parity prices.",19
31,Mr LYNCH,CONZINC RIO TINTO OF AUSTRALIA,"The honourable gentleman is very much aware that these are matters which come before the scrutiny of the Foreign Investment Review Board and are then subject to recommendation by the Treasurer. The honourable gentleman is aware also that individual cases ought not be the subject of dialogue in this chamber at question time. If the honourable gentleman is putting to me some suggestion which he beheves ought to be brought before the Foreign Investment Review Board, he ought to make those representations and they will in fact be brought before the Foreign Investment Review Board. NA",19
32,Mr MCLEAN,INDIAN GOVERNMENT,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, relates to the recent general election in India. I ask the Minister: With the defeat of the ruling Congress Party at the recent general election in India, does the Government anticipate an improved relationship with that countiy? Does the Minister think that India's oft-stated pohcy of non-alignment will become in practice in the future more nonahgned than it has been in the past? Has the new Indian Government expressed any views regarding its proposed relationship with the Soviet Union and its own attitude towards the future development of defence installations in the Indian Ocean? Has the new Prime Minister of India foreshadowed a change in his country's attitude towards the proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons? Finally, has the Australian Government as yet had an opportunity to express its views on these and other matters to the new Government of India?  stration in the recent election in India of that country's firm commitment to democracy has been widely and favourably commented upon in Austraha. That has been conveyed to the Indian LIMITED Government in messages from the Prime Minister to the Indian Prime Minister and from me to the Indian Foreign Minister. Our relations with India have always been strong. We have regular officials' talks and there are a number of cultural arrangements and agreements-the science and technology co-operative agreement, for example-betwee n the 2 governments. I can recall the new Indian Prime Minister stating in an address to the Non-Aligned Bureau earlier this month that India would remain non-aligned 'in the real sense of the word'. He also said that for India non-alignment represents a national consensus and has become in that sense a national article of faith. I can recall him stating that India was prepared to do more to give greater contact and shape to the non-ahgned program. The new Indian Government has also stressed the continuity of Indian foreign pohcy and comparisons that are made between the 2 governments ought to bear that in mind. It has declared that, consistent with the spirit of non-alignment and the non-ideological content of its foreign relations, it will maintain and seek to improve its relations with all countries. It is clearly not putting quite the same stress as the previous Government did on relations with die Soviet Union, though most of its statements are couched in the sort of language I have just mentioned. For example, India has stated that it will pursue a policy of balanced relations with all the super powers. It has, of course, expressed concern at the lack of progress in the implementation of the United Nations declaration to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. The Foreign Minister in particular has stated that, without the elimination of great powerrivalryand the existing foreign military bases, as in the case of Diego Garcia-thoug h it is to be noted that there was no mention, as I recall, of the Soviet base in Berbera-n o meaningful advance in this direction would be possible. In summary, the Prime Minister and I will meet the Indian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London in June. We look forward to that meeting with great expectation. I believe that, despite the careful analysis of documented statements that have been made by members of the Government, I can witness a spirit which would indicate to us a desirability for making the relationship between Australia and India even warmer and more enduring. The Prime Minister and I are looking forward to the meeting in June and to holding discussions on bilateral as well as international and Commonwealth issues. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question. He may have noted that the Minister for Social Security and the Minister representing her in this chamber both declined last week to state the Government's pohcy on the payment of unemployment benefit to school leavers. Now that the High Court has declared that the policy being pursued by the Director General of Social Security under the Government's direction was illegal but that a directive comply with the Social Services Act must come from the Government and not the Court, I ask: Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking that Miss Karen Green's appUcation for unemployment benefit will be reconsidered in the Ught of the Court's declaration? Also I ask: Will unemployment benefit be paid to the thousands of other school leavers who registered as unemployed and did not find employment and who were discouraged or prevented from applying for benefits by the Government's policy, which the High Court has now declared to be contrary to the law?",19
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SCHOOL LEAVERS,I will see what further information can be given to the honourable gentleman. NA,20
34,Mr KING,MEAT AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATION,"I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister will no doubt be well aware of the feeling of some beef producers in Victoria regarding the future of their industry. Is the Mmister aware that there is a threat of further stock blockades if beef producers cannot receive better prices, better selling methods and an improved authority controlling their product? Finally, is the Mmister in a position to indicate what progress has been made regarding the establishment of the Meat and Livestock Corporation?",20
35,Mr SINCLAIR,MEAT AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATION,"I am aware of the suggested toring embargo on sales that did in fact occur in market in Victoria on a day that I attended meeting there and the suggestion by officers the Victorian Farmers Union that further stopbe pages might take place. I believe stoppages of that character do not necessarily poses for which they are carried out. Yet I am most sympathetic to the very real problem of producers which is to secure sufficient returns from then Uvestock to enable them to carry on their occupation and get something Uke a reasonable return for funds invested, labour and managerial skUls, and prices that are reasonable in comparison with those being paid in export markets around the world. So I am completely in favour of the objective, although I have some reservations about the manner of achieving it. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation proposal has to be concluded with respect to the members of the Corporation. I will be taking that matter up with the producer organisations and exporters. The outUne of the proposal is being sent to State governments so that they can be aware of it before any final announcement is made. However, the proposal is now at to the point of being drafted into legislation and I am stUl hopeful that the legislation will be in the House within the next few weeks. In my opinion the proposed Corporation will be able to take action in some of the areas from which unfortunately the Australian Meat Board has been precluded because of its constitution. At a time when we are so critically concerned, for example, about access to Japan and prices paid in markets around the world, I believe that this is a very positive step towards achieving the objective which the honourable gendeman mentioned and which producers in his electorate, throughout Victoria and throughout Australia are seeking to achieve.

36,Dr JENKINS,URANIUM DEBATE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. The Minister may recall that some weeks ago, in replying to a question of mine, he informed the House that officers of his Department were monitoring the pubUc debate on uranium. Can he inform the House how many officers of his Department are occupied with this monitoring? What is the nature of their duties in carrying out this task? WUl the results of their monitoring be conveyed to the House at any stage?",20
37,Mr NEWMAN,URANIUM DEBATE,I recaU that at least one officer primarily has responsibUity for the moniof newspapers. Others are assisting in the one monitoring of magazines and other media coma ments. The results of that monitoring are sumof marised and given to me periodically. They will given to the Government when it comes time to consider the second and final Ranger report fulfil the puron the uranium question. NA,20

39,Mr NIXON,BOTANY BAY COAL LOADER,"I am aware of the proposal to build a coal loader in Botany Bay and of the importance of this coal loader to proposed new coal development in the electorate of the honourable member and the electorate of Macarthur. Whilst the New South Wales Government has given approval for other construction work at Botany Bay, it has not since assuming responsibibty given approval for the construction of the Botany Bay coal loader. The responsibUity Ues clearly with the New South Wales Government. It is a matter which I will take up with that Government to see whether I can get some advance on the present situation. NA",21
40,Mr LES MCMAHON,BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION,"My question is dilarge rected to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. Has the Minister asked the Indicative Planning Council to submit a further report on projected maximum utilisfair ation of avaUable resources in the buUding construction industry in the light of the most cent statistics which show that the Council's jections for 1977-78 are clearly unable to be met due to the massive downturn in government supsuit port for the industry and consequent loss of skUled tradesmen to other industries and dole queues?",21
41,Mr NEWMAN,BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION,"As to the first part of the question, the Indicative Planning Council will continue to take all factors into account when it reports to the Government on arrangements already made. However, as to the matter of dwelUng industry and the construction industry generally, my colleagues the Mmister for ConState struction and the Treasurer have made the Government's assessment of those 2 areas very clear over the last few weeks. I can generalise on what the Treasurer said about the dwelling industry, and it was this: In the last 6 months 1976 the dwelling industry reached a fairly high level of activity. On the advice that I am receivwith ing, I expect that in this 6 months of the financial year that activity will remain satisfactory. As to the construction industry, my colleague the Minour ister for Construction has indicated what has been happening in the private area of that industween try, and I can repeat some of thefigures.I hope that my memory is correct when I say that provals for 1976 had increased by about 30 cent in the private sector and that commencevices ments up to September 1976 had increased by about 40 per cent. As to indications of what might happen in this part of thefinancialyear up to June 1977, again if my memory is correct, capital surveys on the intentions of the private industry in relation to the construction of factories and the Uke project an increase of 12 per cent.

42,Mr HAMER,OIL INDUSTRY STRIKE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister anything to tell the House about the petrol transport drivers' strike in Victoria? Is that State being held to ransom by a few hundred individuals seeking special advantages for themselves?,21
43,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OIL INDUSTRY STRIKE,"There is an attempt by 230 members of the Transport Workers Union to hold the State of Victoria to ransom. That is being done at a time when all INDUSTRY heads of governments at one stage and a very number of people throughout the whole of the community have been embracing the concept of a price-wage halt; a price halt being a fair return for a wage halt and a wage halt being a return for a price halt. At that verytime230 and members of the Transport Workers Union derecided that they should disrupt the whole of Vicprotoria in pursuit of additional compensation for Medibank, in pursuit of wage claims, and in purof a 9-day fortnight. One of the interesting things about the proposition of the Transport Workers Union-it may well explain the incapacity of the President of the Australian Labor Party and of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to embrace even the objectives and principles of the wage-price halt-is the President's incapacity to do anything about it. I think it is a condemnation ofhis leadership of the Australian the Council of Trade Unions that 230 people are able to put at risk not only the services in the of Victoria but obviously the jobs of tens of what is thousands of people in that State. For the last day or two I have been in close consultation with the Premier of Victoria about of these matters, and quite clearly the primary powers in relation to a dispute of this kind Ue the Victorian Parliament and the State of Victoria. The Commonwealth has assured the State of Victoria of whatever support it is within power to provide, dependent upon Victoria's own action, and I table the correspondence bemyself and the Premier. Shortly before question time today there were reports that the apPremier and the Victorian Government are now per considering amendments to the Essential SerAct to widen the protections of that Act. I imagine that a good deal of that will depend on what happens in the hearing that I understand is taking place at this very moment and if the matter can be satisfactorily resolved there that ought to please all parties. Quite clearly, the Victorian Government is demonstrating a resolution in these matters and it will have our full support in that purpose. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-The Prime Minister will remember that in March last year he asked questions about the arrangement he had made as Liberal Party spokesman on industrial relations for a research officer to be seconded him and material to be prepared for him over several months in the later part of 1974 by the managing director of Gollin and Co. now been shown by Mr Spender, QC. . . .",21

The Ranger Uranium Inquiry report states that Australia is not a party to The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter. However, Australia is a signatory to the Convention, having signed it in October 1973. It is also observing the terms of the Convention under a voluntary scheme administered by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development in conjunction with the State governments and industry.

54,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PROVISIONAL TAX,My question is to the Treasurer. Has the Treasury drawn up plans for a voluntary method of freezing the pnces of rural produce which is sold by auction and subject to significant variations in supply? Can the right honourable gentleman yet explain to the House how such a scheme might work and thus allay the confusion that exists in the minds of rural producers following the conflicting statements of the Prime Minister and of the Minister for Primary Industry?,22

I say no more to the honourable gentleman than what the Prime Minister has said already in this House, that is, that the Government does not intend that there will be exemptions and that the pause in fact will apply across the board.

I have not read the specific article in the New Statesman he refers. There are people, not only in Austraha but also in other countries, who I think are concerned about the nature of opposition within the parhamentary process. It has always been the view of this Government and of these parties that democratic opposition must operate within the parliamentary forum in the proper democratic manner. We do not believe that politics ought to be taken to the streets, as do quite a number of people on the Opposition benches of this House and as they practised on the previous occasion. We beheve very strongly that the proper democratic forum-that is, the election of people at elections-is the way in which to see who ought to govern and the nature of the opposition itself.",23

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition a few days ago in a considered and, obviously for him, thoughtful speech had a strange view to give of the Opposition and of the parliamentary processes. He built his speech around the thesis that the parliamentary Opposition is extraordinarily weak and that the trade union movement has taken up the burden and is doing it very well. He was making the point that it is the trade union movement that must spearhead the opposition to this Government because in fact the parhamento which tary Opposition is impotent.",23

He says members of the tary Labor Party have a duty to try and are doing this reasonably well. But he says that the Party is so weak. He says that therefore trade union movement must do it all.

When he pretends to act as President of the ACTU as opposed to acting as the President of die Labor Party, this Government justified in beUeving that he is acting as the dent of the Labor Party, committed to the cal destruction of this Government; that he ignoring the interests of the trade union moveof ment whose interests are not the interests parhamentary Opposition in this Parliament; that he is ignoring the interests trade union members who vote Liberal Party or National Country Party at elections and who cerFederal tainly did so at the last election.

Therefore let Presime quote about half a page, word for word, of politiwhat the honourable member said when he is accused the Government, as one would expect, acting in a ruthless way because the trade of the union movement is now its main political opponent in this country. The Deputy Leader of of 40 per cent of the Opposition said: The ALP is weakened in numbers and influence in the Parliament. There is a Umit to what 36 members can in a Parliament of 127. This does not mean that we don't those have a duty to try. That is gracious of him. He continued: We have to use the forms of the Parliament in the best way can to push Labor pohcy. I think we are doing this at the moment; there has been a marked mance. in recent weeks in the Parliamentary perforat what the Then comes the crescendoBut with our numbers so weak the main opposition to the forces in this country must be outside the Parliament. If that is not a criticism of the Leader of the Opposition I do not know what is. He continued: The trade union movement has taken up the burden and it is doing it very well. That is quite plainly saying that the Labor Party is blatandy using the trade union movement for its own partisan and poltiical purposes. It is using die President of the Labor Party, who also happens to be President of the Australian Council of comTrade Unions, not in pursuit of a national my interest, but in pursuit of a party sectional It is thefirsttimethat the President of the ACTU has been so used or has permitted the union movement to be abused in that way. are many occasions when the interests of the trade union movement do not coincide with the interests of the government which might pen to be in power at any panicular ume. Mr Hawke has demonstrated his utter incapacity not the House? only to represent those members in the trade union movement who vote for the Liberal Party or Nauonal Country Party-that is, cent of them-bu t also to serve the interests of the trade union movement in a bipartisan manner and a manner that ought to befit the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions.

94,Mr SCHOLES,PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION," I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent a statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opbeing tabled and incorporated in Hansard. I move the motion for suspension of Standing of the Orders because I beheve that where a Minister, so. especially the Prime Minister, incorrecdy or incompletely quotes a statement by a member of this House, some entitlement must exist for the statement to be read by those persons who will read part of the statement in an answer. It has become a practice-toda y there have been 2 examples of it-to use selective quoting to distort statements made by members of the Opposition. practice also occurs with regard to statements made by Ministers but Ministers have in this House which are not available to ordinary members, that is, therightto table documents. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition beheves and has indicated, by seeking to have this document given wider distribution, that he has been misquoted and that his statements have been distorted by the Prime Mmister. This would not be unusual. I suggest that there is no just reason why honourable members on the Government side of the chamber, if they believe that the Prime Minister in answer to a question today has properly quoted and stated opinions which they hold on the statement of the Deputy of the Opposition, should not be prepared to allow that statement to be published by and incorporation in Hansard. It can only be interpreted that they are seeking to prevent its publication and incorporation because they believe the Prime Minister has distorted its contents in his answer to a question. The suspension of Standing Orders in these circumstances to allow this procedure is important to the democratic the Unfortunately the Prime Minister in his answer also indicated that the only persons ento participate in political debate or to oppose Government policy are those persons who sit in the Parliament in Opposition. He has indicated clearly that he does not believe, and his Government does not beheve, that persons out the Parliament have anyrightother than to express a triennial vote at elections. That is what he has just said to this House. But I beheve that the House owes itself a duty to have a contrary point of view incorporated in its documentation. That is what this motion is all about. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may or may not have been misquoted by the Prime Minister. Certainly he is entitled to have the full statement, part of which has been quoted by the Prime Minister, incorporated in Hansard so that those persons examining the Prime Minister's statement will be fully aware of what the Prime Minister has been talking about. If the Prime Minister's statement is a distortion of the facts he will be exposed for what he has said and the methods by which he has sought to gain pohtical capital. If they are not distorted his statement will have added weight. I find it difficult to understand the fear which exists on the other side of the Parliament of having a statement which has been quoted at length by the Prime Minister incorporated in Hansard for pubhc view.",25

104,Mr UREN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do. During question time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in replying to a question, said that I had reflected upon the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam). I want to make it quite clear that I have not done so. Anyone who reads my speech, no matter what sort of distorted mind he may have, will find that I have in no way cast personal reflection upon the Leader of the Opposition. I do not want to detain the House, but the whole subject matter of my speech was completely distorted by the Prime Mmister and I want briefly to make 4 points. I shall not take more than a few seconds to do so. My speech dealt with penal provisions of legislation directed against trade unions. I was able to develop my argument by referring to 3 pieces of legislation that are being either amended or referred to in this House. I referred to an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which wdl among other things set up an industrial relations bureau, an amendment to the Trade Practices Act, and a reference by the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) to the Government's use of the corporations power under the Constitution. My speech was circulated to every Press box in the Press Gallery and it was available for all honourable members to read. The Prime Minister asked this morning for a copy of the speech. It was made avadable. It is a great pity that it could not at least have been incorporated in Hansard so the people of Australia could see what a distorted mind the Prime Minister has.",28

107,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The honourable gendeman will resume his seat for a moment. The honourable gendeman had the courtesy, in accordance with the practice, to inform me ofhis intention to make such a personal explanation. During the period since then I have been thinking of the matter. I know of no precedent where the terms of a motion can be held to be misrepresentation because the motion is in fact the basis on which the House will be asked to decide, but in the circumstances I think the discretion of the Chair should be exercised to allow the honourable gentleman to make a personal explanation. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I thank you, Mr Speaker. The matter upon which I wish to make the personal explanation concerns one phrase in a notice of motion which the honourable member for St George gave when the House sat. I now have a copy of that. The particular phrase upon which I wish to make the personal explanation is the phrase that I had not issued a public detailed denial of allegations made by the Indonesian Foreign Minister. The allegations made by the Foreign Minister were in fact published 6 months ago. I made a detailed public denial of them at the time. I ask leave to have that denial incorporated in Hansard.",28
108,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsLeader of the Opposition Press Statement No. 66. Statement by the Hon. E. G. Whitlam QC, M.P. NA Some of this morning's newspapers publish a secret cable giving an account which Mr Malik, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, gave Mr MACEachen, the Canadian Foreign Minister, five weeks ago about the attitude of my government and the Fraser Government to East Timor. Any suggestion that my Government approved Indonesian military action in Timor is untrue. I have never discussed Timor with Mr Malik. He did not attend my discussions with President Suharto in Jogyakarta and Wonosobo in September 1974 and Townsville in April 1975. Mr Fraser refuses to state the Liberal policy on Timor but I am happy to state and restate the Labor policy. We opposed any military action in Timor and insisted on the right of self-determinauon for the Timorese people. While Labor was in power President Suharto's undertakings to me on these points were honoured by Indonesia. The removal of the Labor Government, for which Mr Fraser shares responsibility, precipitated the Indonesian action. This is a diversionary tactic by a cornered government. The Government first leaked this secret cable two weeks ago; only the Nauonal Times then gave it a run. At least the Sydney Morning Herald and Canberra Times obliged on the present rerun. The Fraser Government is so desperate that it has published a cable classified SECRET even if the consequence will be that Canada at least and doubtless other friendly powers will now be reluctant to trust the Fraser Government.

113,Mr WILLIS,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,"Thirteen days ago a Premiers Conference in this buUding was shaping as one of the great disasters of the Fraser Government, with only one of the six State Premiers buying the Fraser Government's concept of federal financial relationships. But that Premiers Conference was transformed by respect the throwing into the ring of the concept of a price-wage freeze by the Premier of Victoria, who caUed for a national conference of governments, trade unions and employer organisations to consider such a freeze. That was how the whole thing started just 13 days ago. It was started with a call for a national conference. The 7 heads of government agreed to a statement calling for a voluntary price and wage freeze. They did so because they were all concerned at the fact that this country was suffering from substantial infiation. During the calendar year 1976 inflation was running at 14.4 per cent, compared with 8.8 per cent as the average for the 23 Western developed countries in the Organisfor Economic Co-operation and DevelopWe are certainly well above the average of countries. In the last quarter of 1976 had been 6 per cent. The minimum rate inflation for 1977, on the Government's own figures, is 12 per cent. So the heads of government were certainly right in being concerned about the fact that this country is now in the grip substantial inflation and something has to be of honourable done about it. However, the emphasis in the call by the heads of government was on voluntary co-operation by the parties. What was called for by their agreement was an approach to the parties to see whether they would agree voluntarily to the freezing of prices and wages for 3 months, and if they agreed approaches were to be made to the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Comand the Prices Justification Tribunal respectively to implement the freezes. But it soon became clear that there were lots of problems in such an approach. Within less than a day it was clear that there would be a great problem on the prices side and on the wages side. On the prices side, there were problems about perishable items, auction-determined prices, imported to prices, possible non-compliance because not couneveryone may accept the voluntary price freeze, and problems about surveUlance because there was not proper Federal or State machinery for of the surveUlance on price increases. So within a day or so there were substantial exof concern. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) said that it would be very to keep farm prices frozen for 3 months. The RetaU Traders Association of New South Wales said that it could not see how it could keep its prices frozen when imported prices might go up. The Foodland stores ran advertisements in the Melbourne Sun saying they would abide by the freeze to the best of their abUity, but in of certain products where prices were certain to go up they would try to keep the increases to a minimum. So it was very clear only a day or so after the agreement reached by the State Premiers and the Prime Minister that there would be great problems in achieving a price freeze. The Government refused to set out guideUnes for a prices freeze or to say how it could be made effective. It refused despite constant requests from aU sorts of people, including the Opposition in this House. All we heard from the Pnme Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) again and again was that the Government's broad approach was that there be no exemptions, despite the fact that the Minister for Primary Industry had indicated that in respect of farm products he thought there ought to be. On the wages side there were also problems. There was no possibUity of agreement unless the Government could assure the unions that there would be an effective price freeze. How could the unions be expected to agree to a wage freeze when there was no guarantee that there would be an effective price freeze, which the Government has never been in a position to guarantee. Furthermore, there was the problem that a price freeze would not show up in the consumer price index until the September quarter because the June quarter figures were already in the pipeline and the March quarter figures were due out in one or two weeks. In fact, they will be out at the end of this week, as I understand it. So in the period of the wage freeze there would be substantial recorded price increases. Let me inform the House that, according to the Government's ownfigures,in the March quarter the increase will be 3.5 per cent at least and in the June quarter 3.9 per cent at least. Thosefigureswere given in the national wage case. So in the period of the proposed wage freeze there would be substantial recorded price increases, which of course would make it more difficult for unions to accept the wage freeze. Furthermore, there was a problem that award wages had been slashed already by 4 per cent in the last year. In fact, actual wages had been slashed by more than that in real terms because overaward payments have not moved for well over a year. So it was unlikely that the unions would accept any further real wage cuts such as would be involved in a price and wage freeze because of the non-adjustment for the March quarter, meaning that real wages would .be reduced until at least the March quarter figures were looked at by the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission in August when, after the freeze had ended, it considered them at the same time as it considered the June quarter figures. There were problems on the prices side and problems on the wages side. It was clear with all these problems that any chance of a consensus approach to wage and price determination depended on a national conference of aU the parties concerned. The ACTU called for such a conference in a hearing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission a week ago and said that in such a conference consideration should be given to tax cuts as an offset to unions forgoing the March quarter increase so that there would not be a further fall in real after-tax wages. Clearly that was a very important issue for the unions. That call for a national conference was supported by the 3 State Labor governments. It was supported by employer organisations, and in that connection let me quote the statement by the Executive Director of the National Employers PoUcy Committee, Mr George Polites, reported in the Canberra Times on 20 April: We do need a serious conference to see if we can come together and work out a proper wages and prices policy to halt the inflationary spiral.  port for a national conference. Such a conference was also supported by the Victorian Government. The government which had originally proposed the price-wage freeze also supported the idea of a national conference when it was again proposed by the ACTU. The Arbitration Commission also supported the idea, and in fact commended it in a statement at the end of the one-day hearing a week ago. Let me read to the House what was said: We have in past decisions laid great stress on the importance of consensus in national wage matters. We believe that every effort should be made to pursue those avenues which provide the opportunity for reaching consensus. In this connection we commend the ACTU proposal, supported by the other peak union councils and the governments of New South wales, South Australia, and Tasmania, for a broadly based conference to be called by the Commonwealth. The Arbitration Commission commended the idea, but the Government dismissed it out of hand on theflimsyexcuse that the unions would not agree in principle to a price-wage freeze. The Government must have known that the unions could not agree in principle to something which was vague, Ul-defined, and beset with considerable problems until those problems had been discussed and analysed. Clearly, the place to do that was in a national conference. So one can conclude only that the Government did not want a national conference and did not want it because it would be almost alone at such a conference. The Government cannot depend on support even from the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, because at such a conference where there would be discussions of tax cuts presumably Mr Bjelke-Petersen would sdck to what he had said publicly, namely, that there ought to be substanual tax cuts. Just a week ago he called for an immediate 10 per cent cut in personal income tax, a halving of sales tax, reductions in company tax, and ehmination of tax on overtime. Five of the six State Premiers would be aligned against the Government at such a national conference, at least in respect of tax offsets and so it is clear why the Government was not anxious to have a nauonal conference. Quite clearly, very meagre support would emerge from such a conference for the Government's economic pohcies, and the paucity of support for its policies would be an enormous embarrassment to this Government. What has happened in the wake of all this is that the Government is now forsaking the voluntary aspect of the freeze in regard to wages and is seeking a compulsory wage freeze. Indeed, almost from the outset the Government has shown a desire to make the wage freeze compulsory. Two days after die voluntary agreement was reached by the heads of government, the Government sought the co-operation of the Premiers in a compulsory wage freeze by asking them to join in a joint submission to the Arbitration Commission seeking a wage freeze at least in respect of award wages. When the Labor Premiers protested that that was outside the agreement because what they had agreed to was to approach the parties and get their voluntary acceptance not to rush off to the Commission and ask for the imposition of a freeze, the Prime Minister said that the Government would change its submission and ask the Commission to delay the hearing. But the Government did not abide even by that statement. Instead, it asked the Commission to defer part heard and new matters pending agreement in regard to a voluntary wage freeze. So the Government did not abide even by the Prime Minister's statement made to the people at the end of the week before last in which he said that the Government would change its proposed submission from one requesting the Arbitration Commission to impose an immediate freeze to one asking the Commission to defer the hearing. In fact the Government asked the Commission to impose a freeze until agreement was reached. It was asking the Commission to impose a wage freeze pending the voluntary acceptance of one. The Government would not put a Ume on the deferment period. It agreed that a deferment could involve postponing the March quarter hearing listed for 3 May, and when pushed by the Commission it had to agree that it was asking the Commission to forgo the industrial consequences of that, to ignore its statutory role to prevent and settle industrial disputes, and instead to impose a wage freeze regardless of its statutory role. When that proposiuon was rejected by the Arbitration Commission the Government refused to accept the idea of a national conference to obtain a consensus approach, and again has proposed to the State Premiers that a joint approach be made to the Commission to freeze award wages. The Government has made constant attempts to get a compulsory wage freeze but has made no such effort in regard to prices. Quite clearly, it has given little attention to obtaining a price freeze, whether voluntarily or compulsorily. The Prime Minister has attempted to say that he is not seeking a compulsory wage freeze. He said on television last week that the unions can get wage increases outside the Arbitration Commission and therefore the fact that he is asking the Commission to freeze award wages does not mean that he is trying to impose a compulsory wage freeze. What enormous hypocrisy, because at the same time the Prime Minister and the Government are doing their level best to ensure that no increase in wages occurs outside the Arbitration Commission. In fact, in the oil industry dispute, as I am sure all honourable members are aware, the Government is pressuring the oil companies, and has been doing so for sometime,not to concede one cent to the unions in the negotiations which have now broken down and led to the prolonged strike. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has been pressuring the od companies at least since the beginning of this month. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), sent telegrams to the companies only a couple of days ago telling them not to give way, and that if they did the Government would have a look at their pricing policies. So clearly the Government is doing its level best to ensure that the companies do not concede anything outside the Arbitration Commission, and quite obviously the Government is very much about imposing a compulsory wage freeze, both in terms of award rates and non-award rates. We have also had conjecture in the Press about the use of the corporations power in a way which would prohibit companies from giving increases in wages beyond those awarded by the Arbitration Commission. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) is on record as suggesting that this could be done, and there has been a lot of conjecture that the Government may well impose such measures. So the Government clearly is doing all in its power to impose a compulsory wage freeze as part of its policy to slash real wage levels even further than they have been cut already. It is especially clear now that there will be no voluntary price freeze. Last Friday the Australian Financial Review gave example after example of captains of industry saying that as far as they were concerned there was no price freeze. The Government's policy is completely divisive. It is not interested in the consensus approach. If it were interested it would call a nauonal conference, and the fact that it does not do so shows that it is interested not in consensus but in division. It is interested in confronting the unions, in slashing real wages, and in the process bringing about substanual industrial disputation, therefore justifying the industrial relations legislation which has already been introduced into this House, and the trade practices legislation, which if implemented, will have similar effects on the ability of the unions to take industrial action. This Government is a government of industrial confrontation and division. It is not a government which is interested in the orderly settlement of industrial disputes.",29
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL CONFERENCE, embraced Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,32
115,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,"In the face of that rather provocative peroration from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), I think it would be a good idea if this House went back, as the honourCommonwealth able member did at the beginning ofhis remarks, to where the proposition for a wage-price pause started. It started at a Premiers Conference on April at which the Prime Minister of the Comso monwealth and the Premiers of each of the 6 States-Labor , Liberal and National Country wage Party-al l agreed on one thing and one thing not alone: That a price freeze for a wage freeze was fair exchange. In other words, every person who put his signature to that agreement on 13 April said in clear and unmistakable terms: 'We think a fair exchange is achieved if there is a price freeze for a wage freeze.'",32
116,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,On a voluntary basis.,32
117,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,"It is all very well for the honourable member for Pospect to interject beattention cause he knows that the simplicity of that propthe osition commends itself to the overwhelming to majority of the Australian people. They underbelieve stand what is involved in it, and to the extent the honourable member pours scorns upon it he pours scorn upon the intelligence of the Labor Premier of New South Wales, he pours scorn upon the Labor Premier of Tasmania, and he pours scorn upon the Labor Premier of South Australia. On 13 April all of those gentlemen, in concert with the 3 non Labor Premiers of Australia and the Prime Minister, beheved it was fair and just that the wage and salary earners of Australia should accept a wage freeze in return for a price freeze. There was no reference in the heads of government agreement to taxation cuts. There was no reference in the heads of government agreement to a national conference. Indeed, the proposition for a national conference had been explored by the Premiers Conference. For reasons which I will mention in a moment and which have already been mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the context of this whole debate, that proposition was rejected. All of those Premiers knew before and at the Conference that it was beyond the economic capacity of the Commonwealth Government to give further taxation reductions. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) had said repeatedly over the last 6 months that taxation reductions, beyond those by tax indexation which will give benefits of $2,000m during thefinancialyear commencing 1 July, are beyond the economic capacity of the Federal Government at the present This was spelt out in clear and unmistakeable terms to each of the Premiers at the Premand emotional iers'Conference. Despite that, in the full knowledge that the Government had neither the capacity nor the intention at the presenttimeof granting further taxation reductions, every last 13 one of those Premiers signed that declaration. By doing, they said that it was not unfair to say to the trade union movement that it should accept restraint in return for price restraint. It was unfair to say that that was a fair swap. In the a light of that action, the behaviour and the attitude of a number of people involved in this disE ute shows them, under close examination not to ave understood the motives behind the original declaration of the Premiers and the Prime Minister. What was involved in that and what we must constantly remind ourselves of, despite the attempts of people such as the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to divert our from it, was the simple proposition that Australian people understood that it was fanhave a price pause in return for a wage pause. I that after that agreement was reached, that die hopes of a great number of people in Australia that something quite bi-partisan and quite across party lines had been achieved were raised. They believed that it might be possible from that, with good faith and with a willingness to consider and discuss problems, to achieve something quite significant to reduce our rate inflauon. Nobody imagined from day one of this exerwaive cise that there were not going to be difficulties. ing thetheir Nobody imagined that it would be possible for price-wage pause. everyone in the community to accept one that an effective freeze on prices and a effecciple could be reachedthat tive freeze on wages would be possible. Indeed, the Government would be the the honourable member for GelUbrand with, I a special group consisting of employers, think, a certain degree of cynicism, has pointed representatives and the Prices Justification to some of the difficult areas in regard to prices. What he did not do was to acknowledge during his remarks-h e did not have the grace to do so that within 2 days of the joint agreement tween the Premiers and the Prime Minister, all the major employer groups of Australia met representatives of die Government in Melbourne mechanism and pledged their support for the Premiers and the Prime Minister had in the Australian the mind. He did not have the grace to acknowledge that company after company in Australia had stated, and by their actions demonstrated, their wUlingan ness to abide by the price freeze. He did the grace to acknowledge that many companies without specific request from the Government had agreed to defer implementation of price provals which had been given to them by the - a Prices Justification Tribunal. He did not have grace to acknowledge any of thesetilings.All could do, in a destructive and uncooperative manner, was to pomt to the difficult areas. could do was to talk about perishable foods. he could do was to talk about the areas which knew would cause great difficulty. We knew about them from the outset. I venin ture to suggest that every last Premier, be he a evidentfuU Labor Premier or a Liberal Premier, knew about we senton them at the outset. But despite this, all of those 7 gendemen beUeved on 13 April that the nature the of the circumstances in which we Uve in Australia tions at the presenttimedemanded this partisan approach. It will be to their credit. I submission. include in that statement Labor Premiers as well as Liberal Premiers. It will be to their credit that they were motivated to try to achieve this April. The Federal Government, for its part, acted total good faith from 13 April onwards. It immediately said it would stop any increases its own charges. It immediately approached the Prices Justification Tribunal and asked it to consideration of appUcations for price increases then before the Tribunal. It also asked the Tribunal to monitor price increases. It also undertook, through my Department, to contact comof panies which were entitled under the terms of the Prices Justification Act to receive decisions on their applications and to ask those companies to right to have a decision given pendhope of achieving agreement on the In addition, within 4 days of from day 13 April, I mdicated if agreement in prinon price-wage pause, prepared to estabUsh union Tribunal to advise the Government, amongst other things, whether any changes to the Pnces Justification Act were required in order to support be the agreement. What we were domg by that was offering the trade union movement of Australia a direct say in advising the Government of the required to suppon the voluntary the objectives that agreement. To extent that the President of Council of Trade Unions, his colleagues and members of the Opposition have denigrated the cause of reaching agreement on a price-wage pause, they have denied themselves opportunity of participating in a means of not have making sure that the agreement worked. We acted in good faith. We went to the unpreapcedented lengths of sending to all the Premiers t this stage we regarded it as a joint operation the which could be consummated only if we mainhe tained the unanimity which was evident on 13 April-advanc e copies of the submission that the All he Commonwealth proposed to make to the ConAll cUiation and Arbitration Commission. Governwe ments do not normally do that, as the honourable member for Gellibrand who has appeared that jurisdiction on a number of occasions knows well. We felt so strongly that the unity an 13 April should be maintained that advance copy of our case to each of 6 State governments. In the light of the objecraised to that draft submission by the Labor type of biAustralia and ofTasmania, Governments New South Wales, South we changed our on 13 In other words, we bent over backwards to preserve the unity which was evident on 13 April. We listened to what Mr Wran, Mr Dunstan and in Mr NeUson had to say. I think that, far from demonstrating any lack of good faith on the pari in of the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth Government, that demonstrates total good faith. defer We put our submission to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. We did not know in advance what the Governments of South Austraha, New South Wales and Tasmania would say to the Commission. They did not pay us the courtesy of sending us an advance copy of their submission. Of course not. I think their failure to do so demonstrates where on this issue the balance of good faith lies. We have acted in total good faith throughout this entire issue. We have endeavoured to bring about an agreement that the Premiers and the Prime Minister had in mind on 13 April. One may ask the question: Why will not the Commonwealth convene a national conference? The Prime Minister has said quite clearly and repeatedly that the Commonwealth will convene and join a national conference if there is a prospect that mat national conference will contribute towards getting an agreement on a pricewage pause. That is what it is all about-a n agreement on a price-wage pause. That is what the Premiers said it was all about on 13 April. They did not say it had anything to do with tax cuts or general economic management. They said it had everything to do with a fair exchange between a price pause and a wage pause. I repeat that the Commonwealth Government will join a national conference on this issue if there is any prospect that such a national conference will contribute towards consummating the agreement that was sought on 13 April. But we do not beheve that there is any prospect of that agreement being consummated through a nauonal conference unless all of those going to the conference at least want it to succeed. One would want a conference of that nature to succeed only if one were prepared to support the objective in principle. If it is all right for the governments of Australia and for the employers of Australia to say that they seek the objective of a price-wage pause, why is it not allrightfor the trade union movement of Australia to say the same? We are not asking the trade union movement to commit itself blindfolded to the proposition. We are not asking it to give an absolute commitment. We are not asking it to bind itself. All we are asking to do as a pre-condition to a national conference is to say mat it is prepared to support in principle the objective of a price-wage pause. That is not an unreasonable demand. Mr Dunstan did not regard it as an unreasonable demand on 13 April and neither did Mr Neilson and Mr Wran. I think an increasing number of people in Austraha are now asking why do the leadership of the trade union movement and an increasing number of members of the Parhamentary Labor Party regard that as such an unreasonable demand. I repeat that we are prepared to go to a national conference. But we will not go to a national conference which has no prospect of success. We will not go to a national conference which wdl be a futile exercise in political rhetoric, a national conference which will unnecessarily raise hopes and expectations, a national conference to which some of the parties will not go in good faith. I beheve that something could be achieved from a national conference on this issue if, indeed, all of the parties attending it were at least prepared to try to reach significant agreement on that one simple issue which motivated the Prime Minister and the Premiers on 13 April. One must keep going back to that point. It was a proposition which involved, of course, massive difficulties. It was a proposition whose success would require good faith on the part of all parties. It was a proposition not for the cynics of this world but for those people who believe",32
118,Dr KLUGMAN,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,You have to have faith.,34
119,Mr HOWARD,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,"No , it was a proposition that a large number of people in this country believed could be made to work if all sections of the Australian community were prepared to join in helping to make it work. If there is evidence that all significant sections of the Australian community are prepared to be represented at a conference in order to make this proposition work, we are prepared to join it. So far I think everybody is acutely and starkly aware that there is one significant element of the Australian community which is not prepared to lend its support even in principle to an objective which all the heads of government in Australia, irrespective of their party differences, regarded on 13 April as an important objective. I think that is unfortunate for Australia. I think it is something which will disappoint and bewilder an increasing number of Australian people.",34
120,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL CONFERENCE,"The Minisit ter for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) is saying that everyone is out of step but the Government. The leader of organised labour in Australia, the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, came to Canberra last week proposing a national conference on the issue of the freeze. The independent Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recommended that course in its judgment a week ago. Since then the Premier of Victoria, Mr Hamer, has suggested the same course. The Australian Council of Employers Feder same thing. Everyone is out of step but the Government. The Government wants blind or slavish support for a wage freeze or nothing at all. So, what do wefind?We now find that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will not even respond to the proposal. He will not sit Wheeler down and talk to almost every interested party this matter in the country because he just wants an unencumbered wage freeze, and that is it. obstructionism is now destroying the whole initiative. Here is the man who got Sir John Kerr to toss out the Labor Government because of economic performance, poUticaUy and economiAffairs, cally destitute. This is the man who claimed he had all the economic answers. In the first place we had an investment led recovery, then consumer led recovery, and then the panic devaluation. Now we have the kick-the-unions recovery. Who is responsible for all this? It none other than the ideas man, the Prime Minisproblem ter-the Leader of a bankrupt Government. Yet he had the hide not so long ago to talk about certainty under the Labor Government. What more uncertainty could there be than a complete absence of any coherent monetary of fiscal poUcy to deal with inflation and this attempt to coerce the trade union movement and working people in Australia into a premature and useless freeze which is not backed by some quid pro on prices. The interesting thing about this debate is the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is absent. We are again confronted by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and, in this debate a back bench speaker. The prime economic manager in pared the Government, the Treasurer, has been sUent right throughout the debate on this issue. from learning the fact that the Treasury sold the idea to the State officials, we have not heard one contribution from the Treasurer or any of the Treasury officials. We aUse that the majority of the officials are opposed to it. When we have asked the Government to torian Premier. table the documents showing the advice which the Treasury has tended to it, it refuses to do so because no-one in the Treasury believes this icy. The Treasury officials put the blundy. They say that the Government has now left the analyst and the technocrat and returned to the witch doctor. The Government wants blind and slavish support for a wage freeze. That said? is the only economic policy that the Government now has. The Government's economic policy is now concentrated on a cut in real wages. Where is the Treasurer whde this debate is in progress? The Treasurer is slinking around in his office listening to the debate over the internal broadcast system instead of being in the chamber defending the policy which he espouses. The point, of course, is that he does not believe it; neither does the Treasury. The fact that the Prime Minister conned Sir Frederic mto selling it to the State officials is bein side the point. The Prime Minister is now practicaUy left on his own, without any of the State His governments agreeing with him, without the employer or employee organisations agreeing with him. He has sent a junior Minister in the person its of the Minister for Business and Consumer into this chamber to defend a policy that which is now falUng to pieces. Let us look at what the President of the ACTU a put to the Prime Minister last week. He said: ' I am here to talk about a national conference, which was commended by the Arbitration Comis mission, because I know that inflation is the and I recognise that wages play a part in prices. I am prepared to talk about tins'. But unthat was not good enough for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that because Mr Hawke would not commit himself to the principle of a wage freeze he would talk no longer. He then was foolish enough to ask Mr Hawke for a personal commitment. What is a personal comwage mitment from a person who leads the trade quo union movement? What is a personal commitment from a Minister? What is a personal comthat mitment from a Prime Minister? What matters is the commitment of the Government and it is the commitment of the organisation and not a personal commitment that matters. Mr Fraser is preto go to any lengths to try to squeeze out of Mr Hawke a commitment to this wage freeze Apart without explaining in any way how he would Secretary of the deal with prices. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs said in the debate a few moments ago rethat no one mentioned tax cuts. Mr Hawke mentioned tax cuts last week, and so did the Vic",34

The Minister reiterated point in the House by suggesting that no one talked about tax cuts. Is he calling the Victorian Premier a bar? On Thursday night the Minister put out an impertinent statement attacking the Victorian Premier by saying that he was domg a that 'Newport'. The statement was probably by the Prime Minister's own hands and given to ment and organised labour into the Minister to be put in the Press boxes in the which has now failed.

But now the Prime sition says that ifin Minister says: 'We wdl not talk unless you sus on inflation itthe slavishly agree to a wage freeze'. I would now like to turn to the question of prices. What has the Government done about prices? It has done absolutely nothing. In fact, the Government has done since it has been office has been to weaken the powers of the Prices Justification Tribunal. I would like to read from an article which appeared in last week's was wrong. edition of the Australian Financial Review. In regard to prices the article stated: Harris Coffee and Tea and Bushells Pty Ltd said they would not hold prices at the present level for three months. which we were putting as others The executive director of the Grocery Manufacturers Associauon, Mr Bernard Holt, said: 'There is no price freeze.' Mr Bernard Holt said no explanation on the price freeze implementation had been received by the association despite its many phone calls and telegrams to the Minister for Busisame ness and Consumer Affairs and the Prime Minister's Department over the last week. Further on the article states: The joint managing director of Reckitt and Colman, Mr Andrew Caro, said the freeze had been' very badly handled.' The stateThe article also stated: subsidiary EOI said it could not be expected to prices on Stork margarine at the special level they had been for the past few weeks. product will be returned to its normal price, a spokesmanufacturers of Smalls chocolate, said the company now has an appUcation for a price increase for the chocolate before the PJT.

The Government thought through a couple of clauses in the heads of drafted could coerceastheit Austrahan agreement, referred to this document, it trade union movea wage freeze, reasonable was people such as the President of the ACTU, 'Let us sit down at a conference and consider a trade in tax cuts; let us look at the question of prices and wages'.

They agreed that such restraint was needed if Australia is to overcome its current economic problems. That was the agreement to which all 7 heads government agreed.

133,Mr BURR,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I thank the Opposition. But what do wefinddespite all of the support behind the Prime Minister and the Premiers as a result of the Premiers' Conference? Wefindthat the union movement does not even want to talk guidelines. about a wage-price freeze. What is it that the trade unions are after? Why do they not want talk about a price-wage freeze. If all the heads government throughout Australia can agree that such a proposal is necessary to bring about omic recovery why do the trade unions not want to talk about it? I think it is significant to some of the decisions taken at the December meeting of the ACTU executive. One of the cisions taken was as follows: If the Commission fails to make indexation meaningful the trade union movement will then be forced to make claims upon individual employers and as was said 1976, to examine whether there is any further point tinuing to participate in such proceedings. I beheve this is getting closer to the core of what the trade union movement wants. For a start does not want wage indexation. It does not to betieddown to legal guideUnes that will prethose vent it from exerting its poltiical muscle over all the people of Australia. What is happeningrightnow? Two things are happening. First, we have a most disastrous strike in support of decisions taken by die ACTU. That organisation makes the claim that it wants to come to a national conference and talk. That is all hot air. What is it doing in practice? In Victoria we find that just about every motor vehicle istiedup because there is no petrol. Why is this so? It is because the Transport Workers Union wants an increase of $5.70 to make up for increases that the ConcUiation and Arbitration of placCommission, in its wisdom, decided would not be granted to some workers. But the TWU says: 'No. We are not prepared to accept the decisions of a properly authorised court. We will go outside that. We will go back to the law of the jungle. We will use our industrial muscle and we will show the people of Australia who is reaUy boss.' What is happening in Victoria at the moOTHERS ment is anarchy-the law of the jungle. Health and emergency services aretiedup. Doctors cannot obtain petrol to enable them to attend to desperately UI patients. These are the measures to which those people are prepared to go, not because they want to go to a national conference but because they want to use their industrial muscle to force this Government into complete submission. They believe that they have some divinerightto be able to tell the Australian people what it is they should or should not have without having the responsibUity of going to the poUs every 3 years as a democratically elected government must do. This is what the trade unions are aU about. trade They do not want the wage indexation They do not want to be restrained by courts oflaw. I believe that the honourable memto ber for Gellibrand (Mr WUUs) really let the cat of out of the bag during his speech when he made reference to the Opposition's stand on the Indusecontrial Relations Bureau and the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. That is what the trade recall unions do not want, and it is what honourable members opposite do not want. They are not deconcerned about a national conference to talk about the economy, wages and prices. What they object to is being forced, by legislation, to be as responsive to the law as every other section in soin August ciety. I put it to the honourable member for in conGelUbrand: Why do die trade unions not want to respond to the law? Why do they want to be outside the law? Are they trying to set themselves up it as some sort of dictatorship in this country? want I challenge the honourable member to answer questions because I believe that if this country is to reaUse its potential and the standard of Uving that it promises to this generation and to succeeding generations, the only way that we can accomplish those things is by having everyone in this country pulling together in the one direction. 1 beheve that the Prime Minister and the Premiers at the recent Premiers Conference showed statesmanship that we have not seen in this country for a long dme. It was one occasion that proved to the people of Austraha that party politics can be put behind them if it means that Australia will be a better country. Quite obviously, Mr Hawke, and the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions are not prepared to do that. They do not have any interest in the people of Austraha or in economic recovery and they are prepared to undermine any elected government as long as it suits their own political persuasion.",40

Before the debate resumed on this Bdl I would like to suggest that may suit the convenience of the House to have general debate covering this Bill and the Life Insurance Amendment Bill 1977, as they are the related measures. Separate questions will, course, be put on each of the BUls at the clusion of the debate. I suggest therefore that permit the subject matter of the 2 BUls to be cussed in this debate.",41
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 2 measures? I will allow that course to be that followed.,41
137,Mr HURFORD,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"The Opthe position is not opposing these BUls. It supports them as being all right as far as they go. The deal with the regulation of the insurance indussition try. Before addressing myself to the specifics of the Bill I will refer to a number of general issues concerning the supervision of the insurance industry. After the Labor Party came to power in 1972 it estabUshed a comprehensive system of supervision of general insurance through the 1945. Insurance Act 1973. The necessity for such supervision had been evident for a long time. Frankly, previous Liberal and National Counry Party governments-let us face it-becaus e of best their conservative nature and phUosophy, had virtually ignored that need. It was left to a Labor government to enact the necessary legislation. The previous governments obviously had felt that the industry could regulate itself, a concept which too rarely works out in practice, however much we would hke it to do so. A graphic indication of the inability of the industry to apply any sort of self-regulation which could protect poUcy holders in the way that we would want them protected occurred in the period between July 1970 and March 1973. In thistimeprovisional liquidators of some 14 insurance companies were appointed. These companies had estimated assets and UabUities of many millions of dollars. In the period between March 1973 and June 1976 a further 5 companies were placed in the hands of Uquidators. The collapse of all these companies meant severe hardship for many thousands of people. Second Reading The financial loss and the mental anguish these people suffered must, I believe, be laid at by the feet of those who were tardy in bringing legislation concerning insurance up to date. Those people, of course, are the Liberal National Country Party governments who governed this country for those years until 1972. was not as if collapses of insurance companies is were a completely unheard of thing. Overseas exit perience, particularly in the United Kingdom, a amply demonstrated the necessity for continual monitoring of laws and regulations applying to insurance industry. I must here pay tribute to of my colleague, the honourable member for conHawker (Mr Jacobi), another South Australian you Labor member, for his persistent actions in disdrawing to the attention of governments and, indeed, to the attention of this House, aU the hardships being caused by the collapse of certain insurance companies. He has done the nation a service in this speciaUty of his. It is to be hoped in the future conservative governments, such as the one we have now, will have learnt from past and will recognise this necessity for more than just self-regulation if people are to be secure BUls from hardships caused by failures. The Oppowelcomes the fact that the present Government has seen fit to continue Labor initiatives in the supervising of the insurance industry, as witnessed in these BUls. I refer, of course, to the changes to the Insurance Act rather than the Life Insurance Act, which has been in operation since This attitude is a welcome recognition that market forces do not always work in everyone's interests. It is the proper role of governments to intervene, for instance, where regulations are required, for protection of policy holders. I might say, however, that given the Government's recent attempts at managing-perhaps mismanaging is the more correct word-the economy through a number of ad hoc, regulatory and interventionist measures, the free enterprise business community might be forgiven for wondering whatever happened to the Liberal Party's commitment to the market. I am, of course, referring to the interventionism of the so-called wage and price freeze which is before us at the present time, particularly now that it is compulsory and no longer voluntary in nature. This is hardly a natural outcome for proponents of the free market economy, but I will return to insurance. The 1973 Insurance Act was, of course, only a start. Much still needs to be done. Constant monitoring is essential in the fields of both general and Ufe insurance. I was pleased to see that the Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) recognised this in his second reading speech to the Life Insurance Amendment Bill. He said: The Government views the current set of proposed amendments to the Life Insurance Act as a forerunner to a much wider review to determine what kind of supervisory legislation is best suited to Australia's life insurance future. Those words I believe could equally apply to general insurance. The Australian Labor Party has of course recognised the need for a wide review of all aspects of the insurance industry and has taken steps to provide the Government with an ideal forum for such a review. We have placed on the notice paper for a general business day a notice of motion to set up committees of this Parliament to study both the life and general insurance industries separately. Mr Jacobi-That is long overdue.",41
138,Mr HURFORD,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"It is long overdue, as the honourable member for Hawker said. I commend the proposal to the Government. The Government should facUitate the setting up of those committees. Many aspects of the insurance industry in general could profitably be subjected to study. These include such things as the criteria to be fulfilled byfirmswishing to enter the industry, the application of the restrictive practices legislation to the insurance industry, the extent of foreign ownership and its impUcations for the domestic economy, general management efficiency and increased means of protection for pohcy holders. Insurance poUcy holders appear to be a group of consumers who have received Uttle attention in attempts to frame consumer protection legislation. For example, methods of selUng insurance often have been called into question. The United Kingdom has legislation which provides for the regulation of insurance advertising. Hopefully the pariiamentary committees proposed by the Opposition to which I have just referred will be able to study these and other aspects of insurance and assurance in great detaU. I now turn my attention to the specific measures included in the 2 BUls currently before the House. The Life Insurance Amendment Bill 1977 is to amend the Life Insurance Act of 1945, which is the Act under which Australia's Ufe insurance industry operates. As the Mmister pointed out in his second reading speech, this Act has been singularly successful in preventing faUures among life insurance companies. The present Bill contains some 39 clauses, many of a technical and complex nature. As I have said, the Opposition is supporting this Bill as it contains a number of provisions necessary for the updating of the 1945 Act. However, there are a number of clauses about which we have minor reservations, and I want to deal with these. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill deal with therightsof life insurance companies to carry on business that is not Ufe insurance. As the existing legislation stands the in the Life Insurance Commissioner does not have the authority to scrutinise or to examine the noninsurance activities of Ufe insurance companies, except when an initial application for registration is made. This Bill inserts proposed new section 16A into the original Act. This proposed new section will require Ufe insurance companies to seek the approval of the Commissioner before carrying on non Ufe insurance business. Proposed new section 16A (2) will instruct the Commissioner to grant approval unless the new business concerned is Ukely to 'prejudice the interests of persons who are or become the owners of policies issued by the company'. This is a welcome move in the direction of protecting the rights of policy holders. In the present Act section 39 (2) stipulates that assets held within statutory funds that life insurance companies are required to establish under the Act cannot be invested 'directly or indirectly in any share or interest in any company or undertaking carrying on life insurance business in Australia or elsewhere' without the courts' approval. Clause 10 of the amending Bill omits that section and substitutes another. The new section proposed to be substituted will allow Ufe insurance companies to invest assets of statutory funds in other companies engaging directly or indirectly in life insurance without the Commissioner's approval provided the share component of the investment is 10 per cent or less of the recipient company's paid-up capital and that the total investment is 10 per cent or less of the value of the assets of the ent company. I am a Uttle concerned at the extent of the relaxation of this provision, although understand the Minister's point that because the wide portfoho of investments held by all Ufe insurance companies the original section was not practical. Perhaps the new safeguards which, the Minister put it, 'will enable the Life Insurance Commissioner to oversight certain investment outlets' will prevent any problems the type which section 39 (2) was designed overcome. It would be appreciated if the Minismuch ter assisting the Treasurer (Mr Viner), who is the table, in his reply could give us more detaUs about the safeguards and perhaps indicate what are the 'certain investment oudets' which the Commissioner wiU oversee. The general investment policies of life insurance companies are of great importance the economy as a whole as well as to the policy holders of individual companies. At 31 December the statutory funds of Ufe insurance companies in Australia had total assets of almost $8.8 bUUon. Their investments totalled $5.1 bUUon and in 1975 there was an increase of insurance $367m in the value of investments. It is in interests of aU sections of the economy that these large amounts of capital be invested in the best ment Bill. possible manner. The interests of the community as well as the policy Holden must be borne in is the mind. Clause 36 of the Bill has the effect of pose of allowing the fourth schedule of the Act to altered by regulation. The fourth schedule of the Act is concerned with, among other things, the Act valuation of liabilities and consequently the experience value of dividends and bonuses paid from statumissioner in gained tory funds. The reason given by the Minister for this change is the necessity to allow greater flexibUity in periods of changing interest rates. The argument obviously is that it is impractical salary to make many legislative changes simply to salary determinations modify numbers. Once agam I appreciate the problem involved. However, I am concerned at general tendency of the Government to use Parliament. regulation and not legislation to effect change. I comes bankrupt draw attention to the editorial of 4 January 1977 ployment, or takes of the Australian Financial Review which the highhghted this characteristic of the Fraser Government. The editorial states: ItThat is in this case the ParUamentis the only institution we have capable of acting check upon an arrogant Executive or a bumptious administrauon. It is being treated with contempt by both. That is, the executive and the administration. Of course the danger on the other side of the coin is recipithat if the Parhament is inundated with legislation, members-rememberin g the inadequate I staff and other facUities we have in this placeof will have insufficienttimeto study carefully any legislation. Indeed, stiU on that other side of the com, we have to take into account that the vital as changes necessitated by raging inflation may not be put through at all, at enormous inconvenience to the community, if we are waiting for legisof lation rather than regulation. A middle course to may be to limit changes made by regulation as as possible and have changes which are at made in this way subject to study by a committee of the House. The Senate has a Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Perhaps it istimetbis House had a simUar committee to study regulations. With regard to the specific use of regulation to powers envisaged in this Bill before us, the Opposition requests detaUs of what the Minister sees as the criteria or indices for valuation changes which would be effected. Many other changes are made by this Bill but in general they are changes consistent with the evolution of practice. I believe that there is no need the for me to make any further comments at this stage on the detaUs of the Life Insurance Amend The other of the 2 BUls in this cognate debate Insurance Amendment Bill 1977. The purthis Bill is to amend the Insurance Act be 1973, the significance and history of which I outlined earlier. Most of the changes to the 1973 contained in this Bill arise as a result of die by the Insurance Comadministering the 1973 Act. Clauses 5,6 and 9 of the Bill relate to the Insurance Commissioner. Clause 5 brings the Commissioner's within the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal. This is in keeping with for other statutory officers. Clause 9 removes final control over the termina ation of the Commissioner's appointment for the At present, if the Commissioner beor engages in paid outside emleave without the approval of Treasurer, the Governor General is required to declare by notice in the Gazette that the Commissioner's office is vacant. Once this is done, as things are at present, Parliament must be notified of the grounds for suspension. Parliament may then move for the Commissioner's reinstatement. Under clause 9, however, this will no as some longer apply and, instead, power to dismiss the Commissioner for misbehaviour or incapacity will lie with the Governor General only. The Minister, in his second reading speech, gave us no reason for this change. It must be seen as a diminution in the direct parhamentary control along the Unes of the use of regulauon powers to change Schedule 4 of the Life Insurance Act to which I referred earlier. No mention was made by the Minister of the changes embodied in clause 6 of the Bill. They remove from the Act a total ban on the Commissioner engaging in outside employment. He may now do so if he obtains the Treasurer's approval. I am curious as to why this change has occurred. Surely the Commissioner is paid sufficient by way of salary and other emoluments to prevent him needing a part-time job outside his job as Commissioner. No doubt the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, when replying to this debate, wtil address himself also to this question which I believe is a proper one for us to raise when considering this Bill. Clauses 27, 31 and 33 of this Bill strengthen the hand of the Commissioner in communicating with the industry. They have obviously arisen as a result of imperfections which experience has shown to exist in the 1973 Act. They are to be welcomed as a logical extension of the intent of the original Act. I shaU have more to say about this matter of communications with the industry in my concluding remarks. The Minister announced that the as yet unproclaimed section 113 of the existing Act is to be modified. This section deals with insurance being sent to unauthorised insurers overseas through agents in Australia. I am reheved to find that the modifications require that cUents be informed when insurance is being transacted through insurers outside the scope of the Australian Act. However, I wonder whether more than the information may be required for the protection of pohcy holders. I should like to learn more about this as well in the Minister's reply. Let us face it, at the moment we are removing a protection. Although section 113, I suppose for practical reasons, has not yet been proclaimed, we must assume that when the Act came into being there was the intention to proclaim that section. Why are we watering down this section now? Mr Jacobi-Perhaps we can get that mformation in the Committee stage.",42
139,Mr HURFORD,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I have covered a number of the 39 amendments in this Bill. No doubt my coUeagues will cover others in specific terms. The honourable member for Hawker suggested that perhaps one aspect should be covered in Committee stage. I look forward to contributions from the honourable member in the second reading debate to see whether we do go to a Committee stage. If we cover the points we wish to cover during the second reading stage, unless we have specific amendments, I doubt whether we will go to a Committee stage of this Bill. Perhaps the honourable member would like to do both. Before concluding my remarks, I should Uke to refer to what I regard as an omission from the Bill. Unlike the Mmister, I believe that there is a necessity for proposals relating to the establishment of new insurance companies to be examined on the basis of national interest criteria. I doubt whether arrangements designed to ensure the financial soundness of companies necessarily covers the needs of the national interest. The Minister's assurance that proposals by overseas interests will be subject to the Government's foreign investment policy is of no great consolation. The insurance industry is of such importance that it requires more than this. I trust that this point will be widely examined in the deUberations of the parliamentary committee which, I repeat, I hope the Government will facUitate setting up. There are many other aspects of the general insurance industry which need to be raised. For example, there is the question of a scheme of natural disaster insurance. The Insurance Commissioner, in his 1976 report, regarded progress towards a national scheme as very important for the industry. Employers UabUity insurance is another area of importance which needs thorough investigation. The Opposition looks forward to the estabUshment of the committees I have mentioned and that are in our general business motions which wtif be able to perform such functions. I end my remarks on a more personal note. There are many excellent Australians working at all levels of the Australian insurance industry. On behalf of the Australian Labor Opposition, I pay tribute to them. Theirs is a vitally important industry for very many reasons. The provision of security for poUcy holders and the savings which they generate for investment in this developing country of ours are just two of the important reasons for that great industry. I am one who does not want more legislation if we can possibly help it. I certainly do not judge the success of government on the amount of legislation it puts through. But this is an imperfect world in which we Uve. Consumers-poUc y holders-hav e to be protected. The industry is only as good as the most unscrupulous people in it. That is why, on balance, I and my colleagues in the Labor Pany have to opt for the best possible protective legislation to the greatest extent possible created with the help of the good people in the industry. But it seems to me that there are still some bad people in the industry and self-regulation does not adequately provide for their activities. Two areas in particular which require careful scrutiny are marine insurance and insurance brokers. I have a particular case on my plate through my electoral office which apphes to both areas. That case has all the ingredients to cause one to claim that there is something rotten in the State of Denmark. I am not going to name names behind the cloak of parliamentary privilege at this stage because all of those involved have not yet had thetimeto reply to me and give me their side of the story. But it does no harm to state the story briefly because it very much relates to the protective legislation we have before this House. It involves the insurance of a boat for a large sum-$750,000 . A broker filled out the proposal form for the client, my friend who has approached my electoral office. The broker in this case is also the main insurer although other companies are involved in the syndicate. The boat was burnt; it was virtually a complete write-off. From memory, the incident happened at least 2 or possibly 3 years ago, I think, in this month of April. Not a cent has been paid. Even if it has been 2 years since the incident that is bad enough, but if it has been 3 years that is worse. Why has the money not been paid? It is because the proposal form allegedly was not made out absolutely accurately. Having studied the matter closely, I assert that the inaccuracies do not affect the insurance risk in any way. They relate to whether or not a new engine which had been purchased for the boat had actually been placed in it at thetimeof the fire. But that is not the point. If indeed the proposal form is wrong, who filled it out? It was the broker, who is also the main insurer. As I understand the law- I believe that the Minister Assisting the Treasurer is a lawyer; perhaps he may take a personal interest in this matter and give me some free personal advice",44
140,Mr VINER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,Kerbsid e opinions are always dangerous.,45
141,Mr HURFORD,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I would never suggest that any opinion from the Minister was a kerbside opinion. I am sure that it would be one of great value. But as I understand the law, my friendsthese small people who are dealing with powerful insurance companies-ar e unlikely to win the case because of the very strict business about every detail on the proposal form being correct. It shows all the signs of unscrupulous people taking advantage of bad law and not facing up to their responsibilities. I repeat that the industry is only as good as the worse people in it, which explains the need for this legislation. We in the Australian Labor Party always will be prepared to talk to the industry. We believe that there was an unnecessary breakdown in communications at the time of our simple proposal to establish an Australia government insurance commission. It was a modest proposal, the main aim being to rationalise on a national basis those State government insurance offices which were prepared to come into the rationalisation, the federation. In our view our desire for fair competition between the public sector and the private sector would have left the insurance industry in some States in a better position than it is at the presenttime.That argment developed into an emotional one with neither side trusting the other. We do not want that to happen again. We pledge ourselves to keep the doors of dialogue open between ourselves as the alternative government-the next government of this country-and the insurance industry. In that spirit the Opposition supports this legislation and, I repeat, seeks further communication with the insurance industry about future necessary changes.",45
142,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TRANSPORT GROUPS," I was interested in the friendly discursion on the part of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) concerning the insurance industry, but, no matter now friendly it was, it should not hide the fact that this industry is a crucially important one and there are certain matters that have to be looked at very closely in relation to events in that industry not just today but over fairly recent main years. It is also appropriate to observe that the insurance industry in this country-the life section of industry as well as the underwriting section of the industry-operate s somewhat in the British tradition and that in that tradition it has always had a very proud history. That is perhaps best examplified by the fact that when well known European consultants were asked to depict the best and worse aspects of British industry for viewers on the European continent they chose as the worse industry, for one reason or another but not due to personalities, the British shipbuilding industry, which had run into immense and enormous difficulties for a variety of reasons, and they chose as the best industries operating in the United Kingdom from an economic point of view the city and the insurance industry. I would like to think that Australia operates somewhat in that tradition. The second report of the Insurance Commissioner is a very valuable document. As the years go by the value of that document will become more and more apparent. That document makes it perfectiy clear that over recent years-in this regard I am referring to the first piece of legislation before the House-the insurance industry has itself run into quite immense and-' enormous difficulties. I believe that those difficulties can be summed up in one proposition, that is, the difficulty of allowing for future provisions in terms of payments from the insurance industry. I am not referring to particularly great natural disasters, which I put aside and which are to be considered in a separate way. Cyclone Tracy, the Brisbane floods and so on are quite a separate matter. But the difficulty is one of providing and making assessments for future provisions in the industry. I believe that it is worthwhile philosophising on that for just one moment. The difficulties of that industry occur because of the distance between the act of insurance and the claim on account of which the insurance was first negotiated. Insurance is negotiated at a certain moment intime.It is negotiated for a contingency. That contingency may or may not arise. The difficulty is that if it does arise it wdl arise some undetermined payout and for an unknown amount. I beheve that that is made perfectly clear by the Insurance Commissioner's report that there are 3 areas of insurance that have been operating at very substantial losses. I refer to workers compensation insurance, motor vehicle insurance and compulsory third party insurance. For example, according to the Commissioner's report, the losses in 1974-75 in respect of those areas of the Australian insurance industry amounted to $128m. That is an absolutely enormous amount. The difficulty is simply to relate ultimate benefits to payments that occur in order to enable those benefits to be met. Some of those benefits have been seen increasingly by governments-ver y much by State governments as well as others-as welfare payments. We come therefore to a very important principle, namely, to what extent is the insurance industry to betiedin terms of either its short term obligations or its long term obligations to the welfare principle? I do not beheve that that can be totally ignored. It ought not to be ignored. It is for those reasons that I am pleased with a represent couple of aspects of the Bills presented by the cent then Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric meet Robinson) concerning which other questions wdl be asked during the Committee stage. I am Ughted that some of the solvency provisions that affect the underwriting companies, if I can that way, are being hberalised and will in fact help a number of those companies. I refer to the Minister's comment: Thirdly, it is proposed that insurance companies be able to omit from the calculation of their annual premium income for purposes of the Act amounts they have collected for onward transmission to the States or Territories in the form of fire brigade levies, stamp dudes and other similar charges. I believe that is perfectly reasonable. What effect is that going to have on the capacity of these companies to meet their obligations? Their premium income is of the order of a couple of thousand million dollars a year. Their payments in terms of stamp duties, fire brigade levies and so on were of the order of $130m to $140m in 1975-76. That sum is to be omitted for the purposes of those calculations. When in addition to that one adds the 15 per cent solvency ratio one can see that it is going to assist them in terms of their payout by something of the order of $ 140m, $150m or $ 160m on the 1975-76figures.So that much less in assets has to be provided for according to the legislation. That means that that much more is available to be distributed to those who will be the welcome and sometimes the unhappy recipients of the payments of these insurance companies. I believe that there can be greater for explanation of some of those details in the legislation. The situation may be summed up by saying that the difficulties of this industry depend upon the overwhelming truism and simple fact that it cannot run an unfunded scheme and that the nature of the funding of that scheme lies at the heart of what one considers in relation to any insurance industry. I would like to read into Hansard one or two appropriate comments from the second report of the Commissioner. I refer to page 9Mr Jacobi-Whic h one-genera l or life?",45
143,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"General. Life will receive attention in a few moments. Referring to the difficulties of the companies, on page 9 he said: There are minor matters relating to the magnitude of adjustments made butThis is the crucial pointin 2 years the private sector has increased its total provisions for meeting outstanding liabilities to policy holders in respect of claims from around $514m at 1 July 1973 to $691 m at 30 June 1974 and to $987m one year later. These latter amounts 45 per cent of total liabilities in 1973-74 and 52 per of total liabilities in 1974-75. Notably provisions to workers compensation claims have more than doubled from$200mto$438. deIn one or two sentences the Commissioner epitomised the very great difficulties and burdens of put it that industry. Therefore it needs help and reasonable supervision. It receives some significant help in this respect. I turn to the Bill to amend the Life Insurance Act. The amendments in the Bdl are only part of some much larger amendments which are foreshadowed by the Minister. We should not gloss over the enormous problems the life insurance industry has endured over recent years. It has endured enormous problems. Perhaps I am taking a risk in introducing some pohtical content into this debate, but it has to be done. The Life Insurance Commissioner in his last annual report on page 8 said: The total number of new policies issued continued cline from the record number of policies written in rate of decline was only 2.3 per cent this year as compared with 7.5 per cent last year, and it is possible that over one or two years a definite upward trend will re-emerge. We hope that it does. Unless I am a month or two behind, the monthly statements of the Australian Statistician on policies surrendered and disconspecially tinued show a disturbing propensity towards continuing increase. That has to worry anybody concerned with the industry and what it can do for Australia. After all, it is some ways the largest single organiser of capital avadable or put the Austrahan market. Therefore it has to be treated sensibly and should not be made a that can be plundered fromtimeto time. It needs to be repeated that a number of changes were made in the treatment of life volved insurance from 1972 on which were to the detriment of the industry and therefore of those who held pohcies. I will just go through some the difficulties and problems. Firstiy, under the actuarial UabUity arrangement the amount of assets exempt from tax was reduced from 3 per cent to 1 per cent. Secondly, the rate of tax on companies was increased. As a result of these provisions in the budgets of 1973 and 1974, on simple calculations in those years at least $21 and $200m less was available for distribution to policy holders. I believe, and I say this without any emotion, that the previous Government insurance made a severe mistake in making those icy holders. provisions. It also made a number of other visions to the disadvantage of life insurance companies. The proposition one which attracts comment from the life insurance companies schedules deserves to be mentioned because I do not totally agree with it. It is that the automatic tax rebate introduced in the 1975 Budget acts as a severe disincentive to those who would take out insurance. I look at the matter itself. I favour of there being an automatic rebate some size for taxpayers because there is evidence that those on lower incomes have not been utilising all the provisions avaUable to them to claim taxation concessions. Therefore the automatic rebate deserves to be retained in some form or other. Whether or not it should be indexed is another matter to be determined. The other proposition which attracts the attention of those concerned with Ufe insurance concerns the $1,200 tax deduction for life insurance. These 2 propositions concerning the automatic rebate and the $1,200 tax deduction impinge on one another. It is alleged that the $1,200 tax deduction cannot be taken advantage of as much to denow as in the past, but this depends on the extent 1972. The to which the tax concession of $1,200 was the principal reason for taking out life insurance in the next thefirstplace. If some method could be found for separating the effect of a $1,200 deduction on insurance that was taken out with the concession in mind and the effect of an automatic rebate for those on low incomes, who quite oba viously have been claiming less in tax concessions than one would expect they should be able to claim, not only would a service be done to economic equity, but also a significant service on to would be done to the life insurance industry itself. Above all, it needs to be remembered that source the previous Government regarded the Ufe insurance industry as an industry that could be raided and disadvantaged. It did not see it as an essential handmaiden of industry and people inin industry. It should have done so. There is one other provision in this legislation of to which I would like to direct one or two comments during the Committee stage. It is the provision involved in clauses 36 and 16. They enable regulations to be made in terms of the Fourth the Schedule. I am referring to the provision for the 2 minimum valuation basis for judging the return on assets of life insurance companies. It is quite Sm clear that at 3A per cent that minimum valuation l is too low, and because that is significantly below what is earnt on assets and investments by life companies too little is returned to polOn the facts of life it is less than what ought to be the return on premium incomes taxation proavaUable to policy holders. The proposed amendments in the Bill give too most much latitude. They merely stated that the can be amended. It does not have to be by legislation. The Fourth Schedule may be amended effectively by regulation. I pose this question: In what direction may the valuations Ufe be amended by regulation? May they be am in amended upwards or may they be amended of downwards? It might be said, and no doubt it would be said: 'We would not amend them downwards. We would have regard to the index of investment returns published in the Life Insurance Commissioner's report. We would amend them in accordance with that'. But that is not provided for in the Bill. Those who have investments in life insurance companies ought to receive a guarantee as to the direction in which those amendments would be pursued. They have that right. They see it in accordance with common sense. The Insurance Commissioner develops a very useful index for the return on investments of the various classes of the life insurance companies, and it ought to be utilised. Another part of the schedule is quite crucial and affects the returns to policy holders. mortahty tables are to be brought up to date and more recent mortality tables are to be utilised. ask: Which mortality tables are to be utilised how up to date are they likely to be? It is clear from the recent Ufe tables put out by the Auslations trahan Government Actuary, Mr S. Caffin, has about 25 letters after his name, that the of mortality for one period as a proportion of mortality of previous periods can vary quite nificantly. Therefore if one is in utilising mortality tables which are dated policy holders can be disadvantaged and the maximum amount which should be returnable to them would not be returned. I beheve that both these Bills are very interestcollect, ing and that they wdl attract a lot of comment this stage and in the Committee stages. I will interested to hear some assurances from the Minister in respect of their administrauon, certainly in relation to the numerical amounts involved in Schedule 4 of the Bill. In some ways they clearly the key to the Life Insurance Amendment Bill. They give it substance and soul, and rectify some of the inequities of the past. I believe policy holders in Australia, in an industry which has assets of $8,000m-odd, should be able to see that both these amendments are made in accordexamination ance with the most recent modern practice and experience in the field of investment and in the field of mortahty tables.",46
144,Mr CREAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS," has Wbilst I might agree with my friend the honourpective able member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) in a lot of the things he said, I do not agree with idea that there should be an extension of the amount deductible for income tax purposes for Ufe assurance premiums paid. Mr Kevin Cairns- I did not say that.",48
145,Mr CREAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"He did not quite say that but he was getting pretty close to saying that $ 1,200 not adequate. I point out that that is in the region of $23 a week, and I do not think that the proportion of the Austrahan public which is able to save that amount is very high. Equally I do not think that the honourable member acknowledged the advantages which have been given to life insurance by the fact that the tax deduction has been allowable. Candidly, if we were starting off in 1977 as though life insurance had never been invented, I am sure we would not embark upon it in anything like the same way. The Ufe insurance industry collects something like $ 1,300m annually in premiums, and I take thesefiguresfrom the most recent report of die Commissioner for Life Insurance. It collects $715m in annual premiums from ordinary busiThe ness, $553m from superannuation business, and oddly enough it still collects $58m from that curiI ous and highly expensive area called industrial and business. That is about $ 1,300m in aggregate, and when one goes a Uttle further into the tabuone finds that the average interest rate who earned on the vast funds which have rate accumulated over the years is 6.63 per cent; the surely a very poor return these days. The next sigtable shows the expense rates for the various over-conservative types of business",48
146,Mr GOODLUCK,TRANSPORT GROUPS,It is very compUcated.,48
147,Mr CREAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"It is complicated. Ordinary insurance costs 32.1 per cent of the premiums to superannuation costs 13.4 per cent, and at industrial 37.4 per cent. In other words, on the be average it costs over 30 per cent to collect that $ 1,300m. When one looks at the revenue forgone by the Government in allowing the concessions for the subscriptions to the policies, the means of are organising the funds coUected are even less efficient. I do not want to canvass that point very much further, except to say that I hope in the that major task of modernising the Life Insurance Act, to which the Minister referred in this speech, some consideration will be given to a wide pubUc of the matter. Perhaps linking insurance premiums to tax deductions is the only thing that makes the industry viable, but I think that is a socially inequitable way of doing it. It been the accepted way in the past, but irresof whether the taxation concession is varied I think that the Ufe insurance industry has his to examine closely its own future and the terms on which it is Ukely to be viable. After all, the original purpose behind life insurance was that there was no other provision for retirement or early death. Other arrangements are now made, and I suggest that perhaps the time is right for insurance companies to consider getting out of was certain forms of Ufe insurance and looking at more sensible new approaches. I think that the companies are tending to do that. After all, biggest revoludon which has taken place, and is a very efficient change if one looks at pense ratio, is that the insurance companies gone into the superannuation business than the old form of endowment and term poliThese cies. It is interesting at least to note that gradually superannuation annual premiums are begining 1974-75. to overtake the rest, and that move has also assisted by taxation because the contribution the employer is tax deductible in his books, which makes the proposition much more viable. I submit that there is a need for a very compreof hensive re-examination of the role of life insurance in 1977.1 got into some hot water the insurance companies during my term as Treasurer because I urged this upon them. It easy to say that the tax law can be altered. We could have altered the tax laws much more we did. Candidly, what we did, arising out of recommendations of the Coombs Task Force, was to remove what had previously been regarded as an anomaly, but all the belly-aching which went on amongst the insurance companies about that rather minor part of the total situation I think took their minds off the reality of they are to survive in the next 25 or 30 years. believe that there is a role for them, but 1 think is very different from the role they have played the past. I want to talk mosdy about the other arena of somehow insurance in Australia. I do not think realised that the premiums paid by individual what might be calledin'uninsurable pohcy holders to life insurance companies are far arise out of incidents, primarily risks'. less in aggregate that the annual premiums paid motor cars and the bad social habitsconcerning by the same population for other forms of insurance-fir e employers' habihty and so on. In their fact, 3 categories mentioned by my friend the innocent honourable member for LUley and referred to on turn to the page 20 of the admirable report of the Insurance that causedlaw Commissioner, if I might agree with the honourmost sensible things able member, show a major loss. Motor vehicle community insurance showed a loss of $40m for the year would at least cover everybody ended 30 June 1975, compulsory third party in retirement. If people want to insure insurance showed a $36m loss and employers' UabUity insurance showed a loss of $43m. The in report of the Insurance Commissioner goes on to expect state: Losses in these 3 classes accounted for nearly 90 of the underwriting losses other than those arising Cyclone Tracy. The figures show that in these 3 classes, each dollar of earned premium, the claims and expenses absorbed: The report cites the claims and expenses sorbed for every dollar of earned premium in case of motor vehicle insurance as $ 1.13. So it not a very viable form of endeavour unless the the premium is increased. For compulsory third it pany, $1.74 was absorbed for each dollar of the exearned premium and for employers' UabUity, have $1.13 was absorbed for each dollar of earned rather premium. The report goes on to state: 3 classes accounted for more than 60 per cent of all the premiums earned by the private sector in Australia in been However, one of the greatest organised objecof tions to the Austrahan Labor Party in the last election was on the part of employees of insurance companies. Candidly, I thought that the companies would have been glad to get out these 3 areas of insurancewith Mr Jacobi-They are out of most of them now.",48
148,Mr CREAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"The companies are out of most is of them and the Insurance Commissioner draws attention to that. Companies in the private area than are not accepting compulsory third party the insurance any more. What has not been said about employers' liability insurance is that instead of compensating workmen, which is what the aim originally was, the people who are most compensated are the lawyers and doctors in the course of the proceedings. What the present how Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) I had in mind when he was Prime Minister was to itpass an Act that would take this matter out of the ininsurance area. My friend opposite, the honourable member for Lilley, thinks that he could separate the welfare part from the rest. it is always think that Iaccidents Candidly, do not believe this can be done. I Australia are becoming They of many of drivers. I do not know how we can insure against this. Surely there ought to be pity for the victims at times. He should not have to his to prove what were the obstacles downfall. I think that one of the suggested for the Australian is national superannuation that through life and their lives other ways, they can do so. But they should not assistance from the taxpayers generally for so doing. per cent I believe equally that in this area of employers' from liabUity the matter is a social one now rather for than an insurable one. I am afraid I have a somewhat different view in this respect than some of my colleagues on this side of the House and the abInsurance Commissioner who is the author of the this report-abou t national disaster. I do not isthink that it is insurable. It occurs and when it does occur its effects are cataclysmic. Living in the area in which I Uve-5 0 yards from the beach- I will not insure against drought. Those who live in the Mallee are not likely to insure againstflood.Fortunately cyclones never occur where I live. Their effects would not be felt in Hobsons Bay even if they did. When we talk about natural or nauonal disasters, we must remember that is what they are. They are things that happen that cannot be insured against. In my view, inevitably, it will be the Government that has to pick up the tab when they occur. To think that somehow it can be made a new area of insurance is beyond me. I know that my friend, the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) does not agree with me on this. I agree with him on most things. This whole area has been talked about very glibly. Unfortunately, Cyclone Tracy occurred and was preceded very shortly by the Brisbanefloods.Certainly, such disasters threw the reinsurance area in Australia into a taUspin. I also want to draw the attendon of honourmembers. able members to the table on page 28 of the Insurance Commissioner's report. He gives total underwriting expenses to premium income for the various forms of insurance. For every paid in premiums for fire insurance, expenses took up 53 cents. For house owners and housewith holders insurance, 53.2 cents of the underwriting dollar was absorbed as expenses. The position regard to contractors' insurance was a little ter at a shade under 40 cents in the dollar. In maritime insurance, underwriting expenses each dollar of premium amount to 29.27 cents. For motor vehicle insurance, thefigureis 26.9 cents and for compulsory third party insurance, it is 18.27 cents. The reason that latterfigureis lower than the others is that nearly all such insurance is now taken out with government sort insurance offices which have a much lower rate of expense to premium income. For employers' liability insurance, 22.49 cents expenditure incurred for each dollar of premium collected. For public UabUity insurance, thefigureis 40.28 cents and for other categories of insurance, 41.33 cents. Does not this sort of thing point the need for further rationaUsation of insurance other than life insurance? One good thing has happened because of the insurance legislation to which the Insurance Commissioner draws attention. Previously, there were approximately 400 operators insurance area. Thatfigurehas now been halved and is down to about 200 operators. Perhaps there is a case for that number What can be more silly than a television advertisement telling people that somehow one comspeak pany has, for example a better form of fire insurance? Insurers at least ought to ask what is the cost of that advertisement and how many cents from each dollar will be taken out to pay for it. But I am afraid that members of the public are still unduly influenced by the blandishments of advertisers who persuade them that commercial television cost them nothing. These advertisements cost consumers a great deal of money in terms of the end prices. These areas are sensitive and I would not like to say at the moment what I think is the overall position of the insurance industry, other than life insurance. I simply ask honourable members to read carefully the total assets of all these 200 non-life companies and at the sametimethe total liabUities. The difference between them is in the region of $430m. The industry has lost that sum totally in the last 2 years. Whether this gives it a sound margin if it continues to operate in all the areas I leave to the imigination of honourable However, I agree with my friend, the honourable member for LUley, that at times we the should have more opportunity to debate this matter in detail. I have no objection to most of $ 1 the proposed amendments. However, I point out one with which I do not agree. I do not agree putting what is not the Insurance Appeals Tribunal under the more general control of the in Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It might sound betnice andtidyto do that. But the idea of an Administrative Appeals Tribunal was a body for the for ordinary citizen to approach when he is aggrieved about something that happens in some government department. But the disputes that arise in insurance are of a technical nature. A tribunal that might be a good one for a general administrative difficulty might not be the right of tribunal-certainl y it is not in my mindfor a complicated difference of opinion between an insurance company and the Insurance Comwas missioner. I suggest that the Government ought to have a look at that. Perhaps it was carried away with the euphoria of giving the Adminisit is trative Appeals Tribunal something to do. to Perhaps it has not had as much work as it was thought it would have. That is a specialist area for dispute and it ought to be so treated. So, I leave it at that. I understand that there is some hurry tofinishthe second reading debate and to proceed to the Committee stage. However, it does seem to me to be a very large and a very in the general complicated area. Mr Bourchier-Would you like an extension to be even less. of time, Frank?",49
149,Mr CREAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Yes, I would not mind it. I could for 20 minutes first on life insurance and then on general insurance. But perhaps serious attention ought to be givn to the proposition that there be a general inquiry into the future of insurance in Austraha in all its aspects. Such an inquiry could take a year or two to complete, but it could begin to answer sensibly some of the questions that have been raised by my colleague, the honourable member for Adealide (Mr Hurford), and which will be raised by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) from South Australia and which have also been raised by an honourable member from the other end of the continent, Queensland.",50
150,Mr DOBIE,TRANSPORT GROUPS," Iriseto speak on the 2 Bills before the House, one of which amends the Insurance Act of 1973 and the other of which amends the Life Insurance Act 1945.1 beheve that the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) gave a very good account of the background of the insurance industry. Before I address myself to the Bills I would like to that in general terms I support my friend, the honourable member for Lilley, in his statement about the principle of maintaining a tax rebate system in one form or another- I underline the words 'in one form or another'-for those on incomes. I do not know that the present form that introduced in the 1975 Budget in any meets any ideal, but the system as described the honourable member for Lilley does in fact encompass my views. I was a little surprised when I heard the vious speaker in the debate, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), talking about the use of advertising in the insurance industry. Although it was not my privilege to sit in this House during the 3 years period that occupied the front bench on this side of the chamber, I must say that between 1975, as an ordinary citizen I was constantly amazed at the amount of advertising that was done by the then Labor Government in regard to too. monopolistic governmental activities in the community. I had difficulty in relating the level of government advertising for something that was provided only by the government of the day with his comments today about the costs involved for policy holders in the private insurance industry. If we had a monolithic, central, monopolistic government insurance corporation, which Labor Government tried to achieve, I venture to say that there would have been as much advertising for that as the socialist government used all its purely governmental activities between 1972 and 1975. Mr Bourchier-And the taxpayer would pay for the lot.",51
151,Mr DOBIE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"As the honourable member for Bendigo says so properly, the taxpayer and not the user would pay for it. The Bills before the House are interesting in the sense that one is designed to amend one old Act and the other is designed to amend a new Act. A further interesting aspect is that both Acts were introduced by Labor governments. I can only hope that the Insurance Act 1973 proves to be as good an Act as the Life Insurance Act 1945. That has been proven to be a good Act. It has been, I believe, an effective supervisor of the life insurance industry. We have not seen the collapse of any life insurance companies during the period of its operation. Despite the aberrations of the 1972-75 period-I venture to say that for insurance purposes we cannot classify that period as a nauonal disaster- I suppose it would be fair to say that there has been a need to upsay date some aspects of the Life Insurance Act. It is not my intention to deal with that matter at length at this stage. I believe it will be taken care of during the committee stage. However, I am pleased to see that it is proposed to increase low the amounts governing payments of policy proor ceeds from $2,000 to $6,000. For the benefit of way those people who read Hansard and those by people who may be listening to the broadcast of these proceedings at the moment, that means that the amount of a pohcy that can be paid without taking probate or letters of administrationprethat involves a long process for beneficiarieshas increased from $2,000 to $6,000. Mr Kevin Cairns-Is that large enough?",51
152,Mr DOBIE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I take the point made by the he honourable member for Lilley. The amount of $6,000 is below the level of the average policy 1972 and being taken out today. Mr Kevin Cairns-And the surrender value",51
153,Mr DOBIE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"The honourable member mentions the surrender value as well. I think the point to be made is that the increase is a step in the right direction. I beheve that it will cover a very large proportion of policies already held. So, to that extent, I believe it does have merit. Like my friend from Lilley, I hope that we will move to the larger amounts as time goes by. Another proposed amendment to the Act for previous speakers have touched on it-is to be found in clause 36, which will enable changes to the minimum valuation basis in the Fourth Schedule to the Act, which covers the valuation of liabilities under policies, to be made by regulation. Although I can understand the honourable member for Lilley wanting some indication of the direction which the amendments wdl take, I do support the principle of the regulation-making power being brought into this Act. I think there are advantages to be gained from it. The point is, I think, that we have to keep up to date with interest rates and mortality tables and the expenditure made on selUng policies. As most honourable members would realise, that would mean that policy holders would benefit in the sense that the hfe insurance companies would have larger surpluses. Although it will be the responsibUity of individual Ufe assurance companies to determine these matters, it should manifest itself in better bonuses for pohcy holders. I take the point raised by the honourable member for LUley: It is important to know which mortahty tables are gomg to be used. I think that we should bear in mind that these BUls are essentially technical. I do not believe that the second reading debate is the occasion to become involved in their detaU. However, I point out that I support totally the updating and improving of what has been a very successful Act, namely, the Life Insurance Act 1945.1 support also the principle of moving the appeals machinery to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Obviously I disagree with the previous speaker in that regard. Although I would Uke to bow to his greater experience, I am afraid that I cannot. I support what is proposed. I shall take only a shorttimeto deal with the other Bill which is concerned with general insurance. The amendments proposed are even more technical than those proposed to the Life Insurance Act. I believe that they will strengthen the adrnimstrative machinery and overcome a number of weaknesses to be found in the 1973 Act. They will have the effect of allowing the Government to collect information on the amount of business being sent overseas by, for example, brokers and agents. While I am informed that that is essentially an informationgathering exercise, I can only hope that it does not frighten off the continued practice of sending premium business overseas. As was shown by the cyclone Tracy experience, that practice does work very heavUy to Australia's advantage. I think it should be realised that something like two-thirds of the cost of the Darwin disaster was borne by overseas reinsurers. I think that people of all political persuasions have to be very careful in introducing legislation which may damage the close relationship we have with overseas reinsurers, particularly British reinsurers. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), who is sitting at the table, to be cautious in any future moves that may take place which could damage the practice of Australian brokers and agents re-insuring overseas. It is very easy to be nationalistic and to talk about insuring ourselves and keeping our premiums. But Darwin has shown the dangers in such thinking. I would like to take the liberty of quoting from the second annual report of the Insurance Commissioner. I doubt whether he has been quoted more often than he has on this occasion. I refer in particular to page 34 of the report where he refers to the nauonal disaster insurance scheme which, of course, is what everyone in this place should have in mind when talking about general insurance. There may be differences of phUosophy in regard to general insurance. I almost said 'theology' because insurance has been put into the ranks of theology by some people on both sides of the political scene in this countryMr Crean-In this secular age not so many people blame God.",51
154,Mr DOBIE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Which God does the honourable member have in mind? The scene is such that even the Insurance Commissioner makes certain that he mentions in his report the great difficulties in establishing a national disaster insurance scheme. One of the things that gives me hope is his statement that the insurance industry representatives have co-operated closely in the work done towards developing a suitable disaster insurance scheme. I think that what we have to bear in mind and what we have to be very sensible about is the proposition that the insurance industry is perhaps the best vehicle we can use to come to a solution in regard to natural disaster insurance. I put it to the House that I do not believe that any government department will ever have the real expertise tofinda solution itself. I believe that we cannot find a suitable natural disaster scheme complex and difficult as it will be to find,without the full and continuing co-operation of the insurance industry itself. If we want any reminder of that we need only look at the damage that was caused in Darwin by cyclone Tracy. We need look no further than even the occasional earth quakes that occur in Western Australia, the State from which my friend the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) comes. Overseas re-insurance has been to our great advantage. Mr Deputy Speaker, I resist the temptation to speak further on the Bills we are now discussing. I have given an undertaking to my Whip that I will limit my remarks. I believe in essence that the amendments to the legislation are necessary. They have been introduced to overcome the teething problems of the 1973 Act which was brought in sincerely. Although we are proposing regulation making powers in this legislation this House, and hopefully more honourable members than are sitting here at the moment, will have to take a greater interest in this area because, as the honourable member for Lilley said, insurance cannot be looked at in isolation; it has to be regarded as part of our general economic situation. Any economic policy of this country needs to include a solution to the problems of insurance. I strongly suppon both Bills.",52
155,Unknown,TRANSPORT GROUPS,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,53
156,Mr JACOBI,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Whilst I suppon the amendment to both Bills, I must confess that I do so with some sense of concern and reservation, particularly with regard to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns). I am not impressed with the transfer of many of the provisions in the Act, particularly the Life Insurance Act, to regulations. I would prefer them to remain subject to parhamentary scrutiny. However, I indicated earlier that there are a couple of matters dealing with clauses 28 and 113 that I want to raise during the Committee stage. I warn the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in advance of my intention to do so. I was interested in some of the comments made by the honourable member for Lilley. I might say at the outset that we are dealing with an industry which in this country is as large as, if not larger than, the vehicle building industry and which has very important consequences whichever way we look at it. The honourable member made the observation that in Britain there are 2 industries, one good and one bad, the bad one being the shipbudding industry, the inference from his analysis being that the good one is the insurance industry. I think there are some pretty cogent reasons why the insurance industry is rather well estabRevenue. lished in Britain so far as its invisible earnings concerned. I think it is the largest industry in Great Britain in terms of invisible earnings. think one of the reasons is that it is not subject the same tax imposts as we have in this country with our rather constructive federal system. Apart from that, I commend to the honourable member a study of the recent rather voluminous amendments to the Acts in Britain in 1973. must confess that until then the industry in that country was not all that good. I think the industry itself might have been all right, lance in Britain was not quite so good. Regrettably, the provisions were rather at fragmented between the Insurance Act and the Companies Act. It was because of the collapse of companies in the insurance industry, such as the vehicle and general companies that the amendments came about. The lack of surveUlance provisions in the British Act largely resulted, I think, in the collapse of vehicle and general companies in Great Britain and this had after effects in Australia also. They found in 1973, as undoubtedly we found, that both Acts had been overlooked and forgotten until a crisis stage was reached. It is one of the tragedies in this country that we pass Acts and then consider that we have finished our obUgations. I suggest to the Minister that this is one industry where we should not be permitted to do that. It is an industry that should be subject constantly to surveUlance. The other observation which the honourable member for LUley made was with regard to workmen's compensation; compulsory third party and motor vehicle insurance. He knows as well as I do that it is a dictum of private enterprise that you socialise your deficits and capitalise your profits. This is what is termed in the insurance industry as 'the sink end of the market'. In nearly every State that deficit end of the market is being handed over to government insurance commissions. I would like briefly to make some constructive comments on some of the measures contained in the Bill. I think the honourable members for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) and Adelaide (Mr Hurford) covered what I think is the necessity to liberalise some of the solvency provisions of the Act, so I do not intend to canvass that point. But one matter upon which I would like to pass some comments concerns stamp duty and fire brigade charges. As I understand it, Australia and New Zealand are the only countries that levy fire brigade charges on policy holders. Frankly, I think it is high time the procedure was updated as such charges ought to be taken from Consolidated To do so would be more effective and are efficient, and certainly more equitable. Above all, the States would have to justify the increases I in costs if the charges were taken from Conto solidated Revenue. At present there can be an increase in the levy with no attention at all being given to efficiency. Stamp duty is an unfair imposition on policy holders and I intend to deal with that when I come to clause 113. I think it I ought to be understood throughout the length and breadth of this country that an impost such as the fire brigade levy is borne by the insured but the surveUand not by the insurer. At the moment, in my State of South Australia any rate,firebrigade levies constitute about 22 per cent of the premiums. I think it is time that aspect was looked at constructively throughcovered out Austraha. The same thing could be said stamp duty which is a source of income to the States but again, is an imposition that is borne the insured not by the insurer. I have undertaken to cut down mytimeas much as possible so I would like to make only a couple of other quick observations. May I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that I find it rather odd the surveUlance provisions, in terms of investinvestment ment, will apply to Ufe companies and not general insurance companies. I find that a omission. I do not find anything in the Minister's second reading speech as to whether the Governon ment will have the same surveUlance over investmately ments for general insurance companies as it will have over Ufe companies. My analysis of the some 16 companies that have gone into Uquia dation is that their situation has been as a result of 2 things-manageria l incompetence or investinformation. ment incompetence. I think that is an area at come. which the Minister should look. The other matter which I raise briefly is agree wholeheartedly with the honourable memoffices ber for Melbourne Ports in that I do not think Administrative Appeals Tribunal is an approprito ate tribunal to deal with appeals in this area. think they are far better and more adequately catered for under a more independent tribunal. turn to that part of the second reading speech the Minister which deals with Ufe insurance and would Uke to put 2 questions to the Minister. speech states: It is proposed to strengthen the supervision over registered life insurers. The Bill requires them to seek permission the Life Insurance Commissioner before they commence form of business other than life or general insurance. ever, the Commissioner will permission to enter non-insurance area unless he is that such entry would be to the detriment of existing spective policy holders. The question obviously to be asked is: What is the situation if the insurer is satisfied that it not be to die detriment of poticy holders? WUl the decision of the Commissioner in this case final and irrevocable? If not, what procedure will take place in that circumstance? The second part of the Minister's second reading speech states: The existing legislation provided that a life insurance pany shall not invest directly company. The statement goes on. As I understand investments by Ufe office companies in particular have never reached the stage where they have felt obhgated to undertake directorships. I want to deal briefly in the UmitedtimeI have avaUable to the question of investments. Since I entered that this place in 1970 I have tried to get 2 areas legislatively sufficiently to protect policy of holders, whether of general or life insurance. One area is the need for greater surveillance over by investments by insurance companies and the second is to have legislative reform in the area of competency of directors or actuaries attached to insurance companies. I suppose it is fair to say that experience overseas of policy holders has that shown that poor management and speculative has cost poUcy owners very dearly into this country, the United Kingdom and the gross United States. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out, the average return investments to life companies is approxi6.6 per cent. I suggest that is not good investment policy. It is a characteristic of Ufe offices that their investment performance leaves lot to be desired. Unfortunately it is not possible to demonstrate this by published statistical We may get that in some years to The type of inefficiency probably can be best that I indicated by examining the activities of Ufe over the past years in 4 main areas of the investment. I suggest that the Government ought have a look at them. Those areas are: PubUc I securities,fixedinterest lending, ordinary shares and property. If we take those four together and I analyse them the record does not stand up well at of all. The Income Tax Act does not oblige hfe I offices to invest 30 per cent of their assets in The government or semi-government securities. It is correct to pursue a policy where such investments are long dated because the liabilities of the from offices are of a long term nature. However, if it is a anticipated that long term interest rates will rise Howproper investment management principles not be able to refuse an insurer satisfied would indicate a shift from long dated to short or prodated stocks with a shift back to long dated stocks once the increase had been achieved. WhUst the nature of the Australian capital marwUl ket precludes switching of the large amounts of stocks already held there is no reason why an be office, when subscribing to a new government loan, should not restrict itself to the snort end if it thinks those rates wUlrise.Over the last decade there has been a pattern of steadyrisein interest rates. Yet except perhaps for a few exemptions in comthe last few years all offices appear to have or indirectly in another such invested automatically in long dated stock and have suffered a substantial faU in capital values it, most as a consequence. I suggest that the following ought to be noted: In the case offixedinterest lending a significant consideration often has been whether granting of the loan will facUitate the writing of new hfe insurance business. I think that is worth ing. In such cases loans have been made on terms less remunerative than in alternative situations avaUable in the market place. As is explained elsewhere, far from being a compensating factor for this lower return the additional business obtained is a further drain on the emerging profits of the office. How often have we witthat nessed that? Such sketchy information as is avaUafter able about Ufe office investments in ordinary shares indicates something of the propensity buying at the top of the market and selling at the bottom. MrKelly-Ha!",53
157,Mr JACOBI,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I am dehghted that the honourmathematical able member for Wakefield agrees with me. He has heard that view before, no doubt. Where has been possible to compare the investment formances of funds managed by life offices with those managed by, say, a merchant bank, the latutilise ter's performance is superior. I am deUghted that the honourable member would concede that. istic Life office property investments have been turn characterised by a late and massive jump onto the band waggon signposted earlier by more that enUghtened investors. The appropriateness of property investment in the Australian climate should have been obvious to life offices 10 to years ago. A steady program of property investlast ment over that period, instead of the mad scramble of recent years, would have benefited both the hfe offices' policyholders and the national economy as a whole. Surely nobody highly would disagree with that assessment. I turn to general insurance. This is the area necessary about which I am very concerned. The nature of is, these companies' investment is somewhat honourable different from that of life offices as their liabilities are of a much shorter term nature. However, their pubhshed earnings generally indicate much lower return on assets than should be expected of the average, efficient investor. of this again would be due to the propensity make loans on the basis of business connections rather than their intrinsic investment merits. ought to have a look at some of the decisions of liquidators in this area to see just how true that The main cause for poor investment perforUquidation mance of both life and general offices alluded is the calibre of people administering these polihave cies. The explanation of this lies within the that offices are currently organised, and have been for many years. It is only fair to point out that the same weakness is currently inherent in all largefinancialinstitutions in Australia. For example, I cite the investment performance of repeatthose administering the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. I am deUghted to note that this is now in far better shape than most insurance companies so far as investments are concerned. Finally, I turn to the question of technical so management, particularly of general insurance companies. The man in the street tends to believe general insurance premiums are ascertained high powered analysis of all statistics available relating to the risks of being an insurer. for WhUst for some decades in Europe this has been true there has also been substantial research into the size of adequate reserves for general insurance companies, in Australia little use has been made indeed of acturial or other skilled or statistical advice by general insurance companies, although I know of one in it New South Wales which has done this extenpersively and has paid handsome dividends to it. The failure of the management of the industry to or perhaps even to be aware of the body of expert advice avaUable regrettably, is characterof the general inefficiency of the industry. I briefly to the last matter with which I wish to deal before the Committee stages of the BUls; is, the question of the provision dealing with fit and proper persons. Since the British Act was changed in 1973 I have tried to get a similar pro15 vision put into both Federal Acts. As recently as week in relation to this matter I received a reply from the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to question greatly on notice No. 364. He replied: (I )-(4) The Government is yet to be convinced that the controversial provisions contained in the United Kingdom insurance legislation in relation to the control of investments and oversight of the suitability of directors are or appropriate in Australia. Insurance legislation however, kept under continuing review and I refer the member to amendments recently introduced. The amendments that have been introduced since the 1973 Act have been largely machinery. a The 2 areas where insurance companies are most vulnerable are in managerial incompetence and Much bad investments. I do not know how many to honourable members in this House have any conception- I noticed the remark made by the One honourable member for Lilley before the suspension of the sitting for dinner-of what hapis. pens to policyholders in Australia following the of an insurance company. How many to have gone into the Minister's office? How many gone into the office of the honourable memways ber for LUley? I can tell honourable members that many have come into mine. Liquidation is a tragedy and a disaster. Any piece of legislation that can constructively overcome that sort of situation ought to be entertained and adopted in this Parliament. It was found in Great Britain that because of the very nature of the insurance industry different criteria applied in that industry from those applying to an ordinary company on the stock exchange. I do not know of any honourable member in this chamber who has any conception of what happened to many people between 1969 and 1973. Literally tens of thousands of people throughout the length and breadth of Australia suffered hardship, anxiety, breakdowns and bankruptcy because of the liquidation of insurance companies. There is no recourse or access at all to those people. An article in the London Times states: Fortunately only about 10 cases a year come up for under the fit and proper persons criteria. And that, ing the fact that the department's 120 insurance monitoring thousands of people in 800 registered insurance companies, is perhaps some source of comfort. The ment has no power to order the removal of an unfit but as it has power to stop ness if he does not go voluntarily this amounts same thing. Most people served with notices that the ment considers them unfit go managers, when their company does not have to informed of the official action against its servant. In of a chief executive or controller though the company have to be informed. At all events, the Department stresses that it tries to preserve the utmost confidentiality. Such confidentiality, it is assured if the acdon were a judicial instead of an executive one. Someone who feels that he has been wrongfully sed can appeal to the courts for a ruling that the Department has acted ultra vires",55
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,Order! The industries honourable member'stimehas expired.,56
159,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"This is a cognate debate. I shall address my remarks the life insurance aspect of it. Life insurance Australia is regulated by the Life Insurance 1945-1973 which restricts the business to ate bodies registered by the Life Insurance missioner. A high standard of entry is mainseen tamed. AppUcants for registration must that they can conduct a self-contained, wellorganised operation in Australia with experirendered enced management and adequate financial resources for development. Registered comthe panies are required to establish one or more statutory Ufe insurance funds to secure policy liabilities and to lodge with the Commissioner audited accounts and balance sheets, actuarial abstracts and other returns, by means of which the Commissioner can supervise the companies and protect the interests of policy holders. Most of the returns are avaUable for public informasponsible tion. No Ufe insurance policy may be issued uninquiries less the premium rates for its class have been tified as adequate by an actuary and each comoccurred pany is required to have an actuarial valuation made regularly of its policy liabilities on a basis which is at least as strong as the minimum basis prescribed under the legislation. The Life Insurance Amendment Bill 1977 amends the Life Insurance Act 1945. It will update and improve existing supervisory machinery established by the Act to take into account changes in money values and business practices. These have altered considerably since the original Act became law. The previous Act of over 31 years ago has been most successful in preventing faUures among life insurance companies in Australia. This can be classed as an industry with fewrivalsin thisfieldthroughout the world. The review present Bill brings modifying provisions in the considerhght of experience since the Act came into full staff are operation on 1 August 1974. The main provisions of the Act are stated clearly in the second Departreading speech of the Minister for Post and Teleperson communications and Minister Assisting the his company taking on a new busialmost to the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson). DepartLife assurance companies play a great part in quietly, particularly if they are be the economic growth of Australia and are easily the case the largest investors in this country. I cite the does Australian Mutual Provident Society which of Trade alone has close to $300m each year to invest. These investments, along with other substantial argued in Whitehall, would not be life assurance companies, assist in developing all dismiskinds of industries across Australia and play a very large part in our way of life. These funds contribute to natural resources development in such as iron ore, steel, pastoral, petroleum, natural gas, aluminium, fertilisers, chemicals, timber, mining and quarrying. Assurto ance funds are playing a major part in the in growth of primary and secondary industry, the Act provision of housingfinance,new suburban corporshopping centres and housing estates and Comredevelopment of central city areas. It can be that life assurance plays a significant role in show the lives of many Australians. Unfortunately, the number of life policies surhas accelerated sharply since the former Labor Government virtually destroyed tax incentive on premium payments. This was a tragedy and a great national loss because the loss of family security and cover could mean financial hardship for thousands of families should a breadwinner suddenly die. On inquiry, the main cause of complaint was related to the amount offered or available as surrender value. Inquiries on this subject have been largely refor the increase in the total number of in the last 2 years and are undoubtedly cerassociated with the substantial increase that has in the surrender of policies since 1975. Policies are surrendered for a variety of reasons, but it is evident that a contributing factor to the increased surrenders of recenttimeshas been the concern on the part of pohcy owners as to the loss of value of pohcy in real terms during periods of high inflation. As the owner of a pohcy is always likely to suffer some loss of equity on surrender of the pohcy, it is encouraging to note that the rise in the volume of surrenders now appears to be slowing down significantly. Latest figures issued by the Life Insurance Commissioner show that at 31 December 1975, 5 635 000 life policies were hi existence in this country for a total insured sum of $39,214.8m with annual premiums of $715.6m. On the superannuation side there are 660 000 policies in operation for an insured sum of $20,885.6m with annual premiums of $553,430,000. Industrial policies total $2,011,000 for the sum insured of $l,597.7m. The annual premium amounts to $58.74m. This represents a total of 8 306 000 pohcies for sums insured of $61,698.1m at an annual premium of $1,327.17m. Superannuation business sums continued to increase during 1975 although the rate of increase was only 29.3 per cent as compared with 43.2 per cent during 1974. There was substantial rise in the sums insured which were discontinued. The rate of increase in discontinuance for 1975 was 41.3 per cent. In 1974, it was 5.5 per cent. These results have probably been influenced by the difiicult economic conditions which existed in those years. Of course the superannuation amounts have been increased on behalf of the contributors to take care of inflation. Life companies do an awful lot of good for low income groups. Payments to widows and orphans are in many cases the only assets that those people possess. These companies should not be knocked for their activity in the life insurance field in Austraha. Life insurance meets a basic human need-the necessity to protect a famdy against loss of income through old age and death. By joining a common pool of people concerned about the same issues, a person can provide for himself or herself and for dependants, financial security which would otherwise be impossible to attain. Under the Act still in force, 30 per cent of life companies' funds are required to be invested in Commonwealth, local and semi-government loans. We know what great benefit these investments are to the community right across the board. The industry is anxious to have the Act modernised. It realises that changes have taken place in conditions, the forms of policies and public demand, making it desirable to modernise some areas of the legislation. The then Minister Assisting the Treasurer stated in his second reading speech that new problems have arisen which are not covered by the Act. Under those circumstances it would appear that there wdl have to be a much wider review to determine what kind of supervisory legislation is best suited to Australia's life insurance industry in the future. We should be prepared for further legislation in this field to take care of this situation. The real worry of the industry is the tax problem. The 1973-74 Labor Budget increased the tax burden of life offices by 350 per cent. Its burden increased more heavdy than that of anyone else. It has fallen into the category of being the only taxpayer not allowed to claim operating expenses as a tax deduction. It is the only business operation in this country that is not allowed to do so. It is not allowed to claim a deduction for its selling expenses. Approximately 15 per cent of the clerical expenses are allowed as a deduction by life companies. This has the effect of reducing the bonus payments that are made to policy holders. There are virtually no shareholders in these companies. So the policy holders certainly must be the ones to lose out. The 1975 Hayden Budget introduced a general rebate of $540. As I have mentioned previously, this has been a disaster to the insurance industry and a disaster to the taxpayers of this country. Mr MCVeigh-It taxed the pensioners, too.",56
160,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Yes . The amount of $1,350 in deductions has to be reached before substantial income earners can receive a deduction of 40 per cent on amounts spent in the allowable area. Most people receive the rebate irrespective of whether they have life insurance. The limit of $1,200 has not been increased since 1967. It should now be of the order of $3,000. The $1,200 allowance covers $800 for life insurance and $400 for superannuation. It is possible that those figures should be reversed and that it should be $800 for superannuation and $400 for life insurance. An old anomaly is the fate of the self employed. An employee is allowed $1,200. An employer is allowed exactly the same amount. A self employed person morally should be entitled to a greater benefit than $ 1,200.",57
161,Mr LUSHER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,It is cheaper than paying pensions.,57
162,Mr OKEEFE,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"That is right. An increase in the limit certainly would be of tremendous value to the small businessman. I support this legislation, which will be of great benefit. As I mentioned previously, we can expect further legislation to be introduced which also will be of benefit to the industry and to the holders of the policies of these splendid life offices which mean so much to Austraha's development and to the safeguarding of family life.",57
163,Mr VINER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal power. Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.35)-The honourable members who have participated in this debate have raised a number of matters concerning the 2 Bills that we deaUng with cognately. I will endeavour to deal with each of those matters or at least the substanpermission tive matters that have been raised by individual honourable members. Some have been raised by more than one honourable member. Hence I will deal with those matters collectively. I shall take first the speech by the honourable the member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who spoke of a proposal of which notice the Opposition for the establishment of a comhonourable members, mittee to examine the insurance industry. I point Government side, life offices out to the honourable member that the industry gest investors in Australia, particularly is currently being examined in detaU by the tralian Law Reform Commission following a reference by the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott). is Furthermore, the Government insurance consultative committees tion of general revision of the Life is being examined by the Government, as was in-of a Ufe office in anothereven dicated by the then Minister Assisting the This has been a constant source Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) in introducing life offices in carrying out their proper these BUls. So I think it can be seen from that thatrole. I am sure the honourable gentleman the Government is active in the field of revision of the law deaUng with the insurance industry. WhUst those inquiries and that act of revision are going on within the Government and outside the exchanges Government there would not appear need to take on an examination by a of the kind proposed by the Opposition. The honourable member for Adelaide also spoke of some concern about the granting of regulation-making power under this legislation. The Government does not blithely go into the authorising of actions by regulation. It appreciment ates that government by regulation can be done. The honourable member has quite proppresent erly referred to the vigdance of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. It that serves a very useful purpose in seeing that no government-neithe r this Government nor any other one-is granted too much regulation-makprevent, ing power. Certainly the Life Insurance Amendapplication ment Bill will enable a number of changes on detaUed matters by regulation, such as monetary Umits governing payments under poUcies. will allow the legislation to be kept up to those detaUed matters and ensure that the legisparticularly lation is not the cause of hardship because of a delay in the payment of policy proceeds. If the matter is looked at fairly by honourable gentlemen I think it will be seen that there is to be no excessive use of the regulation-making The honourable member for Adelaide also asked why the Insurance Commissioner has been given authority to take other employment. As the are proposed amendment provides, if that employment is to be taken it has to be taken with the of the Treasurer. The amendments in this respect are in line with current practice in relation to statutory office holders. So there is nothing unusual or sinister in what is proposed. Another matter that was referred to by the honourable gentleman, particularly in regard to Life Insurance Amendment Bill, concerned has been given by investments briefly on by Ufe offices. I shall comment that. As has been pointed out by other particularly those on the are amongst the laron the Ausstock exchanges. The purpose of the amendment to avoid investment being unduly inhibited is consulting with ing hasaonly where company in which a life office is investa small or remote interest in another and the queslife office. Under Insurance Act tion 39 sub-sectionthe(2), existing provisions of seca rniniscule interest Ufe office is prevented. of difficulty for investment will appreciate this point and the fact that life offices are such substantial investors in the stock of Australia. The amendment to be any limits which areare specifies what considered to be reasonable committee of poticy holders.considered So there to be in the interests is nothing unreasonable in the proposal which is put forward. The honourable gendeman, as did also the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), referred to clause 32 of the Insurance AmendBUI deaUng with section 113 of the Act. overThat amendment is proposed because the section has been found to be not workable. Indeed, it has not yet been proclaimed for reason. The variations that have been made will benefit Australians who cannot obtain satisfactory insurance cover in Australia. It does not as would have been the case under the of the present section, Australians from obtaining insurance overseas, but it does protect those overseas insurers who have This obtained authorisation to operate within date onAustralia. The honourable member for Cook spoke of the British insurance industry. Lloyds, which of course is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, re-insurers in the world, is authorised to take insurance in Australia from Australians. The other provisions of the amendlong-term ment deal simply with the obtaining of statistical and other informadon and to see that there is no abuse of the exemptions provided for. It is for informadon gathering and ought not to be source of inhibition of those Australians who wish to obtain insurance with overseas insurers. Mention was made of the decision to remove from the Insurance Act the present provisions dealing with national interest tests for Ushment of new insurance companies. Very briefly, it has become quite clear that the life general sectors of the industry are already subclause ject to very close supervision under the insurance legislation. Proposals for overseas investment the industry in Austraha are subject to examinman ation under the Government's foreign investrefuses ment poUcy. Very clear guidelines are laid there with respect to investment in the insurance industry. The industry is also subject to trade practices legislation. So within the existing framework of Government policy and legislation it is clear that there is no need to include insurance legislation itself this national interest test. Within the existing policy and legislation is felt that criteria relating tofinancialsoundness can be met and that market forces should be algeneral lowed to determine the structure of the industry rather than any artificial structure imposed government. A number of honourable members mentioned insurance. the transfer of jurisdiction from the Insurance Tribunal to the Administrative Appeals Trito bunal. Under clause 24, particularly sub-clause (11), non-presidential members hearing an insurance appeal are required to have expertise in the insurance industry. So the Government aware of the need for speciaUst members to sit insurance appeals. A number of honourable members, including the honourable member for Adelaide, the for honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and the honourable member for Cook referred to the minimum valuation basis and changes that will be provided by regulations purI suant to clause 36 of the Life Insurance Amendofthe ment Bill, particularly relating to interest rates, mortahty tables and the expense allowance the selling of poUcies. The purpose of this is allow these tables and hence the minimum valuinterest ation basis to be kept up to date rapidly as cumstances change. That necessarily will require close consultation with the Life Insurance Comwhich missioner, the Australian Government Actuary and industry representatives. So, whUe indices provide a useful guide in assessing whether the basis is up to date, it is necessaiy nature of life insurance that UabUities are valued conservatively, thus ensuring stabUity of the industry. It is stressed that regulations to purely change the basis will not be brought forward a until the matter has been fully discussed with representatives of the industry. That should provide both the industry and policy holders with a clear understanding of the concern of the Government to safeguard their interests. the estabThe honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) mentioned a number of matters. I will and deal very briefly with two of them. He referred to 6, the proposed new section 16A, dealing with a company carrying on another form of hi business. I point out to the honourable gentlethat if the Life Insurance Commissioner permission to carry on some other form down of business then the company has a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Furthermore the honourable gentleman in referring generally to both BUls asked why there is a suspension of certain life insurance investments in when there is no similar investment supervision for general insurance. Might I shortly say to him it that the types of investment undertaken by Ufe insurers differ greatly from those undertaken by insurers. Experience has shown that certain investments by hfe insurers need to be superby vised in the manner which is proposed and there is not the same requirement for general In closing my comments on the contributions the second reading debate might I say that it was with a great deal of irony that I heard the honourable member for Adelaide speak of the interest of the Australian Labor Party in the is insurance industry. His memory must be short, on but I am sure that the industry's is not, because as was pointed out by honourable members on the Government side-the honourable member Lilley and the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe)-grea t damage was done to the insurance industry by the former Labor Government during such a short period in office. would just ask the insurance industry to beware honeyed words of the honourable member for Adelaide. They are no better than the docfor trinaire approach taken by Labor Treasurers to under the last Government. I noticed with great that the honourable member for Melcirbourne Ports (Mr Crean) in speaking in this debate did not retract one iota from the things he and other Labor Treasurers did. It is a matter that ought to be of great concern to the insurance industry itself to hear these words but then to reflect on the experience it had under the in view of the former Administration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bdl read a second time. The Bdl. Proposed new clause 34A.",58
164,Mr VINER,TRANSPORT GROUPS," I move: That the following new clause be inserted in the Bill: ""34A. Section 124 of the Principal Aa is amended inserting after sub-section (1) the following sub-section: ""(IA) In proceedings in any coun, a certificate hand of the Commissioner that a requirement of this Act specified in the certificate(a) had or had not been complied with at a date or within a period specified in the certificate; or (b) has been complied with upon a date specified in the certificate, but not before that date, is prima facie evidence of the matters specified in the certificate"" '. The purpose of this amendment is to overcome substantial weakness in the Insurance Act 1973 which has become apparent since the Bdl was tionship introduced. A number of authorised companies have persistently offended against section 44 not lodging returns required within the period specified, and it is desired to prosecute the worse offenders. However, advice from the Crown authorities indicates that in their present form the provisions of the Insurance Act regarding prosecution for late lodgement of documents are unworkable for all practical purposes and thus do not provide an adequate basis upon which institute proceedings. It is emphasised that requirement that companies make detailed that returns and statements at specified intervals fundamental to the effective administration of the legislation. Thus, the amendment will enable the Commissioner to prosecute in appropriate cases for late lodgement of returns. It has been drafted along the lines of section 12 (4) of Companies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory and will facditate the Commissioner's task of proving the non-lodgement of documents to the satisfaction of the court.",60
165,Mr HURFORD,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"The Opaddress position supports this amendment. We are very glad to learn that the Government found this improvement intimefor it to be made before Bill became an Act. As the Minister Assisting Treasurer (Mr Viner) oudined, the fact is that prosecutions which should be made for the betcan ter supervision of the industry by government have not been lodged because of this weakness. It would be interesting to learn, of course, why this amendment was not included when the Bill was drawn rather than at this stage, but perhaps that is a story which will come out on some other occasion. I am not going to speak for much longer. My colleague the honourable member In Committee for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), who I told the House, if the House did not already know, during my speech in the second reading debate is an expert in this field of insurance, is to be congratulated for the interest he has taken and the valuable work he has done in making sure that there is more security for policy holders, particularly in by the general insurancefield.He will be joining the Committee stages of this debate for a very short under the time to apply himself to section 113. Whilst thanking the Minister for dealing with the details of the points I raised in my speech, nevertheless I must say that his reply was spoiled by the last couple of minutes of gratuitous nonsense. He need not be worried about the Labor Opposition's relationship with the insurance a industry. What he should be worried about in drawing up legislation is his own Party's relawith the insurance industry. I am glad to say that the Labor Opposition now has a very by good relationship with the insurance industry. Communications have been established in both directions, and that is the way they will continue Law while I am Opposition spokesman on economic affairs. I believe that the insurance industry a knows it was misled for political reasons by the Liberal and National Country Parties during the time of the Labor Government. It was misled to into emotional arguments concerning Australian the Government insurance corporations, believing they were hidden monsters. But I can assure is you, Mr Deputy Chairman, and I know that you will be very happy to learn this, that indeed those misunderstandings are now being cleared up and proper relationships have been restored with the insurance industry. Dialogue will continue and the the Labor Opposition will communicate with the insurance industry on occasions such as this concerning legislation in relation to that industry.",60
166,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TRANSPORT GROUPS," I shall myself for a very few moments to clauses 16, 32 and 36 of this Bill, since we are considering it in a Committee of the Whole. Clauses 16 the and 36 rather hang together and give the cathe pacity for regulations as to valuations and the minimum rate of interest to be determined. They be determined by regulation, and I shall consider those 2 clauses together. I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Viner). I raised this matter during the second reading debate, and the Minister indicated that in these matters the Government would consult with the Commissioner and with the industry and that something would then be done. What wdl be done and how will it be determined? That explanation does not satisfy me, nor could it satisfy anybody. If there are going to be consultations with an industry, on whom does the initiative lie with respect to the decision to consult? When will it occur? Above all, what is the nature of the decisions which will come out of that consultation in terms of the interest rate for the assessment of the minimum rate of value of UabUities in the various statutory funds according to Schedule 2? What is the interest rate to be? I suggest that that kind of proposition ought to attract the Minister so that some assurance can be given that the interest rate, according to which the minimum basis of valuation of the aggregate liabilities of a statutory fund shall be determined, shall be one per cent, say, below the return on assets as determined by the Commissioner for that year; or if the interest rate has to be determined in a year for which the Commissioner has not determined the rate of return on assets, one could go 2 years earUer and catch up in that way. One has to have assurances as to the way in which minds are going to work in determining what that interest rate will be. I assume that that is simple common sense, and that a variety of formulae are avaUable when there is a lag between the year for which the interest rate return can be determined by the Commissioner and the year at which he has to determine the value of liabUities. With a little bit of flexibility of mind, there are many ways in which that can be assessed. But the assurance needs to be given, and I believe it deserves to be given. After all, a difference of one per cent in the interest rate could make a difference of $200m to $400m being returnable to pohcy holders over a period of four or five years, and that is on a very conservative assumption. It also determines the extent to which the benefits will accrue to policyholders in the future as against poUcy-holders today, who want to receive the benefits today or who want to receive the bonuses. I do not beheve it is a proposition to be put aside as having no value whatsoever. That is my comment in respect of the minimum rate of interest to be determined under the Schedule. Returning again to the matter of the life tables, I do not know whether the Minister responded to that in his reply.",60
167,Mr VINER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"No , I did not.",61
168,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"The Minister did not indicate what life tables were to be utilised. There is a whole host of good reasons why the Ufe tables to be utilised-again , they are nominated in Schedule 2 and are governed by clauses 16 and 36-shoul d be as recent as possible and not ones which are rather dated. One only has to look through the Schedule at the moment to see that some of the tables to be utilised lie in the period of the 1930s. The difference in mortahty rates in all age groups and sexes varies very much as between the 1930s and today and differs very substantially as between the 1950s and today. For example, statistical bulletin number 4.31 was released by the Commonwealth Statistician only recentiy and gives the Australian Ufe tables for 1970 to 1972.1 will quote Mr Caffin in his comments on the life tables as they are today: The decline in the rates of mortality which has been shown in each of the Australian Life Tables this century except for the Australian Life Tables 1965-67, has again taken place in the present Tables for the years 1970 to 1972. When we refer to appendix D it is quite clear that there is a significant gradation over the period of time. So we ask: What Ufe tables is it the intention to apply for the purpose of these calculations according to the regulations? Some assurance needs to be given. Again, that affects very significantly and cogently the return that is to be given to people who are either policy holders or who will receive bonuses from the life insurance companies. The third point which I want to mention to the Minister- I hope that he would consider it-con cerns clause 32.1 refer to clause 32 (13) which is dealt with on page 13 of the Bill. This determines the membership of the tribunal that shall be considering certain appeals. From line 13 onwards, certain people are debarred from being members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The sub-clause states: A non-presidential member of the Tribunal shall not sit as a member of the Tribunal for the purposes of a review of a reviewable decision . . . if he is a director or employee of a company, body corporate or body carrying on (whether in Australia or elsewhere) life insurance business or insurance business. That exception is fair enough and the intention of it is quite clear. But I ask the Minister: Would not it be appropriate for him to consider that insurance brokers also be debarred from sitting on the Tribunal? Insurance brokers, even in the example I cited this afternoon, and from one's experience tend to develop a relationship with an insurance company or an organisation-eve n a predominant relationship with an insurance company or a particular organisation. I suggest that insurance brokers should be considered as falling into the same category of being debarred as is suggested in clause 32 (13). It would make a number of the people in the industry rather happier than they would be with what I think is simple oversight. I hope that it will be considered carefully by the Minister. So the 3 clauses to which I want to refer",61
169,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,Mr GILES) Order! Would the honourable member for Lilley explain to me what clause of the Bill he is now debating?,62
170,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TRANSPORT GROUPS,I am debating clause 32(13).,62
171,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Is not that a clause of a Bill the Committee is yet to consider? Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Chairman, we are considering the Bdl as a whole.",62
172,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Yes , but we have 2 Bdls to deal with. I have a feeling that honourable member for LUley is debating the second Bill and not diefirstBUI.",62

174,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,Exactiy .,62
175,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Nevertheless, I ask the Minister to consider my comments when replying. I would not dare repeat them when we come to deal with the Life Insurance Amendment Bill. It has been rather obvious what I have been speaking about. I have been speaking to the Life Insurance Amendment Bill. I think that my remarks have been self-explanatory.",62
176,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Before I call any other honourable member, there is another small problem I wish to raise. I put the question to the Committee a whUe ago: 'The question is: That die new clause proposed to be amended be so amended'. In fact, the honourable member for LUley was out of order in not debating the amendments. Might I get an indication as to whether the other 2 speakers in the debate wish to debate the amendment? Mr Jacobi-No- I do not wish to debate the amendment to clause 24.",62
177,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I think in this circumstance I will call the honourable member for Denison to debate the amendment. Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Chairman, Iriseto order. The Committee may have 2 BUls before it. But you asked the Committee whether it wanted to take the Bill as a whole. I think that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) wished to talk about the major Bill that is before the Committee which includes the amendment. Am I correct? If so, I think that you should caU just a the honourable member for Hawker first.",62
178,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"I will clear up this matter. I do not think I have gone far enough in my explanation to the Committee. The question before the Committee at present is 'that the amendment be agreed to'. Having disposed of that argument in a little while on the vote of the Committee, the next question I put is 'that the Bill, as amended, be agreed to'. Quite frankly, that is the more legitimate area for debating the sort of issue raised by the honourable member for LUley, if he were talking to the right Bill, which he was not. I would think that a direct debate on the amendment such as the honourable member for Denison says he is about to present would be proper to call on after which I will put the the question and then I presume that the honourable member for Hawker would be prepared to debate the question that the Bill, as amended, be agreed to. Is that how the honourable member for Hawker would wish it? Mr Jacobi-Provide d I can speak to clause 32 (13), I am delighted. But I ask the honourable member not to take too long.",62
179,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,I call the honourable member for Denison.,62
180,Mr HODGMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS," I find this amendment offensive though not to the extent of leading to a revolution. It is yet another example of the Parliament writing into the statutes a provision that a certificate shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of the matters specified in that certificate. I have consistently opposed such provision in State and Commonwealth legislation because I believe it is wrong to bring a defendant before a court and instead of confronting him with witnesses whom he can cross examine, confronting him with a certificate. The situation under section 124 as it stands at the moment is that a certificate under the hand of the Commissioner certifying as to certain matters shaU be received in all courts as evidence of the matters certified. This takes it further and states that for the purpose of the prosecution a certificate is, 'prima facie evidence of the matters specified in the certificate'. This means that unless a representative of a company goes into the witness box and gives evidence-and having given evidence he can be cross-examined at large- a conviction must follow because the certificate will not have been answered. I lodge what is probably a protest 20 years too late. For the last 20 years parUaments have been putting this iniquitous provision into legislation, even in the case of a man who faUs to vote. If he goes along to court to defend that prosecudon, he is not confronted by witnesses. He cannot told the electoral officer what my explanation was on the day in question'. He is confronted a certificate. I do not believe it is good law. fact, I beheve it is bad law. Having made that amount protest, let me say that the provisions of lation are such that we are dealing stantialfines.We are dealing with the reputaI tions of life insurance officers. I beheve that are dealing with the integrity of the managers the insurance profession of this countiy. I want place on record my opposition to a situation in which we facUitate prosecutions by producing certificates instead of producing witnesses. Ueve that it works injustice. I certainly believe does not savetime.There are nearly as many artion guments about certificates as there are about nesses who come into court. Lasdy, I ask the Minister rhetorically friend at the bar: Why is there not a provision in this amendment for a defendant to give notice that he requires the signatory of the certificate be present for cross-examination? I believe that we create a situation in which a certificate f nit in as evidence the Government should east give the defendant, whether it be a pany or an individual, the right to give notice that he desires to cross-examine the man who made out that certificate. I hope that in future we are to put these iniquitous provisions legislation we at least remember that there sides to every prosecution. There is the prosunderstand ecution and there is the defence. I believe that the defendant has inherently a basic right to front the man who accuses him, not to be confronted by a printed government certificate.",62
181,Dr JENKINS,TRANSPORT GROUPS,The honourplacing able member for DenisonMotion (by Mr Bourchier) agreed to: That the question be now put. Proposed new clause agreed to.,63
182,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"The question tainable before the Committee now is: 'That the Bill, amended, be agreed to'. I call the honourable member for Hawker.",63
183,Mr JACOBI,TRANSPORT GROUPS," I wish to make 2 quick observations before I deal with section 113.1 remind the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) that the consultative committee to which he made reference was a compromise beproportion tween me and certain individuals rather than in depth inquiry. The second point concerns Law Reform Commission dealing with contracts. I believe that I gain some prestige by the fact it was because of my efforts that that matter is besay: ' I fore the Law Reform Commission. I turn now to section 113 of the Insurance Act. by In his second reading speech the Minister said: In Fifthly, it has become apparent that a considerable of insurance is being sent to unauthorised insurers the legisoverseas . . . which has not yet been with very subproclaimed . . . would like to be very specific and somewhat cirwecumspect when dealing with this particular matof ter because it is important. I assume that when to deaUng with 'unauthorised insurers overseas' the Minister is referring to insurers overseas who are not authorised under this Act. The Minister will I berecall that during my speech on the last number it of amendments to these Bills I raised the quesof the irresponsible actions by overseas comwitpanies operating within the Australian market and the adverse efTect that they would have on as an old Australian companies. I make 3 observations. Firstly, section 113 has yet to be proclaimed. Secondly, it has been deto cided to allow exemptions from the prohibition if for so-calledflexibUitypurposes. Thirdly, the can be amendments make for more information on at business transactions to overseas unauthorised commarkets. I have very strong reservations about the Government's proposed manipulation of this section of the Act. I believe that the section if should be retained and its full force brought to into bear to ensure that the maximum business is are 2 retained within the Australian market. As I it, if an insurance broker cannot on behalf of a client obtain an acceptable rate in this concountry, he may be obliged, and indeed is often obhged, to place it on the London, New York, Amsterdam or Switzerland market. That means that business with overseas insurers not authorised under the Australian Act. As I understand it also, unauthorised insurers are not prohibited from a slice of the market, subject to certain criteria. That authorisation should be granted, I believe, very sparingly. It should be granted only where cover is not obwithin the Australian market, and that is as where there is a shortage within the Australian market to enable it to underwrite a risk. It should not be used to underwrite, or rather to undercut, the Australian market and thereby create an unstable situation amongst authorised insurers who are obtiged to comply with and meet the provisions of the Insurance Act and to pay their due of income tax, stamp duty and fire an brigade levies, which is largely the source of the funds for fire brigade maintenance throughout Australia. The Minister ought to remember that that when he appUes this section of the Act. Other countries, in particular the United States, certain of the countries in the European Economic Community, South Africa and not the least Mexico- I ask the Minister to note this point-hav e seen fit to legislate to prevent plunder by overseas companies of their own indigenous markets. We ought to be doing exactly the same. This dispensation must be sparingly granted if for no other reason than to enable the maximisation, as far as it is practicable, of protection from exploitation of the Austrahan market by Austrahan companies. I raised in this Parhament very early the proposition that Australian companies ought to get a bigger slice of marine hull insurance. As a result of that and as a result of the actions of the Labor Government, we got at least a proportion of the market. We went from almost ml to 20 per cent. I beheve that a lot more can be done by this Government to galvanise the Austrahan market to capture a greater proportion of insurance business that we are losmg rapidly to overseas markets day after day. The other factor which I think ought to be shed in this context is regrettably the stamp duty impost. We in this country do not seem to realise what a marked effect that impost has in forcing underwriting work on to the overseas market. As I said, much underwriting is placed overseas to obviate the stamp duty impost and the fire brigade levies. One cannot gauge precisely to what extent that occurs, but unquestionably those imposts represent a very large contributing factor. Again it depresses and it obviously creates additional burdens on Australian companies or companies authorised within the Australian market. I wish to raise another matter. Perhaps technically I should not raise it when dealing with section 113, but I raise it in connection with the final amendments to both Bills. I suggest to the Minister that it is well known throughout Austrahan insurance circles that Guardian Royal Exchange, which is a London based company, has for some time been cutting rates to an uneconomical level. If it continues its price premium cutting war, there will be one ultimate result: If Australian companies are forced to compete with that company on its terms some Australian companies could well face liquidation. For instance, recently a State insurance company in South Austraha lost a large parcel of underwriting insurance with the State Bank of South Australia because it was undercut by that London company by as much as 50 per cent. Australian companies just cannot meet that competition. I am reliably informed also that in London, for instance, pressure is being placed on Guardian Royal Exchange in the insurance market to act more responsibly in this competitive field. I impress upon the Minister and upon the Government the fact that we ought to realise that Austrahan companies are underwriting in an extremely limited market and we ought to do what overseas countries do; we ought to structure our legislation to protect our own indigenous market. We have faded to do that. In the interests of market stability in this country, I ask the Minister to have my allegations thoroughly investigated with a view to ensuring that the irresponsible former activities of Guardian Royal Exchange are minimised as far as possible. I conclude by impressing upon the Minister the proposition that if the Government intends to apply section 113 it ought to do so very sparingly if it wants to protect the Australian market.",63
184,Mr VINER,TRANSPORT GROUPS,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.17)-In dealing specifically with the matter raised by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) concerning section 113, it ought to be pointed out that the original intention of the section was to forestall the establishment of unauthorised overseas insurers through agents in Australia and thereby to protect those who are conducting authorised business in Austraha and to protect Australian insurance companies. As the clause was drawn, it would have defeated the intention of the legislation. Brokers and others are not restricted in placing business directly with unauthorised insurers, providing they act on their own behalf or for others in Australia and not as agents of these insurers. But, of course, if an Australian resident places business with an unauthorised overseas company he must make his own judgment as to the security of the insurance which he places. What the Government is doing by means of the amendment is to bring into operation the true intention of the legislation. It is seeing also that information is provided so that it knows the extent of that business overseas. The exemption which is provided for by the proposed amendment to section 113 is necessary to enable the section to be brought into operation without undue disruption to current arrangements in relation to placing business overseas, whdst still protecting the Act from evasion by unauthorised insurers overseas. Against that background I do not think it can lie in anybody's mouth to accuse the Government of setting up the amended section 113 so as to manipulate the insurance industry in Australia in favour of overseas insurers. In fact, if the honourable gendeman has proper regard for the foreign investment guidelines which must be applied in relation to the legislation, it will be seen that the Government is seriously concerned about preserving the interests of Australian insurers whUe at the sametimeahowing Australians proper access to overseas insurers. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report-by leave-adopted . Bill (on motion by Mr Viner)-by leave-rea d a third time. NA Consideration resumed from 31 March, on motion by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.",64
185,Mr VINER,LIFE INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.23 ) - I move: That the Bill be now read a third time. In moving that the Bill be now read a third time might I briefly refer to a matter raised by the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) concerning the nature of decisions upon which alterations will be made in interest rates under the Fourth Schedule and the life tables. Might I say that I am not in a position now to say to the honourable member just what rates will be applied, what new rates will be applied or what particular life tables will be adopted. It is obviously impossible for me here at the table now to say what might be done in the future in order, as I pointed out during the second reading debate, to update the tables and the rates provided for in the Fourth Schedule. The very purpose of the amendment which will enable this to be done by regulation is to allow the speedy updating as there are changes, for example, in mortality rates and interest rates. I think the honourable gentleman would appreciate that I am not in a position to give such information. I am not able to do so for very good reason. As I have said earlier, any changes would, of course, be made only after the closest consultation with the industry and the Life Insurance Commissioner.",65
186,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,LIFE INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL,"I think the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) may have misunderstood what I was trying to convey earlier. I do not want him, nor would I want him, to indicate the minimum interest rate which should apply to the basis evaluation etc. I do not want him to nominate whether it be 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5 per cent or any other figures. I merely wanted the Minister to indicate Third Reading the basis upon which the judgments are to be arrived at after consultation with the Insurance Commissioner and the industry. As a matter of fact, more power and less assurances will exist now as a result of the amendment than existed 1977 previously. Previously the interest rate could not Second Reading be varied other than by an amendment to the Act. If the Bill is passed, as obviously it will be passed, the interest rate will be able to be varied by regulation. But there is no guarantee as to where this will end or the basis upon which the judgment will be applied. I appreciate that the Minister would not want to be trapped into making a year by year random Third Reading judgment, for example, on the return on assets. The latest report of the Insurance Commissioner sets out the return on assets of all classes and all companies for the 5 years to 1974. The report shows that the returns were 6.68 per cent, 6.71 per cent, 6.78 per cent, 6.91 per cent and 7.41 per cent respectively. There are some variations in thesefigures.Of course, we may be speaking in respect of the returns of a company for the year 1975-76. So one could easUy getridof odd random movements by a number of techniques which would be available to the Minister. Techniques such as moving averages and so on would certainly be available to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). I suggest to the Minister that there needs to be some guarantee that the interest rate will have a relationship to what I call the index of returns which is in the Life Commissioner's report and which can be applied to the year in question. I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister once again-h e may have forgotten what I said previously because of the confusion that arose in relation to the 2 BUls-claus e 32 of the Life Insurance Amendment Bill which deals with the membership of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I mentioned the people who were debarred from membership of that body. I suggested that the Minister might consider insurance brokers being appointed to that body. I think it is appropriate that the Minister should consider such appointments. I come back to the quesdon of interest rates. This is an important matter in respect of which there are no principles or guarantees whatsoever. Under this legislation there is less restriction what can be done without regard to any interest rates than existed prior to the amending Bill being passed. Therefore I suggest that the Minister might consider those principles very carefully. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA Debate resumed from 21 April, on motion by Mr Staley: That the Bill be now read a second time.",65
187,Mr VINER,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legismission lation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill would Uke to suggest that it may suit the conhave venience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Commonwealth full-time Teaching Service Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions wdl, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conthe clusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 2 BUls to be discussed in this debate.",66
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 2 measures? As there is no objecbers tion, I shall allow that course to be followed.",66
189,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"Thes e 2 pieces of legislation have already been debated in the Senate where amendments were moved. It is proposed by the Opposition to move simUar amendments here. At the outset honourable members will from the amendments that are being circulated that the Opposition has some reservations in the sense that it now appears that the Technical cation Commission is to be absorbed in what is now known as the Tertiary Education Comindeed mission. I propose to address my remarks almost in to to to the Tertiary Education Commission Bill. However, as honourable members know, are also dealing in cognate fashion with amendcisions ments to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act to which the Opposition has no objection. I have confirmed, the Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bill has already been passed by the Senate. This Bill makes special long service leave provisions for New South Wales technical teachers who joined the Commonwealth Teaching Service between 31 on December 1976 and 1 April 1977 and who were engaged in fulltimeteaching duties in a technical instution in the Australian Capital Territory. The Bill allows former members of the New South Wales teaching service who were teaching in the Australian Capital Territory technical institutions in 1976 and who elected to join the Commonwealth Teaching Service after 31 December 1976 and before 1 April 1977 to preserve their long service leave conditions that apBILL 1977 plied under State legislation in force immediSecond Reading ately prior to their joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service and to treat future teaching service as if it were State service for the purposes of that legislation. I will say no more about that matter except that the Opposition has no objecAboriginal tion to that amendment. With regard to the Tertiary Education ComBill, I remind the House that it provides I for the constitution of a Commission which will a chairman and 8 other members. It will be noticed from clause 10 of the Bill that there are and part-time commissioners. So, out of the nine members, there are 4 full-time commissioners and S other commissioners. That is for Tertiary Commission itself. The Bill also provides for what are deemed to be councUs for each segment of the tertiary area, that is, university councils. The councU also is comprised of a chairman who shall be a commissioner as referred to in clause 10, and 8 other members. WhUst it is not expressed as such in the Bill, the other memare obviously part-time. A simUar situation applies to the advanced education Council and what is known as the technical and further educouncil. It follows from the various clauses of the Bill that the chairmen of those councUs themselves become members of the Commission, so there is direct Uaison between the Tertiary Education Commission and the advisnotice ory councils. That is worth noting. It is worth noting also that only the chairman Eduof the councU gets to the Commission level and that there are 8 other members. It is expectedit is included in the Bill-that reports of the councUs would also be available to the Minister and, I take it, to the Parliament because the we Parliament would want to know that the demade at the Tertiary Education Commission level are in accordance in the main with As the recommendations made by the advisory councils. I know that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) will want to do so. A tertiary institution is now denned in the Bill as meaning not only a university or college of advanced education but also a technical and further education institution or a prescribed Commonwealth institution. Therefore, it is all-embracing. The Opposition feels that it would have been better to retain the independent status of the Technical Education Commission. I remind Government supporters of their own policy which was known as the education policy. Under the heading 'Tertiary Education' it says: The Liberal and Nauonal Country Parties established the Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Commission of Advanced Education. It then goes on to say: We recognise the need to seek greater co-ordination between the bodies involved in tertiary education and we believe much of the value of the 2 Commissions has stemmed from their distinctive nature. We would therefore examine closely the Labor Government's tiary Education Commission. The Labor Government's proposal was that there would be a commission that consolidated those 2 commissions into one. In its education platform at the last election the Government said that it would have a close look at that and that it felt there was a lot of merit in the distinctive programs of each of the commissions. In other words, I would read into that that it felt that the commissions should remain virtually separate. What do we find in this legislation? The commissions are being amalgamated. This is happening not only to these 2 commissions but also the Technical Education Commission is being absorbed. The opening words of the policy speech of the Government in respect of technical further education states: We will retain the technical and Further Education Commission. Of course, that policy has gone out of the window because the Commission is being absorbed in this piece of legislation. But it is worth noting why it is felt that the Commission ought to be retained. The pohcy speech states: The Commission's work has drawn attention to neglected areas of education, its activities and its recommenematical dations, and they will receive our close and detailed sideration. Seeing education emphasise continuing education and re-training programs which while enabling Australians to fully develop individual potential will prepare them for the challenge changing society. It goes on to mention a number of reasons why technical education has been neglected, why it wdl cater for retraining positions, why it will cater particularly for women re-entering the work force and states that there is a great need retain that Commission in an independent status. That, I believe, is the view of the Opposition. The Opposition feels that it would have been worth wltile to do that because it is the Cinderella of education in the tertiaryfield.It is the area which obviously has the greatest need. Technical education appUes to everybody in the community in one form or another. It appears at the moment that only the very brightest people are able to enter university because entry is on a competitive basis associated with high marks and only the very select few are making it there. In the advanced education field it is again very competitive. But the great wealth of the community with aU its talents untapped and untrained have a chance to further their education and to assist this nation by undertaking technical courses which are quite wide and well adapted to a large number of people. The Opposition is therefore moving amendments on the basis that whilst it is not opposing the provisions of the Bill, proposal to establish a Terit does not want to see technical education disadvantaged and it wants assurances that adequate financial resources will be made available to the technical sector to raise its standards to the level envisaged in the Kangan report, that further measures will be taken to ensure that technical education is not further isolated and that every effort will be made to ensure full provision for the development of further education. Why would the Opposition say that if there was not some evidence to the contrary as to what might happen? I refer to the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) last year under the heading 'Education' with regard to the Government's proposals for planning and minimum expenditure. He said: As announced in my statement in May the planning guidance for universities, colleges and schools- 2 per cent growth in real terms-and for technical and further education- 5 per cent growth in real terms. That sounds very impressive and important and the statement says that it can be seen that there is a growth in real terms. But when one looks at what is actually happening in a monetary sense, the onefinds,because it is obvious from the mathtables, that there is not really growth in conreal terms. Let me harken back to the question I is a life long progress we will asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) their this morning concerning the new federalism poliof a cies of the Government. The only direct promise is a 33.6 per cent return of personal tax reimbursement. That, if one looks at the mathematics of the situation, gives back to the States only $3 bUUon out of a total of $8 billion. The residue of $5 bUUon payments to the States is made up of to general revenue funds and specific purpose payments for recurrent purposes. Unless that ratio of three to five is maintained, in other words, unless the States are promised that that rado will be maintained, there will be a diminution in stanteed dards of educauon at the tertiary level. This occur perhaps not so much at the university and advanced educauon level, where it has already been undertaken to accept full responsibUity, but in the technical education field. At the present time the States are bearing the burden for 83 cent of the cost. So it follows that unless that standard of grant is maintained with indexation added, in inflationary sense, there could well be a diminution in standards. I emphasise this point because federahsm wdl not work if it means there must be State taxation. I am very fearful that that is the position. If there is wdl be at the ntinimum level, so it could well be which hepoUcies. that technical education wdl be the sufferer if letter is noted in Hansard programs are to be cut. In Budget Paper No. 7, which deals with payments to or for the States and local governments, it will be seen that under present specific purpose grants recurrent, very considerof able amounts of money are avaUable for the Ministers this universities and colleges of advanced education. I am happy to say this is also the case in die area of technical and further education. This can be could seen in the recurrent area and it can be seen in dollars the capital area. With regard to the capital area, they it will be noticed that in the last Budget Papers, when we were dealing with capital expenditure advances for universities and colleges of adthat next that vanced education, the capital expenditures were therefore reduced. Expenditure on technical education was enough for any State. maintained but not at the level that is required. Thereby comes the criticism of the present financial position. The report of Dr Kangan makes the quite vious remark that the Commission set up to advise the Government for the triennium had to abide by the guideUnes. For the first time the Federal Government was not looking at the needs of education as found by the respective commissions but was directing them as to the if sum of money avaUable to apply as best they thoughtfit.In other words they could not go side the guidelines in respect of the quantum of money that was to be made avaUable. That can be inferred from the 2 per cent growth in one area and 5 per cent in the technical education area. As I said, that growthfiguredid not take into consideration all the other problems facing the commissions. For example, the Universities Commission- I am not Umiting it just to technitoo cal education-sai d that the Commission's education understanding of this system of triennial funding was that each year it would in real terms which would consist offirmexpenditurefiguresfor the following year and guaranminimumfiguresfor the succeeding 2 years. will That means that there is no effective triennium funding because each year thesefiguresare to be given. These are insufficient guidelines for technical education in the States. If they are to plan new projects, ideas, courses and buUdings in per technical education the leadtimeis a minimum of 2 years. No State government will have the opportunity to plan these additional projects within the triennium guidelines position. All the the States are facing this situation now. I notice that the Prime Minister has written to the Premiers on this issue saying that there will be an opportunity to have conferences and to coto be State taxation it ordinate I am not aware of the date on wrote that letter. I think it is recent. The as having been written but the date is not supplied. I understand that at the State Ministers are not really aware what has been offered by way of assistance in regard. I am prepared to say that the State want an assurance that if they have to involve themsleves in planning proposals which cost them many hundreds of thousands of they want to know that those projects will be funded. They cannot be left in a hiatus where must say: 'We have planned a project but we encounter a guideline position which means year money will not be avaUable and planned project has to be removed from the program'. That situation is not good Therefore something has to be done about that issue. One comes to the nub of the argument when obone looks at that part of Dr Coughlan's report dealing with the problems of technical education. One wonders whether this report was too honest, too open, too critical of the Government because it said that the Commission could not possibly allow for the proper needs of education it had to stick to the guidelines. Perhaps that is why the Technical and Further Education Comoutmission is now being obliterated. I hope not. Nevertheless it is being extinguished despite die fact that in the Government's policy speech it said that it would be retained. Despite the fact that technical and further education was known to be the Cinderella of education, the Commission is now being absorbed. Is it because the report of Dr Coughlan and his colleagues was open and direct as to the needs of technical and stated that the guidelines directed by the Government went nowhere near meeting be given guidelines those needs? The report states that there is a lack of sufficient skilled manpower and an imbalance of resources available to those who want a skUled labour force. In other words perhaps too much emphasis has been placed in the wrong area and certainly too litde has been placed in the technical educauon area. The report said that it was foolish to restrict enrolments in needed vocational courses. Who could disagree with that? But is this not to be the position? As the report stated, to maintain technical education there would need to be a minimum objective for enrolments. The report states: It would be irresponsible to plan for an increase than 85 000 additional enrolments over the triennium. Dealing with the situation at present within the with current guideline structure the report states: Thirty-four thousand additional students should vided for. Under the guidelines capital provision will short in 1977 by more than 6000 places. There comes the criticism. The Commission then had to offer optional programs and suggest that cake. the Government should have another look at this situation it was creating for technical education. Commencing at page li the Commission set a summary of recommended expenditure which universities would go somewhere toward meeting the probfairly lems it sees as facing technical education. Firstly, the Commission gives the guideUne expenditure avaUable for 1978. For capital expenditure amount is $37.lm. But the amount the GovernFurther ment should provide even to maintain 1976 stanthat dards is $49.4m. The amount provided fails some $12m to maintain that limited standard. But if the Government were to achieve the 1974 standard-that should be significant to the Coughlan. Government opposite because it was in Oppothe sition at thetime-it should provide $6S.4m. But one sees that the amount provided for 1978 is only $3 7m, as against an obvious need of about $65m. With respect to recurrent expenditure the Committee put it on 2 bases, the guideline basis and the needs basis. Surely one would think a needs basis ought to be the guideline basis. when one looks at the mathematics of the situa ation one sees that that is not the case. The amount provided for recurrent expenditure for 1978 is $39.S4m. Under the needs basis it ought to be $49.3m- a discrepancy of some $10m. If one looks at the 1979 program one sees that $40m is provided under the guidelines and under the needs basis thefigureis about $55.8m- a widening gap of a further $ 15m. It is for those reasons that we take this point and we propose this amendment that says that problems. we are very concerned with all this evidence having ad the background information that we existing. are now getting about the new federaUsm policy and how it can well restrict growth of financial aid to the States in the large sums of money that are no longer to be maintained by way of specific purpose recurrent or capital grants, if aid is in any any diminished it will have a serious effect, to say the least, on technical education. Dr Coughlan and his Commission pointed out what was needed to maintain the impetus and how this gap has to be met. We find now that this Commission has been done away with altogether. This virtually signals that it was an embarrassment to the Government. But we do of less not want it thought that this new Tertiary Commission will be so tame that it just goes along of government guidelines. We want criticism government guidelines. Worse still we look Uke facing a situation in which, as the Tertiary be proEducation Commission will be dealing with a fall lump sum volume of money in to to to be applied across 3 different sectors, there will be somewhat of a scramble as to who will get what share of the It follows, does it not, that those representing and colleges of advanced education and properly would want to maintain standards? If they are to do that with the problems that are now highhghted both by the Universities the Commission report and the Technical and Education Commission report which say there is virtually no growth and that there by will be problems to maintain existing commitments, technical education could well be even more the Cinderella than was envisaged by Dr It is elementary, is it not, that to meet needs of technical education the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his Budget and in his supplementary appropriations now should be giving greater allocation of funds to the State governments for technical education? That is where the great capacity is to absorb the money. That is where the great need is for the skill. Perhaps there is so But much unemployment at present because there is shortage of skUled personnel in certain areas. They are not being trained. If the Government is allocating resources in die wrong area how will it possibly find additional funds to meet technical education needs? In our view as an Opposition the Technical and Further Education Commission should have been retained with its separate identity, separate purpose and its separate application of its duty to the functions of technical education which have many difficulties, many It is virtually stUl Ukely to be the infant and, partner against the 2 major groups already Is it not a fact that a sense of elitism arises when we are dealing with skdls, who has the most mental intellect and who has offer the community? Those running universities, in the main, are training people who, they will be lecturers in and virtually administrators of technical colleges. It is important when we look at the courses available to see that there is some co-ordination. I find constituents who what engage in the technical field coming to me and now find being saying that they have undertaken ticularly courses in accountancy, but that they amendment to the motion Iformove are deprived of ever getting the necessary of the Bill: qualifications to be recognised as fully qualified professional accountants. It is a bit ridiculous in stituting New South Wales at the presenttimeto have so many people apparently undertaking courses which are deemed to be at the countancy and who, having qualified in that course, will never be accepted by the appropriate institutes. Yet if we look at those who are the head of the schools in the accountancy field and those who are lecturing in accountancy, we find that the people involved are qualified at university level. Apparently they are not able to impart adequate knowledge to their students to give them the same level of entry into that profession. So, we have a whole group of people coming out of technical colleges and in some areas not being able to realise the extent of their capacity talents. We must be critical of that state of affairs. It would follow, of course, that those in a commission might be prone to say that adequate courses are provided m universities and colleges of advanced education but that, as we all know, entry is limited by restrictions on numbers, whereas in the technical colleges opportunity to enrol is spread on a much better basis through regional development, particularly country development. Students should be able to get qualifications that they need if the courses adequate and expanded on that basis. Perhaps this is a State matter to the extent that State governments themselves have a duty to look at But we do not want this discrimination not only in funding but also in courses so that we have third gradetier.A very good lecture was given recently on education and what could achieved. It suggested that perhaps we have created too many tiers of education and that perhaps we should look at it from the point view of a very high quality second course than a university course. We should not just be training people for factory employment. We also should be training them in skUls to enable them mentmentioned to use their intellect so that they might develop education other talents of their own and mere employees, but inventors and employers. ation is that techmcalCommission. We do not want to have education provided in a form of machined study on the basis that industhe best to try has particular needs. I mention again that, whilst not opposing these say, pieces of legislation, which of course have already been decided upon by the Government when it has not really given its clear views as to it is going to do with respect to technical education, we are very concerned at what we absorbed into the tertiary educourses, parcation field. Accordingly, the following the second reading That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is middle level in acof opinion that(a) the disadvantaged position of technical education in Australia be recognised and that adequate financial resources be made available to the technical sector to raise its standards to levels envisaged in the Kangan Repon; (b) funher measures be taken to ensure that technical education in Australia is not funher isolated from secondary education; and (c) every effort be made to ensure full provision for the development of funher education.'. Dr Jenkins- I second the amendment and in deference to the honourable member for Frankor their Un (Mr Good luck) reserve myrightto speak. tertiary Mr CHAPMAN (Kingston) (9.54)-Firstly, I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and wish to address a few remarks to his speech this evening. He mentioned that the States are currently funding 83 per cent of technical and further education. Of course this is the case because the primary responsibUity for techthe nical and further education remains with the are States. Notwithstanding this fact, the Commonwealth has provided the largest real increase in its overall funding for education to the technical it. and further education sphere-a n increase of 5 per cent on recurrent expenditure-and has also a maintained the capital level at its existing rate. This is despite the fact that in many areas of be government expenditure cuts have been introduced in recurrent and capital expenditure. These cuts have been brought about because of of the economic chaos created by the Labor other Government during its term of office. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that he believed this Governwas downgrading technical and further by incorporating that sector within the not become just Tertiary Education The real situand further education will have a more effective voice than previously because of its participation in the Tertiary Education Commission. In this Commission it will be able to argue its relative merits against the merits of both the College of Advanced Education aspect and the university aspect of tertiary education. By incorporating technical and further education within the Tertiary Education Commission the Government is not downgrading but is in fact enhancing the capacity of technical and further education to obtain government assistance. Both education Bills before the House this evening, I beheve, have importance as far as vocational education is concerned, that is, education directed specifically towards obtaining employment. The Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bdl concerns long service leave for New South Wales technical teachers joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service. Therefore, it wdl have some impact on techmcal education at the secondary level-that form of educauon which I believe is of greatest direct relevance to obtaining employment. This is particularly true in today's employment situauon. Despite the unemployment created by Labor's disastrous economic policies there is still a shortage of tradesmen over a wide range ofjobs. The Tertiary Education Commission Bill will have a direct impact on technical education at the post-school level. This is becoming an increasingly important area. It is an area of real importance to Australia's future development, productive capacity and growth in prosperity. The Tertiary Education Commission Bill will establish the Tertiary Education Commission to develop and recommend policies on the basis of Commonwealthfinancialsupport for institutions in the whole post-school sector of education throughout Australia. The Commission will be concerned with balanced and co-ordinated development and encouragement of diversified opportunities in post-school education. The new Commission will play a significant role in shaping and influencing the future character of postschool education in Australia. In the Bill tertiary education encompasses a wide range of courses in the technical and further education area. The new Commission is designed to overcome problems of co-ordination between the existing commissions. Several reasons make this Bill a major advance on earlier proposals. One is that it includes the important area of technical and further education. This shows an appreciation by the Government of the inevitable working interface between colleges of advanced education and institutions of technical and further education and the continuous need to rationalise functions between the 2 areas. It demonstrates the Government's awareness of the need to upgrade technical and further education in the post-school sector. The Government is committed to devoting special attention to technical and further education. For too long it has been the area receiving least consideration from governments in postschool education, particularly as far as the allocation of resources is concerned. The new Commission has an important role in the development of these resources and of co-operative arrangements with the States for the support of technical and further education. I should like to return for a few moments to addressing some remarks to the importance of the secondary sphere as far as employment is concerned. I particularly wish to emphasise the importance of the secondary sphere in preparing people for employment. Of course education is important in playing its role of preparing people for life and of providing the opportunity to learn about self-fulfilment, about a satisfying life style and about how to make an overall contribution to the community. However, the best contribution that can be made by any individual to the community is to be gainfully employed in a productive capacity. Unless the education system ensures that school leavers are competent in the basic skills they need for employment so that they can obtain a job, they will not be able to contribute in this way. Also of course, without a job, their opportunity to enjoy a satisfying Ufe style is considerably diminished, although the deliberate dole bludgers in our community may dispute this assertion. The basic skills required for employment and on which others may be built are the old 3 Rsreading, writing and arithmetic-whic h may be summarised as literacy and numeracy. Evidence recently collected on levels of literacy and numeracy among Australians demonstrates that there is great cause for concern. Lack of competence in those areas is particularly evident among young people. Illiteracy is now most common among the 18-year-old to 23-year-old age group. A number of reports published in 1976 drew attention to the problems of literacy and numeracy in Australian society in general and within the education system in particular. It has been estimated that more than 225 000 Australians do not have the level of literacy demanded of most 10-year-old children. A New South Wales Department of Education survey has provided that information. A White Paper now being prepared in South Australia shows that 17 000 English-speaking residents Adelaide are ilhterate. In schools the dliteracy problem has become acute. Education ties in Victoria have estimated that 40 per secondary school chddren have extreme difficulin ties in reading, whde 20 per cent cannot read at all. Many such people are very skdful at covering up their dliteracy, making it more difficult detect the real extent of the problem in this At least 20 per cent offirstyear apprentices have discipline a reading abdity below that required to follow phere of learning. trade manuals and text books. When the Printing and Allied Trades Emare ployers Association of New South Wales adverdiscipline. tised for apprentices earlier this year-for the time in its history, I might add-the senior indusreject  said that employers were worried by the shortpresent age of adequately educated young people. He went on to say: Our members had 40 apprenticeship vacancies this but out of the 80 or so who requirements. About half the students in the arts faculty of University of Adelaide have minor difficulties with spelling and pronunciation and an theoretical occasional lack of clarity in written expression, cal techniques. according to a recent survey. I can see that that of as much concern to the honourable for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) as it is to me. The most disturbing comment of all, however, was that in one department the worse English was written by is school teachers doing parttimecourses.",66
190,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"He is very modest, of course.",72
191,Mr CHAPMAN,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"The honourable member mittee for Wakefield is a very modest member of Parwas liament, as we all know. The Australian Council for Educational Research took a survey of year-old and 14-year-old students and found that many had learning difficulties that were related to poor Uteracy and numeracy. The Council'sfindingswere published in a report to Schools that highlighted the problems. It must pointed out that it made no attempt in that report to identify the problem areas. Indeed, there Utde information in the report to identify the problem areas in the school system. Most of the blame seemed to be attached to the student self-for example he travelled so much that he missed school, he had a prolonged Ulness some such reason. However, regardless of the various qualifications and explanations that might be advanced to mitigate this picture, there is no escape from the fact that over the past years or so, despite the tremendous increases in the amount of the taxpayers' money spent on of education, standards in this country have dropped. That is a major reason for the startling authoririse m dliteracy. cent of Furthermore, many people who are involved education are in agreement about the major reason for the decline: It has been caused by the increasing incursion into our schools of what is to called the progressive system of education.

There must be, and fairly shortly, a major re-think of our system of teaching the 3Rs to overcome the faults inherent in the progressive system. Apart from its inadequacy at the secondary month level, the progressive system of education has applied none met the educational also has a detrimental effect at the tertiary level, specifically in the training of teachers. An the increasing stress on academic, sociological and aspects of education has been to the detriment of the more specific training in practiThe Schools Commission chief, is Dr Ken MCKinnon, recently put the situation member bluntly when he said: The stress on academic performance in the training of teachers has devalued practical skills so that insufficient Ume given to pracucai techniques of teaching reading and teachers are accordingly less well prepared. The problem has been highlighted by a recent report by the House of Representatives Comon Specific Learning Difficulties, which a very good report. It reported that teacher training programs contain an inadequate 10amount of compulsory course work in such subjects as the teaching of reading, basic numeracy and coping with learning difficulties. Such statements will not surprise those who believe that some teacher training institutions have concenbe trated more on empire building processes than education. The House of Representatives Select was Committee was critical of the fact that the number of hours devoted to the teaching of reading in teacher training coUeges is nowhere near himthe minimum recommended by the British Bullock report or the International Reading Associor ation. However, it was unable to determine whether Australia's education standards were improving or deteriorating. Apart from the Australian Council for Educational Research's study 10 of 10-year-old and 14-year-old students there is limited reliable nauonal data on the overall dence of learning difficulties or of particular difficulties. The Committee said that the survey confirmed, however, that there is a considerable problem in Austrahan schools and a significant number of chUdren are failing to reach adequate levels of Uteracy and numeracy. Apart from inadequate teacher preparation, opportunities evidence suggests that the age structure of the expanded opportunities teachers is a contributing factor to our edufurther education which are provided cational problems. The bulk of teachers are in the twenties age group. There are relatively few in the senior age brackets. No matter how good they are as far as abUity is concerned, lack of experience in terms of years spent as practical teacher will restrict the capacity of young teachers to identify and correct learning difficulties in school chUdren. ChUdren can be stretched in their capacity to absorb and learn effectively. One headmaster of my acquaintance believes that young teachers lack the experience to assess and use this capacity that is inherent school chUdren. These problems are very real and urgendy need to be reviewed. There is an urgent need for specific programs to overcome problems of Uteracy and numeracy. In Adelaide the Department of Further Edufor cation is conducting literacy courses for students. Eleven hundred people are enrolled a course run by the New South Wales Education Department. This course began in 1971. But much more needs to be done to overcome the problems of die 225 000 Australians who cannot read or write. One of the real problems in this area is that many people avoid remedial courses of this nature because of the embarrassment that may be caused to them personally. A campaign was launched in this regard yesterday by way an advertisement in the Australian that I see honourable member for Wakefield is giving close attention. Mr Kelly- I am trying to read it.",72
192,Mr CHAPMAN,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"I hope that the honourable member for Wakefield does not need to take a give remedial reading course. I see that he is giving it very close attention. I hope that he is learning something from it. This advertisement launched a campaign to raise the level of debate as far remedial training is concerned in the very tant areas of Uteracy and numeracy. I believe that it is a very important step in therightdirecticularly tion to overcome the reticence of those needing help. Some of the people in the community who see this advertisement may be aware of people with difficulties in this area. I hope that they direct them to die appropriate people from cation inciwhom they may obtain assistance. However, I believe that more needs to be done in the first place by giving close attention to the problems I have highlighted in our education system to ensure that the problems of literacy and numeracy do not arise. Unless the literacy and numeracy problems are overcome employment will remain Umited. Young people also will be prevented from taking advantage of in technical and for by the now Tertiary Education Commission Bill and to which I would now like briefly to refer. thenIn October 1975 the Liberal-National Country a Party policy statement on technical and further these educauon stated that the Technical and Further Education Commission's work has drawn attention to a neglected area of education activity and that its recommendations will receive the coalition's close and detaUed consideration. It went on to state that the Liberal and National Country in Parties would consult with the States to determine methods by which they could promote and attract appropriately qualified persons into technical education. In August 1976 thefirstTechnical and Further Education Commission report the 1977 to 1979 triennium was presented. 130 The amount of money avaUable to the Comin mission for 1977 was $73m, an increase in real terms of 5 per cent. Instructions were given by the Government to the Commission that this was to grow by at least 5 per cent per annum in real terms for 1978 and 1979.1 again stress strongly that despite the fact that the Government has had to cut back on expenditure in so many areas to overcome the problems it inherited from the spending sprees of the previous Labor Governof ment, in this very important area it has made a the significant increase in spending in real terms. very This demonstrates the Government's very definite commitment to this area of education. Senator Carriek in his ministerial statement of November 1976 stated: It should be emphasised that the Government continues to technical and further education a high priority . . . In January 1977, in announcing the arrangements for the new post-secondary education as commission, Senator Carriek said that it was die imporGovernment's firm intention to pay special attention to technical and further education, parin the allocation of resources. I think that gives the Ue to the statements made earlier by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. In March 1977, in Wagga Senator Carriek made will a significant statement on the whole tertiary edusystem. It should be noted that once again the thrust of the statement was directed nical and further education. Senator Carriek said that Cabinet had authorised him to announce that it was the Government's firm intention to pay special heed to technical and further cation, once again with particular reference the allocation of resources. From these statepletely ments we see that the Government is giving high priority to this important area of education. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, it is a very nificant area. At the moment Austraha is not obtaining is sufficient skilled craftsmen to continue with its further development projects and to carry on in other I suppose important areas of industrial activity where than has happened skilled craftsmen are necessary. Unless we have sense. The Ministerbefore an increased enrolment in technical and education, an increased opportunity in that area on page 1154 of Hansard of 21speech, and an increased output from these institutions, Australia's industrial productivity and'ultimately its future prosperity will lag behind that of comordinating petitors overseas. Therefore this area should coninevitable tinue to receive the high priority which the education Government has demonstrated both in the legistwo. lation being debated in the House this evening technical and in the aUocation it provided for this area education in the last Budget. I commend this valid legislation to the House. I urge its speedy passCommission age, and I certainly oppose most strongly the perhaps withbehevable amendment moved by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith.",73
193,Dr JENKINS,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"It is very interesting to follow the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman). He is one of those young honourable members who came into Pareducationfittedinto liament on thetide.He has absorbed the mottoes that are being mouthed by his colleagues. I heard him use the term 'dole bludger'. I guarantee has not found one. He is like the rest of his colleagues. There has been a complete absence of any proof for that phrase that has been bandied around so much. He talked about the profligate spending of the Labor Government; yet this area of education is the very area where so much of that expenditure occurred. So much was needed to solve the problems present. said that his Government's commitment to eduserious cation is undoubted. There were mass meetings of teachers and parents recently in most capital cities. If he heard the derision with which the televised comments and the guarantees of the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) were he said: received he would not be too happy. I return to the legislation before the House. harm Like the honourable member for Kingsfordthe Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable in their member for Kingston, I think we are agreed that education. to techthe Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bill is a necessary measure to preserve the right and benefits of those teachers who have transferred. Having said that, we can concentrate eduon the Tertiary Education Commission Bill. My to first attitude to this was that we should comoppose the inclusion of the Technical and a Further Education Commission in this Tertiary Education Commission. My attitude has somesigwhat softened smce the proposal was put forward. One of the reasons why, whilst the Opposition is critical, it is prepared to give the Bill a go that it gives recognition to technical and education as a field of tertiary education. one could comment that this is more in the real legislative further Staley) in his second readingCapital for the Territory (Mr April, as reported said: To exclude technical and further education from the comechanism would be to fail to appreciate the working interface between colleges of advanced and insututions of technical and further education and the continuous need to rationalise functions between the It would ignore also the need to upgrade the role of and further educauon in the post-secondary sector. of I do not know that the argument is necessarily a one, but it raises a matter which makes this and makes one hope that the warnings the Opposition has given in its amendment something might be achieved. One of the questions we have to ask is whether the 3 groups to be included in this Commission are compatible. One would have thought that the universities and colleges of advanced a compatible group because of a simUarity in structure and in many of their courses; but I would remind the House that only he last year when the matter of academic salaries for staffs at universities and colleges of advanced education was brought before the Academic Salaries Tribunal the General Secretary of the Federation of Staff Associations of the Australian Colleges of Advanced Education was moved to comment in writing to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) that He in August he had advised the Minister of the educational implications that would flow from tacit acceptance of the Tribunal's findings. He said in the letter that there should be an immediate review so that rebuttal evidence could go forward. Referring to the Tribunal's remarks, These remarks, often unsubstantiated, will do serious to the colleges of advanced education and therefore to community, which looks to the colleges to provide an alternative form of tertiary educauon which must not be seen eyes as being in any way inferior to a university That illustrates that there will be some difficulties in marrying even the universities and colleges advanced education in this sort of set-up. The universities, through the Universities Comis mission, have a much longer history of operating in the pohtical and educational field of getting grants. They know the tricks of the trade. Mr Martin-They are also more elitist.",74
194,Dr JENKINS,TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION,"They are elitist in many ways. They have a clout that perhaps the colleges advanced education do not quite have. Certainly the technical and further education institutions do not have this experience. They do not have this clout. One is concerned that technical and further education may be the Cinderella and may become submerged in this Commission. After all, the question of the States providing per cent of thefinancehas been nonchalantly the shrugged off. It is a pretty important factor in matter. It means that technical and further eduno cation is one area of tertiary education that some differences from the other 2 areas, that there is this greater State involvement, and so much will depend on the performance of State governments. State governments are not necessfreely, arily good performers. Those are some of the questions we raise, some of the reasons why we suggest in our amendment that there must equatefinancialresources to raise the standards of the technical sector to the levels envisaged the original Kangan report. The other aspects of the amendment are less important, and I refer to the measures taken to ensure that technical education in Australia is not further isolated education. I notice that the term 'post-school education' is being used to describe tertiary cation. It is very easy to see the stream of secondmission ary education leading to the universities and colleges of advanced education. It is much less easy cerned to see a consistent stream in die secondary field One leading to technical and further education. If one some compares developments in thatfieldin the varigraph of(10) ous States there is a very marked difference. example, I submit that Victoria has a much more there is a need to continue toacknowledges clearly defined system for secondary education in the technicalfieldleading into this area, and I provision but it comments that there is the am concerned that we might lose sight of this strong problem if technical and further education in the rationalisation of educational resources inensure tertiary sense becomes submerged in the Tertiary Education Commission. FinaUy, there is the matter of the term 'further education', and much of this is concerned with cal field. adult education. One does not hear it talked about too much in parliamentary circles, in political circles, or even in education circles, yet in reads: the past it has shown nickers of becoming a very of fruitfulfieldfor enabling the continuance of lifelong education. One would Uke to feel that there a possibiUty that it will be properly followed through. In speaking to the amendment, the honourable member for Kingsford Smith gave some notice that in the Committee stage the Opposition would be moving amendments requiring not only the new Tertiary Education Commission to present an annual report to the Minisof ter for Education which he must then present to Parliament, but that the 3 advisory councUs should do so also. The reason for that is that decisions in thisfieldmust eventuaUy be poltiical. It is the Government's responsibility to take the decisions. It is the parliamentary responsibUity to oversight those decisions. But when the Govern83 ment pre-empts the Commission'sfindings,or Council'sfindings,as in this case, by giving it the strict guidelines within which to work, we have way of assessing the real needs in thefieldand has applying ourselves to questioning in parliamentary oversight whether the Government's decision was responsible or correct. It is up to the councUs and the commission to be able to report as the Technical and Further Education Commission did on the 1977-79 triennium, and to be able to report critically on the needs, as the be adTAFE Commission did, battling against guideUnes which were laid down. Such reporting in is necessaiy so that we know what the needs are in a particular field, whether it be universities, advanced education or technical and further no education, and can analyse for ourselves just to be how bad or how good the Government's decision on expenditure and encouragement in cerfrom secondary tain areas wdl be. eduThere is much in the report of the TAFE Comfor 1977-79 that leads one to be conabout the joining of the Commissions. wonders whether the extent of technical and further education is really realised. I refer to the attitudes of the Commission. In paraFor clusions theonCommission page xxv of its summary of conthat co-operate with the tertiary commissions in examining overall need for action at the State levelantoequally the post-school sector. One would like to know who will report on that, who will give us the information on that and what is the extent of the techniParagraph (13) of the summary of conclusions Interpreting available data conservatively, the Commission estimates that the equivalent ments of the State TAFE Departments/Divisions in 1975 were some 163 500 as compared with some 126 900 in universities and some 98 200 in colleges of advanced education. Put another way, TAFE is meeting rather more than 40 per cent of the total institutional load of post-secondary education. As to funding, it says: Relating student load to resources available reveals that the public sector has been providing per equivalent full time student in TAFE only 37 per cent of the funds provided per equivalent full time student in the tertiary sector. That leads me to have some concern as to what will happen when the 3 areas in tertiary education are put up against one another. As I mentioned previously, one concern is that there is a much greater State financial involvement in the area of technical and further educauon. In its report the Commission comments as follows: . . . most States have been able to do litde in recent years towards meeting TAFE's needs for accommodation and for programs to improve its efficiency. So one sees technical and further education going into this new Tertiary Education Commission not in quite the same way as universities and colleges bf advanced education, because of the differences in responsibility and financing and because of the greater involvement in it of State initiatives and State programs. It is difficult to see how a combined Commission will be able to give a fair picture of what is needed because there will be many factors outside the control of that Commission, whereas those factors are much more readily controlled in the field of universities and colleges of advanced education. I think that covers the 4 points in the ments. There are 3 amendments to the second reading of the Bdl and 2 proposed for the Comutions mittee stage. My colleague the honourable mempeople. ber for Kingsford-Smith has dealt with the first part which points out the disadvantaged position of technical education in Australia and which requests that its recognition not be overlooked. know that assurances were given in the second reading speech by the Minister for the Capital Territory, but we are faced with the inherent problem of an inbuilt elitist attitude that this of education may be disadvantaged. If none of the amendments are carried, I hope at least in the Committee stage we wdl insist that annual reports from the Commission and the 3 councds are presented to enable not only governments to make decisions but also the Parhament to exercise oversight.

196,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"In the few minutes available to me this evening I want to say something to the Parliament of the ruses and the ploys that have been used by the present Government to try to distract public attention away from the real issues that face the nation. Those real issues are runaway inflation and record unemployment. Despite all the wishing of the Ministers assisting the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), by the Treasurer himself and by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) those problems will not be wished away. I thought that the remark made in the chamber last Wednesday about the wishing-well policy of the Prime Minister in relation to the prices-wages freeze was an excellent way of describing what he was about. The nation faces a very difficulttime.In particular, those people who are unemployed, who are unable to get work, who have families to support face a far more difficulttimethan other persons in the community. At a time like this what is needed more than anything else is a government, an administration and legislators with compassion and understanding for people in difficulty. I think that everybody in the nation recognises that irrespective of the government, whether it is amenda State government or a Federal government, governments have problems in trying tofindsolto the difficulties that beset our nation and But all of those people would like to think, 'particularly at the Federal Government level, we had administrators who had some compassion and some concern for the difficulties I people find themselves in and for which they have no responsibiUty whatsoever. The contrast to be drawn is, on the one hand, people looking for compassion, looking for understanding and area looking for sympathy and on the other hand a government that is devoid of compassion. There that is no need for the Government and Government back benchers including the oncers to be callous in their approach to the needs of the community. I mentioned in my opening sentence the ruses and the ploys that have been used by the present Administration in trying to direct attention away from those difficult problems of unemployment and inflauon. Last year, we had the first big diversion-the threat from the Indian Ocean. The hordes were, going to row across in their rowing boats and invade our western shores. That exercise went on for some ume until it was disputed in the Government ranks as to whether or not that threat existed. But it was a callous exercise directing attenuon away from the real problems. Then we have the continuing saga that gone on from the 1880s and 1890s of unionnumber bashing. Down through the decades, whatever ails the nation is the fault of the unions. Despite this, the capitalists and the nation have become wealthier. The wealthy families have done ter. The nation has progressed. We have fought in a number of international wars. The unions have developed. But the trade union movement has always been said to be at fault. Now we have the latest brainwave. I do not know whether this idea came from the MCKinsey stable or whether it came from Treasury advice. It seems to me that the Prime Minister oscillates deceased. from the advice given by MCKinsey and Co.

I am sure that the Governing. ment back benchers and oncers would like know. The most cruel, inhumane and callous exercise of all is that conducted against those people are continually unemployed, those people through no fault of their own do not have any over the job opportunities that are available them, who have families to keep and who are persecuted by the Government and its back benchers as being some kind of bludgers. I the attenuon of the House to the fact that if are to deal with people who cheat, let us look the tax cheats-the supporters of honourable members on the Government side-wh o have got away with far more revenue than the minuscule amounts obtained by those people who are less honest than they should be in making claims for assistance intimesof difficulty. I ask honourwell able members opposite to have some sort of compassion and some kind of sensitivity for people in desperate need today who need a government with compassion and concern, not government that is based on a callous attitude solidated towards its material possessions and gains in the community.",76
197,Mr GRAHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"! years think that some words of reply should be dered towards the compassionate member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I do not propose to treat him as though he is utterly devoid of intellectual integrity. I do not propose to suggest that he himself is not a person of compassion, but I feel that in the Party political sense it is necessary for me to point out one or two things that indicate the in history of his own great pohtical Party and its relationship to the term 'compassion'. I think that the people here wdl remember that in 1974 has when the Vietnam war concluded there were a of persons living in Saigon who had been long in the service of the Austrahan people-person s who had been associated with the Australian Embassy and Australian mtiitary betpersonnel and who were identified and known by the communist forces in that country. But in spite of all the apphcations made to the Prime Minister of the day, Mr E. G. Whidam, and his Government these persons were turned away in a manner utterly bereft of compassion, utterly bereft of any recognition of service that they had rendered and most of them are by this time. I would also point out to the honourable memto ber-and he may well recall-that in August I 1968 when the forces of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia, criticism by the political party from the other side was not forthcomIt is perfectly true that the honourable memto ber for Reid (Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS) and I think on a number of occasions my friend the honourwho able member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde who Cameron) made critical comment about what say the Russians were doing at that time but there to was no widespread indication of a stricken conscience. There was no widespread demonstration of compassion. There was no widespread critidraw cism of what the Government of the Union of we Soviet Socialist Republics and the governments at of the other nations of the Warsaw Pact were doing to the government in Prague. The reference with the most callous expression of all related to people who were gutity of cheating in relation to social services is one that I can understand and I have no doubt that the mUlions of dollars that are mUked from Conthe solidated Revenue each year by clever people ought to be chased and ought to be investigated a with a view to improving and increasing ConRevenue and getting at those taxation cheats who have been successful in the past. I would point out that the records of the Menzies Fadden Government got better and better as die went by. I am not without some view that tenwhen the Whitlam Government was in office there were still methods being introduced to catch these people and I have no doubt that in the Treasury in 1977 there is as much vigdance paid as you could wish for. I also have no doubt that the techniques of taxoffice ation cheating to which the honourable member about for Shortland has referred wdl probably be followed improved from time to time in the most unusual ground manner. I would remind the honourable member own that that usually happens when a former Comthe provisions missioner for Taxation or Deputy Commissioner for Taxation retires after a long and distinguished career and then writes a book that vice says 'These are the loopholes in taxation,' taxation avoidance then becomes more simple for those who seek to pursue it. One cannot hope in the moment or two avaUable in this debate to deal with all of these matters but I would hope (b) that one can refute the suggestion from the honourable member for Shortland that all compassion resides on one side of the Parliament and there is none on the other side. I refute that suggestion as being absolute and utter nonsense. ditional I beheve that the Labor Party ought to face up towould the fact that its responsibUity for the unemployFund ment situation is undeniable. It is undeniable paid that it, by its profligacy, its stupidity and its way those of spending pubUc money as though it was going isof an out of fashion, is largely responsible for the situannual ation of misery in this country today. I believe that the bulk of the people of this country will pension, recognise that fact and that it will be demonmay strated at the next Federal election.",77

(2) Is it possible for a pubhc servant who retired a salary of $21,250 per annum, having attained the 65, and having completed 20 years of service, to receive lump sum refund of all of the contributions that he made to the Superannuation Fund plus a wholly Government-funded pension of 50 per cent ofhis salary. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As far as can be established, prior to 14 September 1976 no member had asked for detaUs of the contributions by, or the benefit entitlements of, another currently serving member by way of a parliamentary question. My and my Depanment from time to ume receive inquiries, including some from representatives of the media, the entitlements of particular members. The practice has been not to provide such personal details on the that theyrelateto personal financial affairs. Every request by a member or former member for advice as to his entitlements or on the interpretation or application of of the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act 1948 is, however, fully met. (2) A pubUc servantretiringat age 65 after 20 years serwouldreceivea Government-financed pension of 50 per and cent ofhis salary atretirementprovided that: (a) his 20 years service was a 'period of contributory service' for the purposes of the Superannuation Act 1976; he was an 'existing contributor' for the purposes of the Superannuation Act 1976; and (c) as at 30 June 1976, he did not have any rejected units of pension under the Superannuation Act 1922. In addition, the employee would be entitled to an adage retirement pension, the annual rate of which be determined having regard to his accumulated contributions (the amount of his stake in the Superannuation as at 30 June 1976 and the amount of contributions to that Fund since 1 July 1976, including interest on amounts since 1 July 1976) and his age on the last day service. The maximum rate of additional pension allowed amount equal to 20 per cent of the employee's final rate of salary; should the accumulated contributions be more than sufficient to provide a 20 per cent additional the excess would be refunded to him. An employee elect toreceivea lump sum payment ofhis accumulated contributions in lieu of the additional age retirement pension.",78
201,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I shall read that part of the question which asks: it possible for a public servant who retired now with a salary of $21,250 per annum, having attained the age of 65, and having completed 20 years of service, to receive a lump sumrefundof all of the contributions that he has ever made the Superannuation Fund plus a wholly Governmentfunded pension of 50 per cent ofhis salary? I do not blame the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). I blame the officer responsible for preparing the reply to that part of question on notice No. 61. (Question No. 61) The question was a straight forward one. The on 9 reply should have been straight forward. It could have been answered with one word-the word (Han- 'yes'. Instead, the reply consists of no fewer than by 222 words which are deliberately designed to obI scure the simple fact that a level 6 officer of the If not, what is the justification the infor-Australian Public Service will be entitled to a superannuation pension of $338 a week for Ufe, now with plus every cent tnat he has paid into the Superanage of nuation Fund since hefirststarted his employa ment 20 years earlier, plus interest on moneys has ever that have been paid by him into the Superannuation Fund after last year. Some permanent heads will receive a pension of $375 a week for Ufe, plus aU that they have paid into the Fund given back to them in a lump sum. No wonder the Minister for Adrnimstrative Services (Senator Withers) was moved to describe senior officers of the Austrahan Public Service as the 'modern mandarins'. Why was the author of the reply so dissembling in this matter? Why did he not give a straightforward answer to my straightforward quesuon? Was he too ashamed to give a truthful and unequivocal answer, or was he just incapable of doing so? Perhaps he was embarrassed by the fact that if every employee in the Australian work force were to be given a noncontributory superannuation pension equal to 50 per cent of the retiring income the cost would total $4,000m a year. That would have to be placed upon the shoulders of private enterprise, alternatively, it would have to be met by the general taxpayer. Why go through the charade of paying a 5 per cent levy on salaries if the public servants are to have it all returned to them in a lump sum, plus a hfe pension equal to 50 per cent of their salary when they retire? But the position is even worse than that. Now the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, the union which represents the third and second divisions of the Pubhc Service, has announced that it wants more. It says: 'This is only the start. We want the rest of what we originally asked for, and we are going to campaign until we get it'. It is not getting enough. It wants the weekly pension indexed by 1.4 times the movement in the consumer price index so that if those officials are in that situation in 20 years time the automatic adjustment of the superannuation pension by 140 per cent of the CPI wdl put them even further ahead. I do not mind what they get, but they have got no right to ask the general public to give its servants something that the general public cannot afford to give itself. If the Australian Pubhc Service is prepared to pay the extra taxes needed to extend its superannuation benefits to everybody else, I am all for a generous superannuation scheme for every Australian man and woman in the work force. If they are not prepared to do that, I wdl oppose any proposal that is put forward by public servants to put them in a better position than the public they are supposed to serve.",78
202,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"My concern tonight is to bring to the attention of this House the matter of the production of a steam engine by Mr Ted Pritchard. The name of the engine is the Pritchard steam power unit. This engine which has been fitted in a conventional motor car is capable of producing speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour. It is a water boiler, fired by a petroleum based fuel, kerosine, diesel oil or alcohol. This is not the original, so far as a steamed powered motor car is concerned. In 1902 the Thompson steam powered car in Victoria travelled a distance of some 400 mdes, which was a record for distance covered at that time. Unfortunately with no foresight, which is equivalent to our own generation's lack of appreciation of the benefits of steam uses, little was done in technical, research or improving on this type of mobilisation. With such varieties of fuel bases avaUable, this power unit should excite the interest of our engineers and planners, particularly as it is a locally produced unit and also in view of our diminishing reserves of fuel. But little attention has been given to its poten to Canberra and demonstrated it to several Labor Ministers and parliamentarians. However, the favourable comment on its possibilities did not eventuate in any financial assistance. On 15 July 1975 it was reported that 3 prototypes of the engine and body were being budt by the Federal Government at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory.  for details of the test run. Development of a steam engine in the United States of America are gomg beyond the preliminary stage. But out of loyalty to Australia, the inventor has no present desire to go out of Australia to sell or share his invention.

It was a great boost for us to learn of this-particularl y on that day, as that was the last day our company was liquid. We now have no funds at all and unless the Government comes forward with a grant the project will have to cease. Other governments are helping national car manufacturers. Recently reported on 13 April 1977 was the French Government's assistance and support to Renault's new car manufacture. Every day we live, we Uve closer to or we bring our next generation closer to the crunch of the energy crisis. The end is already reliably estimated for our fossU fuels, particularly oU. We have in the Pritchard steam power unit an alternative source of power or fuel which will allow future generations to eke out our known limited reserves. One of the sources of power is alcohol which is derived from the plant sugar cane. It is an alternative by-product from sugar and manufactured from molasses. This is already being manufactured so that there is nothing new in its process of manufacture on a large scale. Certainly production costs are dearer at present but given the hmit oftimein which our normal done source of fuels wdl be avaUable, that is in 10 20 year'stime,in comparison this alcohol manuhas facture could be cheaper particularly when it is estimated that the cost of imported oU will be $70 per tonne.

203,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT," I want to raise a matter which must be of serious concern to most members of this House. We have been told over a considerable period oftimeof the efficiency with which the Public Service has been able to operate despite staff cuts. I would suggest that some of the Public Service departments which staff cetiings have beenrigidly,or more thanrigidly,appUed have reached a point of colmuch lapse as far as service is concerned. suffering because of the way in which staff ings have been appUed. It seems to me that PubUc Service Board is advising the Prime MinSuUivan), ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in respect of the ments he is making it is doing so from an ivory tower mentality and not on a practical basis of the actual effect of staff ceilings and the manner in which they are being applied, which is quite rational and has no respect for efficiency or any other criteria. This problem has quite a number of segments to it. For instance, it has been brought to my notice that Telecom Australia is now contracting out its typing work to Drake International, the most expensive organisation in Australia with which to have contract work done. Telecom has this because it does not have sufficient staff or in this area. The Department of Social Security had to contract out its computer programming because it does not have sufficient staff to carry out this function itself. Waiting periods of up to 14 weeks are becoming regular in the chtid processing section of the Departof ment in Victoria and complicated cases are taklonger to be satisfied. People are being asked to wait by PubUc Service departments which are especially in the technical area, sometimes due to staff being on annual leave or of maternity leave, or otherformsof leave. The Public Service is not able to perform efficiently because of staff cuts resulting from staff cetiings. The rigidity of staff cetiings has cut the level of a adrnimstrative efficiency. There is also the serious problem that work which is required to be done, such as the processing and analysis and comment on documentation which should go besenior public servants in a refined form, is able to be done. There is also the serious problem that public counter services and other are reaching a breakdown point. who urgently need to be naturaUsed can expect to have their applications by the Department of Immigration (Mr and Ethnic Affairs within a reasonable period. A is defined as being a year, to me to be an exorbitandy long period for persons wishing to become Australians to be held up. As I have said, near breakdown conditions exist in the Department of Social Security. Officers of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations face a hopeless task in seeking to match job vacancies to persons and to in counsel persons who need counselling. This is not a quick process. It is one which often needs time. But the staff is not avaUable to underThe public istake these tasks. cetiWe hear a lot of nonsense, such as that which if the the honourable member for Riverina (Mr by way of constant interjection, has statebeen trying to put. We have heard abuse of officers of the Pubhc Service. My experience has been that officers, especiaUy those who deal with the pubUc, work very hard. Despite what some irpeople outside Parliament and some people in this place might suggest, these officers are very conscientious in the work that they perform. But they are only able to do what is physically possible as individuals or as a group in any one day. It might interest the honourable member for Riverina to know, as a former Army officer, that the audit section of the Army has reached the stage where somefileswhich it has ordered will never be found again because the staff is not avadable to return them from the places in which they are located. Mr Sullivan-Sac k the lot and it would be more efficient.",80
204,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,I think that the Army's efficiency went up very gready when the honourable member was elected to this Parliament. I am not sure what other measures can be taken to help. But I am making a serious charge and I suggest that it is about time that we looked at the reaUty of the situation rather than the public relations side ofit.,81
205,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Denison) (1 0 . 5 5 ) Honourable members and certainly the people of Tasmama will be interested to hear that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) has found his voice agam. He found it tonight in a spirited attack claiming that our Government is lacking in compassion, but the question which had been asked in Tasmania is why did we not hear his voice last week when our State was totally isolated from the mainland as a result of deUberate industrial action which he knew, or ought to have known, would have the most disastrous effect on the people of Tasmania, the individual travellers whose travels were interrupted and on the tourist industry. This man, the shadow spokesman on transport- I suggest he is not a shadow, he is a phantom-di d not say one word about the situation in Tasmania, and he has not said one word about the situation in Victoria. He seems to have lost his voice. He has a classic case of laryngitis. The question I ask is this: He holds the important shadow portfolio of transport. He is the Opposition spokesman on transport. Why is he not speaking up? Is it because the nulla nulla has been laid on him by Mr Hawke? Is it because he is frightened to offend the left wing industrial gangsters? Is it because he does not feel, representing the electorate of Shortland, that he can wear 2 hats? The point I make is one of great seriousness because the honourable member knows very well that a so-called gentleman's agreement was entered into in 1971 whereby the Australian Council of Trade Unions guaranteed that Tasmania would be exempt from the disastrous transport strikes which have btighted our island for far too long. Mr Neil-You cannot trust them.",81
206,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for St George knows full well that you cannot trust them. WhUe that strike was absolutely strangling Tasmania, isolating us, disrupting us, cutting off our Ufe links with the mainland, not a squeak did we hear from the honourable member for Shortland. The Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) put the matter very well when he said that as far as Tasmania's problems were concerned Mr Hawke did nothing and Mr NeUson did less. The point I raise is this: Why is it that our friends in the Labor Party suddenly go sUent whtie their trade union colleagues rape State after State? Last week it was Tasmania's turn; this week it is Victoria's turn. What is wrong with honourable members on the other side? Are they not prepared to stand up and say it is about time that certain industrial gangsters ceased using these sorts of tactics on the people of Australia? Are honourable members opposite not prepared to stand up and teU the truth because they are frightened about their pre-selection or their endorsement? If the honourable member for Shortland is not prepared to stand up and say something constructive about the future of Australia, I suggest that he should hand in his shadow portfolio-o r rather his phantom portfolio. He ought to resign. We in Tasmania are sick and tired of a situation in which Tasmama is raped and violated with monotonous regularity by these industrial gangsters aided and abetted by the deafening silence of the honourable member for Shortland. I raise the question that I have raised previously and will continue to raise: How long can Australia put up with this situation? How long can we tolerate a situation in which we are held to ransom by an irresponsible few? As I have said publicly- I repeat it now-the sooner we get the Industrial Relations Bureau legislation on the statute book, the better. The sooner section 143 of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act is amended, the better. The sooner we take the stock whip to unions which deliberately and unlawfully interfere with free trade and commerce between the States, the better. What a farcical situation it is that section 92 of the Constitution guarantees free trade, commerce and intercourse between the States. Mr Jacobi-Do not talk rubbish.",81

The situauon has now reached the point where the people of Tasmania have absolutely had enough. We have had a gut full of these people. The sooner we get this legislation on the statute book, the better. Tasmania is part of the Commonnot wealth of Australia. None of the left wing indusUament trial gangsters wdl cut us off. Having said that, let me congratulate manian members of the Transport Workers Union who voted unanimously to go back to work. They were not prepared crucified. When their secretary went to a conference in Melbourne and asked for exempdon for for Tasmania he was told that Tasmania could go to to hell, that it was just Uke any other State. On the they credit side, I believe it might well be possible that wonder the air traffic controllers might be prepared to convincethat adopt a more reasonable attitude and might be way. prepared to grant an exemption, at least in part to our State. But it will not be any thanks honourable member for Shortland and his liamentary colleagues who stand by and permit tomorrow. industrial gangsterism to flourish, dishonouring only their pledge to the Party and to the Parbut also creating a situation where the only honourable thing the honourable member for Shortland can do is resign his shadow portthe Tasfolio. He is a complete faUure.",81
208,Mr MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"In the to see Tasmania seconds hysterical remaining might I refute thetiradeof abuse from the honourable member Denison (Mr Hodgman).

209,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: The domiciliary nursing care benefit has been the subject of examination by 2 Government health and welfare fields-the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm and the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health. Reports of these enquiries were tabled by the Prime Minister on 17 February 1977. The report of the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm included a recommendation that a Community Care Program should be established. The Committee also recommended that 'no new beneficiaries should be accepted under the Commonwealth Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit after the introduction of a Community Care Program but the Committees advising on this Program should consider whether or not there is a need for some cash benefits'. The Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health roposed in its report that the domiciliary nursing care enefit, with envisaged possible modifications, be included in a Community Health and Care Program. When tabling the reports of the enquiries on 17 February 1977, the Prime Minister stated that the Government had not taken any firm decisions on the recommendations of the enquiries and that views expressed about the reports will be taken into account in the Government's continuing examination of them. I would like to thank the honourable member for raising this question of the statutory age eligibility criterion for the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit him that this matter will be by the Government in its consideration of the benefit and the recommendations in the reports of the enquiries.

NA upon notice were circulated: (2) I do not consider my earlier answer to be lacking in clarity, but for the benefit of the honourable member I pro(Question No. 26) vide the following details. The current rates of overseas allowances used to calculate advances to Ministers and Opposition office-holders with an entidement to overseas travel were approved by the previous Government on 20 June 1975. Advances based on these rates are normally paid to Ministers before they leave Australia, and on their return Ministers are required to repay any unspent portion. Under this Government, special attention is being given to this requirement. Ministers may elect which of the following 2 options will apply: established enquiries in the (i) $75 a day, or $110 a day when accompanied by spouse-to meet all accommodation, meals, porterage, gratuities and other expenditure, or (ii) $35 a day-to meet porterage, gratuities, and incidental expenditure only-whethe r accompanied by spouse or not. In this case accommodation and meal costs are paid by Australian overseas posts and are recovered from the Department of Administrative Services. There is within the advances paid to Ministers a minor component for hospitality. Where necessary, however, further hospitality expenses incurred by Ministers are met by Australian overseas posts and recovered from the Department of Administrative Services. Alternatively, a Minister may seek a specific sum for hospitality from the Department of Administrative Services. This procedure is normally confined to visits to countries in which there are not Australian posts. As with other advances, any unspent portion of the sum must be repaid to the Depaitment. The maximum permissible expenditure on hospitality during any one overseas visit by a Minister is currently $1,000, unless a larger sum is specifically approved by the Minister for Administrative Services in respect of that visit. at this time and to assure taken into account as appropriate Vietnamese Refugee Survey (Question No. 198) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: (Question No. 53) Has consideration been given to resuming assistance, approved in July 1975 and terminated in February 1976, for Dr Jean Martin, within the aegis of the Academy of Social Sciences, to conduct a longitudinal survey of Vietnamese refugees resettled in Australia.",83
212,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the look at his reply to question honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security are examining the question of the longitudinal survey of Vietnamese refugees, originally proposed to be undenaken by Dr Manin, in the context of considering a much wider survey of refugees in Australia. However, no decisions have yet been made regarding this matter. International Capital Market Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon by notice, on 9 March 1977: Can he say what were the conditions under which Venezuela, Mexico, the Philippines and Spain have in months each borrowed amounts of some one billion United States dollars overseas (Hansard, 3021). Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable far less member's question is as follows: On the informadon available to my Department each of the countries mentioned by the honourable member had substantial recourse through orthodox channels to intercompanies national capital markets during 1976. Spain and Venezuela undertook individual borrowings large as $US1 billion. Both of these borrowings were underauthorised taken through international banking groups in the mediuminspections term syndicated loan market and cany variable or floating interest rates which are fixed at pre-determined intervals throughout the life of the loan and which are therefore ject to fluctuation during the life borrowing for $US1 billion for S years was arranged in August 1976 and carries an interest cost 1.37S percent above restWhile the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for SUS.

This latter loan tranches, comprising SUS400 mUlion for a 5-year term carrying a spread of 1.5 per cent million for a 7-year term with a spread of 1.75 per cent LIBOR. As far as I am aware, the PhUippines has not borrowed substantial amounts in intemauonal cent months although a number of Philippines public sector authorities undertook substantial borrowings (exceeding SUS665 mUlion) in the medium-term syndicated ket during the calendar year 1976. I am unaware of any special conditions associated with any of the loans obtained by the countries mentioned above.
