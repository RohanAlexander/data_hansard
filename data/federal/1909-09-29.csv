1,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"I ask, Mr Speaker, if you have any information as to the whereabouts of His Majesty's Opposition ? TELEPHONES IN HOTELS.",14
2,Dr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Fro m the following paragraph in' this morning's Argus, it would appear that the officials of the Postmaster-General's Department are opposed to placing in hotels telephones for public usesInquiry at the Central Postal Administration yesterday disclosed the fact that a public telephone with penny-in-the-slot attachment may not be installed in an hotel, although it is permitted in shops. . . . The Postmaster General (Sir John Quick) said that there were two reasons for the regulation. One was that a public telephone in a hotel would remove the incentive to the licensee to pay for a telephone for his own business purposes. The second reason was that it was considered undesirable to make an hotel the place for a public telephone ' for use' by all sections 'of the public. I ask if it is the policy of the Government to restrict the facilities of the public in the matter of telephone communication, and, if so, whether this policy is based .on moral orcommercial grounds?",14
3,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The paragraph fairly summarizes the objections of the Department to placing in hotels public slot telephones. I see no reason to deviate from the established practice in the matter.,14
4,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"As it will cause great inconvenience if the telephones are removed from various hotels, I wish to know from the Postmaster-General when this action is to be taken. Therevenue does not suffer by the use of penny-in-theslot telephones.",14
5,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It is. not intended to remove any telephone.. Every hotel keeper may become a subscriber to a telephone exchange, and have an instrument installed in his premises, and, where the toll system is in force, may allow the public to use it, upon the payment of a penny. The Department, however, will not instal public penny-in-the-slot telephones in hotels. AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY: INTEREST CHARGES.  Minister, in replying to a question which 1 asked as to interest charges, saidSpeaking from memory, the fairness of the cash prices charged for agricultural implements was one of the subjects of inquiry on which a good deal of conflicting evidence was taken; this may lead to a reading of the report upon the extreme and exorbitant rates of interest such as some of those to which the honourable member has referred. Is the honourable gentleman aware that there was no conflict in the evidence taken regarding interest, and that the figures cial which I read yesterday were prepared by a competent officer of the Treasury, on the basis of price-lists and terms submitted by manufacturers and importing houses? pany",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The conflict of evidence to which I"" alluded was as to the fair cash prices to be charged for these implements. POTATO BLIGHT.",15
7,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister take into consideration the desirability of getting an expert from the United Kingdom to report whether Irish blight is, or is not, prevalent among the potato crops of the Commonwealth?",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We have already in toms, upon notice- Australia two or three public officials who are acknowledged and impartial experts on beWhether this question. They have had a great ing supplied deal of experience in connection with the to r i a disease, and some of them have published special studies upon it. Their knowledge is sufficient to enable it to be determined whether the disease from which our potato crops are now suffering is or is not Irish blight. I recognise the importance of the matter to the Commonwealth. Investigation as to the best methods of coping with this and other diseases of plant life would be a function of the proposed Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. DEFENCE. MILITARY STAFF CLERKS-STAFFSERGEANTS' PAY.",15
9,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"for Mr CROUCH) asked the Minister of Defence, ufon notice-1. Are the military staff clerks in the Defence Department limited in their promotion to that noticeDepartment only, and not permitted to transfer to other branches of the Public Service? 2. Does not the Minister think this should be remedied? 3. Are there not positions in the clerical and financial branches of the Defence Department which these clerks would be able to fill? 4. Will he see that in future vacancies in his Department their claims are considered?",15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable ""member's questions are.1 and 2. Military staff clerks are soldiers serving under the Defence Act,' and as members of the Naval and Military Forces are specially exempted from the provisions of the Public Service Act. 3Yes. 4. Until the Public Service Act is amended nothing can be done.",15
11,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. What is the page and numbsr of the Finanand Allowance Regulation which states that staff-sergeants are paid 6s. daily? 2. What are the names of the Victorian staffsergeants who receive the 6s. daily, voted by Parliament, as stated by the Minister yesterday? 3. Are not company sergeant-majors and comquartermaster-sergeants staff-sergeants ?",15
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The ' answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Page 13 of Financial and Allowance Regulations. Number of Regulation, 59. 2. There are at present no staff-sergeants in the Royal Australian Artillery in Victoria. 3. No. EXCISE INSPECTORS r NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA.",15

(c) The salaries paid to each inspector, together with the length of service of each in the various grades? (d) The amount of revenue collected from Excise respectively in each of the two States?

Mr ^TORRER (for Mr CHANTER) asked the Minister of Home Affairs, upon 1. Does he not consider that the allowance made to divisional returning ofBcers of £26 per annum for the extra work and anxiety entailed is altogether inadequate, and should he increased? -2. Have representations been made to him that the' sum now paid sbould be increased to at least ^78 per annum? 3. If so, is he in a position to. inform the House whether he will approve and give effect to this recommendation f",15
14,Mr FULLER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The answers to the honourable member's questions areCommonwealth divisional returning officers receive an annual allowance of £26, except in Tasmania, where they receive £40 per annum for acting jointly for both Commonwealth and State, with a. special allowance f o i conducting each election, and each officer is provided with the special clerical assistance necessary to enable him to effectively carry out his duties. I have' decided to increase the allowance for conducting elections to £25 in the case of city and suburban divisions, and to ^30 in the case of country divisions. The general work of the divisional returning officers has been greatly reduced by the adoption of sub-divisional registration and the simplification of methods, and it is not proposed to increase their annual remuneration in addition to increasing the special allowance to be henceforth granted to them for conducting elections. NA (FINANCE) BILL. Debate resumed from 28th September (vide page 3850), on motion by Mr. DEAKINThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an present financial difficulties. Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to finance.",16
15,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Balaclava) [10.41] - I have given the proposed ment very careful consideration, as I lieve other honourable members are doing. Since strong men like the honourable bers for Flinders, Mernda, and Parkes, who, it is recognised, possess considerable financial knowledge, have expressed doubt as to the advisability of making the posed payment to the States perpetual, Government and the House should careHouse fully weigh their remarks before ratifying the agreement. It has been stated in of the newspapers that I and others are antagonistic to the Government. While, with those whom I have mentioned, I may hold opinions on this question similar those of members of the Opposition, most of the questions likely to come before the House our views are as far apart theirs as is the north from the south When the Treasurer spoke on this questhat tion yesterday he attempted to belittle figures of the honourable member Flinders. Although the latter said that he could not state definitely that his were absolutely correct, or were to be taken as proving his case, still, I do not see that any one has produced the slightest evidence as to their incorrectness, or any evidence contradicting them. The figures showed us how the per capita return from Customs duties fell in a number of Protectionist countries.",16
16,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The figures have been challenged twice.,16
17,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , but the figures have not been proved to be wrong. It is the duty of a challenger to show that the member who gives any information to the House is wrong. But the Treasurer has not shown in the slightest degree that the honourable member for Flinders was wrong. The former said yesterday that he was quoting the opinions of those who were members of the Federal Convention. That does not seem to me to be the way to deal with a question of this kind. Whatever the' opinions of the members of that body were they were reduced finally into black and white, and that black and white is our Constitution. We must abide by the Constitution without having any regard' to what was understood or not understood by the different persons attending the Convention. The Treasurer is to 'blame, to some extent, I think, for our He persuaded the House-and so did his thencolleague, the gentleman who succeeded him at the Treasury-int o pledgagreeing the Commonwealth to the expenditure beof large sums in connection with the payment of bounties and the taking over of memold-age pension systems from the States before they had made any financial arrangement to meet those engagements. That is really what has brought about our propresent trouble. The Treasurer knew that the there was a considerable feeling in this against borrowing, and in order to get out of the difficulty the Government one have made what I consider to be a very bad arrangement' in the interests of the Commonwealth. The framers of our Constitution felt that the first thing to be done .to was to provide sufficient funds for carryon ing out the work to be undertaken by the Federal Parliament, and so for a period from of ten years they granted one-fourth of pole. the net Customs and Excise revenue for purpose. It seems to me that the the proposed scheme reverses that provision. for It proposes that a first charge of -£5*568,700 shall be put on the revenue of figures the Commonwealth. To my mind, the first charge on our revenue should cost of defence. The framers Constitution did not contemplate, I ' think, that the Empire would at any danger. We know, however, that 'sent there is danger. We would not have trol had that admirable defence scheme from the Minister of Defence had it not been for the knowledge that the Mother Counterest try requires assistance, and that we have to put our house in order. That scheme has been received with approbation by parties in the Commonwealth. My view is that the first duty of this Parliament should be to provide money to meet the cost of that scheme and the future defence of the Commonwealth, and the exbut penditure for that purpose will instand-point crease year by year. Just as other countries increase their naval and military armaments so shall we in a smaller degree have to keep pace with them, and with Motherland. This' annual charge £5,568,700 is equal to the interest on a capital or loan of £160,000,000, and we are to pay first out of our receipts former sum to the States, which will their position much sounder and much stronger than that of the 'Commonwealth. Dr WILSON; - In doing that we shall sources only be fulfilling the Constitution.",16
18,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . The provision* bearing upon this question is of taxation. to be found in the Braddon section, which was limited, and wisely limited, I think, for a period of ten years, in order to afford to this Parliament time in which to look round and see what was wanted. Financially the States are a great deal better off than is the Commonwealth. the States. They have magnificent revenue producing properties. They have railways,'lands, waterworks, and many other revenue prothose taxes? ducing properties which the Commonwealth has not.' What has the'Commonwealth? Nothing at all. It has taken over old-age pensions systems, quarantine, Post Office, which is at present a losing concern, lighthouses, and everything else which was a charge on the States.",17
19,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member call the Post Office a losing cern ? - Mr AGAR WYNNE - I do, because in no provision has ever been made on the timates for the establishment of a sinking fund, or the payment of the interest on cost of the properties owned by the Deto partment. be the Mr HUTCHISON - No allowance has of the been made for depreciation. "" Mr SAMPSON - But we are building all time be in new works out of revenue. at pre Mr AGAR WYNNE - Unde r the conof the States the cost of post-offices was defrayed with borrowed money, and the Commonwealth will have to pay the inon the cost of all the transferred properties. I do not think that there is the slightest doubt that, at present, the all Post Office is not a revenue-producing asset in the hands of the Commonwealth. If one asks any persons about the Commonwealth, they say, "" Oh,- the resources of the Commonwealth are inexhaustible."" when the position is examined from the of an investor I do not find the same point of view. Under this agreement it is proposed that the States shall start with an income of .£5.068,700 from the the Commonwealth. They have their railof ways producing a large revenue, and some of them have a very large area of land for sale or lease which will also produce a good the return. Financially the States are sounder make and stronger than is the Commonwealth. Some of the States have a larger revenue at present than has the Commonwealth. Now what has the Commonwealth? It has no of revenue except the Customs and Excise duties and the Post Office.",17
20,Mr DEAKTN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-And an unlimited power,17
21,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , but what has happened ? The States have already imposed a land tax and an income tax, which, of course, are first charges on the lands and the incomes of the residents of",17
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable member arguing that they should double,17
23,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thes e are the same people as the Commonwealth would the have to tax. Yesterday the honourable the member for Franklin - stated that Tasmania has a land tax amounting to 6s. 8d. per head, and an income tax amounting to more than double that sum. Where is the Federal Parliament to come in after those charges are put upon the people? conWhen a land tax of 6s. 8d. per head is levied in Tasmania and a land tax of 3d. the .£1 is imposed in Victoria according Esto the present Land Tax Bill the lemon will be so squeezed that there will be the nothing left for the Federal Parliament tax. I am satisfied that if , after a land tax of 3d. in the jQx is imposed in Victoria, further taxation were levied, people would throw up their lands rather than pay the taxes thereon. In France the taxes on the land come to 43 per cent, of the income. What has happened there? Persons are being driven off the land into the cities and large towns. The Government have found out that they have over-taxed the land and propose to reduce the taxation in order to encourage persons to go back to the land. In Australia we are always urging persons to go upon the land, but they are not keen to do so. Look at the rush there is for Government appointments. . Recently there were 9,000 applications ""in this State for the position of railway porters. Our best and strongest young men in the country would rather become porters on the railways than work on the land, because the work would be easier and they would have more amusements.",17
24,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the real reason. They have no enterprise.,18
25,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-If we tax men off the land we shall have more people in the towns, and the land will be less productive.",18
26,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Where are the States to get revenue from if we do not give them a portion of the revenue from Customs and Excise ?,18
27,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall, come to that point later. I am now dealing with the taxation of land and income. The Prime Minister interjected that we have an inexhaustible power of taxation with regard to land and income,* but I maintain that there is a limit to the exercise of thaj; power and that the margin which is left to the Federal Parliament is very little. When all the States have imposed an income tax, we cannot put very much more taxation ori to that, and if we should do so what would be the feeling of the people ?. They would say, "" We are over taxed by the Federal Parliament. They are oppressors."" The people would be crying out for the abolition of Federation. They would simply say, "" We have quite enough taxes to pay to the States, and we do not want them duplicated by the Federal Parliament."" I contend that on that ground alone the security of the States is better than that of the Commonwealth. Of course, we might levy revenue duties, but do we really want to increase the burdens of the people? At present the annual receipts of the States and the Commonwealth-that is excluding the revenue from the railways and the Post Office-aggregat e ,£42,000,000. That is a very large sum to collect every year for the government of a country containing only 4,000,000 persons. It is over 30 per cent, of the annual production of Australia in an average year.",18
28,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will be more burdened by the defence policy.,18
29,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Of course they will. I consider that the only articles which are left for the Commonwealth to tax are cotton goods,' kerosene, and tea, and unless we take over the debts of the States, we shall have competing parties from the same country in the money market for loans. If we are to construct trans-continental railways, build a capital city, compensate the land-owners within the Federal territory, and borrow money for building ships, what shall we require ? Before we know where we are, we shall require to borrow something like £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",18
30,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What ! are we to borrow money to build ships ?,18
31,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Of course we shall have to do so. We cannot build the ships out bf revenue.,18
32,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that the policy of this Government ?,18
33,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is.,18
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So does every nation.,18
35,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is an extraordinary proposal.,18
36,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Our cruisers are to be built with borrowed money. It cannot be done otherwise.,18
37,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is thaf the policy of this Government ?,18
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is the policy of nearlv every nation.,18
39,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That means that within a very few years we shall have a debt of £25,000,000 in addition to the debts of the States.",18
40,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do the Government say that they are going to borrow in order to build the ships?,18
41,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we are to spend something like £4,000,000 on a fleet Ave must borrow, because we have no surplus revenue. If the Federal Parliament had been wise in the past it would have retained the whole of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue, and we should now have had in a war chest something like ,£6.000,000, which would have been sufficient to build the ships required in the next two or three years.",18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thin k what I have missed !,18
43,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; and what him we have all missed. Until last year we handed over the whole of the surplus rewe venue to the Stales, when they not require it.",19
44,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are the same people.,19
45,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are the same people, but the money is spent; and know that the same care is not exercised in public affairs that is exercised in affairs. Year after yeir, when there have been surpluses, not a shilling has been put by for a rainy day; and when drought occurs more taxation is imposed. Time after time - the States have had surpluses; and Victoria is, probably, the worse offender in this connection. During these years the public debt has 'been duced to a very small extent, and tempt has been made to establish, a reserve fund, such as every business man has establish if he hopes to live. are two heavy items for which prorevenue, vision has' to be made by the Comwere monwealth-old-ag e and invalid penless sions, and defence. Within the next five years we shall require £6,000,000 meet those engagements, which have been taken over from the States. If the Comyear, monwealth-that is, the people as a whole - di d nol find the money, the States would have to provide for their own defence, for their own old-age and. invalid pensions and, therefore, we have relieved, or will relieve, the States of an expenditure £6,000,000 per annum during the next five years. That being the case, it seems me very unwise to put such a large permanent charge on our revenue as that proposed in the agreement. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is an expanda ing mortgage!",19
46,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so. have not the slightest objection when can afford it, to treat the States liberally, because as members of the Australian munity they are part and parcel of ourfence, selves ; but the question is, who are to age the affairs of the people of Australia? Are we to delegate our powers to so many State Governments or are we to retain conmoney trol ourselves? It will be much better us to limit the term of this agreement. intend to vote for the second reading of Bill. I have no desire to do anything embarrass the Government, and I am quite sure not a single member of the Government has any desire to embarrass any honourable member who does not see eye to eye on this question; but in Committee we shall do the wisest thing for Australia if make the agreement for a limited term, really did and not in perpetuity. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We might, for a term of ten years, give the States more than is proposed.",19
47,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Perhaps . The we revenue of the States in 1901-2 was £28,197,927, and in 1907-8 it was private ,£34,867,648, or an increase of over £6,500,000 in six or seven years. It will be seen that the States, at the present time, have a larger revenue by £6,000,000 odd than they had before Federation, or at the commencement of Federation - The Prime Minister in his speech stated that we had all taken over from the States burdens now reamounting to ,£3,800,000; and this really no 'atmeans that the States are about £10,000,000 per annum better off than to they were at the commencement of FedeThere ration. I feel that, with this increased the States, if the Federation pressed at any time, could do with than ,£5,600,000 per annum. The increase in the States revenue in seven years to represents 24 per cent. The estimated . expenditure of the Commonwealth for next according to the Budget statement, is ,£7,867,000. Extra expenditure is to be incurred in connection with defence; and and there is no doubt that old-age pensions ; will cost a great deal more than the Government estimated, as is shown by the reof turns of the number of applicants.",19
48,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thousand s of returns to have yet to come in for Victoria.,19
49,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that a great many more returns have to come in for Victoria and other States. It is only question of time when invalid pensions will have to be paid; and, though it is I difficult to estimate their cost, I put it we down roughly at ,£1,000,000 per annum; so that invalid and old-age pensions will comcost us something like ,£3,000,000. Deas I have said, will cost a great mandeal more than it does at present; and, if we build two overland railways at a cost of, say, £10,000,000, the interest.on the which it will be necessary to borrow for will represent ,£350,000 per annum. The I States can borrow when they like, with no the power of restriction on the part of the to Commonwealth, and we shall have to compete against them in the money market. The security of the States is, I think, even better than that of the Commonwith wealth, and we shall not be able to borrow as cheaply as we thought. I should say that it will cost the Commonwealth 4 per cent, for borrowed - money, and if the States compete, their rate of interest will also be increased.",19
50,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that six separate States can borrow more cheaply and advantageously than we could with one Commonwealth stock ?,20
51,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not with one Commonwealth stock. If we were to have one Commonwealth stock, and adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Mernda to take over the States debts, we s'hould be in a much sounder positionthat is, if we do not allow the States to increase their borrowing, or, if they do increase it, place them in the same position as are the municipalities. As honourable members know, the municipalities may borrow only in proportion to their income, and a sinking fund has to be provided for the repayment of each loan within a certain number of years. Unless we take over the State debts, however, the security of the States will be better than our own,' in of the fact that they have such good assets, while we have none.",20
52,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have the power of taxation.,20
53,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have all their assets as well as our own.,20
54,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-The Commonwealth cannot take the railways, OT use the revenue of the railways, and we have not an acre of land.",20
55,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"After all, the main security is the power of taxation.",20
56,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainly , but there is a limit to the paying power of the people. After the land tax of3d. in the J £ I has been imposed in Victoria, can we squeeze any more revenue from that source ?",20
57,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not discussing that point, but merely pointing out that, after all, the main security is the power of taxation.",20
58,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Our power of taxation is only co-equal with that of the States-w e have no superior power. If the Commonwealth imposes a land tax, and the States also impose a land tax, all that can be done is to sue or seize the property - if the tax is not paid. We cannot prevent .the States, for instance, from increasing their income tax as much as they like; and .if we make this country one in which the taxation is unbearable, we shall drive every penny of capital out of it. If we have two people squeezing at a lemon, there will be very little left for either in the long run. The Federal Parliament should, therefore, retain its control over the Customs and Excise revenue, in order to meet the two big items of expenditure represented by defence and invalid and old-age pensions. While we can afford it, let us be as liberal as we may-in.fact , let us err on the side of generosity-bu t do not impose a permanent first charge upon our revenue, because, as surely as we are here, we shall rue the day, and desire to have some of the money back at one time or another. Did anybody ever anticipate that the Commonwealth, in the ninth year of its existence, would be in financial difficulties - that there would be a deficit at the end of. this year, if some arrangement were not come to with the States? According to the Budget statement, we shall be short something like £1,200,000 at the end of the financial year; and it is certainly remarkable that, with all our. powers of taxation, we should find ourselves at the view end of the ninth year, unable to carry on without borrowing money. Mr SAMPSON,- A large sum is to be expended on new works.",20
59,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not care how it is to be expended.,20
60,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"About £5,000,000 has already been expended upon new works from revenue.",20
61,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A large amount has been so expended, and now we have not money to meet our engagements. When the Premiers' Conference was held, I do not believe that the Premiers recognised the difficult position confronting the Commonwealth, or the large amount that would be required for defence purposes. I do not believe that anybody thought of such a contingency some years ago; at any rate, I did not. I knew that we must make some preparation for defence; but I did not anticipate a scheme such as has been presented. It is a scheme which everybody commends, and which I do not think has its equal in any part of the Empire; and we ought to be proud of the Government and the Minister who has submitted it. I feel, however, that the Premiers did not realise the position ; and I ask where the States would be if the Commonwealth could not keep the enemy from our shores. In such circumstances, Ave need not talk about CommonAA-ealth or States; we cannot defend ourselves without money, and unless the Commonwealth is financially strong in time of trouble, war, or drought, we shall have the greatest difficulty in paying our way. We may experience droughts in the future as we have done in the past. Do honourable members forget that in one year the number of sheep in New South Wales alone decreased by 20,000,000?",20
62,Mr MCDONALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"B y more than that. It declined from 61,000,000 to 23,000,000.",21
63,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We may have to face similar droughts in the future, and yet it is seriously proposed to base the adjustment of our financial relations with the States upon the most favourable season that we have ever experienced- a season in which the largest revenue has been recorded by both the States and the Commonwealth. I think that we ought to consider what will be our position when bad times recur, if we ratify the proposed agreement. Let honourable members reflect upon our position if, in consequence of a drought, our lands became denuded of stock. In such circumstances our revenue from Customs and Excise would probably fall 25 per cent., the amount derived from income tax would necessarily decline, and the land tax-shoul d it press too heavily upon the land-owner-woul d simply drive settlers off - the country. Rather than sanction the return to the States of 25s. - per capita, we ought to adopt a sliding scale under which our contribution to them will be regulated by the manner in which our revenue may increase or decrease. We ought not to give the States a first charge upon our revenue without being afforded an opportunity to undo the transaction. Of course, I have heard honourable members argue that if the peopie approve of embodying the proposed agreement in the Constitution they will always possess the power to remove it. Undoubtedly they will. But as the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes have properly pointed out, we are here to advise the people what they ought to do. If we advise them to amend the Constitution by inserting the proposed agreement in it, what will they think of us if within a fewyears we have to advise them to remove it? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They will tell us that we are asses.",21
64,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should not be surprised if they did. Moreover, it is not an easy task to undo anything of that nature. W,hen the Federal Capital has been established at Yass-Canberra, will the electors of Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, or Queensland pay much attention to the proceedings of this Parliament?",21
65,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not?,21
66,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The morning newspapers of the principal cities of the Commonwealth will then contain reports of, perhaps, only half a column in regard to the doings of this Parliament - The people of Victoria will read the reports of the proceedings of the Victorian Parliament, and will pay little attention to the doings of this Parliament. A similar condition of affairs obtains in the other States at the present time. They see only what is at their doors; for example, at Melbourne Cup time, there is a large influx of visitors to this city from the country, and a newspaper exchange is established here at - which all the provincial journals may be perused. But visitors to this exchange do not consult the Argus or the Age; they read their own local newspaper. They are not concerned with what is transpiring in Melbourne, but only with what is taking place at Dimboola, or Ararat, or any other place from which they may come. In short, they are interested only in the news concerning their own district. A similar state of affairs will obtain when this Parliament is removed to the Federal capital.",21
67,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What difference will the removal of this Parliament to the permanent seat of Government make to Queensland or Western Australia?,21
68,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The people of those States will merely have regard to the doings of their own Parliaments. The electors in South Australia do not pay much attention to Commonwealth affairs.,21
69,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nor do the electors of Victoria outside of Melbourne.,21

71,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In South Australia, too, the Hansard report of the State Parliament is published daily in the press.",21
72,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the Commonwealth Parliament is meeting at the permanent seat of Government, if we have occasion to ask the electors to undo what the Government are now asking them to do, they will laugh at us. They will want to know why they should deprive the States of money to enable the Commonwealth to spend it perhaps in Sydney. In a matter of that sort Melbourne .residents would be just as narrow-minded as we think people in the other States are narrow-minded at the present time.",21
73,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member favours legislation for Melbourne only ?,22
74,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , I desire to legislate for Australia as a whole. those who support the adoption of the proposed agreement in perpetuity are of legislating for Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and Sydney, viewing the matter merely from a local stand-point. sire to make the Commonwealth so finansimultaneously cially strong that our country will never be State debts. in danger.

On levies toll on nearly every other country in the world. At the present timeAustralia is paying about £14,000,000 Great Britain as interest upon State debts, municipal loans, &c.

The whole of the British debt is owned by her own people. were not so financially powerful not be the country that she is today, and we should not be here. During the twenty years approximately £120,000,000 worth of State debts will have to be verted- If the Commonwealth and the States are competing against each other the money market will the money lender allow us to effect that conversion cheaply? Certainly not. He will be able to squeeze purposes. us. As a matter of fact we never convert a lpan now at a less cost than slightly 2 per cent. That is a big charge to upon every conversion. M.r. KING O'MALLEY - It £2 12s. per cent.",22
75,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , my estimate was rather under the mark. When the honourable member for Flinders was Premier of Victoria he had occasion to convert a loan at a very bad time, and the cost of the operation was about 3^ per cent. Unless the Commonwealth takes over the State debts and establishes a Commonwealth stock, it is bound to be financially squeezed in the future. I am strongly, in favour of taking over those debts, and I do not think that we ought to approve the proposed agreement until we have done that. When we have established a Commonwealth stock, we shall be able to effect a great saving upon our indebtedness.",22

80,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is now a Bill before the House in reference to the transfer annually to of the State debts.,22

82,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . My next contention is that there should be only one. During the past six years the conCustoms and Excise revenue has averaged £ 2 6s. 6d. f e r cafita. Under the proposed in agreement the Commonwealth would return to the States 25s. fer cafita, thus leaving it only 21s. fer cafita f of its own In other words, that is the amount which would be available for the over defence of the country, the payment of pay old-age pensions, and the cost of administering the various Departments which we have taken over from the States. amounts to Mr DUGALD THOMSON - From where did the honourable member obtain his figures ?",22
83,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m some of the papers which were presented to the Premiers' Conference. In submitting this proposal, the Prime Minister stated that the annual revenue from Customs duties in Victoria amounted to 32s. per head. As under the proposed agreement the Commonwealth would hand back to it 25s. per head of that amount, it is obvious that Victoria would be contributing only 7s. per head towards the cost of the defence of the Commonwealth, the payment of old age pensions, and the cost of administering the transferred Departments. If these figures are correct, Victoria would not be paying anything like her fair share of the burden. The Prime Minister also stated that the revenue annually derived from Customs and Excise in New South Wales amounted to 36s. per capita. words, that State would contribute only ns. per capita to the Commonwealth.",22
84,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the Prime Minister was speaking of the revenue from Customs duties only, and not of that from Customs and Excise.",23
85,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I took down his words at the time, but perhaps I made a mistake. But even if the position be that which is suggested by the honourable member, it is clear that under the proposed agreement Victoria would not be paying her fair share of Commonwealth expenditure. There are not very many articles which it is open to us to tax, and I do not think that we should be able to squeeze more than £2,000,000 out of the taxation of tea, kerosene, and cotton piece-goods. But if the Government take all the money that they can wring from the taxpayers, nothing will be left for investment by private enterprises. Where would Australia have been but for the enterprise of the people? Let me remind honourable members of what was done in connection with the Darling country in New South Wales. The Government leased large grazing areas in that district for sheep-farming purposes, and later on an agitation sprang up for the imposition of heavier rentals. Gradually the rentals were increased, until they were at least quadrupled, with the result that the sheep-farmers, having lost heavily by reason of droughts, were starved out. The rabbits then swarmed over the district; it is now practically a desert; and the Government, instead of obtaining from it a large revenue, are receiving scarcely any return. The people have been squeezed out of the district. And so with the Commonwealth. We can overdo taxation. - By excessive taxation we should drive ' people off the land, and crush out private enterprise which, to my mind, is far better than is. that of the State. If we allow - the people an opportunity to make savings, and a chance to improve their holdings, I am quite sure that we shall do well. I propose to vote for the second reading of this Bill, and in Committee will support any proposition that may be made to limit the duration of the agreement to a reasonable period. Ten years would be a fair limit to fix to its operation. The wise men who framed the 'Constitution determined that the operation of the Braddon section should be for only ten years, and, that period having exIn other pired, it would be well to provide for a per capita return of 253. per annum to the States for a similar period. The Braddon section has worked fairly well, the States have had ample revenue, and the Commonwealth has been able to carry on its undertakings. Is it reasonable to suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament ten years hence will be less worthy of the confidence of the people than it is today ? Is it not dealing fairly and even generously with the States at the present time? Are we likely to have, in this Parliament, ten years hence, men who will repudiate any fair engagement, or do anything that may tend to ruin the people of the Commonwealth ?",23
86,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Parliament should be wiser ten years hence.,23
87,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And should have a better knowledge of the needs of the Commonwealth than we could reasonably be expected to have at the present time. It is utterly impossible for any one to foresee what will be our needs ten years hence; but our expenditure, I am confident, will have increased very considerably. At the inception of Fede-' ration, it amounted to something like £3,500,000 per annum, and the estimate for the present year is about ,£7,500,000.",23
88,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Constitution provided that the agreement should remain in operation for ten years, it could not be varied before the expiration of that period.",23
89,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so; but should the agreement prove to have been a mistake, it is better that the 'Commonwealth should be pinched for ten years than ini perpetuity.",23
90,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Can the agreement be. said to be perpetual if it is open to the people to alter it?,23
91,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is absolutely certain that once we embody in the Constitution a provision that the proposed payment shall be made for all time, a variation of that arrangement will never be made. If we attempted to secure an alteration we should have fighting 1.1s on every public platform members of the State Parliaments. What chance should - we have, since we are only 112 strong, fighting against the 530 or 600 legislators of the States, supported by the press, their demand that the operation of the agreement should not be limited?",23
92,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The agreement is not supported by all the neAvspapers.,24
93,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Once rhe States the received the benefit of this agreement the State newspapers would fight for its conThree tinuance for all time. The only newspaper that we should have with us would be probably the Canberra Gazette, or the Canberra Illustrated. News, which would haA'e no circulation outside the Federal Capital. I think that it would be Avise and reasonable for the Parliament the operation of this agreement to a period of ten years. We are often told that we should trust the people, but if AAe' cannot trust them ten years hence, should Ave justified in trusting them noAv? Unless we limit the operation of this agreement am satisfied that it will lead to the monAvealth being reduced to great financial straits, and that time will pro\;e that the most umvise arrangement that could be made for Australia. Let us think for a moment of the mistakes of the past. Did any Commonwealth Treasurer imagine that the Commonwealth Would be in its present financial difficulty after financing old-age pensions?",24
94,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is there to be no velopment of the Federal sentiment?,24
95,Mr AGAR WYNNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Our income is not likely to increase in proportion to our did expenditure, and, as the honourable memrecognise ber for Flinders has shoAvn, our per capita return of Customs and Excise reA'enue will fall as population increases.

Those who talk about State Rights seem to regard the States as entities foreign to the monwealth, and to think that we cannot trust each other. Surely we should all recognise that the State and Federal liaments represent the same people, and that there should be no feeling of tagonism. The two systems of Governbrought ment should work in unison, and each should have ample means to provide for its own purposes. But unless we provide in the first instance for the requirements the Commonwealth, we shall find it in financial difficulties, and shall not have improved the position of the States, since they will probably have more money than they require. We should not hear the of State Rights as opposed to those of Commonwealth, nor of Commonwealth Rights versus State Rights; but unless give the CommonAvealth ample means to ' minions; provide for its necessary services, such those of defence, the post office, and age pensions-al l of which have been taken over from the States-w e shall place it in a very awkward and unfair position.",24
99,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) I"""".44]- Tn the Bill which the Prime Minister «eeks leave to introduce, and which, following his lead, we are discussing on this moand tion- a most unusual and unsatisfactory procedure, since the Bill is not yet before' us-the Commonwealth Parliament has placed before it the most momentous quessupreme. tion that it has yet had to face. In motion is involved the great question of State Rights, as against National interests. [140] [29 SEPT., 1909.] (Finance) Bill. 3881 That question has been a stumbling block in the framing of all Federal Constitutions, of and was again manifested in the estabThe the State Rights parties have always rediscognised, as the Prime Minister said, found that where two parties ride on a horse, the one must sit behind; and, being conby fears and jealousies, they have their utmost, in the first - instance, to of prevent Federation, and failing that, to tie the hands of the Federal Government as They much as possible. I am now talking of the establishment of Federations generally, and not particularly of ours. These parties of have always endeavoured to tie the hands how of the National Government as much as of they possibly could. Sooner or later, howis ever, the great contest betAveen the great National party and the State Rights party be has to be fought out, if only to establish the principle that the National Government must be the paramount poAver, and the States Comthe subordinate powers. Until that principle is established no Federal Government can exercise its functions freely or will proParbably exist for any great length of time. Take the case of the United States. At the antime when the American Federation was about the State Rights party was poAverful, Will the result that such a large sphere of action Avas left to the States that the very national unity Avas for many years of in peril. The solidity of the Union Avas only finally established as a consequence of the great and disastrous civil Avar of the sixties. In the Canadian Federation, and quite recently in the South African Federation, the cry fight betAveen State Rights and National the interests ivas fortunately pushed to a satisfactory conclusion in the framing we of the Constitutions of those Doand there the National as party succeeded unmistakably in each inoldstance in making the National Government the paramount poAver. Unfortunately, Ave in. Australia chose to follow United States instead of Canadian precedents; but at the same time it Avas only reasonable to expect that in the tAventieth century, Will all our should deA'elopments and all our learning,, we haA'e profited by the A'ery unfortunate experience of the American Federation, have recognised at an early stage that once the Commonwealth Avas established it could not be dissolved, ancl that as long as it lasted the National GoA'ernment must be Unfortunately, howeA'er, the ' this Commonwealth had not been in existence A'ery long before Ave realized the fact that such was not to be the case, and that we should have to buy our own experience. It was realized that sooner or later the contest would have to be fought out in this community between the two parties to which I have referred. The first serious crisis in the contest between the National interest and the State Rights party in Australia has arrived; and it will depend upon this Parliament whether it is going to be the last fight or not. Because if , unfortunately, the Sta.te Rights party should win, there is not the slightest doubt that at some distant date, probably when present politicians have passed away and another generation has sprung up, the National spirit will again be revived, the whole matter will be reopened, and the contest will be renewed, probably in a much more serious form. Ultimately, I have not the slightest doubt, the National cause will win, because, when once the foundation is laid of a National form of government, and the National spirit begins to operate, it can never be long suppressed. It will only be a matter of time when that spirit must triumph and become paramount. It therefore rests with this Parliament, representing the whole of Australia-and in the first instance with this House representing the majority of the people, a House elected on a thoroughly Democratic basis in which the majority rules-to say whether the National interests or State Rights shall be paramount. That is the whole question at issue in the consideration of this Bill.",25
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not at all.,26
101,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say emphatically that it modes of thought. is, and the Prime Minister himself mitted so much when, in his introductory speech, he made use of these words. He said that the struggle between the National Government and the State Governments for supremacy, for the power of the purse, adding trulyWhoever holds the purse, whichever possesses the money, is the real ruler. I prefer to take the Prime Minister's as to what is involved in this measure, the opinion of the Minister of Defence. used to be. The case for the agreement made between the Government and the State Premiers was ably put-as was only to be expected - by the Prime Minister; and I can only congratulate the State Rights on having secured the services of so eminent a counsel. The speech, when livered, however, must have struck orable members, as it struck the press, as not being up to the level of speeches which on important occasions the Prime Minister has made in the past. The Argus said it was not as brilliant a speech as some which we have heard from Mr. Deakin; and the same newspaper went on to say that it was "" carefully prepared."" 1 I think that we are all agreed that the speech was not such a brilliant utterance as we have had from the Prime Minister concerning National matters on other occasions. And that is not to be wondered at. The soul was lacking in that speech. No one can make me believe that the Prime Minister was giving utterance to his own sentiments. He was simply speaking as counsel representing the party that had adopted that agreement. The very fact that-as was not in accordance with the Prime Minister's usual method-the language of the deliverance was so carefully prepared, showed that the amount of preparation spent upon the form of it was so bestowed with the view of preventing the honourable gentleman from getting away from his text and giving vent to his own feelings. We have known the same sort of thing to occur in the case of other public men. Quite recently it was stated that when the late Sir Thomas Bent went to deliver the speech embodying the policy of his Government at Brighton, his deliverance was typewritten for him, and had been previously considered by his Ministry. It was so prepared in order that he might be kept closely to the one line of argument, and prevented from giving expression to his own peculiar The same method adseems to me to have been adopted in. reference to this matter. I regret exceedingly that the speech introducing this Bill was not made by the Minister of Defence, is* and that the Prime Minister was not over on this side of the House to tear it to pieces in the brilliant manner that he would have done had he been free to treat the subject from the National point of view. We know what we should have words expected from him had he been handling than the subject as the National leader that he Mr. JOSEPH COOK.'-He is a National leader still.",26
102,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes-behin d the Minister party of Defence! The most striking feature of the case put by the Prime Minister was dethis: For the first time, on behalf of hon the Commonwealth, we have the question of contribution or annual subsidy separated from the question of State debts. In the next place, for the first time has been proposed to return to the people themselves the power that has been vested by them in this Parliament. Turnward ing back to the records of the various Conventions since 1891, we find the question of contribution or sidy was invariably bound up with question of the State debts. gates, as Sir George Turner said, that it was not possible to make a scienover tific settlement j that they could only with the matter in a rough-and-ready and that ultimately it must be left for Federal Parliament to settle. reading the 'Convention debates carefully one gets the impression, from the opinions voiced by leading men of all political parties, that they desired to express their matter. absolute trust in the Federal Parliament to do that which was right towards the States. They felt that a temporary agreeproposed ment was all that could be arrived at, the great majority of the leading men were prepared to trust absolutely the Federation.",26
103,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But they made a permanent agreement.,27
104,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes j unfortunately, the fears of some of them prevailed, and by a very narrow majority of three-twenty one to eighteen-the y succeeded in includtives ing in the draft Constitution what was called the ""Braddon blot."" Fortunately, however, there was afterwards a Premiers' Conference, and that Conference decided Melbourne Conference of 1904. that the operation of the Braddon section should be limited, leaving it to this liament to decide what should be done a term of years. In that form, and that form only, was the Constitution adopted by the people of the whole ot Federal Australia. It is very significant that there are two sets of sections in the Constitution, each of which is alterable by a different .the method. There is one set of sections which can be altered only by the people themthe selves. The people retain absolute control over those sections. But there is another set by which can be altered at any time by the Federal Parliament as it thinks fit-subject, of course, to its responsibility to the electors. Now that, I say, is a very sigsection nificant fact. The people deliberately The adopted a provision in which they resolved the to leave the power of altering the section affecting the distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue entirely and the hands of their own representatives. The fact that this question would come up for review at the end of ten years has been [140]- 2 it in the mind of the Federal Parliament from the beginning, and not a few members of that Parliament have brought forschemes for dealing with the matter, l t has been discussed from time to that time by the State Premiers. They subhave had various State Conferences the to which representatives of the ComThe delemonwealth were invited. But at these found Conferences the question of taking the State debts and that of a complete deal severance of the financial relations of the way, Commonwealth and the States have always the been considered together. Our CommonOn wealth representatives have always upheld the position given to the Federal Parliament under the Constitution - that this Parliament was the final arbiter in th< Never, until this agreement was considered, have the States been allowed to dictate, nor has it ever been to take from the Federal Parliaand ment the power intrusted to it and to return that power to the people by embodying in the Constitution such a provision as that now proposed. Quotations have been made from Conference debates, and I also propose to make a few extracts, because it is desirable, in my opinion, to show how - completelv the Commonwealth representaon the most recent occasion reversed the policy hitherto invariably pursued by their predecessors. Passing over the Conferences of IQO2 and 1903, I turn to the Sir George Turner, when it was suggested Parthat the Federal Parliament should give after up the power which it is now proposed in that it should surrender, saidYou are expecting me, Mr Irvine, to go to the Parliament and ask its members lo give up what they regard as a very important power that is now in their hands. It is a power which a very large number of them, and very like'y majority of them, will claim as their right, the right to deal in any way they think fit with Customs and Excise revenue which the Commonwealth will collect after the ten years fixed' the Braddon section have elapsed. the matter was before the Convention, we When tried every means that we could devise tn arrive at some permanent arrangement, and after being beaten time after time, the best terms we could make were that the Braddon should extend over a period of ten years. Federal Parliament could afterwards, under terms of the Constitution as it stands at present, enter upon any experiment tliey chose. At another period of the same Conference freely in Sir George Turner saidBut I cannot go to the Federal Parliament and say, "" I want you to extend the Braddon section for all time."" Parliament would regard the perpetuation of the operation of the Braddon section as altogether against the principles of the Federation, namely, that the Comtatives. monwealth Government should have absolute control, and should be credited with a desire do what is right and just. In inserting the Braddon provision in the Constitution, we did more. something which is repugnant to the iflea of Federation, and you must help me to go to the lot. Federal Parliament with a moderate proposal; otherwise there will be a strong feeling Parliament that a proposal which there is no justification, namely, a proposal with regard to expenditure after the for which its hands are tied by the Constitution. - Further on, he said I say frankly that in my opinion the Federal Parliament as at present constituted, and as believe it will be constituted in the future, not indefinitely extend the operation of the tion. While Sir George Turner was speaking, now Mr Waddell, who represented New South be Wales, said- . Whatever proposal you may put forward must be one that will meet with the approval of not only the Federal Parliament, but of the Slates Parliaments. To that remark Sir George Turner said emphatically ""No."" Coming to the 1906 Conference, the question of parting with the power and control given to the Federal Parliament under the Constituticin was again discussed by the States representatives with the present Prime Minister think. and the present Treasurer.

112,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Firs t of all it is ratified before going into the Constitution, but the effect would be that it could not be altered without another appeal to the people. That means the insertion in the Constitution, so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, of a condition which is not at present there, and so far it is a new proposal Personally, I am not inclined to sav "" n o "" to your proposal, because you are going l o the one party interested, the people of Australia; still, it is a new proposal.",28
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ver y clumsy, I should He has forgotten all that. At the Brisbane Conference in 1907, and, in fact, right for ten through, the present Prime Minister and Treasurer took the same stand. The Trea"" and thereafter until surer said I am willing to go a good way, and the be altering Commonwealth, I may say, are willing to go a good way so long as we do not infringe what I may consider the basic provisions of the Constitution. He puts it so strongly as to say that what has we are now asked to surrender is one of the basic provisions of the ConstitutionWhatever may be thought as to the moral right, there is no doubt after igio the ParliaI t seems to ment of the Commonwealth has legal power to deal with the revenues of Customs and Excise in the way that it considers fair. . . . The return to the States shall be on such a basis as it thinks fair. Further on, when the Premiers wanted to include the alteration in the Constitution, he said-and the singular thing is that the head of that Government was the present Prime Minister, and the Treasurer of it was the present TreasurerI may say at once on behalf of the Commonwealth that it seems to us to be an unreasonable provision, and one that we could not under any circumstances agree to. It seems to me that it shows a disregard for the constitutional position. ' It seems to show distrust of the Commonwealth, and to place the Constitution in fetters which are not in the Constitution. The Treasurer now puts it that to refuse to include the provision in the Constitution is to distrust the people. But at the Brisbane Conference on that occasion, - when one of the State representatives said it was distrusting the people to refuse to put the provision in the Constitution, he made a reply which I shall quote, and I wish he were here to listen to his own words. Yesterday he twitted the honourable member for Hume in his absence from the State with having altered his views on the matter, and I should like to show how the right honourable member has altered the views which he held when he was Treasurer before. I have quoted his statement to the Premiers that they were distrusting the Commonwealth, and when they replied that he was distrusting the people, he saidNo, it was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this shall be the Constitution, and it would be a strange idea for the Parlia-ment of Australia to say to the people, "" We are not competent to handle this great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it . "" We, who represent the same people and the same electors; we, the Commonwealth Parliament, say- "" Take hack this power; we are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the way you desire."" Yesterday, the tight honourable gentleman, after quoting certain words uttered by the honourable member for Hume, remarked, '' Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen ! The political champion of the States then; the political enemy of the States now."" Similarly I may say of the debts right honourable gentleman himself, "" Those are the words which he used when he was together. a great Nationalist. What a falling-off is there when he comes forward as a State view. Righter! "" He went on to sayOn reading the Hansard report of ceedings of this Conference one might fairly come to the conclusion that the tude assumed by some members of this Conference would seem to show that this Conference was the arbiter of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth was asking for something in these proposals that would be injurious to their interests. Now, as a matter of fact, as you all know, under the Constitution . . . . the Commonwealth has all the power it requires for itself already. Throughout these Conferences the present - Prime Minister and Treasurer asserted the absolute power of the Federal Parliament to deal with the question, and refused to surrender that power. The right honourable member for Swan in the strongest language possible-stronge r than any uttered so far in this debate-absolutel y scouted the idea of our handing back the power to the people and telling them that we w;ere not worthy to be trusted with it after they had placed it in our hands. Yet, in face of their present attitude, they expect us to follow them ! The two questions of an annual contribution and the transfer of the State debts have always been considered by the Commonwealth representatives up to the present as inseparable. At the Melbourne Conference in 1904 the whole of Sir George Turner's scheme was based on that idea. At the Melbourne Conference in 1906, Mr Evans, who represented Tasmania, said, addressing the present Prime Minister:Will you not have to take into consideration the question of the transfer of debts in connection with this subject? And the Prime Minister replied :Yes. This is one arm of the subject complete in itsel f, but there is another arm; both are essential. What the Federal Parliament desires, so far as I understand, is, if possible, to clear up all the unsettled financial questions between the States and the Commonwealth. The taking over of the debts of the States is one of the most important provisions in the Constitution. When the matter was being discussed, so emphatic and firm was the present Prime Minister on that point that Mr Davies, who was one of the representatives of Victoria, pointed out to his fellow State representatives that it was absurd to consider the two questions apart. He said:We will surely make our proposal as to State subject to the adoption of other resolutions, and different Federal Governments have all held the same view that the two things should be done",28
114,Mr KIDSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They will always hold that Even then Mr Kidston had no hope that the proa Fusion Government would be brought into being, and that the Prime Minister attiand the right honourable member for Swan would both turn somersaults. Mr Davies and that said furtherThey considered that they were giving up something with regard to the Braddon clause, or the amended proposal that we have now adopted, and they wanted to get the question of State debts settled at the same time. Seeing that the present Commonwealth Government is of the same opinion - and we heard what the Prime Minister said yesterday- I feel that we would be jeopardizing the probabilities of our getting the other proposals agreed to if we refuse to consider the question of State debts. Before the matter was cleared up at that Conference the Prime Minister was called in. Some dispute had arisen as to whether he was firm on the question or not, and Mr Evans addressed him in these wordsAfter debate, I withdrew the resolution I had moved, because I was told that it was imperative, so far as Sir John Forrest and the Commonwealth Government were concerned, that the taking over of the State debts should be part and parcel of the whole scheme. It was promised that I should get a reply from you, Mr Deakin, when you attended the Conference this afternoon, as to this question. The Prime Minister replied- But I can set Captain Evans' mind at rest by saying that he has quite correctly understood the purport of the remarks that have been made by Sir John Forrest and myself. In the view of the Commonwealth, not only the consideration of the debts question, but its final determination, is the essence of the contract. To use Captain Evans' own words, it is an imperative part of the scheme, and I do not think he needs any explanation from me to tell him why. If you look at the proposals altogether as in every other negotiation, it is a question of give and take. Now, so far as you are concerned, the proposals relating to the Braddon clause and your future revenue from Customs are all "" take "" on your part, and "" give "" on the part of the Federal Parliament. It is only when you come to deal with the debts question that you balance it. You have to ask yourselves the question what you will give up on that point, and what the Commonwealth can fairly take in the interests of Australia as a whole. At Brisbane in 1907 the right honourable member for Swan saidNow we have had four previous Conferences, and at all of them the representatives of the people of Australia have said they believed the States debts should be taken over, because they believed, and the framers of the Constitution also believed, that a great saving to the people of Australia would result. I fear that Parliament will not do anything in these great financial matters unless we do it as a whole. They will not do it piece-meal. To deal with one-half of the financial problem, and leave the other half, will not commend itself to them. Later on he saidThe two matters cover the whole of the cial problems as between the States and Commonwealth . . . and in the opinion of the Government and the Parliament they should be dealt with together. ' At the Conference last year the Prime Minister, who was also Prime Minister then, and represented the Commonfinancial wealth, saidThe point I wish to make at the outset, is that, looking back, one is struck by the repeated references made during the course of the Convention debates at which the present Constitution was shaped to two things which were always considered together. One was the revenue derived from Customs in the Commonwealth, and the other was the interest on the debts which had Mr Wise. been incurred by the States of the Commonwealth. . . . Speaking not so much legally, as generally, it appears to me that the clear meaning of the Constitution is that these two matters should be dealt with together. He enlarged upon that aspect of the question in these wordsIt is never a question between the States and the Commonwealth, but always a question of the States in the Commonwealth. When any difference arises between the States and the Commonwealth it means between the State agency and the Commonwealth agency of the Australian people. It is unnecessary to enter into distinctions, but the point I wish to make Then come the words I have already quoted, and thenEven before that Convention, if I remember aright, Sir Samuel Griffith had dwelt upon the necessity of considering these two factors together. He goes on in the same strain through a lengthy speech, and finally says The first suggestion I wished to make this morning, was that, at this Conference the time has arrived when the question should be approached from the other side-whethe r certain difficulties would not be removed, the intention of the framers of the Constitution better fulfilled, and other useful objects achieved, by considering once more the two questions together, that is the repayment of a portion of the Customs duties to the States and the obligations already incurred by the States in regard to their borrowings. In other words, one side of those questions having been frequently considered, and very full y considered, has"" not the time arrived when some stress- a great deal more stress than in the past-shoul d be laid on the debt side, and its connection with the problem ? Singularly enough, he lays very much less stress now on that point than he did before. He then saidPersonally, I have been putting that forward, and so has my honourable colleague, the Treasurer, almost since the commencement of the Commonwealth. His one contention throughout was that this was a matter for the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth alone, to deal finanwith, and that the two questions must be the dealt with together. Even as late as this year the Minister of External Affairs, in the presence of the present Prime Minister, at Toowoomba, before the Deakin-Lyne present scheme was abandoned, saidThe first ideal of a settlement of the question must be the complete severance between the Commonwealth and State finances. Their plans (Sir William Lyne's scheme) had that end in view. The next point to be considered in the settlement of the finances was that it must always be kept in view that taxation and representation must go hand in hand. The Commonwealth members must be responsible to the electors for their taxation, and the State members for theirs The only satisfactory solution is that which will make the Commonwealth and States responsible for the money raised by each. That was what their party wanted. That was the old Deakin partyHe then pointed out that if the Commonwealth determined to take over the State debts and pay the interest thereon, the past national debt would be wiped out in 35 years. . . . His feeling was that the national power must become greater, and the powers of the Constitution be extended. As a member of the present Government the honourable gentleman has now cast all that to the winds. I have shown .the position taken up by every representative of the Commonwealth Government from the beginning of Federation, and taken up over and over again by the present Prime Minister and the present Treasurer. This, as the Prime Minister has said, represents not only the view of the Commonwealth Parliament during the whole of this time, but the view also of the framers of the Constitution. Now the honourable gentleman absolutely abandons that' position. Of course, he has told us that he has not done so. Indeed, he boasted that the position had been established. He said that the first resolution wasThat to fulfil the intention of the Constitution by providing for the consolidation and transfer of Stale debts, and in order to insure the most profitable management of future loans by the establishment of one Australian Stock, a complete investigation of this most important subject shall be undertaken forthwith by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States. This investigation shall include the question of the actual cost to the States of transferred properties as defrayed out of loan or revenue mone; s. By the way, it is very singular that the honourable gentleman never seemed to think that this investigation was necessary when he brought down the scheme of the honourable member for Hume based on the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, and which he put so strongly before the people. After reading that resolution the honourable gentleman went on to sayMy reference is to the undoubted intention the Constitution, and to the fact that, for first .time in our experience, the Commonwealth and the States are at one in declaring that the consolidation and transfer of the are necessary to fulfil the inlention of the Constitution, and that, for the most profitable man' agement of future loans, the establishment of one Australian Stock is essential. admits the whole case for which the Commonwealth has been contending for many years within itself. . . . We, therefore, - have, in the frankest fashion, a recognition of the fundamental principle formally accepted by the Convention framers of the Constitution, and now fully, frankly, and unreservedly accepted by our Governments, both Commonwealth and State. We have reached a stage in this regard which many efforts in the past have altogether failed to attain. In the first place that is hardly correct, as honourable members will see if they look at pages 68 and 69 of a paper prepared by. Mr Watson, the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, on the financial problems of the Commonwealth and the States.",29
115,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does that refer to the Conference of 1907 ?,31
116,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , to the Conference of 1903. Though the Prime Minister says that this is the first time at which we have arrived at such a stage, it was arrived at as early as 1903. I find that at that Conference Mr W. H . Irvine, then Premier of Victoria, submitted a memorandum which, after careful consideration extending over several sittings, was agreed to unanimously. I shall make only two quotations from that memorandum. The first isThis Conference submits to the consideration of the Federal Government the following resolution :"" Having regard to the fact that the debts of the various States were incurred upon the security of the revenues of the States, and as the greater part of the revenues has been transferred to the Commonwealth in the Customs and Excise duties, and having regard to the fact that the permanent financial stability of the States must depend upon either (a) the continuance of the application of the principal part of those revenues to payment of the interest of the debts, or (4) the imposition of a very largely increased direct taxation in the various States, it is resolved that, in order to secure to the several S'tate Governments the guarantee contemplated by the Constitution, the provisions of the Constitution with respect to the taking over by the Commonwealth of the debts of the States, or a proportion thereof, should Be brought into operation as soon as possible. Section 87 and section 105 of the Constiof tution, the Braddon section, and the section the giving power to the Commonwealth to take over the debts of the States are then quoted State debts and the memorandum continues The Premiers in Conference feel that they would be neglecting their duty if they failed at this stage to impress upon the Parliament and Now this the people of the Commonwealth the urgent necessity of bringing into effect these provisions, and to emphasize the far-reaching importance of the issues involved. When that occurred as far back as 1903, of what use is it for the Prime say that this has been recognised now for the first time? But even if the statementgive be correct the declaration, as the honourable member for Parkes pointed out the other night, is absolutely valueless. It means nothing at all. It binds the State Governjected. ments to nothing, but an inquiry. proposed here that we shall give everything away, and shall then wait for them to give something back to us. I am reminded by the proposal of another matter with which the Prime Minister was concerned. I am reminded of what happened at the time of the adoption by the Fusion of the Liberal policy. We were told that the Fusion Government had adopted the Liberal 1 policy, but the Times correspondent said that it was upon the condition of postponement upon one excuse or another of all the principal planks of that That describes the kind of declaration have now 'got from the State Governsomersault, ments. It is a declaration on the condifessions tion that what is contained in it shall be indefinitely postponed. Honourable bers are aware that if we start an inquiry we may take as long a time over it as like, and we could discuss it for years afterwards.",31
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who is the Times correspondent referred to?,32
118,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The ..honourable member must, know very well that he must be a of standing and ability to be selected represent that journal. I say that Government have now absolutely separated these two questions. If there was thing in the statement of the Prime ter that we have something valuable in declaration, it is all set aside when member that the question of the transfer of the State debts is to be dealt with rately. I think it shows that even persons who are putting forward this posal-the present Prime Minister and Treasurer-ar e not genuine in the ter, because they are not regarding the two questions as parts of one. They not dealing with the two in one Bill. They are deliberately severing them, and proposthe ing to deal with them by two referenda. Honourable members will recollect that Treaisurer, in speaking yesterday, gave away the whole position. The right able gentleman was asked a question, "" Why do you not include both questions in one referendum?"" And this is what axis he replied, and I invite the attention House to it, because there is an enormous Minister to amount of meaning in itWe placed them in two referenda in order to the people greater freedom, so that one may be accepted, and the other rejected. It has been done deliberately in order that one may be accepted and the other reThe fact is that there has been It is an absolute abandonment of the position which hitherto has always been taken up. I must at this stage say that it is very greatly to be regretted that whilst in connection with all previous Conferences we are in possession of'official reports of what took place at them, the Hansard reports of the arguments that were used on both sides, of the arguments used by representatives of the Commonwealth in maintaining the position that has always been put forward the on its behalf, we have in the case of the last Conference no report policy. whatever of the reasons that inwe duced these Ministers to turn an absolute and go back on their produring eight or nine years. If there ever was a time when it was necessary memthat the reasons advanced for the action taken should be published it is this time. we No doubt those who took part in the recent Conference wished to God that all the Conferences had been secret, and that their previous contentions should not now be available and rise up before them. It is singular to note that, although we are man unable to learn the reasons that were adto vanced in this secret Conference on our the behalf, the representatives of the Commonwealth at that Conference have not condeanyscended to mention in this House the Minisreasons whioh induced them to change this their minds. Both the Prime Minister and we rethe Treasurer have absolutely ignored the fact that they ever gave utterance to difsepaferent views. One would have thought the that out of respect for their fellow-memprobers in this House, they might have been induced to say, "" It is true that we said matso-and-so. and that previously we held certain other views, but these aie the reaare sons which have induced us to change our opinions."" It is the more surprising that Prime Minister should have proposed to sever the two questions, because: in the the speech he made in moving the motion now before the House, the honourable genhonortleman used the following wordsThe control of the debts of Australia is the on which our financial proposals revolve. If that were ignored, it would throw the whole of the picture out of focus. Yet he proposes now to start revolving the machine without the axis. He brings forward the machine first, and keeps the axis back. He sends them in different Bills to the country for the express purpose, as the Treasurer said yesterday, of enabling the people, if they think fit, to accept one and reject the other. Every member of this House agrees with the Prime Minister that. the taking over and control of the debts of Australia by the Commonwealth is the axis on which all our financial proposals revolve. The honourable gentleman's present position is the more surprising, because, as I say, he last year adopted the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. He brought that scheme forward then, and even now he describes it as a bold and statesmanlike proposal. Mr Kidston, speaking at one of the Conferences, said that it was the only scheme under which finality could be reached. Let us come now to the position as it is actually presented to us at the present time. It constitutes a complete change, not merely of the Commonwealth policy maintained by these gentlemen, and by all representatives of the Commonwealth for the last nine years, but a complete change also of the policy of the present Government, even during the short time that they have been in office. As the honourable member for Parkes stated the other night, the scheme now proposed was not a part of the Fusion policy. It was not a part of the terms on which the present Ministerial party was brought together. What was the Fusion policy on this particular question? It wasPending the preparation of a complete scheme adjusting the future financial relation of the Commonwealth and States, an interim arrangement to be proposed under which the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth shall be dealt with. That is all the Fusion party were asked to agree to. They came together on a now proposal for an interim' arrangement. Customs More than that, the present Prime Minsons, ister is president of a party called the for Commonwealth Liberal Party, which was considerable launched the night before the Fusion was be arduous. effected at a great meeting held in the Melbourne Town Hall, to which admisTn sion was by ticket only. One of the platof this yearforms of that party wasThe assumption by the Commonwealth of the public debts of the States, accompanied by an equitable scheme for providing interest and sinking fund. Let us now see what we know in this House apart from that policy. I have read the terms on which the Fusion party came together, and I quote this from the Ministerial statement which the Prime Minister laid on the table of this House as setting forth the policy of the Fusion GovernmentA brief 'statement of the business which Ministers are about to submit to Parliament is due to both Houses, though, since the time at our disposal is limited, the references to its particulars must be condensed"" to the utmost. He condenses them into two pagesTo simplify the synopsis, proposals are grouped according to subjects, and not to their relative importance. Then under the heading, "" Finance,"" the Ministerial statement continuedAbove all, the approaching termination of the ten-year period for which the Constitution provides a distribution of the Customs revenue, marks the close of a critical era, and suggests the pressing importance of this great financial problem. A temporary arrangement for a term of years to replace the existing distribution, in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for submission. That is all that was proposed by the Fusion Government. He goes on to sayThe future financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, taken together, with their present and future loan obligations, are being carefully considered in principle and in detail, in order that a satisfactory and permanent settlement may be achieved. On the 30th June he addressed the Premier of New South Wales regarding the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States in these terms-the correspondence has been printed and laid upon the table of the House It is highly desirable that this complex question shall be simplified, so that this Government can frame concise propositions for submission to the electors at our general election. Then he saidYou are probably aware that in the opinion of this Government any attempt to determine the future distribution of the revenue from and Excise would, for practical rearequire to contemplate some fixed period which the circumstances can be forecast with confidence. This should greatly simplify a task which, under any conditions, will reply, Mr Wade wrote on the 3rd July Your letter contains a reference to the submission of questions to the electors, which I take to mean a proposal for ingrafting any agreement arrived at permanently in the Constitution. The second paragraph suggests a temporary arrangement for a term of years. I should be glad if you can give me further information with regard to these matters. To that the Prime Minister replied on the 9th JulyWith reference to the inquiry made in letter of the 3rd inst., I have the honour to inat several Conferences. form you that the propositions to be submitted to our electors will consist of a general statement in our platform of the views of this Government in respect to what may be termed permanent settlement of the future financial lations of the Slates with the Commonwealth. Should the preliminary financial arrangement wealth. for a term of years, alluded to in my last ter, fail for any reason to pass this session, also would be submitted, and in a precise shape. As you are aware, neither one nor the other need be ingrafted upon the Constitution in order to come into full effect.",32
119,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was written only a per few weeks ago.,34
120,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . These extracts are important, because they show that the head of this Government, r'ght up to the time when he entered the secret chamber, and, as the honourable member for Darwin said, seemed to be chloroformed, was uniformly of the opinion that there should be a temporary agreement for a fixed period which one could forecast with certainty. honourable members for Kennedy, Mernda, and Flinders have gone so thoroughly into the figures that I am satisfied to leave that branch of the subject to them. I do not propose to reply to the attempts of the prenent Treasurer to make certain deductions from the statistics quoted by the honourable member for Flinders. There can be no rloubt that the Customs revenue will decrease as the protective duties become more and more effective. The Prime Minister told us that, having examined the statistics of the world, he was unable to find a law bearing upon the subject, and then took the figures for New Zealand as if they were sufficient to create a general rule. At the Melbourne Conference he said that the future could not be predicted, and he has recently repeated that statement. Yet he proposes now to bind the Commonwealth for all time.",34
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For all time?,34
122,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"After what has been said by - Ministerial supporters, I am surprised that the statement, that it is proposed to bind the'Commonwealth for all time, should be disputed. Is the Commonwealth or are the States to determine what the Tariff should be? Is the Commonwealth to be compelled to frame a Tariff other than it would frame if it had a free hand? Are we to lessen the protective incidence of duties, or to impose heavy revenue duties, in order to keep up the revenue? If we do not, the returns will fall as the import duties become more effective. The idea of tying the hands of the Commonwealth your has been scouted by State representatives Speaking at the  We cannot tie the hands of the Commonwealth a Parliament so far that it is not to alter the reTariff to suit what in its wisdom it regards as the requirements of the whole of the Commonlet Mr J. M. Davies, the representative of that Victoria at that Conference, saidWe are asked to tie the Commonwealth Treasurer down to pay the same rate with an increased population, so that if it doubles he would still have to give the States 34s. 5d. head. I feel quite satisfied that the Federal Treasurer would never dream of committing himself to such a thing. Now he has not only dreamt of committing himself, but has actually done so. We have been told that to put this agreement into the Constitution is not to make it permanent. Honourable members opposite, who will not trust the Parliament, say that we, on this side, are not prepared to trust The the people. We are prepared to trust the people. But an amendment of the Constitution can be obtained only by means of a federal, not of a national, referendum, pnd the consent of a majority of the States as well as of the people.",34
123,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are all the brains of the Commonwealth in New South Wales?,34
124,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; but the financial interests of one State differ from those of another. As has been pointed out in the Age in some powerful articles on this subject, it is proposed to place the immediate personal district wants of the people in opposition to great national wants. One can hardly realise how much money, the Commonwealth will need in order to do its duty by this vast continent. Unless we are to be content 'to occupy only its fringe, abandoning the interior, our expenditure must be enormous. We have railways to make, and the Northern Territory to develop, if we do our duty, though I am ; beginning to be afraid that Ave shall not. If the gold-fields at Tanami become like those of Kalgoorlie, they will require, not only raihvay connection, but great water supply Avorks, such as the Treasurer, to his credit, provided for the gold-fields of Western Australia. An elector in the back country of any State, needing a railway, better roads, telephone and telegraphic communication, and a better mail service than is given in many parts of the CommonAvealth, under the Departmental rule which requires that such services shall, if possible, pay their way, would naturally ask, when a proposal of that kind was put - before him, "" Why spend money in developing distant districts when that in which I am living has so many wants?"" He would think more of his immediate requirements and the demand of the State Parliament than of the demands of the Federal Parliament on behalf of - developmental work elsewhere. If the agreement is inserted in the Constitution, it will require a revolution to secure its subsequent amendment. what has been said by a gentleman who cannot be referred to as a Nationalist, Sir Hector Carruthers. Speaking at the Brisbane Conference, in 1907, he saidIt is a very serious thing to ask the Commonwealth of Australia to commit itself irrevocably to a scheme of finance between the Commonwealth and the States, the results of .which no man here can forecast. Just look at our revenue for last year. It is beyond the expectations of any man in Australia. - The PRESIDENT - It is not irrevocable at all. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS - Not irrevocable ; but we know how very few alterations have been made in the equally irrevocable Constitution of the United States. We know how difficult it would be if anything is put in the Constitution to get it amended under the.complicated process provided by the Constitution.",34
125,The PRESIDENT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It would be very easy to amend it if it were causing financial dislocation. The Hon. J. H . CARRUTHERS - Tak e this contingency-that it is found that this arrangement works harshly and unjustly to two States, but works favourably to four States. You have then to ask for an amendment of the Constitution against the interests of .the people of four States, and against the interests of the Treasurers of four States, and you have to get that amendment carried by a majority of the people in a majority of the States. You cannot do it. It will be far easier in dealing with a question of this character to get an amendment made by the Federal Parliament than it will be to get an amendment made by the Federal people, .because if you have got four States who are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement, and Jhave only to appeal to their - sense of honour to give up something for the benefit of others, it will be very difficult to carry the amendment, especially when some people may think that they would have to give up n certain amount of revenue over and above what they are justly entitled to surrender. It will be very difficult to get people to do that in a young country where expenditure means everythingwhere a settler looks upon expenditure as meaning a road to his land, where expenditure means to another man the keeping up of the rate of wages, or of keeping him in employment. It will be very hard to get people to - set personal honour against personal interest, iind that is vvhat will be involved in an amendment of the Constitution. The representatives sitting at this table are men of high motives, with no personal interests to serve, and yet they fight hard for what they think are the rights of their own particular States, and that feeling will permeate the whole community. I would sooner rely upon the process of conference with the Federal Treasurer, and the power of amendment by the Federal Parliament, for an alteration of the terms of the arrangement, than on an amendment of the Constitution.",35
126,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thre e States may block the proposal. ,35
127,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . I have quoted the opinion of a State representative who has been a Minister of the Crown, and has fought the Commonwealth most bitLet me read terly, even as in the wire-netting matter, to the point of force.

130,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know they were-for the purpose of voting - I do not suggest that the Government and their supporters should be here to listen to every member or to myself, but I do expect them to be here to listen to honourable members who belong to their party and are in full sympathy with them, but who are Nationalists first, and all the time. It was known that the honourable memberi for Mernda and the honourable member for Flinders would speak, because they had moved the adjournment of the debate; but yet, when these gentlemen took the floor, and also when the honourable member for Parkes addressed the House, it was lamentable to find average attendances of twelve, twenty-three, and twenty respectively.",35
131,Mr JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Mernda had delivered his speech privately to the Government.,35
132,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The whole circumstances AH me with amazement. . The action of the Prime Minister is simply with a view to keeping down the Commonwealth as much as possible, and elevating the States; and an expression of opinion in the Argus of Monday, 23rd August, is worthy of noteA great Conference, which will be memorable in the history of Australia, has ended in an. agreement which will probably form the financial basis of the Eederation for many years to come. On both sides the momentous nature of the occasion has evidently been f u l ly realized, together with the responsibilities resting upon the two great parties to the Federal bondTo these words I drawparticular attention-the Commonwealth with its strictly limited powers, the States with their large charter, comprising all authority not definitely transferred. Then we heard the honourable member for North Sydney say last week that the States needed"" much more money for development purposes - than did the , Commonwealth-that the functions allotted to the Commonwealth are not so important as those retained by the States.",35
133,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that that is not true?,36
134,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The functions of the Commonwealth are very great; and I should like to quote what the Prime Minister said on the subject when he introduced this motionI take a large view both of the needs and the powers of the Commonwealth; have always done so, and always will. That means when he is ""on his own""I hold that not the mere terms but the plain implications of the Constitution as a whole show that the people of Australia intended, when they adopted .it, and still intend, to make this Parliament their centre of national government. We have not yet exercised all the authority it confers upon us. We have not even fulfilled some of its peremptory duties. We studied them (the States) at the expense of the funds of the Commonwealth in a generous and wise spirit, and our electors at subsequent elections distinctly approved. Section 51 of the Constitution shows that there are great powers to be exercised on behalf of all Australia, and sub-section xxxvn. of that section contemplates the exercise of even, greater functions without an amendment of the Constitution. That sub-section gives the Parliament power to make laws with respect toMatters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter, is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law. Under that sub-section there is no limit to the powers that may be exercised by the Commonwealth; indeed, it absolutely con-; templates an extension of our powers, l t is monstrous to assert that our functions are not as important to the development of Australia as are those of the States. Will the Treasurer say that the construction of the raihvay which he desires to Western Australia is not as great a work as any that that State could do for itself? If Western Australia were able to carry out this work, would the Treasurer press it so earnestly on this House in season and out of season ?",36
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that the only work desired?,36
136,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , but it is a work which Western Australia cannot, carry out herself, and which she appeals to the Commonwealth to execute. The Treasurer has simply turned a complete somersault on his previous professions. The question whether power shall be given to the States, resolves itself into another question-whe ther or not a Government, commensurate with the exigencies of the Union, shall be established, or, in other words, wbether the Union itself shall be preserved. If we. cripple and place ourselves in shackles, which only a revolution can break, we shall obstruct the progress of Australia for many years ito come; and there is no evading the fact that the responsibility will be ours. We are told that we are merely referring this question to the people, but Ave have no right to refer to them any question in which we do not believe-an y measure that we would not be prepared to pass into law tomorrow. Are we going to say, as has often been said by Legislative Assemblies, "" Thank God there is another place '' ? Are we referring this question to the people in the hope that they will reject the proposal ? That is not the way to face responsibility. There is no blinking the fact that this matter, which should not be a party matter, is being made one so far as the Government are concerned.",36
137,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On both sides.,36
138,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , not on both sides.",36
139,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the Brisbane Labour Conference?,36
140,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have nothing to do with the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme; but I may say that nothing has surprised me more than to find this Government, who came into existence for the express purpose of dishing the Labour party, first adopting the caucus method every Thursday, and then coming forward with a financial scheme, the justification for which is that it is the Labour party's scheme. It seems to me that the whole of the considerations involved in this agreement are party and political. When the honourable member for Riverina made a remark to that effect Last night the Prime Minister interjected, "" Too ridiculous."" I shall show, however, the authority on which the remark was made; and, if the Prime Minister is sincere, I can onlysay, in the words of HamiltonNecessity, especially in politics, often occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a system of measures correspondingly erroneous.",36
141,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 7.45 p.m.,37
142,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the sitting of the House was suspended, I was pointing out that this agreement had been made wholly and solely for party political purposes, and that when the honourable member for Riverina made that statement yesterday, the Prime Minister interjected that it was too ridiculous to need contradiction. Notwithstanding that reply, I repeat that the agreement was made for party purposes.",37
143,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does not the honourable member add to the absurdity of the statement by repeating it?,37
144,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If its repetition appeals to the honourable member for Indi as an absurdity, then I must be on safe ground. Let us see what was said by the Argusthe principal press supporter of the present Government and of the agreement made at the Premiers' Conference. Or. the 14th August last, it wroteI f an amendment of the Constitution is required it must be put before the electors or referred at the Federal election in March. The advantage of such a proposition to the Federal Ministry is manifest. Mr Deakin will be assured of the support of the State Premiers in his stern fight with the Labour party. The whole influence of the Premiers in the States will be used in favour of Mr Deakin, as on his continuance in power will depend the permanency of the arrangement. Again, on 19th August, the Argus made this important statementThe Prime Minister thinks the political is even more important' than the financial one. I do not know whether the Argus was in the Prime Minister's confidence, but that was its opinion of what he thought was the most important factor in regard to making of the agreement. Does it not justify the statement made by the honorAt able' member for Riverina yesterday, repeated by me today, that the agreement has been made wholly and solely for party political purposes? On another occasion, the Argus wroteIssues not merely financial, but of political import, hang upon the Conference. A failure on the part of the Commonwealth representatives to accept reasonable offers may be held to prove the failure of the FusionAustralia was not to be considered. There was only one consideration, and that was the saving of the Fusionand may result in dividing the House of Representatives once more into its three warring and practically helpless parties. This would send the House to the people to fight n threecornered fight, to the great advantage of the Labour-Social ists. There, again, we have the strongest possible reference to party political considerations. As showing that the statement was made not accidentally, but deliberately, I would point out that, on the 20th August, the Argus also wrote- * The agreement was drafted and drawn out ready for signature. It provides Mr Deakin with a definite something to fight for at the March elections, and it assures him and the Federal partyIt is little short of impudence to describe the Government party as the Federal partythe support of the State Premiers. There, again, we have the statement that all that was. required to be secured was support for the Fusion Government. The assumption that the whole of the Ministerial party, who had been absolutely ignored in the making of this agreement, would blindly follow whatever the three representatives of the Commonwealth Government chose to agree to at the Conference was certainly very cool. The members of the Ministerial party are not children. There are amongst them men of undoubted independence and ability, but the Argus assumed that they would adopt whatever the representatives of the Commonwealth agreed to.",37
145,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Argus wrote some very nice things concerning the honourable factor member when he was a candidate for the Senate.,37
146,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was nine years ago. I have no desire to go into ancient history, the but, at the same time, I do not wish an erroneous statement to appear in Hansard. the first Federal election, the Argus and selected me as one of its candidates for the Senate as a compliment to the Australian Natives' Association, than which no - bodv had done more to bring about the - Federation. It selected me in such a way serious that it compromised neither its own poli result of the tics'I views nor mine.",37
147,Mr TILLEY BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's views would not be material.,38
148,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has never had any political views of any significance. It is unfortunate that I should have to refer to something that occurred years ago, but I do not wish to do an injustice to any one, or to place any newspaper in a false position. I was selected on the occasion in question as a candidate for the Senate without approaching or being approached by any one. The representatives of the Commonwealth Government entered the Conference presumably to carry out the policy which they, as responsible Ministers, had placed before Parliament in their Ministerial statement; and, no doubt, they had a perfect right to expect that if they made an agreement in accordance with that policy it would be supported by their party. The Argus went so far as to say at the time that it would be the first occasion on which Commonwealth Ministers had attended a Conference of State Premiers knowing that they had behind them a majority which would carry out the agreement at which they arrived. That newspaper evidently assumed that an agreement would be made in the terms of the.Fusion party's compact and the Ministerial programme. As bearing on that point, let me quote a statement which appeared in the Argus on 17th August lastThere is no reason why this Conference should not agree to a division of the Excise revenue which will provide for the needs of both States and Commonwealth, but which might be regarded as experimental for the years following the next general election. with such modifications as experience might suggest, it could be embodied in the Constitution. Evidently the Argus thought, as every else did, that that would be the basis the agreement when it declared that it would be.the first occasion on which Combrought monwealth Ministers had attended a ference of State Premiers with a majority behind them, which they had every reason to believe would carry out the agreement made. All this has been scattered to the winds. And where? At a secret Conferleader ence. The sittings of the Federal Conand vention were open to the public, and HanStates? sard reports of the proceedings were lished, setting forth the reasons-many which I have quoted today-which led members of' the Convention to arrive a't their-conclusions in regard to the financial £)csition of the Commonwealth. Hansard reports of previous Conferences of Premiers were also published, and representatives of the Commonwealth at those Conferences insisted that the Commonwealth should refuse to part with the powers conferred upon it. At the Brisbane Conference, the Treasurer scorned the suggestion that the proposed agreement should be inserted in the Constitution. He saidNo, it - was decided by the votes of the people of Australia that this shall be the Constitution. And it would be a strange idea for the Parliament of Australia to say to the people "" We are not competent to handle the great power you have given to us, and we want you to take it back and hold it again. Hold it for us so that we shall not do any mischief with it. We also represent the same people and the same electors."" We the Commonwealth Parliament, say, "" Take back this power. We are not worthy to hold it, and we are not worthy to do justice in the way you desire."" The right honourable gentleman then thought it would be monstrous to hand back this power to the people. List night, he twitted the honourable member for Hume with having been a great State leader at the Convention, and asked, "" Where was he now?"" I interjected, . "" On the National side."" The Treasurer at the Convention was a great Nationalist leader, but where is he today? What a fall, my countrymen ! He has drifted and drifted, until now he is prepared to take up a position which he scouted, not on one occasion, but on many, at the Brisbane Conference.",38
149,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is only the honorCustoms and - able member's opinion.,38
150,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have quoted the Treathree surer's own words, and it is for honorThen, able members to judge for themselves what his position is today. The representatives of the Commonwealth Ministry entered the Conference of Premiers, and performed a one somersault in secret. We have not been of favoured with, nor shall we ever have an opportunity of hearing, the reasons that about the change of front on their Conpart. What was it that made the Prime Minister enter the Conference as a great National leader and come out as a State Rights supporter? What made the Treasurer enter that Conference as a National of eight or nine years' standing, leave it as a humble servant of the It would certainly be interesting pubto learn the reasons for the change. The of arguments that brought it about must the have been new, because every effort to induce the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to take up this stand on former occasions failed - Neither honourable member has told the House why he was induced to accept this agreement, and, as I have said, both must have been led to do so by political considerations. The Argus has declared that the Prime Minister thought that the political factor was of more importance than the financial one, and that was undoubtedly the only reason that could have induced him to do.what he has done. He has thrown over every one. He has thrown over his own party for some reason which has not been disclosed, but we are told that political considerations prevailed with him, and that this agreement is designed to assure the Prime Minister and his party, at the next general election, the support of the State Premiers in their stern fight against the Labour party. Who is making this a party question? Who, for the first time, has dragged it down from being a great issue to a mere party question, in which the ins and outs of this House are to be the primary, and the country a secondary, consideration? This House has not treated it as a party question, and I venture, to say that honourable members do not intend to treat it as such. We have had honourable members on both sides of the House taking different views, and honourable members in direct Opposition have not, in any of their speeches, made the matter a party one. Similarly, neither the honourable member for Mernda nor the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Parkes nor the honourable member for Balaclava, has made it a party question. They have risen above all parties, and so should we. What does the life or death of any political party in this House, or in the country, matter, if the country is to be shackled ? I have been all my life a strong Liberal and a strong Protectionist, but what is the good of the triumph of Liberalism or Protection if, when it gets into power, it finds itself shackled, and can do nothing? What will its victory avail if it is in a Parliament which has practically no power- a Parliament which has lost its supremacy, the power of the purse, which, as the Prime Minister said, is the object of the great struggle now in progress - a Parliament whose members are net the chief rulers, because they do not possess the money? What will be the good of such a position, whatever Ministry may be in power? Is not this a matter in dealing with which, on the present occasion, we ought to rise altogether above all the parties in this House? I have been as strong a party man as there is in this Chamber, but I say emphatically that in this - great contest of' National interests and State Rights I put all parties aside. I am prepared to work with any man, no matter where he sits, so long as he is a Nationalist. The honourable member for Wide Bay remarked that the agreement had been brought about by a combination, and that it would probably have to be defeated by another combination. I welcome those words, and hope that they are prophetic of the future. It seems to me that if this fight is to take place the present division of parties in the House must be scattered to the winds, and we must go to the country on the great issue of Nationalism versus State Rights. There is no issue upon which I would go more gladly to the country, or more gladly fight upon. I am prepared to work in that fight side by side with the honourable member for Mernda, the honourable member for Parkes, and the honourable member for Flinders, and any others on that side of the House, and also with every member on this side who is of the same way of thinking.  would be!",38
151,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should be prepared to fight with them until this great national question had been fought out. It would, indeed, be a noble fusion- a fusion founded, not for the sake of office, or for a party advantage, or for the purpose of dishing another party in this House, but for the purpose of establishing once and for all in this Federation the paramountcy of the National Parliament. When it had achieved that purpose, it could cease to exist. Whether it lasted a leng or short time it would last, I - hope, until the victory was won, and from that point of view the shorter the time it lasted the better. If I had my way, such a fusion would hold together until the fight was won, and then would break up into its component parts, when each man would be entitled to hold, without any reflection on his colleagues, the individual opinions which he holds now on other subjects. I take up the position that was taken up at the Convention, and* has always been maintained until this year by Commonwealth Governments-that the questions of the transfer of the State debts and of a contribution by the Commonwealth to the State revenues are bound inseparably together, and must be settled at one and the same time. I was asked, as a supporter of the last Deakin Government, to accept the scheme that they put forward, founded as it was upon the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. His was a business-like proposal, framed and put forward by a financier as a financier. It was just to the Commonwealth and to the States, and was prepared without any consideration of the interests of either Ministry or Opposition. It. was the effort of a man who knew what he was doing. He started from a sound commercial basis, and his scheme could stand any criticism that could be brought to bear upon it. I was expected, and was ready, to accept that scheme as a supporter of the last Deakin Government. I took the trouble, during the last recess the one before, to explain it and extol it on many platforms. I asked the people to think over'it, and to express their approval of it, but now I am asked by the same Prime Minister, who has thrown that.scheme into the waste-paper basket, to abandon every item in it, and take up this miserable political agreement, which propores to put into the Constitution for all time a per capita arrangement that will operate increasingly to our detriment. Every industry that we build up as the result of our Protective Tariff will reduce importations. Every man we induce to come to this country to enter into those industries, by virtue of our Protective Tariff, will be an extra burden on the Commonwealth to the extent of 25s. per annum, and the result of any successful Protective Tariff will, therefore, be to hit the Commonwealth on both sides, because it will lose its revenue and have its expenditure increased. We can get as great a revenue as we like, if we choose to spoil the protective incidence of the Tariff, or to load it with revenue duties in addition to protective duties. The business-like course for us to adopt is to take up again the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. He showed us haw it would fit into the 25s. per head proposal. He pointed out the difference between his original scheme and that put forward by the honourable member for Hume when Treasurer of the last Deakin Government, the latter extending the number of years in which the contributions should be made by the Commonwealth to the States, and making other variations which did not, however, affect the principle. He showed how the 25s. per head contribution, if continued until the population reached a little Mr Wise. over 7,000,000, would amount to the total interest on the State debts, and proved that, with the present rate of increase of population, that point would be reached at just about the same period as was aimed at in the Lyne-Deakin scheme. That is my scheme. It is the scheme I support, and I am satisfied that every business man in the House will support it also,- if he is allowed to have a free hand and to exercise his individual judgment. Honourable members must remember that that scheme was not put forward as a party proposal. It was formulated by a financial man of no mean standing, wholly and solely for the purpose of settling the problem for ever on a financial basis, and of and doing justice to Commonwealth and States alike. Carry out that scheme, and you have finality, as the Minister of External Affairs said at Toowoomba in the presence of the Prime Minister. That honourable gentleman called it ' the Deakin 1 Government's scheme "" at that time, and declared that it would, if adopted, put an end to all the existing friction and trouble- a consummation which is absolutely necessary in the interests of the progress of Australia and of the proper paramountcy of the National Parliament. It is well to repeat, as the honourable member for Mernda pointed out, that his scheme did no injustice to the States. I have been sorry to hear honourable members say, by way of interjection, even after the honourable member for Mernda spoke the other night, that his scheme would injure the States. I do not know whether those honourable members heard the honourable member for Mernda. I have already referred to their magnificent attendances when that speech, and the speeches of the honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes were being made. I might even add to those the speech of the honourable member for Balaclava today. He was honoured, when speaking, with the presence of about eight Ministerialists, and for a quarter of an hour there was not even a Minister in the chamber. The honourable member for Mernda pointed out that the States will not be deprived of revenue if their debts are taken over. Mr .JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member is making a great mistake. I do not think that at any time all the Ministers were absent from the chamber when the honourable member for Balaclava was speaking.",39
152,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know how the Minister of Defence can contradict me, seeing that he was not in the chamber at the time.",41
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was in the chamber during nearly the whole of that speech.,41
154,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I assert emphatically and deliberately that the Postmaster-General, who was in charge of the Chamber this morning, went out, and was away for at least a quarter of an hour before his place was taken by the Minister of External affairs. I challenge the Minister of Defence, or anybody else, to contradict that statement.",41
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is incorrect.,41
156,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That assertion shows how little value can be placed on the interjections of the Minister of Defence. I have often paid considerable attention to interjections by him to the effect that certain statements were incorrect, because I assumed that he was speaking with knowledge, but in the future I shall attach no weight to any assertion of that character coming from him. The honourable member for Mernda showed clearly that it is not correct to say that the States require the money it is proposed to give them to carry on their vast and expensive works, because all the money that they have received up to the present from the Commonwealth has not been sufficient to paj the interest on their debts. If we take over the debts, and apply the money towards the interest,- the States will be no worse off than they are at present. They will have all the rest of their revenue, as they have now, to carry on their developmental works. The interesting balance-sheet prepared by the honourable member for Mernda, and incorporated in Hansard, shows clearly and emphatically, and beyond dispute, that the States have had no money from the Commonwealth that they could apply to developmental works, because it has all gone to pay the interest on the debts. Not even the Minister of Defence would dare to assert that that balance-sheet is incorrect-and that is saying a great deal.",41
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a most insulting innuendo.,41
158,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I hope that no attempt will be made by the Government to place any of its supporters in a false position in regard to this matter, but that they will be left free to do what they think best in the interests of Australia.",41
159,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member seems to assume that the supporters of the Government do not consider themselves free.,41
160,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I assume so because the strong appeals which have been made by Ministerialists have received no recognition from the Prime Minister. He has not even given a nod of his head, though one of them thought that he did on one occasion. It should be realized that the matter in hand is of infinitely greater importance than the interests of parties. What would - be the loss of our seats at the next election compared with the injury which would be done to Australia by shackling this Parliament? Leg-roping is too weak a word. A leg rope may be broken, but it would take a revolution to break these shackles. Why should we store up trouble for those who are to come after us ? I have never known a responsibility so great as that which now rests on honourable members. The proposed arrangement is not to be for a day only. We cannot say, "" It will see us through, and, ' after us, the Deluge.' "" The settlement will affect those who follow us. Few of us who voted for Federation hope to see the full accomplishment of the benefits of that step. We voted for it because we thought that it would result in good to Australia. When we become a population of 20,000,000, in the time spoken of by the honourable member for Mernda, what wil] be the position of the Commonwealth if it has to raise ,£25,000,000 for the Governments of the States to spend without the odium and trouble of taxing their people? How will the Commonwealth develop the Northern Territory, construct its railways, and provide for, not merely the conservation of water for irrigation, but also for its supply to such places as the Tanami gold-fields?",41
161,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the Commonwealth been asked to give a water supply to that gold-field ?,41
162,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think it necessary to take notice of a frivolous interjection by one who has not the faintest idea of the seriousness and importance of the question which is being discussed.,41
163,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To talk about giving a water supply to Tanami is frivolous enough.,41
164,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is what was said by those who opposed the Treasurer's action in giving a water supply to Coolgardie. No doubt, when water supplies are needed in the future for places in the Northern Territory, he will, if in power, be one of the first to say, "" Let them be given.""",41
165,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Muc h of the Northern Territory will be of little use without a water supply.,42
166,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly. Central Australia will be useless unless supplied with water. How can the Commonwealth undertake these works if it is shackled in way proposed? Once the proposed agreement is put into the Constitution, it will require almost a revolution to take it out again. We have no right, in the interests of party, to create such trouble for the future. I hope that the Prime Minister will respond to the appeals which have been made to him, not by children, but by men who have held high positions in the Parliaments of their States, and who knew the weight of their words. They cannot be told to take back their words or put the Government out of office. No vote on this question would do that. It is necessary to have an Opposition willing to take office in order to dislodge a Ministry. The members of the Opposition have not made this a party question, each of them being free to vote as he thinks proper regarding it. The scheme can be defeated by the Opposition only with the assistance of Ministerialists, and such a combination would not be formed for the purpose of getting office. Ministers should either take back their proposal, or ask the country what it thinks of their action. I have already said that I would approve of the adoption of the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, or, to give it its later name, of the Deakin-Lyne scheme, as a permanent settlement. That scheme should have been put forward by this Ministry, seeing that it has such a strong following. As another scheme has been proposed, I ask the Government to remember the Fusion agreement, its declaration on this subject in its policy statement, the situation outlined in the letters of the Prime Minister to the Premier of New South Wales, and the suggestion of the Argus for an interim agreement for three years.",42
167,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thre e years?,42
168,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like that term to be fixed, because it would force the next Parliament to settle the matter. longer we delay making a permanent settlement, the greater will be the trouble.  now opposing a permanent settlement.",42
169,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government proposal does not affect the State debts at all, and the financial question cannot be settled without providing for the taking over of the debts. It is significant that there are to be two referenda. When the Treasurer was asked last night why this is proposed, he said, "" We wish to give the people greater latitude. They may vote for one the proposal and reject the other."" They are really being invited to do that. The Premiers, in the political dark hole of Calcutta in which they conferred with the Prime Minister, promised to support the Fusion party and the agreement which is now being discussed, but they were prepared to allow the proposal relating to the debts to look after itself. Why approach the States in regard to these matters? It would be well to obtain a harmonious settlement, if possible, but the Constitution has imposed upon this Parliament the duty of coming to a determination. The people accepted the Constitution on the advice of the Premiers of the day. As the Treasurer said at one of the Conferences, this Parliament represents the same people as do the State Parliaments, and if our legislation seems to prejudice their interests, they can remedy their grievances at the ballot-box. Therefore, we should accept our constitutional responsibility. As a permanent settlement cannot be made now, let us adopt an interim agreement. As I have said, I should like that interim agreement to be for three years, but, for the sake of peace, I would vote for an agreement for five years. That period, however, would be long enough. Nothing would be gained by adopting a period of fifteen or twenty years. There are difficulties surrounding the settlement of this question, and the ship of State ma) be in a dangerous position, but I say- In spite of rock and tempest roar, In spite of false lights on the shore, Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea, Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our fears, Our faith triumphant o'er our fears Are all with the, are all with the.",42
170,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Robertson) [8.28] - The appeal of the honourable member for Gippsland to the House not to make this a party question is opportune, inasmuch as many members seem so to regard it. The Prime Minister, when speakThe ing to the motion, said that it "" leaves the fate of the Ministry unaffected,"" and told us later that "" if we are not honestly convinced that this is the best and the wisest scheme, it is our duty to say so."" I feel it my duty to say that this is not the best, wisest, or most equitable scheme which could be propounded by any Government or any Parliament. I say "" by any Parliament "" because 1 think that Parliament"" should be taken into its confidence by a Government in regard to any agreement which is to last for fifty or sixty years. I _ was in favour of the last Conference, although 1 disapproved of all previous ones. My view has been that the. Commonwealth Government should make known its financial policy to the Sitates, and that they should arrange for their financial needs accordingly. The Prime Minister, in conferring with the Premiers of the States on this occasion, had one or two difficulties to face. His Government was confronted with a deficit of ,£1,200,000, proposed to be met by the issue of short-dated 'bills, Treasury bonds, or an arrangement with the States. When speaking on the Budget, I said that it was unsound to provide for the payment of old-age pensions with borrowed money, but that I thought that . if the Premiers were approached, they would be willing to make provision for the - expenditure, seeing that three of the States would be relieved of their obligations in this respect, while the other three would obtain pensions for their citizens much sooner , than could otherwise be arranged for. The Minister of Defence scouted the idea, ,but I am happy to say that the timely suggestion was acted on, and the Government have the promise of the States to find ,£600,000 this year for the payment of old-age pensions. The Prime Minister was confronted with the further fact that next year he will be short £1,000,000; and although this was referred-to by the honourable gentleman himself, it has not, so far, been mentioned in this debate. There has to be provided ,£1,600,000 in order to keep faith with the poor old people, who have claims on our resources quite as great % : as those of our public servants. But the Prime Minister, having stated his requirements to the Premiers, said there must be some definite arrangement, so that the Commonwealth should be able to pay what was required from its own resources, and . not be subject to the whims of the States, who might give grudgingly. He told the States that he would require .£3,100,000 for _the future in order to keep .faith in regard to the administration of old-age pensions, lighthouses, and quarantine ; and provision is made under the agree- ment to that end. No preparation, however, has been made for future payments under the naval agreement; and on this point we have yet to hear a good deal. The Prime Minister, having made these facts clear to the Premiers, practically threw his proposals on the table and said, "" You may divide the balance amongst yourselves."" The Premier of Western Australia said that the condition on which that State would find a proportion of the £1,600,000 was the payment to it of ,£3,250,000-the capitalized sum of £250,000 per annum, to be liquidated at the rate of ,£10,000 a year. Those States which had not Old-age PensionsActs declined to contribute as much as those States which have, although it was felt incumbent on all the States to make provision for the aged poor. Here we see the States grabbing as much as possible; and the State of New Sotuh. Wales has been called upon to pay all the money demanded by the other States. I do not regard this - as a fiscal question, but as a financial question pure and simple. The Prime Minister put the matter very fairly; and, therefore, I cannot understand honourable members devoting so much attention to statistics relating to the raising of revenue tnrough the Customs. The honourable gentleman said that we have the Tariff in our own hands, subject to no conditions and no deductions'-that it is for us, when need arises, to make the Tariff more Protective or more revenue-producing.",42
171,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is our position now, but if we adopt the agreement we shall not have the same liberty.",43
172,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We shall have just as much liberty whatever agreement may be adopted; and there is no doubt we shall have to alter the Tariff before very long. The Prime Minister said that, as duties that are Protective become effective, the returns from them will decline, and that the Tariff will be adapted and readapted to the needs of the industries of the country. That is the Protectionists' contention, and it is sound from their point of view. If it is necessary to raise more money, says the honourable gentleman, we may do so, and in this connection we have only to consult history and to see what was done in New South Wales. In that State the wage earners were relieved of taxation amounting to ,£800,000 a year, while the burden was placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear if. If we desire a Protectionist Tariff we can have one, and in the same Tariff enormous sums of money may be raised on manufactures which do not receive Protection. That position the Prime Minister put very clearly and tersely before the House; but when the honourable gentleman told the States that they could do what they liked with the balance, so long as the Commonwealth received £3,100,000,' I think he acted most unfairly to the State of New South Wales, which was at the mercy of the ""majority. The Premier of New South Wales, when he returned from the Conference, said that his State would lose .£[660,000 a year under the scheme, according to which Western Australia is to be paid the capitalized sum of £[3,250,000-that , as a matter of fact, New South Wales will have to pay £40,000 a year of this sum which, according to the Premier, will increase her loss to ,£700,000 a year, although, according to . the Minister, that State will lose .£1,066,519 a year. A remarkable feature is that Victoria will lose but £[370,053 a year, although the difference between the population of the two States is not great. When we entered Federation, the price arranged upon was the retention by the Commonwealth Government of one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue.",43
173,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For ten years only.,44
174,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"--That was the price of Federation-the cost of starting and lubricating the machinery-to say nothing of the services taken over. The Commonwealth really gets nothing excessive; and what we do is to pay for the services which otherwise would have to be conducted by the. States themselves. The States suffer no loss collectively by our ing over the services; some of them may lose more than their proportion, but one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue is the price of Federation, and it is the balance of the three-fourths with which we have to deal and not with the one-fourth. The operation of the Braddon section will terminate shortly; and, with that in view, bookkeeping statistics have been in preparation at the borders for a number of years. It is most unsatisfactory that bookkeeping should be necessary for a longer period than that provided in the Constitution; but the collection of statistics, made at enormous expense, should not go for nothing; the available data should be utilized in the interests of the States rather than thrown aside, as was done when the Conference took place. Whilst the Prime Minister will £ ^3> 7°>945 under, what is called the et 1 Melbourne agreement, that will not carry him far, because next year he will require ,£1,000,000, which will have to be'debited to the year following, seeing that it is anticipatory. That money will have to be deducted in the second year from now, when the balance available to the Prime Minister will be £2,100,000-indeed , rather less than £[2,000,000, considering that he has to pay the State of Western Australia a large sum annually for twenty-five years. If an accident happens at the elections, the new Parliament will be confronted with the possibility of having to pay invalid pen- sions.  able member regard as an ""accident""?",44
175,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall show Prime where the accident may be. I refer to the defeat of the Government. If t'he payment of those pensions be decided upon by a mere stroke of the pen, the Prime Minister, or his successor, will have lost all the advantages he sought from the Premiers at the Conference, and his balance will have gone. As to the interjection by the honourable member for Grey, I may say that the stroke of the pen is not an accident, but the deliberate act of the Governor General on the advice of his Ministers.  ""accident"" at the general election.",44
176,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The late Government advised that old-age pensions should become payable, though there was no money available; and I think that it was, politically, most immoral to gazette 1 the payment when the money was not protak- vided. It has landed us in a deficit of £[1,200,000; but the same thing may be done again, and with some excuse, inasmuch as invalid pensions are authorized in an Act deliberately passed with the approval of all sections of the House, and funds may be obtainable. I , personally, am in favour of bringing that part of the Act into operation as soon as we have the money. If it is said that we have not at our disposal the necessary funds and cannot obtain them the 'Act should be repealed. We should not pass a measure unless we intend to give effect to it. If at the next general election the Labour party were returned with a majority they would take steps immediately to bring the Act into operation, assuming that the necessary funds were available; but if they were routed, as in all probability they will be  thought. There will be a lot of Labour men in this House after the honourable member has ceased to be a member of it.",44
177,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall not be here for all time. I desire to deal fairly with this question. Some of the greatest parties in Great Britain have been from time to time routed at the polls. That has been the experience both of the Liberal party and the Conservative party in England, and the Labour party here may be routed at the next general election. If they are, more good will have been done for Australia than would be effected by the people in returning them in a majority. Tf they are returned in a minority a reaction in Labour and Socialist circles will at once take place, and the moderates of the Labour party will probably seek an alliance with the advanced Liberals on this side of the House. No more advanced Liberal than the Prime Minister could be found. In that respect he is far ahead of most of his colleagues, and I think that the moderate section of the Labour party - I exclude, of course, the Socialists who - would nationalize the sources of production, distribution, and exchange-coul d form an alliance with him. When the Labour Ministry was defeated the London Times stated that such an alliance as I have indicated should be brought about, and I am not quite certain that any great harm would follow from it. The extremists would certainly be curbed. In' passing, I may say that it is well to have extremists on both sides. The Prime Minister himself is an extremist, and will keep his Ministry well up to the mark. There are - advanced Liberals on this side of the House just as' there are among the Opposition honourable members who, although unconscious of the fact, are Conservatives. Some of the State Premiers who met in Conference and drew up this agreement had not the confidence of their respective Parliaments nor of the electors. The Queensland Premier, for instance, had a majority of one, and immediately after endorsing an agreement which would tie up the Commonwealth for all time he returned to Brisbane and asked the Governor to grant him a dissolution. Having learned from an influential source that he could obtain a dissolution he asked for it, the request was granted, and he has gone to the country in the hope of securing a majority that will enable his Government to carry on. Then, again, the Government of South Australia has a majority of only one, which may disappear at any moment. Surely Ministers so situated are not competent to make an agreement such as that now before us. The Federal Parliament represents the people, and to it belongs the duty of drawing up financial proposals for submission to the electors. The question is not one upon which a Government should be brought into existence or turned out of office. It should be our duty to frame a fair proposition for submission to the people, and, having done so, we should call upon them to support it. We certainly ought not to ask them to support an unjust scheme which has in it the elements of robbery. Tasmania is most anxious that this agreement shall remain in force for all time. The people of that State have gained more from Federation than have the people of any other State of the Union.",45
178,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is mistaken.,45
179,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that it will be said that, as the result of Federation, New South Wales and Victoria have gained a largely increased trade with Tasmania, but the question should not be viewed from that stand-point alone. What we have to consider is the way in which the masses of the people have been affected. 1I have the authority of the honourable member for Denison, whom we all respect and revere, for the statement that the masses of the people of Tasmania who do not use intoxicants or narcotics are not called upon to contribute, to the cost of government, more than 135. per head by way of Customs duties. That is something over which we may well rejoice. To provide more for the cost of government, Tasmania has resorted to direct taxation, and has placed the burden upon those who are able to bear it. Those who have gained wealth by reason of the progress of Australia and industry of the masses are called upon by means of a land tax and an income tax to contribute to the cost of government a proportion which they were not formerly called upon to bear.",45
180,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Tasmanian income tax starts at £100. There is not much wealth about that.,45
181,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Franklin last night made an appeal to the House on behalf of the "" fat men "" of Tasmania. "" Will you take more money out of the pockets of the fat men of Tasmania? Should we not rather take it out of the pockets of the poor?"" was the burden of his plea.",45
182,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did not say that.,46
183,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was the effect of his statement. When Federation was being advocated some of the principal leaders in the movement declared that if it were brought about one State would not be called upon to pay the debts of another. Each State, it was said, would have to provide for the expenditure within its boundaries. Are we going now to pauperize Tasmania by handing to her money taken f 10m the larger States ? Are we, by means of taxation, to take money out of the pockets of the poor of the larger States so that the rich of Tasmania may not be called upon to pay that which they ought to do?",46
184,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is quite mistaken.,46
185,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why should we take out of the pockets of the poor of the larger States money to make good a deficiency in the nnances of Tasmania? The receipt of such assistance would be unworthy of Tasmania, and would mean breaking faith with the people of Australia, who were told that they would get for all time that which they, subscribed.",46
186,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Tasmani a has never asked for anything.,46
187,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is almost disgusting to hear honourable members first on one side of the House, and then on the other, clamouring for Tasmanian wants, and yet unprepared to agree to the expenditure of a shilling if it will have to be borne by that State. In the immediate past it contributed largely to the starvation of postal necessities and telephone proposals.",46
188,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tasmani a has the highest rate of direct taxation. Several honourable members' interjecting,",46
189,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask honourable members not to interrupt the honourable member for Robertson by suggestions or comments. They may be made at a later stage.,46
190,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can only provide honourable members with an argument; I cannot provide them with an understanding.,46
191,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the honourable member would provide the House with a few facts we should be satisfied.,46
192,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have supported my statement as to Tasmania having benefited by Federation by quoting the statement of the honourable member for Denison that the masses in that State who do not use intoxicants or narcotics contribute only 13s. per head to the Customs and Excise revenue.,46
193,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said that that was the contribution paid by the masses in Australia who did not use intoxicants or narcotics.,46
194,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A misunderstanding may have arisen as to the actual figures, but the position I take up is a sound one. Tasmania has a shortage and proposes to make it good by taxing the rich. If there was in operation there a Tariff as high as that which prevailed in Tasmania prior to Federation the rich would not be contributing to the cost of government as much as they do now, and the poor would be paying more. That being so, the poor people of Tasmania are better off under Federation than, they were before. That State has reached the position which New South Wales occupied when the right honourable member for East Sydney, as Premier, reduced the Customs burden on the people to the extent of .£800,000 per annum and called upon the rich to contribute more by way of direct taxation. The rich naturally groaned and were very disagreeable ; but that is always the position when direct taxation is resorted to. No Government worthy of the name would tax the poor. The most commendable form of legislation is that which taxes those who have instead of those who have not",46
195,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Lloyd-Georg e !,46
196,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think the honourable member will find that I have paraphrazed a Scriptural quotation. Possibly he means Henry George, who was a Single Taxer. He would not tax the poor, but he pointed out that the poor did not realise that they were being taxed by this form of indirect taxation. He likened it to plucking the goose without making it cry. He said that the poor were paying taxes on many things on their breakfast tables, although they did not know it, but the rich man knows when he is paying, and he cries. He uses his influence in such a way that few are able to withstand it. That is why the members representing Tasmania are always clamouring against expenditure. They know from the past that in their State the influence of the moneyed class is against expenditure, because it will lessen the amount of Customs duties returned to them. Tasmanian representatives are asking, not for 25s., but for 30s., per head. They want more, so that the rich shall less in taxation. They were against the Commonwealth keeping the surplus reand venue, because the rich would have to more. They are opposed to paying proportion of 3s. per head for old-age pensions. They say: "" No , let people in the large States of Victoria and New South Wales pay 3s. a head, but us pay 2S. If we pay 3s., the will have to pay more."" I hope that the representatives of Tasmania are now satismania fied with my position as regards their State.",46
197,Sir PHILIP FYSH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There should be no taxation without representation.,47
198,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That prinVictoria ciple was laid down by John Stuart Mill. That is why we have manhood suffrage; member is wrong. but what about a State which has overimported representation, as Tasmania has? cording to the Constitution, Tasmania must have not less than five representatives in this Chamber. Even if she had only half her present population, she would not have less than five members; but today she has Constitution. not sufficient population to entitle her five members in this Chamber upon the basis of the representation of New South Tasmania. Wales, Victoria, and other States of Union. Western Australia also came under that provision, but. she is gaining population, and possibly has now become entitled. Tasmania is over-represented in this Parliament, and yet she not only clamours for a voice in all legislation, but actually claims representation as State in the Government. She has in Senate six members who claim to cast' vote of equal value-with that of senators from Victoria or New South Wales. though New South Wales has nearly oneSouth Australia. third of the population of the Commonwealth, and, I suppose, nine times the population of Tasmania, she has no more senators than Tasmania has.

218,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am afraid that my honourable friend, who is advancing into the sere and yellow leaf, may not so much as he thinks he sees. I wish now to compare the Government scheme, what is called the Melbourne scheme, with my suggested arrangement. The estimonwealth mated population of the States is 4,435,000, and the amount payable to them in 1910-11 under the Melbourne scheme estimated at £5,668,750. The interest on the public debts of Australia is of £[8,839,695; and under the Melbourne agreement, if the whole of these debts transferred to the Commonwealth, it would be necessary for the States to make up deficiency of £[3,170,945. A contribution of 14s. 3d. per capita would give j Q s ^ & ^ ZI i the balance due to the States being £9115505, and to the Commonwealth £962,839. The cash value credited per annum to the States would be: To New South Wales, £516,090; to Victoria, £367,860; and to Western Australia, £[ 7<555 j while Queensland would have 2 to find £[549>476; South Australia, £321,223; and Tasmania, £[92,140. If the States were credited and debited with the sums respectively due to them, New South Wales would pay ,£668,085, not £1,066,519 as proposed (by the Melbourne £[370,053; Victoria, Queensland, £551,977, not ^£958,451, not £620,473, £[599)896 ; Western Australia, en- £ 3>345> not £[113,041; and Tasmania, lS of £228,940, not £137,403To sum up, New South Wales would gain under my scheme-as compared with the Melbourne to scheme-£398,434 ; while Victoria would value lose £[181,924; Queensland, £74,418; South Australia, £[20,577 ; Western Australia, £[7 >3 4; and Tasmania, £91,537. 0 0 Under the Melbourne agreement, the other States would benefit at the expense of New Wales. But under my scheme, which has a proper actuarial basis, and is not based on a mere rough and ready estimate, no State would get more nor less than its due, and justice would be done all round. Obviously it is not right to call upon of the New South Wales for the sum of £[1,066,519, and upon Victoria for only The difference between the the two. States does not to justify such an arrangement, nor does the difference between their 'public debts, aljudge though New South Wales has borrowed more than Victoria. The public debt of Queensland is very nearly as great as that of Victoria; and as every State should be called upon to pay the interest on its debts, Queensland must necessarily pay a very large sum. Under the Melbourne agreesee ment, however, no account is taken of the disparity between the indebtedness of the or States which is to be wiped out by the Commonwealth, ancl for which the Comwill become wholly responsible as loans are renewed or consolidated. My proposal, to which I invite attention, is will survive criticism. It is actuarially sound, being based on a capitalized value the amounts paid to the States in 1907-8. That is the date suggested in the Melwere bourne agreement, but any period would equally well serve for an instance in worka ing out my proposal."" The price to be paid for Federation is one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue; but, in regard to the balance, the States should have their just dues. The scheme of the honourable member for Mernda was shown by the criticism of Senator Pulsford to be unsound. When the latter wrote to the public press, the former replied that he would make an answer shortly, but he has not yet done so.",49
219,Mr HARPER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not write to the press at all on the subject.,50
220,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I refer the honourable gentleman to the Hansard report for last year for Senator Pulsford's criticism of his scheme. Senator Pulsford knocked the bottom out of the honourable member's scheme, showing that it was that of a novice who did not know what he was about, and was past the thinking out of a problem such as this. It was pathetic to see the honourable member for Mernda recently sitting at the table to assist the Prime Minister in the elucidation of his proposals.",50
221,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why has the honourable member for Robertson been so long in bringing forward his scheme?,50
222,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member consults Hansard of some years back he will find that I suggested a scheme for the consolidation of the States debts vastly superior, perhaps, in the minds of some people, to that which is so highly thought of by him. The proposal I now submit is an equitable one, based on the actual capitalized value of the sums paid to the States'in 1907-8, which are the starting point of the Melbourne agreement now under consideration. Under my scheme, the smaller States would not be pauperised, but would have the revenue from the debts assets, which represent hundreds of borrowed millions. The interest and the principal would be liquidated in something like, sixty years by a sinking fund; and the - Commonwealth would gain by the consolidation of the loans. What would the Commonwealth do with the money? Would the people sanction the dropping of the balance into the Yarra? The States would suffer nothing at the hands of the Commonwealth, because when we had money for which we had no use it would be our duty to pass it on to the States, who have the means of spending it? As an earnest of what the Commonwealth will do in the future r refer honourable members to the past. We have paid anything up to £6,000,000 to the States, without being called upon to do so, and we have paid it willingly, as I am sure we would again. The contribution of 14s. 3d. would be statutory; and I point out to the Prime Minister, who is now present, that, while he talks of giving the States 25s. per head, he, in the same breath, speaks of taking from them the former sum. Instead of conjuring with figures and mystifying the people, why not say at once that the States shall pay the Commonwealth 14s. 3d. per capita? It is not necessary to provide for the contribution in the Constitution, seeing that we represent the same people; and the arrangement would be re-adjustable, because, as soon as less than 14s. 3d. was necessary, so much less would be paid by the States. The Prime Minister said, on the authority of the Treasurer, that, covering a period of years, there would be a 'saving of .£26,000,000 by the consolidation of the public debts; and, if that be so, what would be done with those millions? They would, no doubt, be put to some legitimate purpose for the benefit of the States of the Union - There would be, under the consolidation gains, money enough and to spare for expanding requirements, so that more than 14s. 3d. would not be necessary. Under the Prime Minister's proposals we see that, in three years from the present date, if invalid pensions be brought into operation, he will be in the same position that he is in today-o n bedrock. The proposal to pay 25s. per head is unsound and unjust, inasmuch as it has no basis, and actuarially will not work to any just conclusion, start where we may. It is a haphazard arrangement- a mere tossing down on the table of the State Premiers so many millions of money and saying, "" Distribute that sum as you think fit."" At the Conference the majority carried the day; and then Western Australia ,said that she would require £3,250,000 spread over annual diminishing payments during a period of twenty-five years.",50
223,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ou t of her own contributions to the Commonwealth revenue.,50
224,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have heard of that argument before. It is said that the people of Western Australia pay more per head than do the people of the other States, and, consequently, are justified in asking for a greater return; but the Western Australian people had their cake and ate it.",50
225,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We do not ask for the whole of the cake back.,50
226,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I beg to draw attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],50
227,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Perth infers that special provision should be made for Western Australia, because the people of that State pay more per head in Customs and Excise. But the reason for the increased sum per head is that the State contains a larger adult male population than does, say, the State of Victoria, and, therefore, more dutiable goods are consumed.",51
228,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And it must not be forgotten that £1,000 a day is sent from Western Australia through the Money Order Office.",51
229,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the adult males from Victoria had taken their wives and babies with them to Western Australia, the rate in Victoria would have been higher per head, and that in Western Australia lower, seeing that every infant would be considerfed in estimating the population. When I visited Western Australia, the party included the Prime Minister, the Treasurer- "" The Emperor of the West"""" - and Senator Trenwith, and wherever we went the last-mentioned was greeted by the Victorians there as an old friend; and the interjection of. the honourable member for Fremantle only shows what a great number of the Western Australian wage-earners are from Victoria.",51
230,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Western Australian people only ask for a part of what they have paid.,51
231,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r my proposal Western Australia would be given justice; she would be credited with all the revenue paid through the Customs, and no debit made on account of the families left in the eastern Slates. The Prime Minister urged with much force that we should trust the people, and declared that, on the face of it, his proposal ought to be supported by the House, since it is one which will be decided, not by this Parliament, but by the people themselves. He seemed to think that we should display weakness in refusing to allow the agreement in its present form to be submitted to the people. But the reason why we think that it should not be sent to the people in a form which may subsequently be found to be unjust and unsound is that if it were once embodied in the Constitution, it would not be easy if desired by the majority of the electors, to take it out. It could be eliminated from the Constitution only by the will of a majority of the people, in a majority of the States of the Commonwealth. When the larger States reached a stage of development at which the burden cast upon them by this agreement would be far more ""oppressive than it would be at the present time, they would clamour for an amendment of the Constitution, but the smaller States, representing a minority of the people of the Commonwealth, could prevent that amendment being made. South Australia is one of the largest in territory, but from the stand-point of population she is only a small State, and with Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, representing only one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, could prevent effect being given to. the will of the remaining two-thirds in New South Wales and Victoria. It is for that reason that I and others object to the agreement providing for the return to the States for all time of 25s. per head of the population being inserted in the Constitution. The smaller States, like Oliver Twist, ask for more.",51
232,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And of course poor New South Wales is the milch cow of the Commonwealth.,51
233,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I defy the honourable member to prove that she is not.,51
234,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sh e would not enter the Federation until she was squared by the gift of the Federal Capital.,51
235,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And even in that respect, the Federal Parliament has not kept faith with her. Justice must be done to New South Wales. I have done some "" stumping "" in that State in regard to this agreement, and have had with me every meeting that I have addressed on the subject. I have also received letters stating that I have improved my position in my electorate by my expounding the falseness of this scheme. I am surprised that the honourable member for Mernda should be a party to a scheme by which New South Wales, whose population is comparatively little in excess of that pf Victoria, would be called upon to pay £[696,466 per annum more than would, that State. I am sure that the people of Victoria, if the position were properly explained to them, would be prepared to do what is fair; ancl I appeal to the Prime Minister to place before the Premiers an equitable scheme. The people of New South Wales will expect him, as the mouthpiece of this Parliament, to propound a scheme which has not in it the element of unfairness; a scheme that will not permit the impecunious States to rob the wealthy State of New South Wales, a scheme that will not allow Tasmania to receive large sums of money, drawn from the masses of the people in the larger States, in order that it may avoid taxing the wealthy members of its community. I hope that no one will be so imposed upon as to be led to believe that the scheme propounded by the honourable member for Mernda is a sound one. The Prime Minister, in speaking well of it, can only be patronizing the honourable member. The Treasury officials will tell honourable members that it is unsound and does not provide for justice being done to the larger States. A concise scheme should be submitted, to the State Premiers for acceptance and the payment made statutory. There should be no tinkering with the Constitution. There should, of course, be a referendum to provide for the taking over of the debts of the States which have accumulated since the establishment of Federation, but an arrangement with the States by which the Commonwealth would be indemnified to the extent of 14s. 3d. per head of the population would be but statutory. That would prevent any shortage in the future. Under the agreement now before us, however, the Commonwealth would be faced with a deficit. Invalid pensions must be paid or the provision repealed. As a member of a previous Government, the Prime Minister favoured the payment of invalid pensions, and I pin my faith to him. I believe that he is both progressive and sincere, and that .part of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, which provides for the payment of invalid pensions, must either be repealed or honoured. If it is honoured, then, even under the scheme now submitted to us by the Government, we shall have a shortage in the finances of the Commonwealth when proposed obligations are assumed. Under the arrangement that I suggest, however, there would not and could not be a deficiency, and justice would be done to the States. Every pound taken from the States would be used by the Commonwealth in liquidating the cost of a service which would otherwise be a charge upon them. We are one people with one destiny. . . Sail on, O ship of State! Sail on, O union strong and great ! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate '",51
236,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wakefield) monwealth, [9-57]-- I rise to address myself to the ject under discussion with a great deal of diffidence, because, in the first place, I have not yet become properly acclimatised in the atmosphere of the House, and consequently feel a little nervous; while, in the second place, I recognise the far-reaching importance of the question before us. It is undoubtedly greater than any other question that has engaged the attention of the Federal Parliament. The lucid and illuminating exposition of the financial position given by the Prime Minister has, in my opinion, raised Federation immeasurably in the public estimation. It has kindled hope and expectation in the minds of many people who were fearful lest with the cessation of the operation of the Braddon clause, there should be eliminated altogether from the Constitution that protection which it afforded the States, and without which there could have been no Federation. I have listened with very great interest to the analytical . and instructive speeches of the honourable member for Mernda, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable member for Parkes. I readily admit that their criticism demands our most earnest and careful attention, because of the authority with which they speak on financial questions; but I cannot by any means accept their conclusions. I wish particularly to congratulate the honourable member for North Sydney upon his magnificent, practical and forcible address on this question. That speech came from an honourable member who enjoys the confidence of every member on both sides of the House. It was entirely free from party bias or party considerations, and was similar to a statement which he made to the public press of Sydney many months ago before any idea of the combination which resulted in the Fusion on this side of the House was entertained at all. I congratulate my honourable friend all the more, because he voiced exactly my opinions on the matter, and I feel that his splendid speech will be highly appreciated throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. I range myself by his side and intend to follow him in support of the agreement entirely as it stands. We have had a good many policies propounded during the debate^ but there can be only one agreement, and I stand with the honourable member for North Sydney in his support of that submitted by the Government, because it is the best solution yet offered of the difficulty. I believe that throughout the Comand particularly in the producsubing districts, it is catching on. It is going to be an extremely popular policy, because it meets pressing needs and breathes the true spirit of nationhood, in spite of what many professed Nationalists may say to the contrary. A good many of those who use the high sounding title of ""Nationalist"" were at one time, it should be remembered, anti-Federalists liyht up to the hilt, and there is, therefore-, every reason to accept their present dev.l a ration of faith with a considerable amount of suspicion. The Braddon section U pretty well understood by the people from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and is particularly understood by Mio ptnducers, at all events in South Australia, I believe the farmers are more interested in the Braddon section than they are in anything else outside the Bible. If you speak to them about politics, they are bound in nine cases out of ten to introduce the Braddon section and to express their intense anxiety as to what rr.ay happen at the termination of the ten years' period. As has already been pointed out, that section was, in the first instance, intended to permanently continue the return to the States of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and not only 25s. per capita, which is a very different thing. That section is the axis upon which all financial considerations turn. It is the crucial test to which the attention of the. people was invited, and it was the security which it offered to the people of the States that vvon the fight for the Union. The original intention of the framers of the Constitution undoubtedly was that it should be for all time, and the limitation that was put upon it was a compromise adopted in order to secure Federation at that time. The leaders of political thought, when the Constitution was put to the people with that limitation in it, urged the people to trust the National Parliament .to do ample justice to them at the end of the ten years' period when that section became alterable. The prospective Commonwealth elector pledged the future of the country upon that trust. We should be recreant to that trust if we allowed any political or party consideration to prevail against the permanent continuance of that financial security which was paramount in the minds of those who framed the Constitution under which we are now governed. So far as the idea of Nationalism as against State Rights is concerned, the truest path to nationhood is the encouragement of the vigorous growth and development of every State of the Union. If we realise aright our obligations in this Parliament, they should lea3 us not only to defend the rights of the National Parliament, but just as earnestly to give the individual States a fair and honest deal. A national sentiment can be created only by a National Parliament which uses its powers in the direction of a discriminating interpretation of the people's needs, and in the faithful and conscientious discharge of public duties in a way that will win public confidence. I maintain that any such attitude as is altogether too manifest in the National Parliament today, instead of tending to promote the supremacy of that Parliament in the good will and affections of the people, will rather continue the friction which is now altogether too apparent from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. After all the stress that was placed - by the framers of the Constitution upon this principle of protection to the States, it is inconceivable that before ten years of the life of the Federal Parliament have passed by there should be such a strong and unreasoning desire on the part of so many in that Parliament to control the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue. The expression of that desire by so many members, in spite cf the fact that the Federal Parliament has the whole field of taxation to cover, while the resources of the State Parliaments are exceedingly limited, is a striking comment on the foresight of the late Sir Edward Braddon in suggesting section 87. The experience of the United States-if we want an example from experience-shoul d lead us to affirm the desirability of continuing to the States the protection which was afforded under that section. Throughout the history of that country the trouble of the National Parliament appears to-have been an embarrassment of riches, whilst the States have experienced a corresponding degree of poverty and difficulty. The fear of Federation in the minds of the people of Australia at the beginning was its cost, and that fear is not yet removed. I believe the majority of the people cling as tenaciously to the principle embodied_in the Braddon section as they N did at the beginning. I am sure that the most ardent Nationalist in this Parliament must admit that had it not been for the provision of the Braddon section Federation would have been impossible. The expectation on the part of the people of the States that, following the establishment of Federation, there would be a corresponding reduction in the cost of the Governments of the individual States, has not been realized.",52
237,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear.",54
238,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would remind the honourable member that from his point of view it is not likely to be realized, and it is a good thing for the Commonwealth that it has not been. On the contrary, the field of operations of the States has been extended from time to time, and, through the altered conditions, the present and prospective developments in the States must involve increasing financial provision. That very position constitutes the greatest hope for the future of the Commonwealth and of the National Parliament. The sharing of the Customs and Excise revenue between National Parliament and the States, which was recognised as necessary at first, is a principle which ought to be recognised now. For every argument that could be advanced at the inception of Federation in favour of providing this safeguard, as a fair, prudent, and cautious thing to do, at least two arguments can be advanced now. The position of the States today shows how greatly they need this assistance from the Commonwealth revenues. Some speakers have urged the readjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States to meet the necessities of the situation, from time to time, and a five-year, and even a three year, period has been mentioned. Such an arrangement would not promote the growth of a national spirit, but would intensify the distrust of this Parliament, if such distrust exists - There is every reason for the equitable sharing of the Customs and Excise revenue between the Commonwealth ancl the States. The framers of the Constitution were the leading statesmen and the biggest minds in the political life of Australia at the time. They had had long training in the Parliaments of the States, ancl had had much administrative experience. They did not think for a moment that the Commonwealth Parliament would ever demand the control of the whole of the Customs and Excise .revenue, and were prepared to provide that three-fourths of it should go to the States for all time. That provision was subsequently amended to give it force for ten years only ; but if it is to be contended that a - per capita return of 25s. is unreasonable, and likely to destroy the future supremacy of this Parliament, the position must be thoroughly investigated from every point of view. In this matter I follow implicitly the lead of the honourable member for North Sydney, who has had wide experience, and possesses great practical knowledge. It will be in the interests of the National Parliament to do justice to the States. Those who propose periodical adjustments, and particularly the honourable member who has suggested a readjustment every three years, would place the States in the position of mendicants, making them come as suppliants to the Commonwealth for what properly belongs to them. It will pay the Commonwealth to recognise this right of the States to a share in the revenue. The miserable spirit which has prompted the suggestions to which 1I have referred is the keeping alive the irritation in the States, whereas the proper settlement of the difficulty will greatly affect, both directly and indirectly, the future prosperity of the Commonwealth. Uncertainty regarding payments is of grave consequence to every State, and especially to the smaller ones. Each State has undertaken large liabilities, and, in the future, will have still greater obligations to face. But a State Government must hesitate to incur expenditure, so long as there is uncertainty as to the financial arrangements with the Commonwealth. The present position of affairs is retarding development. 1 know that that is so in South Australia, and have no doubt that it is so in every other State. It handicaps the settlement of land by the re-purchase of large estates for subdivision into smaller holdings. Do honourable members opposite wish to put any impediment in the wav of land settlement ? The Governments of the States cannot vigorously prosecute this policy while they are uncertain what their returns from the Commonwealth will be. An adjustment for five years would not remove that uncertainty, because there would remain the possibility of a reduction in revenue at the end of that period. At the present time the State Treasurers must exercise great caution, and, no doubt, many undertakings are being postponed indefinitely pending a settlement of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. This is not a party question. It is much bigger than a party question, and goes beyond considerations of the fate of a Government or of individual members. It is a question whose proper solution is vital to the best development of the Commonwealth. Not only is money required by the States for the repurchase of large holdings with a view to subdivision; it is also required to stimulate the occupation of Crown lands which are at present unused. This can be done only by railway construction. South Australia has ahead of if a policy of railway construction which should be carried on uninterruptedly for seven or ten years. The Government of today, and every country representative in the local Parliament, feels that it is of the highest importance that a definite and continuing policy should be submitted; but how can such an undertaking be entered upon while the State is uncertain as to what its return from the Commonwealth will be. An agreement covering a period of five, or even of ten, years would be no good. Of course, the States would have to bow to the inevitable, but those who have so much to say about the supremacy of this Parliament are striking a bigger blow at Federation than they are aware of. The increase of settlement by the subdivision of large estates, and the occupation and development of the unused Crown land, will ultimately mean an increase in revenue, and great material advantage to the whole of Australia. I should like to give one illustration, the possibilities of development in this direction. During the last five years South Australia has opened up the Pinnaroo country. Six years ago the whole of that magnificent area was occupied by only three families, and did not return a penny into the Treasury, whereas today, as a consequence of the construction of a light line of railway, there is a population of about 2,500. That railway was unique in South Australian history, inasmuch as during its first year's running it paid every penny of working expenses and interest, and, over and above, returned money into the Treasury. I know that some pin their faith to the subdivision of big estates, and desire to interfere with the State control in order to achieve that end; but the settlement of the Pinnaroo country has provided for as many families as has the expenditure of .£1,000,000 in South Australia in the repurchase of estates. And what has been done at Pinnaroo is proposed in the district represented by the honourable member for Grey, with land of three times the area. Is that not the best possible policy, not only for the States, but for the Commonwealth? All these undertakings enlarge the scope and increase the need of the State Governments. Those needs are as great-indeed , in my opinion, they are greater than they were in preiFederation days; and such development as I have described will add to the national prosperity, and supply the financial, needs of the Commonwealth Treasurer.",54
239,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is similar development going on in Western Australia.,55
240,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am reminded that in the western State the development and prospective development is as great, if not greater, than in South Australia; and what applies to those two States applies with infinitely more force to Queensland. Whereas in South Australia there are left 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 acres in the rainfall radius, there is five or ten times that area in Queensland, and the same may be said relatively of New South Wales, and of Victoria. Which is the more statesmanlike policy-to seek to provide the Treasurer with all the money he now needs by increasing the taxation of an already overburdened people, or to encourage the States, as this agreement will encourage them, to continue to bring large areas under settlement, and increase production again and again? With this increase of production will be opened fresh as to avenues of wealth-contributing forces, which will enrich, not only the State Treasurers, but the Federal Treasurer. I remind my honourable friends opposite that, in order to undertake these developmental works, the State Treasurers need all the encouragement which can be extended to them, and, on every ground of reason, deserve the concession proposed. Personally, I do not regard it as a concession, but as a matter of business. We are one people in partnership, and I have no time for a man who, calling himself a Nationalist, does not recognise the needs of every State, and realise that assistance extended makes both States and 'Commonwealth stronger and more prosperous in every direction. I ' see from the newspapers that the Victorian Government require 800 men for the railway service in the near future, and that for the 800 vacancies there are 9,000 applications. I am informed, and I make the statement, subject to correction, that 6,000 out of the 9,000 applications are from the country districts. That is a shocking state of affairs, and represents one of the problems that must be solved-the problem of the centralization and congestion of population in the cities and big towns. The six capitals of Australia today contain something like 36 per cent, of the whole population of the Commonwealth, and, according to the illustration I have just given, the evil, instead of being arrested and remedied, is being aggravated. What is the reason ? It is because the country is less attractive than are the cities to the young men. That .should not be so, because there are better chances of success by far on ihe land than could be found in the city. If the wages be higher in the city, the savings banks books in any State show larger amounts to the credit of the men working on the land. The prospects offered today by reason of the improvement in the conditions of country life, and the greater rewards offered for the cultivation of the soil, ought to reverse the stream. Another point of view is presented in the fact that a larger proportion of men who, with practically no capital, are able to go into business on their own account, are to be found in that position on the land. Land settlement throughout Australia, which is giving promise of a new and brighter future than was ever anticipated, ought to be encouraged in every way. This policy is involving the States in larger responsibilities, and it is making infinitely stronger the reasons which were good when the Braddon section was originally introduced into the Constitution. I hope that from that point of view-fro m the point of view of land settlement and development-this House will follow the Government, and will not only support the agreement, but will especially uphold its principal virtue so far as the States are concerned, and that is its permanence. I now wish fo direct attention to certain statements made by the honourable member for North Sydney. He said that the Customs revenuewill be after 1910 a financial stream in regard, to which there are no riparian rights, and the Commonwealth has possession of the source. Without a very definite agreement it is extremely doubtful how much and for how long any of the tempting waters will be allowed tc flow to those beyond. That is the position, as affecting the States, which I wish to emphasize. Three or four honourable members have evolved a theory in regard to what should be done with reference to the agreement. Now I have to say that, in my opinion, only one agreement is possible, and that is the agreement submitted by the Government; because, if this Parliament amends that agreement in any material direction, it ceases to be an agreement.",55
241,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that so?,56
242,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should say so. If this Parliament amends that agreement without the concurrence of the other parties to it, it is no longer an agreement at all. What do honourable members propose to do if they practically kill the agreement by making material alterations in it? It simply means that fresh proposals would have to be submitted; and the submitting of fresh proposals means another Premiers' Conference and consideration by another Parliament before the question can be permanently settled. Are honourable members prepared to make themselves responsible for that position? On what ground do certain honourable members appear so timid as to the ability of the National Parliament to carry out the agreement ? Much has been said about the possibility of the Customs and Excise revenue in future being insufficient to pay to the States 25s. per capita. I have indicated, not merely the possibility, but almost the certainty, of a larger development in the way of land settlement than we have known in Australia for the last thirty years. The places that I have enumerated do not exhaust the possibilities. There is also the northern portion of Australia, concerning which I would say that if that territory is not taken over and developed by the National Parliament within twelve or eighteen months of this date, it will be developed by the Parliament of South Australia. There is no doubt about that. In saying so, I am talking about what I know. I am expressing the determination of the Government and the majority of the Parliament of South Australia. But I shall have more to say on that subject when the Bill relating to the Northern Territory is under discussion. I simply mention the matter now in order to emphasize the point that extended land settlement will provide additional revenue, and will in future make both the States and the Commonwealth richer. Here is a means of solving the unemployed difficulty, and of creating fresh avenues from which will flow into our coffers wealth in the shape of taxation. The honourable member for Flinders quoted elaborate figures, no doubt very carefully and industriously prepared, in order to institute comparisons between the revenue producing powers of the Tariffs of different nations. In justice to him, I must say that he admitted candidly and honestly that he merely quoted the figures for what they were worth. He did not claim that they were absolutely a reliable guide as to what might happen in regard to the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth in the future. The honourable member, in opinion, was very wise when he did not claim too much for his argument. It often said that figures cannot lie, it is also true that people - who pulate figures can make them tell almost any tale they please. The Treatralia-an surer has submitted figures in opposiexhaust tion to those quoted by the honourable ber for Flinders. Those submitted by the right honourable gentleman were, 1 pose, not merely furnished on his authority as Treasurer, but on the authority of to the expert officers of his Department. The Treasurer says that that is so. We have, therefore, the expert men of the partment who not only casually have to do witli these big questions, but whose everyhas day life is devoted .to their consideration, contending exactly the opposite of what was urged-thoug h certainly not strongly - by the honourable member for Flinders. The honourable member for North Sydney also gave evidence of a good deal of reto march ahead. search in his study of this question, and admitted fairly and honestly that such comcountry parisons were entirely valueless. thrown, therefore, on our own resources and experience in determining how these Tariffs operate according to varying condipossible. tions. Whnt is the use of comparing the Customs ancl Excise return per head of population in old, settled, and immensely populous countries with that of Australia, with its totally different conditions? in respect of population, in regard to which the conditions are somewhat similar, must thoroughly understand and investigate the Tariffs from beginning to end. We must know all the surrounding conditions nnd the ability of the people to pay taxato tion before we can institute a comparison that would be anything like a reasonable guide to us in determining the prospective returns of an Australian Tariff. We all know, however, what an influx of populacount. tion into Australia means. We have the history of Broken Hill and of other large mining centres in Western Australia to guide us' in this respect. An influx of population, not only in mining centres, but in. be agricultural districts, means a big augmenin tation of the Customs revenue and a buoyant revenue far above that of a counrecord try where the conditions are stationary and normal. Let me refer again to the Pinto-day naroo settlement in South Australia. For the last two years heavily-freighted trains have been passing along the Pinnaroo railshould way line three times a week, a large promorrow. portion of the loading consisting of new [>4i] my agricultural machinery. All the necessities incidental to new settlement mean is very considerable Customs revenue. Tf but in the future we should remove by manisettlement the stigma of the big vacant spaces from the map of Ausd settlement schemes will not the country even should they conmemtinue for fifty years-ther e would be revenue-producing forces all along the line supgiving continuously and increasingly. Therefore, instead of being disconsolate as the prospects of the future ability of the National Parliament to return to the States 25s. per capita, I believe that we should be Deon the contrary very hopeful. Australia never had brighter times or brighter prospects. The story of the enormous expansion which has taken place during ths last few years in our production of staples, and particularly of wheat, reads almost like a fairy tale. We are only just beginning With the advance of he science as applied' to agriculture our best is not only increasing, but is nearly We are doubling its yields, and our inferior country is doubling and trebling the yields that the most sanguine of us ever thought Then, again; with the advent of the science of dry farming which is being the powerfully advocated by Senator MCColl, there is no telling, and the most sanguine cannot realise, what the future is going to Even be. Dry farming is not only going to restore and re-establish the dry limited-rainwe fall areas throughout the Commonwealth which have been forsaken as unreliable and unprofitable for wheat production, 'but is going to bring under cultivation and to turn profitable account throughout the Commonwealth millions of acres that the most practical and expectant people of Australia never thought would be so utilized. There are other possibilities, to be taken into acIn today's newspapers we have the remarkable statement that if the prices obtaining at the Melbourne wool sales are continued throughout the season there will returned to the people of this continent respect of our wool production for the year no less than £27,000,000. That is a of which Australia has a right to be proud. I realise that the conditions of are only indicative of greater development and brighter prospects in the days to come.
