1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir John MCLeay) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. ABORIGINES. Petitions. Mr UREN presented a petition from certain citizens of the Commonwealth prayOpposition ing that the Government remove section 127, and the words discriminating against aborigines in section 51, of the Commontechnical wealth Constitution, by the holding of referendum at an early date. A similar petition was presented Mr Armitage. Petitions severally received. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.",12
2,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I ask the Prime big Minister a question. In view of his repeat recently repeated statements that TFX TSR-2 aeroplanes are in the same stage development-that is, aeroplanes on the drawing board only-and in view of his statement yesterday that the press photoideal graph of the TSR-2 was a mock-up, which or is usually a full-scale wooden workshop model used to check up on the overall dimensional design and to plan the interior arrangements of instruments and the like, I ask the right honourable gentleman: Is not a fact that the press photograph of TSR-2 depicts an aeroplane in a very advanced stage on a fully equipped propoint duction line with other aeroplanes followForce the TFX ing on? Is it not also a fact that the aeroplane depicted in the press is an aeroplane flying, and that a mock-up plane never report? flies? I do not mind the merriment of honourable gentlemen opposite, Mr Speaker, because for most of them this is their last day in this House. As this is the last day on which the present Parliament will sit, I ask: In view of the Prime Minister's claims that the Canberra bomber has of several years of life left in it and can bably be used until TFX aeroplanes are gentleman's delivered in 1967, will he explain the urgency for placing orders immediately before the election? Was the visit of the Minister for Defence to the United States of America concerned more with election purposes than with getting aeroplanes? Why did the Minister not also go to London for consultation with the United Kingdom Government on a high political level in order to find out whether that Government could make an offer which would match the American offer?",12
3,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,Unknown,"This , of course, is not a question, it is a speech. 1 do not understand why the Leader of the thinks he has any future in pursuing this argument; he certainly has had no past. He is now getting frightfully about mock-ups and about a a picture of a plane in flight. I thought it was well known that the prototype of the TSR-2 will not fly until next year. The by prototype of the TFX has not flown yet. The fact is that, from the point of view of getting aircraft and putting them into service, the delivery dates of the TFX and the TSR-2 are substantially the same-that is, if all expectations come to pass. Two factors in this matter-shal l I have to them indefinitely?-are , first, that our and own experts, whose advice the honourable of gentleman was promising the other day to take, have said that for the purposes of the Royal Australian Air Force the TFX is the plane, and they have pointed out four five respects in which it is superior to the TSR-2. My colleague, the Minister for Air, mentioned them yesterday. I am not asking honourable members to take my word in this matter. I do not claim to be an expert on it it. But I do claim to be able to read the English in a report, and when I tell the House that our experts said that from the of view of the Royal Australian Air Mr Uren - Why don't you table the",12
4,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,Unknown,"Really! Honourable members opposite are hard up, aren't they, Hogging a dead horse on this matter. All of a sudden they have discovered that we ought to ignore the advice the experts. Really, the whole thing is proludicrous. As to the rest of the honourable speech, I will hear it many times in the course of the election campaign. FRUIT TRADE WITH JAPAN.",12
5,Mr DEAN,Unknown,"I wish to ask a question of the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to previous discussions 1I have had with him regarding proposals to market in Japan citrus fruits, apples, pears and bananas. The honourable gentleman may recall that the representative of the industry has suggested that to facilitate agreements or arrangements it would bc of advantage to have some Japanese officials visit Australia. The officials having shown interest in the proposal, I ask the Minister whether he has any information to give to the House regarding the request of the industry.",12
6,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,"The Japanese have had a ban on the importation of our fruits because of the insects that affect our fruit industry here, namely the Queensland and Mediterranean fruit flies and the codling moth. Negotiations have taken place with the Japanese Government to try to establish an acceptable basis on which we can export to Japan the fruits mentioned by the honourable member. As the honourable member has said, it was understood that when the Japanese Prime Minister was here discussions on this matter would be held. The secretary of my department had discussions with Japanese officials who intimated that it was quite possible that they would send a small delegation here to discuss this matter. We have heard nothing more definite on that, but it is still expected that they will arrive and discuss the matter further. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.",13
7,Mr UREN,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Territories aware that the "" South Pacific Post"" of 17th September last stated that a new land ordinance in Papua and New Guinea will replace 69 earlier land ordinances? Is it a fact that some time ago a land bill was introduced into the Legislative Council for Papua and New Guinea which would have materially affected community ownership? Was this bill strongly opposed by the indigenous members? Is it a fact that the proposed land ordinances deal with matters similar to those contained in the bill and that the enactment of the ordinances is being used to by-pass the Legislative Council, in which the bill was presented?",13
8,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"I find some difficulty in following the details of the honourable nu..iber's question. With all respect him, the points he makes seem to me to be rather garbled. I think he is referring to the Lands Bill which is before the Legislative Council for Papua and New Guinea. As its main point, it tackles the problem of conversion of tenure from customary tenure to some form of tenure which has a recognizable and defensible title. I think the honourable member will realise that in view of the rapid economic development of the Territory and the participation of the native people in that development, a system of land holding based on customary rights is not always suitable for modern conditions. For example, a man may plant cocoa trees on a piece of land to which he has rights of use, but he may have no rights to leave that land to his descendants. By native customary righis it may go to some one other than his descendants. In those circumstances it is necessary to devise a system of land holding which will meet the economic advancement of the people. The bill as introduced was intended to bring about a system by which it would be possible, not under compulsion but with the voluntary acceptance of the people, to' turn in, as it were, customary rights to land for conversion to a title held from the Crown. This is very clearly in the interests of the economic advancement of the native people and is intended to serve no other purpose. NA OPPOSITION.",13
9,Mr ERWIN,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Externa] Affairs: In discussions that took place prior to and during his recent trip overseas, the Leader of the Opposition stated that he had said to Mr. Averell HarrimanWe will re-negotiate the North West Cape Base Agreement with the American Administration. We want joint control of the base. The Leader of the Opposition also implied that re-negotiation of the agreement would be considered by the American authorities. As to discussions with Mr Dean Rusk on the nuclear free zone theory for the southern hemisphere, the Leader of the Opposition had this to sayMy discussions with Mr Rusk were cordial, warm Mr Reynolds - I wish to raise a point to of order. Mr Speaker, you have often ruled- I think quite properly-that questions of the kind now being asked by the honourable member for Ballaarat constitute the giving of information, and that the purpose of a question should be to elicit information.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,"I think there is some substance in the point of order. However, we are in the final quarter, as it were. There was a little relaxation of the rules yesterday, but I suggest to the honourable member that he do not go too far wide of the customs of the House.",14
11,Mr ERWIN,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,The Leader Opposition had this Mr Calwell - I raise a point of order. While I was overseas 1 did not see Mr. Averell Harriman at all.,14
12,Mr ERWIN,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,I have already said that prior to and during,14
13,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,Order ! I suggest that the honourable member ask his question.,14
14,Mr ERWIN,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,The Leader of the Opposition had this to say,14
15,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,Th c honourable member is now out of order. INTER-COMPANY LENDING.,14
16,Mr SEXTON,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Sir Ian Potter, in a published statement that has been reported, has warned against the policies of large commercial enterprises favouring increased inter-company lending. Can the Treasurer say whether any steps have been taken to control these operations? Does he regard this new monetary method as being a threat to the orthodox control that the Reserve Bank of Australia is supposed to exercise over our monetary system?",14
17,Mr HAROLD HOLT,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,"It is a fact that over recent years the practice of intercompany lending has been growing and has now assumed quite sizeable proportions. The Government has not taken any specific action in this matter, but the subject is under close study by the Treasury and the banking authorities. However, I am not in a position to make any policy comments about it. ANTI-SEMITISM.",14
18,Mr HAWORTH,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,I wish to ask the Minister for External Affairs a question. Has he seen reports that in New York on Monday Mr Averell Harriman charged Russia with suppression of religious groups in a statement in which he said that undoubtedly the heaviest burden of this attack had been borne by the Jews; that there had been some relaxation in antiJewish discrimination but the respite was brief; that synagogues had been closed and that Jews were kept out of high posts; and of the that he had found it difficult to do something effective to alleviate the position? I ask this question having regard to the raising of this important subject of human rights by Australia at last year's meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Will the Minister instruct Australia's ambassador to discuss this matter with the United States representative at the United Nations in order to raise again this question of persecution of the Jews in Russia as a matter of urgency at the present sitting of the third committee of the Assembly?,14
19,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,STATEMENTS BY LEADER OF THE,"I know that the honourable member has maintained a close interest in this question of religious intolerance and oppression. Last year, he asked me a question much along the lines of the one he has just put to me. The House will remember that I responded and that Australia raised the question during the discussion of a human rights resolutionand to some point. I was very pleased, if I may say so, to see that Governor Averell Harriman had again called attention to this oppressive activity on the part of the Soviet. It is very interesting to see how ready the Soviet always is to pick on other people and speak of what other nations do and then proceed itself to do the very thing that it condemns. I am quite sure that in the future we shall have to watch more closely Soviet imperialism and also particularly red Chinese imperialism. I am glad to see, as I have said, that Governor Harriman has called attention to this case of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. I shall most certainly ask our representative to confer with Mr Adlai Stevenson, the United States representative, at once to see whether something effective can be - done. 1 lay stress, on the word "" effective"", because it is not useful this sphere to do things that NA CORPORATION.",14
20,Mr EJ HARRINSON,COMMONWEALTH BANKING,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask: Is he aware of the announcement made by the Reserve Bank of Australia in late September that salaries of the bank's employees would be increased somewhat in line with the formula of increases adopted in the Third Division of the Commonwealth Public Service, representing margins increases of about 10 per cent, plus an average increment of £50 to £60, dated from 22nd April, 1963? Can the right honourable gentleman say why the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, over its whole field of activity, has not yet made any similar announcement? Why is this differential in wages allowed to continue? Is it because the corporation is prepared to tie itself to private banking conditions in relation to its employees instead of adopting the lead given by the Reserve Bank?",15
21,Mr HAROLD HOLT,COMMONWEALTH BANKING,"This is not a matter that comes within my own sphere of direction, and I do not have the facts in mind. However, I shall obtain an answer that I can make available to the honourable member by letter. NA ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS.",15
22,Mr WENTWORTH,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, relates to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Affairs, a body which has received generous support from the Government and which, I understand, receives the support also of the Opposition. Since it has proved impossible to bring down in this session legislation formally to constitute this body on a proper basis, would it be possible for approval to be given for the appointment of a permanent head without delay? May I say that this is a matter of great urgency in view of the rapid changes taking place in the field, and that the work of the institute would be much improved if it had a permanent head.",15
23,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,I shall be very happy to have a look into this matter and see whether 1 can arrange for some in decision to be made upon it in the course are not effective. of the day. SOCIAL SERVICES.,15
24,Mr MINOGUE,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I ask the Minister for Social Services whether he is aware, that in the last three annual budgets married pensioners were unjustly treated in that they did not receive any rise in their pensions. Will he promise that if this Government is returned he will make amends by. paying married pensioners the 10s. a. week rise that is being paid to other pensioners?",15
25,Mr ROBERTON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"1 find it is my melancholy duty to remind the honourable member for West Sydney once again that expenditure from the National Welfare Fund has increased since this Government has been in office from £81,000,000 to not less than £411,000,000 in the current financial year. I hope that that progress can be continued on into the future, but it can only continue consistently' with the capacity of the Australian people to pay the additional cost. DEFENCE.",15
26,Mr LINDSAY,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,I ask the Attorney General: Is there any way in which a true record of the discussions concerning the United States Naval Communication Station at North West Cape and the nuclear-free zone theory for the southern hemisphere which took place between the American authorities and the Leader of the Opposition can be made public?,15
27,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"Record s will no doubt be kept of those confidential discussions, but whether or' not the parties to them would want them made public is a matter for them and for nobody else. As to the nuclear-free zone, I do know that the American authorities made it clear to me, and I am quite sure they, did also to the Leader of the Opposition, that if this proposal for a nuclear-free zone in the southern hemisphere was persisted with America vvould not only be opposed to it but would have to rethink its relationship with us in ANZUS. As to the question of re-negotiating the North West Cape agreement, as I have said in this House, the Americans made it perfectly clear to me that they would not agree to joint control and they would not have come here had there been an insistence other on joint control. I have no doubt they made that perfectly clear to the Leader the Opposition also. ARMY AMMUNITION SUPPLIES.",15
28,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I address a question to the Minister for the Army. Was a report made by the brigadier in charge of ordnance services earlier this year expressing concern at the number and variety of defects being found in new ammunition after it had been received into ammunition depots from the Department of Supply? Did this report say, among other things, that in almost every inspection over the last five years defects, which should have been detected and corrected before the item was accepted into service, were found? ln view of these and other examples of gross negligence in the supply of vital ammunition to the Army, will the Minister say why this state of affairs was allowed to continue for at least five years and what action, if any, has been taken since the report to which I refer was written earlier this year?",16
29,Mr CRAMER,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I think the honourable member is on a rather long trail. His question covers a period of five years. There is no current complaint before me, nor can I recollect one dealing with this particular matter. Difficulties which arise from time to time arc discussed departmentally between my department and the Department of Supply. I can assure the honourable member that no major difficulties at present affect the supply of ammunition to the Army. MARGARINE.",16
30,Mr NIXON,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I address a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it a fact that the Australian Labour Party has forces at work to damage the dairying industry by encouraging the production of margarine? Also, is it true that the honourable member for Grayndler is an advocate for the margarine industry and in fact calls himself the shadow Minister for Margarine? Mr Daly - 1 take a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The question asked by the honourable member is obviously political. It is true that in my district there is an establishto ment that manufactures margarine and, like taxpayers, it is entitled to representation when it considers this to be necessary. of In keeping with my general policy",16
31,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,Order ! Mr Daly - I might say also,16
32,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,Order ! No point of order is involved. I ask the honourable member to resume his seat.,16
33,Mr ADERMANN,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"The records show, of course, that the increases in the quotas for the production of margarine were made in both instances by Labour governments - the Labour Government of New South Wales and the Labour Government of Queensland. The attitude of the honourable member for Grayndler is apparent in his speeches, which are reported in "" Hansard "". He champions the cause of the margarine manufacturers and speaks detrimentally of the dairying industry. No doubt this represents the Labour viewpoint. RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES.",16
34,Mr GALVIN,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I direct a question to the Attorney-General. It refers to the restrictive trade practices legislation that had been proposed. Has the Attorney General received representations from certain overseas shipping interests regarding the exemption granted to the conference shipping lines on the United Kingdom and Europe run under the Industries Preservation Act, in which they have sought to have the exemption extended to conference lines on all overseas routes by an appropriate section in the proposed restrictive trade practices legislation? If so, will the Minister give details of the representations, and say whether he has considered them, and what attitude the Government has adopted on the submissions?",16
35,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I bave said many times that I have had a lot of representations of all kinds. AU of them have been made in confidence, because the people concerned have trusted me. 1 do not propose to disclose what took place in those conferences. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.",16
36,Mr CHANEY,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I address my question the Minister for Air. In the various discussions and statements about the B-47E bomber, some allegations have been that there are defects in the air frame. Has the Minister any comment to make on these allegations?",16
37,Mr FAIRBAIRN,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"It is correct that some years ago some fatigue problems were associated with the B-47E. These did arise from any fault in the design of the aircraft. It was originally designed as high-level bomber, but, with the introducimproper tion of improved radar and surface-to-air missiles, a new technique of low-level ing was adopted. The technique under which the United States Air Force evidence operated was to come in low down, to pull up in probably a 5G loop and roll off the top, throwing a bomb off as this was being done. I am sure that honorare able members will realise that, with an aircraft weighing 200,000 lb., this placed a little bit of strain on the wings. sequently, in about 1958, the aircraft grounded and strengthening was put into the wing spars. Since then, there has been no difficulty at all with the aircraft. honourable member may be interested to know that we have two squadron leaders in the Royal Australian Air Force who have both done periods of exchange duty with the United States Air Force flying B-47's. One of those, Squadron Leader Wilson, is in Canberra at the He was, for a considerable time, an instructor with the United States Air Force in Kansas, on these aircraft. This has been a great help to the Royal Australian Air Force and when we introduce these airyear craft to service he will be an enormous help. TOWING SERVICES.",17
38,Mr CROSS,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"I direct a question to the Minister for the Interior. Has been directed to recent reports suggesting that the Australian Capital Territory police are showing favouritism in the allocation towing jobs to private operators? In view of these reports can he say whether both he and the Australian Capital Territory Police Commissioner have directed police strictly to observe a roster system and to recommend any particular operators? Is he also able to say whether any evidence has been presented either to him or his department to support these serious recent time. allegations against the police? If so, what made action does he propose to take?",17
39,Mr FREETH,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"Some considerable time ago- I think it was two or more years ago- a detailed investigation was held into allegations similar to those mentioned by the honourable member. No substantial evinot dence was produced that any favouritism was shown by the Australian Capital Terria tory police, or that they had acted in any way, but they were instructed to be very careful in observing the tow-truck bombroster. When I saw the recent allegations I made further inquiries, but there is no to show that the police have disobeyed instructions in this respect. Some tow truck operators do not maintain a 24hour service on the telephone. When they rung, as their turn comes on the roster, there is no response and so the police have to go to the next man who is available. ConVery often citizens who are involved in was accidents-particularl y if they are from outside the Australian Capital Territorypress the police to give tbem the name of The a tow truck operator who can be reached on the spot. The police have been advised not to do this. It is very difficult for the police, when pressed by people, not to give them some advice or information. I am the quite satisfied that there is no improper action on the part of the Australian Capital present time. Territory police. REPATRIATION.",17
40,Mr FOX,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,I wish to ask the Minister for Repatriation a question. Earlier this he announced changes in the rates of repatriation benefits for Torres Strait islanders. I ask the Minister whether his recent visit to those islands has stimulated interest in the increased benefits and also whether he will inform the House of the current position with respect to applications his attention for these benefits.,17
41,Mr SWARTZ,AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF,"As the House is aware, of a bill was introduced earlier this year to increase the rates of war pensions for Torres Strait islanders-that is the men who had served with the Torres Strait Islands Regiment-to the same rates as not those for other Australian ex-servicemen. At that time, their rates were much lower. In addition, we introduced service pensions for Torres Strait islanders for the first Knowing this, I paid a visit to the area. In the party, I had the federal member for the district, the chairman of the Repatriation Commission, a representative of the Returned Servicemen's League and a representative of the Australian Legion of Ex-servicemen. We arranged meetings in the area. This was the first opportunity that the islanders had had to discuss matters at ministerial level. Resulting from the conversations, I left behind an oincer who visited all the principal inhabited islands and interviewed approximately 200 ex-servicemen islanders. Resulting from these interviews approximately 80 new applications for war pensions are at present being considered. In addition, a number of applications for increases in the existing rate of war pensions are being considered, together with approximately 40 new applications for service pensions. It is expected that the result of these investigations will be known in the near future. NA NA AUSTRALIA.",17
42,Mr CALWELL,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"I ask a question the Minister for Labour and National Serledges vice-that proud aristocrat of Australian the proper one. liberalism. Is the Minister aware that the Western Australian branch of the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the Trades Labour Council of Perth-ha s shown great recall. foresight, tolerance and co-operative understanding in the agreement that it has arrived at, on behalf of all unions concerned, with the employers concerned, on all matters relating to working conditions and relevant matters associated with the buildbeen ing of the North West Cape radio base affectmission ing the whole term of the contract which extend over an estimated period of days? Is this agreement registered or about to be registered with the Arbitration of Western Australia? ""Will the Minister now acknowledge tihe wisdom of the followed by the trade union movement in Western Australia in deciding to settle necessary industrial code at the commencing point of the project for the purpose ensuring industrial peace during period of work on the project?",18
43,Mr MCMAHON,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"I think it should be stated that the Government's attitude in respect of this matter from the Minister very beginning has been to encourage the trade union movement to negotiate an industrial agreement with the employers before any action was taken on the security of the base. I personally wrote to the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Monk, and informed him that this was the Government's approach in the matter, rhe Government wanted negotiations to take place. It has been patiently wa »iJg to see whether the ; negotiations h?-j been completed before taking any action. I know that Mr Monk welcomed the Government's approach in this matter and to the best of my knowledge so, too, did the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia. Until yesterday I had not been informed that a satisfactory settlement had been reached and that the agreement had subsequently been registered. Nonetheless, if a settlement has been agreed to I applaud it and express my satisfaction that the Government's attitude was the correct one to take in the circumstances. The Government has done all in its power to show to the trade union movement that it encouraged negotiation and I am sure of that the trade union movement acknowthat the Government's approach was There was another part of the question of and the honourable gentleman which I cannot Mr Calwell - Do you know that the agreement was registered with the court?",18
44,Mr MCMAHON,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"The honourable other gentleman stated that the agreement has registered with the industrial comof Western Australia, not with the will Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration 960 Commission. I did not know that the agreement had been registered, but if it was Court registered yesterday Mr Calwell - I said that it had been or course was about to be registered.",18
45,Mr MCMAHON,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"If the agreement is the about to be registered I would not know about it, but if it is registered today I of am sure that the authorities in Western the whole Australia will let me know. AUSTRALIAN LABOUR PARTY. Mr TURNBULI Will the Prime make searching investigations in an endeavour to ascertain the reason for the recent noticeable lack of enthusiasm in this House and the complete silence at election time of members of the Labour Party regarding their socialist policy?",18
46,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"This is a magnificent suggestion. I hope that everybody will conduct a little research into matter. In fact, if I may boost a recent work of literature, I advise everybody to read the book recently written by the Leader of the Opposition. TAXATION.",19
47,Mr BARNARD,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"I direct a question to the Treasurer. In accordance with the Budget announcement the taxation law has been amended to provide that where the spouse of a taxpayer has a separate net income in excess of £65 a year, the allowable deduction in respect of the spouse is reduced by £1 for every £1 by which the separate net income of the spouse exceeds £65. As taxpayers submitted their income tax returns prior to the amendment being brought into force on the basis of a reduction of the allowance for the spouse of £2 for every £1 by which the separate net income of the spouse exceeded £65, will it be necessary for them to submit amended returns showing a reduction of the allowance for the spouse of £1 for every £1 by which the separate net income of the spouse exceeds £65, or will the Taxation Branch adjust returns accordingly without putting taxpayers to the trouble and expense of submitting amended returns, which will create unnecessary work for the branch?",19
48,Mr HAROLD HOLT,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"I hope it will be possible to avoid any inconvenience to taxpayers in these circumstances and that the adjustments can be made within the commissioner's office. However, I shall put the substance of the question to the commissioner and ensure that a written reply is sent to the honourable member. IMMIGRATION.",19
49,Mr DRURY,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,Will the Minister for Immigration state how successful he has been in attracting single women to Australia under our immigration scheme?,19
50,Mr DOWNER,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"The Government, quite naturally and properly, has ha.d a very healthy interest in this problem. ' One' of the aims of our migration programme has been to redress the slight imbalance of the sexes that remains. On the whole, I think we can say that our activities have been fairly successful. Honourable members probably will be more interested in what I am about to say if I use round figures. this In 1961, we attracted to Australia 11,500 single females of marriageable age-that is, between the ages of 15 and 44-and in 1962 we brought in 13,700. I think the House will agree that this is the kind of progress that every healthy man would like to see. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.",19
51,Mr MONAGHAN,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"I preface my question to the Minister for External Affairs by stating that as an Australian and a member of the Australian Labour Party I have a very real interest in preserving the integrity of Australia's shores. How does the Government view the concept of Maphilindo? What steps has the Government taken to use its good offices in the unhappy relationship that exists between the countries of that conceptual federation, namely, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia?",19
52,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"At no stage have I offered what is technically called good offices in relation to the differences which have arisen between our three neighbours, but last February I did give positive encouragement to the proposal that they should meet with a view to resolving' their differences and removing misunderstandings that may have existed between them. As a result of that meeting, the concept of Maphilindo emerged. We have not shown any disfavour to it; indeed, we have shown interest to the contrary. Recently there have been more acute differences, and I have taken the stand that, at this time, we should allow these Asian neighbours to work them out for themselves. I think that they will find a way to resolve their differences without any outside interference at this time, and I hope that they do so. EMPLOYMENT.",19
53,Mr FORBES,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service, refers to the career guidance work done by the Commonwealth Employment Service. So that young people leaving school in South Australian country areas may have the same advantages as young people in the metropolitan cities have, will the Minister ensure that excellent films on careers in the possession reply of his department are available for showing to young country people?",19
54,Mr MCMAHON,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"My department has produced a number of films, both blackand-white and coloured, dealing with occupations and trade testing. They are worth seeing. I have seen several of them. I am sure that they would be of interest most honourable members. In reply to the honourable gentleman's question, I will ensure that all of these films are made available in South Australia, and I certainly will see that enough are made available to enable them to be distributed in country the position. areas.

57,Mr DALY,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,On a misrepresentation during question time.,20
58,Mr SPEAKER,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,I think the honourable member had his opportunity to speak during question time.,20

61,Mr DALY,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"During question time the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Nixon) asked the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Adermann) a question, which was answered. In the course of his question, the honourable member for Gippsland said that I represented margarine interests in this Parliament. That statement is completely false. I represent the industry only as a constituent part of my electorate. As such, it is entitled to approach me on matters, just as people in the electorates of other members of this Parliament are entitled to approach them. The industry has the right to have its case presented. That is the only activity in which I take part in this Parliament on behalf of the industry. I have no shares and no other interest in the industry. The the Minister for Primary Industry, in his",20

82,Mr FAIRHALL,COMMUNICATION STATION IN, I present a report of the Tariff Board on the following subject:Unwrought Copper. Ordered to be printed. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.,21
83,Mr CALWELL,COMMUNICATION STATION IN,"Mr Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented and I wish to a make a statement on the matter. In the course of a reply to a question today, the Minister for External Affairs (Sir Garfield said that he had been advised by leading statesmen in the United States of America-h e said he had no doubt that I had been advised of this, too-that , if the Party persisted in its attitude of seeking to make the southern hemisphere a nuclear-free zone, the United States might have to review its obligations under the ANZUS Treaty. No American of any status even mentioned the question of the ANZUS Treaty to me. Neither the President, the Secretary of State, the Assistant Secretary of State nor any of their officers ever mentioned the ANZUS Treaty when we discussed the question of having a nuclear-free zone in the southern hemisphere. I did discuss that question with them. They did not agree with the attitude of the Labour Party on the question. I pointed out to them that we would try to persuade all the powers having interests here, whether they were powers in the northern hemisphere or powers in the southern hemisphere, to reach an agreement, and that if any one held out there could be no agreement. I thought I made my position clearly understood. At no time was it suggested that the United States viewed it in the way in which the Minister said he was told, and in which he claimed that I was told. On the other question of the installation at North West Cape, it is true that the US. representatives hold very strong views. It is true that this Parliament has agreed to an act and that we are bound by the agreement in that act for a period of 25 years. I told the Americans that a Labour Government would not repudiate the agreement, that we would feel bound by it, but that we claimed the right at any time within the 25-year period for a Labour Government or some subsequent government to try to negotiate an alteration in the agreement if this was thought wise. That was how I put the story, and I want the record of this Parliament to contain my story, so that when people read it alongside what the Minister for External Affairs has said today they will know my view as well as his view. What I have said is completely in accordance with fact. NA AUDITOR-GENERAL.",21
84,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BY THE,"I present the following paper:Audit Act-Supplementar y Report by the Auditor-General upon other accounts, for year 1962-63. Ordered to be printed.

F.9601/63 - R -[90 ] COPPER BOUNTY BILL 1963. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr. Fairhall, and read a first time. Second Reading.",22
85,Mr FAIRHALL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Paterson-Minister for Supply) [11.29] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The Copper Bounty Act 1958-1960 expires on 31st December, 1963. The Tariff Board has now completed a further inquiry into the industry and, in a report dated 14th October, 1963, has recommended that this act should be extended in its present form for a period of two years from lst January, 1964, except that small producers should be paid, in future, bounty on up to 100 tons over two years instead of on 50 tons in any one year as at present. The Government has accepted these recommendations of the board and the bill now before the House is to implement them. The board has made its recommendation for continuation of the existing rate of bounty as, in effect, a holding action for the next two years. By that time, the position in regard to the potential new mine at Cobar, New South Wales, and its effect as a new major producer on domestic and export sales of the present mines, will be clearer and easier to assess. In recommending that small producers be paid bounty on up to 100 tons over the two-year period, instead of on 50 tons in any one year as at present, the board had regard to the difficulties experienced by small producers in that their production can vary greatly from year to year because of such factors as the necessity for developmental work to provide for future production, good or bad weather, and favourable or unfavorable areas. It is not possible to estimate precisely the cost of continuing the present bounty scheme for a further two years, but in the three years to 30th June, 1963, the annual bounty payments varied between £405,000 and £699,000. Provision has been made in the bill to give my colleague, the Minister for Customs SENATE. and Excise (Senator Henty), authority to delegate his powers and functions under the act. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in his personal work in administering the increasing number of bounty acts, and it is considered neither desirable nor possible for the Minister peras sonally to make each and every decision per required to be made in the course of administering the various bounties. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Tariff Board has limited its examination and recommendations to existing copper producers. It is, however, proposed tend the act in its present form, apart from the change in respect of small producers, and to refer the matter to the board review within the next two years. I commend the bill to honourable members.  adjourned. NA Bill returned from the Senate with a request. Message from the Governor General commending an appropriation of revenue for the purposes of the amendment to be made upon request by the Senate in the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Bill, anper nounced. In committee: Consideration of Senate's request. Clause 8. (I.) Bounty in respect of superphosphate, being superphosphate in respect of which the succeeding sub-section, applies, is payable at the rate of Three pounds for each ton of superphosnewly phate. (2.) Where the percentage of the phosphorous pentoxide content of any superphosphate is less lh;m nineteen and one-half per centum, or more than twenty and one-half per centum, by weight of the superphosphate, bounty in respect of that superphosphate is payable at the rate of Fifteen pounds for each ton of the phosphorous pentoxide content of that superphosphate. (3.) The Minister may, from time to time, by notice published in the Gazette, determine that bounty shall be payable at the rate of Three pounds in respect of each ton of superphosphate the percentage of the phosphorous pentoxide content by weight of which is less than nineteen and one-half per centum and, where such a determination is in force, the last preceding sub-section has effect as if for nineteen and one-half there were substituted the percentage' so determined and in force. Senate's requestIn clause 8, sub-clause (3.) leave out all words after "" nineteen and one half per centum "", insert "" and is greater than a percentage specified in the deterrhination and, where such a determination is in force, the last' preceding sub-section'has effect if for the reference to nineteen and otve-halt centum in that sub-section there were substituted a reference to the percentage so specified."".",22
86,Mr FAIRHALL,PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS BOUNTY,"Paterson-Minister for Supply) [11.32] - I move That the requested amendment be made. This is a minor drafting amendment, suggested by the Parliamentary Draftsman to exhimself, to clause 8. The amendment merely makes a little clearer the intention that in the event of it being necessary to for use rock phosphate which will produce a lower content of phosphorous pentoxide than the proportion of 19.5 per cent, presently agreed to, the Minister will be empowered to make a determination that superphosphate containing a higher proportion of P 0 will qualify for 2 5 BILL 1963. the full £3 a ton bounty. Mr Kelly. ""-No lower.",23
87,Mr FAIRHALL,PHOSPHATE FERTILIZERS BOUNTY,"It is higher than rethe new limit determined by the Minister it will qualify for the full bounty. At the present tune the proportion to qualify for the bounty is 20 per cent, plus or minus .5 cent. But in view of the fact that you may have to use a poorer phosphate rock as a basis for your fertilizer, it may be necessary for the Minister to determine a lower figure. It may come down by 1 per cent. This amendment merely makes it a not little clearer that superphosphate containnext ing a proportion of P20 in excess of the 3 determined limit will attract the full benefit. It is a drafting amendment.  Opposition has no objection to the amendment. It will facilitate the provision of machinery necessary to allow the payment of bounty on superphosphate manufactured from phosphate rock that may be of a quality inferior to the phosphatic rock deposits at Ocean Island, Nauru and other places where there arc high-grade deposits. Requested amendment made. Resolution reported; report adopted. Bill, amended accordingly, returned to the Senate. NA BILL 1963. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 24th October (vide page 2267), on motion by Mr AdermannThat the bill be now read a second time. Mr Adermann - As the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill and the Wheat Export Charge Bill are relevant to one another, I suggest that we discuss them together.",23
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION," There being no objection, Victoria that course will be followed.  Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill provides for certain amendments of the Wheat Stabilization Act and also consolidates the wheat stabilization legislation to date. mally I would be tempted to use this opportunity to make a fairly long survey the history of Australian wheat stabilization legislation. I can claim to have a longer political experience of legislation dealing with wheat stabilization and the problems of the wheat industry than anybody else in any of the parliaments of Australia. I can also claim a fairly long record of experience of the industry in a personal sense. I have always been most actively interested in operative marketing, which is the most effective way in which the primary producers can obtain just and adequate returns for their labour. The political party to which I belong has the same outlook on the keting problems of primary producers. In 1921 I sowed a 20-acre paddock with wheat in order to qualify for a vote in ballot arranged by the conservative Victo torian Government of the clay. Following World War I . , the wheat-growers of Victoria - and indeed of Australia generally-wer experiencing acute financial difficulties brought about by the low price of wheat. They agitated until they provoked the Country Party in the Victorian Parliament into putting pressure on the party equivalent to the Liberal Party of today. I am not sure what the Liberal Party was then called, but it was at last galvanized into activity. It had at first refused to concede to demands of the Country Party for a ballot of the Victorian wheat-growers on whether they desired compulsory wheat pooling. The Labour Party, true to form in this matter, supported the Country Party in the Parliament and the two parties by their combined votes, defeated the Government. I think it was the Lawson Government. Anyhow, it resigned and the ensuing tion was fought on the question whether there should be compulsory pooling of wlieat in Victoria. The Country Party and Labour Party returned in greater numbers than they had when they went campaigning, but, as it does ever and anon, the Country Party peaked and formed a liaison with the Liberal Party. In the result, the growers of did not get the legislation they were seeking. In the period between the two World Wars the wheat-growers were never out of trouble. Agitation continued and a wide variety of schemes for the solution of their Norproblems was produced. There were flour tax schemes, home-consumption price of schemes and all manner of schemes. With the outbreak of World War II, the Commonwealth Government of the day enacted legislation to acquire the wheat production of Australia for the period of the war. Because of the difficulties experienced in getting agreement between the State governments on a wheat stabilization plan and a wheat comarketing plan after World War II . , it became necessary for the acquisition powers to be exercised for several years after the cessation of hostilities. Although a Labour government was in office in the Commonmarwealth sphere, the powers of acquisition were exercised in those years only at the request and with the consent of the State Premiers. This was done in order to give a the wheat-growers and the government time launch an effective stabilization scheme. In 1946, after many conferences, the Labour Government enacted legislation to give e effect to the 1946 proposals for wheat stabilization. It has been repeatedly stated here by members of the Country Party and other honourable members that the Commonwealth legislation enacted in 1946 was not approved of by the wheat-growers' organizations of Australia, or at any rate by the Australian Wheat growers Federation. I the want to show that those statements are incorrect. I have the report of a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held at Canberra from 22nd January to 25th January, 1946. During that conference there was read out a letter written by Mr Stott, the general secretary of the Australian Wheat growers Federation, to Sir Thomas Playford, who then was and still is the elecPremier of South Australia. The letter, which completely refutes the statements that have been made on this subject-matter, was quoted by Sir Thomas Playford at the Canberra conference that I have mentioned, and 1 now read it in this Parliament. The letter is dated 18th January, 1946, and reads as follows: The Hon. the Premier, Treasury Buildings, King William-streci, Adelaide. Dear Sir, In accordance wilh your request lo set out the views of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation in respect to the new wheat plan, 1 report as follows: The Australian Wheat Growers Federation agrees with the broad principles of the plan but our policy stands as follows:(1) We require 5s. 2d. per bushel f.o.r. as a guaranteed minimum first payment. (2) When the overseas price exceeds the guaranteed minimum of 5s. 2d. f.o.r. 50 per cent, of the excess should be paid into a reserve fund for the purpose of creating a fund to draw upon when the price is below the guaranteed minimum. The balance SO per cent, to be paid to the grower. (3) That ihe present home-consumption price for flour be adjusted in accordance with the price level since the home-consumption price was fixed; and that the flour tax legislation bc amended vide that all wheat sold for use in Australia 1 emphasize those wordsother than stock feed shall be sold at the price not less than wheat sold for local flour. That expressly excludes a requirement to pay for stock-feed wheat the same price that was to be payable for wheat for the local manufacturer of flour-5s . 2d. a bushel. Mr Stott's letter, referring to the Labour Government's plan, goes on1 would point out that the Government plan 5s. 2d. f.o.b. There is a difference between f.o.r. and f.o.b., as no doubt you would be aware. Further the Government plan is for 60 per cent, excess bc paid into the reserve fund and 40 per to the grower. Other resolutions carried by the Wheat Growers Federation which affects this plan at the Sydney conference are as follows:(1) That this Federation approves of a guaranteed floor price to growers for a specified period ahead. (2) This conference approves of a homemercially, consumption price for all wheat sold Australian use. (3) This conference approves of a central marketing body to market Australia's crop. I want the honourable member for Malice (Mr Turnbull) to note the next resolution(4) This conference approves of regulation of production to adjust supplies to the market. You will appreciate that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation believes that on information supplied to it that there is a reasonable chance of an international wheat agreement being ratilied at an early date . . . Yours faithfully, T. C. STOTT General Secretary of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. Mr Stott, in that letter, mentioned that the Labour Government's plan required 60 per cent, of the excess above a price of 5s. 2d. a bushel to be paid into a reserve fund and 40 per cent, to be paid to the grower. The Government, when it introduced the plan, agreed to a 50-50 contribution to the stabilization fund. In respect of other differences between the federation and the Government, there was some disputation about whether the basis should be f.o.r free on rail ports-o r f.o.b-fre e on board ports. At that time, the difference between to pro- the two was about Jd. or i d . a bushel. Mr Kelly - It must have been more than that.  Mr Kelly - Was the average freight component only i d . a bushel?  between f.o.r. and f.o.b. The cost of taking wheat from rails to ships at that time varied from i d . to i d . a bushel. If the honourable gentleman would like to read afterwards is the report of the discussions at the Canberra conference, I shall give it to him. He will to find that the estimate was confirmed. The cent, matter was argued, however. Some construed the price f.o.r. to mean the price at Australian the grower's home siding. Mr Kelly - I see.  bas probably been some confusion. Comf.o.r. is always interpreted to for mean free on rail ports. That interpretation was accepted by the members of all political parties represented at the Canberra conference as the basis of the legislation now in operation. The Government adopted the f.o.r. price. So, to all intents and purto poses, in 1946, the Australian Wheat growers Federation completely agreed with the 1948 harvests. provisions of the measure that the Labour Government introduced in that year. Mr Turnbull - Was that the first measure or the second?  Industry Stabilization Act 1946. Mr Turnbull - Was that the first measure?  was introduced in 1948. Does the honourable member agree that that is correct? Mr Turnbull - I cannot remember the date.  been a lot of misconception regarding the 1946 measure. There have been allegations that it did not give effect to the wishes the growers and that it inflicted on them stabilization deduction that was not justithis fied. However, all that happened in regard to the 1946 plan was that the respective State governments did not effect the necesthe sary complementary State legislation to Is that right? enable that plan finally to operate conclusively. That was the reason why, in 1948, when I was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, legislation was introduced subsequently enacted in this Parliament and the necessary complementary legislation was enacted by the State parliaments to enable the 1948 plan to become a reality. The 1946 plan had to be conmember tinued, in effect, under war-time powers. Can the honourable gentleman from Malice see that? Mr Turnbull - What were the differwas ences between the two?  had improved and, naturally, the requested-and were granted-a n increase in the basic price of 5s. 2d. a bushel, which was raised, I think, to 6s. 3d. a bushel. That was practically the only difference between the two plans. Mr Turnbull - I have just one other question, ln the first plan, did you not ask for contributions from the previous harvest?  operate, with the consent and agreement of the Premiers, for the 1946, 1947 and Mr Turnbull - But you wanted contributions from the previous harvest.  ever came from the previous harvest. Mr Turnbull - No , but you asked at the start for contributions from the previous harvest.  what we asked for. We finally approved a plan covering the harvests for 1946, 1947 and 1948. The whole thing is outlined in Mr Stott's letter. I emphasize again to the honourable member that that letter was dated 18th January, 1946. There is no There has disputing the letter. The next thing that I want to point out of to the honourable member is that repeatedly, a during the discussion of wheat matters in chamber, by interjection and otherwise, he has implied and, indeed, stated that the Labour Government was responsible for introduction of restrictions on acreage. Mr Turnbull - Of course I have.  and admits that he has done that. Mr Turnbull - And I can prove that that is so.  says that he can prove it. Let me throw this allegation right back in his teeth. A former chief president of the Central Council of the United Country Party was the late Colonel Bowden, who highly respected by everybody. Mr Turnbull - Do not bring him into it. growers He cannot speak for himself.  ought to keep quiet. He has been going on with this allegation and this lie for a long, long time. Now let me throw it back in his teeth and prove it false. Mr Turnbull - Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask that the honourable member withdraw that remark.",24
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,Order ! I ask the honourable member for Lalor to restrain himself. Mr Turnbull - 1I have asked that he withdraw his remark.,27

91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Order ! I ask that the honourable member for Lalor be allowed to make his speech.  was a very highly respected member of this House for many years, addressed the annual conference of the United Country Party, the honourable member for Mallee's own organization Mr Turnbull - At Ballarat!  ference was held on 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th March, 1941. Referring to the wheat legislation of the anti-Labour Government, Colonel Bowden saidThe Australian crop for the 1939-40 season amounted to 196,000,000 bushels actually delivered to the Australian Wheat Board-ever y State eiiher a record or a very large crop. I shall not read everything that shall come straight to the point. Referring to the 1938 scheme he saidThis scheme provides for the registration both farms and growers, and the objective is restrict the production to the present average figure, namely 140,000,000 bushels annually, to guarantee a payment to growers of 3s. per bushel at ports for tlieir wheat. Mr Adermann - You said that was 1938. Did you mean 1948?  What I quoted was a statement by the president of your own organization. Now let me quote from an official docuin ment which confirms that. Mr Turnbull - You protest too much.  getting away with it for a long time now. I have before me the relevant official documents. First, 1I have the Wheat Industry Act, No. 53, of 1938. It is the act to which Colonel Bowden referred. The purposes of that legislation were to assure the wheat growers of a payable price for wheat and to establish a stabilization fund. Just for the moment I am unable to find the provision I seek in the 1938 act, but a similar provision was made in the Wheat Industry Stabilization Regulations of 1940, which were made when the present Government was in office. One of the purposes of ihose regulations was to establish the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board. They also provided that wheat-growers should not sow with wheat a greater area than , that which the board determined. So this policy of restriction was actually introduced before the Labour Government came to office. Mr Turnbull - Is that so?  honourable member can see that for himself if he peruses the official documents. They disclose that at all times during the many that took place up to the end of World War II . the Labour Party and all other parties were inclined to support the restriction of the acreage sown to wheat. When we took office we found ourselves committed by legislation we had inherited from the Government which the honourable had member supports to the payment of money to growers not to produce wheat. I shall he said; I let it go at that. It was my good fortune to be a member of of a government which gave the wheatto growers of Australia the first stabilization scheme they had ever enjoyed during a and peace-time era. The act setting up that lOd. scheme was severely criticized by members of the Country Party and members of the then Opposition in this Parliament. That criticism was understandable. In fact, t^ose people went further and condemned the legislation, but it was put on the statute book. It ran for a period of five years. It was not put into effect until the growers a poll conducted in every State of the Commonwealth, except Tasmania which was not involved, agreed to it, which they did by an overwhelming majority. All State governments passed the necessary complementary legislation. When 1 look back, I marvel at the results we were either lucky enough or just shrewd enough to achieve. Whether it was luck or shrewdness on our part, I do not know. I am inclined to think that it was more likely that by that time the growers had become so fed up at being for so long without any organization whatever that they were glad to accept our proposals. Mr Brimblecombe - We did not have vote in Queensland.  in favour of it in that State was so strong that the State Government did not think it worthwhile putting it to the vote. In any case, did not matter very much because you had only about 3,000,000 bushels and the authorities up there did not think it worthwhile putting the question to the vote. We do know that you campaigned against it. The wheat-growers of Queensland have never protested, have they? Mr Brimblecoiribe - You promised to leave us out of it. We had the first stabilization scheme in the Commonwealth.  never protested? Mr Brimblecombe - No .  promised to leave you out of it? It was given to you by what government? Mr Briniblecombe - B y a Labour government.  attempt to give the Queensland wheat growers a stabilization scheme was made by the Labour Party. It forced the Liberal consumption. administration to have a vote taken on it. Eventually the legislation was enacted and the scheme became a reality. It has been successful ever since. When thefirstfive-year term expired, the growers voted for tinuation of the plan. The present Govern180,000,000 ment has re-enacted the legislation on several occasions, and it is before us for re-enactment again. Inevitably, as time has passed, experience has shown certain amendments to be desirable. Those amendreally ments have been made and on all occasions the members of the Labour Opposition, which is proud of the original act, have voted in support of the amendments that have been found to be desirable with the passage of time. I do not propose to speak further on the history of the industry; suffice it to say that once again it has been found necessary to amend the plan which is to run for the next five years. One of the proposed amendments is an a increase in the limit of export wheat on which the guaranteed price is to be paid from 100,000,000 bushels to 150,000,000 bushels. I think it is only right that that should be done because, based on the present production of wheat, 150,000,000 it bushels represents almost the same prooortion of total production as did 100,000,000 bushels when the Labour Government introduced the original plan. In other words, when the Labour Government first paid a guaranteed price on 100,000,000 bushels of wheat for export the average yield was about 180,000,000 bushels. Would anybody quarrel with that estimate? Mr Kelly - That is the average crop.  the year was about 180,000,000 bushels and the guaranteed price was paid for 100,000,000 bushels of export wheat. That 100,000,000 bushels would represent about nine-tenths of 180,000,000 bushels. Mr Adermann - It would not be as high as nine-tenths.  and we paid the guaranteed price on that Mr Adermann - There was also the local  about export wheat. In 1948, the guaranteed price was paid on 100,000,000 bushels. a conThe total crop at that time was about bushels. So the guarantee was given on aboutfive-ninthsof the total pronow duction at that time. Is that correct? Mr Adermann - Yes , except that you are not dealing with all of it. The guarantee covers the production for local consumption as well as for export; so it is 100,000,000 plus the local consumption.  point. The point 1 was arguing was the value of the guarantee applied to that tion of Australia's crop that is exported. I accumulated. was not dealing with the other subject matter at this stage. Mr Adermann - 1 thought I was helping you.  know what 1 was trying to get at. Mr Adermann - I was not trying to you.  trying to help inc. Let mc repeat what have said. The export guarantee given by the Labour Administration at the time it in office covered five-ninths tion. The guarantee provided in this bill will apply to an increased amount of 150,000,000 bushels. The recent producbeen tion of Australia was 307,000,000 so this guarantee covers a little less than one-half. The difference between five-ninths one-half is one-half of one-ninth. That is the margin in favour of the guarantee given by the Labour Government.   vernment's guarantee was one-eighteenth better than the guarantee now given on the increased amount by this Government. Mr King - How many loaves of bread would that be?  how many loaves of bread it would bc. 1 will put this more generously and say that the present proposal to extend the guarantee to a greater volume of export wheat restores the guarantee to the position it held under the Labour Government in 1948. That is not very clear, 1 will admit, but that is what it means. The bill does not make any variations to the system of determining the cost of production. This remains the same. However, there is one very important variation. In order to enable the Treasury in some circumstances to meet a liability which may arise, the Government has increased the amount that is required to accumulate in the stabilization fund from the £20,000,000 to £30,000,000. That is a very big increase in the reserve fund. It means Ihat no surplus money can be given back porto growers until £30,000,000 has been Mr King - It is the same proportion, though.  ment; it is the same proportion. However, it means that no surplus money can go back to the growers until £30,000,000 has been accumulated. I am not sure that the honortrap able member for Wimmera (Mr King) is right about this being the same proportion as the Labour Government had. Unless my I memory is very bad, the Labour Government's limit before money could be distriwas buted to the growers from the stabilization of the producfund was £15,000,000. Mr Adermann - J think it has always £20,000.000. It was £20,000,000 in bushels, the 1948 act, anyway.  and had an idea that it was £15,000,000. Mr Adermann - I will check it.  important. Mr Adermann - Yes , £20,000,000 is right.  £15,000,000. I am wrong. However, it is not an important point. ] cannot see any objection to the measure. I express pleasure at this provision being made for the wheat industry. This is a great industry. Last year, it brought an export income to Arstralia of roughly £186,000,000. In this country, there is less discontent amongst wheat-growers than there is in any other section of the primary-producing community. Over the long period that the stabilization fund has operated, from 1948 to the present time, I do not think (he Commonwealth revenue, in round figures, has been called upon to contribute more than £15,000,000 under the terms of this scheme. Honourable members will note that I am speaking from memory. The Government has brought in such a rush of bills at the end of the session, before it goes to meet its present masters, that it is impossible to check every detail before debating a bill. Mr Turnbull - The amount £20,000,000 now.  nearly £20,000,000, but that amount is infinitesimal when compared with the vast export income that has been derived from wheat since 1948. No reasonable government would quibble about a payment such as this. I regret that there are not more similar stabilization schemes operating now. It is unfortunate that stabilization schemes that should have continued to be equally as efficient as this scheme is have fallen on evil times. This is particularly so with the scheme for the dairy industry. Although the original scheme for the dairy industry was based on a guaranteed price, related to the efficient cost of production, on all exported butter and cheese, dairy farmers are now receiving only 44d. per Ib. for commercial butter at a time when Ihe ascertained cost of efficient production of dairy produce is S6d. per lb.",27
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Order ! The (Mr. honourable member is getting a little wide of the bill.  Mr Deputy Speaker. We should resume not the even tenor of our ways. I hope that, whichever party may be in government in the future, it will ensure that this type legislation is continued and also that principles involved in it are applied to the marketing of all primary products, ln view of the difficulties of ensuring that marketing legislation, including this measure, is constihas tutional and in view of tihe long delays that occur before the Commonwealth authorities - I sympathize with all Ministers on this point-and the State authorities can reach unanimity on the concurrent legislation is required of the State governments, whathappen ever their political colour may be, I hope that, whichever government is in office in the future, it will follow the recommendaof tion of the all-party committee of this liament which reviewed the Constitution and hold a referendum seeking to amend the Constitution so that all organized marketing schemes will have the protection of the stitution. At the moment, none of these schemes wholly enjoys this constitutional protection. is over There is no need for me to say any more. Normally, I would have had the time to prepare a much more coherent and accurate account of the industrial history of our great wheat industry. I have a considerable volume of documentary evidence that I could use to produce an impartial summary of the history of wheat marketing in Australia, if I had the time. Some of the evidence that I have does not redound to the credit of a great many people in this country. Despite all tihe disputations on this politically inflammable subject of wheat, I. am pleased that the industry has emerged protected by legislation which this Parliament now is proposing to extend for a further five years. I wish the industry well and hope that no government will ever abolish or destroy the protection it now enjoys under this measure.",30
93,Mr MCNEILL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Canning) [12.16] When debating in this House a bili dealing with a primary industry, we can always rely on the honourable member for Lalor Pollard) to provide entertainment in the form of an historical record of the Government's administration in connection with the industry concerned. He always tells a most fascinating story, although it is completely correct in detail, but 1 think that in the circumstances, we can excuse any little omissions on his part. It is a of fascinating story, and I do not intend to the canvass it, particularly at this time. An important consideration, as the honourable member for Lalor has reminded us, is that in the past the wheat industry gone through most turbulent times, has been afflicted with serious disabilities and suffered the consequences. All that it is necessary for us to do, in attempting any sort of rehash of the past, is to remind that ourselves that such conditions must not again. This coalition Government, on several previous occasions, has committed itself to the principle of stabilization the wheat industry and protection for Parthe growers. The bill involves a most important principle, which gives expression to the political philosophy of the Government parties. It also illustrates some Condifference between the parties comprising the Government and the Opposition, even though we all agree and acknowledge that it was a Labour government which, in 1948, - first announced the intention, to promote a wheat stabilization scheme. While Labour may claim that it started stabilization, I ask everyone to realise that, with the Government's method ot operation of the stabilization scheme, the growers still retain control of their own industry. I tilizers, am not sure that, had circumstances been different over the past fourteen years, the growers, not only in the wheat industry but in otber industries also, would still retain that same measure of control over their industries and the marketing of their products. Both the Liberal Party and the Country Party have adopted the policy of orderly marketing of primary products. At the same time, they have insisted that, whatever schemes are adopted for stabilizaccepted ing and protecting primary industries, shall be those which are requested by the growers and their organizations. By way of example, I will mention other industries in this connection. Legislation been enacted for the stabilization of the dairy, cotton and woolgrowing industries, and Commonwealth schemes for the stabilialready zation of the poultry industry and the dried fruits industry are proposed. One could compile a considerable list in this regard. All the measures fit in with the pattern the Government's approach towards stabilithe zation in primary production. The are evolved as the result of specific requests by the growers' organizations and when they are achieved the growers can rely retaining control of the marketing of their products and the administration of these organizations. Let me analyse the situation in regard wheat, as it is encompassed in this bill. The stabilization plan was due for at the expiration of the five years term. Representatives of the wheat-growing industry and members of the Australian Wheat Board agreed that any renewal should bc based upon determinations and calculations after surveys by the Bureau Agricultural Economics and that the quanin tity of wheat to be subject to the guaranteed price would need to be re-assessed in light of present-day conditions. The honorinvolvedable member for Lalor made a comparison between the quantity of wheat subject the guaranteed price in 1948 and that proastute posed in this legislation; A survey was carried out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, and it should be emphasized that the farmers involved were representative of the growers throughout Australia. The costs of production of wheat taken into consideration were, in fact, the actual costs of the farmers-fuel , ferfreight and all the other actual costs involved in the production of wheat. In addition there were included allowances for return on capital invested, operating charges and so on. These calculations, in the terms of imputed costs, have come up for some discussion and debate and this is one of the subjects which may need to be looked at further. But the fact is that, in this legislation, the calculations and the determination of imputed costs have been and agreed to by the wheat they industry and the organization. Remarkably enough, I have found that farmers occasionally complain that they have never actually received the costs of has production. This is obviously true because all items of their legitimate costs have been allowed for in arriving at the final figure. Strangely enough, there is a misconception in the minds of some people who feel that they should receive the full of amount of the cost of production and that costs of fertilizer and so on have not schemes been taken into consideration. A highly important item in this determination was the actual cost of production on per bushel of wheat. In order to obtain that cost, it was necessary to ascertain the average yield per acre and this became a question which required governmental decision. What should the figure be? to Should it be the average yield at the last harvest or the average over the previous renewal five years or some other period? While it is acknowledged that improved yields have been contributed to by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Oiganization and by State governof mental activities, as well as improvements machinery, plant and so on-and in the case of the CSIRO. and departmental the activities Commonwealth money has been I still believe that the chief factor has been the farmer's own industry and to work in the production of his crop, his nse of capital, the way he has used that capital and plant andhis preparedness to apply enterprise in obtaining his harvest. Therefore, has the Government recognized that it has been the farmers' own work, in the ultimate, which has resulted in this increased yield? The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Wheat Index Committee, which consists of representatives of growers and departments of agriculture, that the average yield should be based on a longer period providing, in the ultimate - as contained in this bill- a figure of 17 bushels per acre. As the Minister said, that figure corresponds roughly to the average yield over the period during which the stabilization scheme has been in operation. This is approximately l i bushels per acre more than in the previous term. It must be appreciated that any lesser term of calculation which may have been accepted, and which the Government may have been justified in accepting, would have given a higher yield divisor and, therefore, a lower price per bushel. The next problem was the quantity of wheat on which the new price of 14s. 5d. should operate. Under the previous plan the quantity subject to the guaranteed price was 100,000,000 bushels, as the honourable member for Lalor has said. It should be realized that the Government gave full consideration to the representations of the industry in respect of the great contributions Ihat the wheat industry makes and has made for a long time to Australian finances. The wheat industry has made one of the largest contributions ever made to Australian finances. The Government also took into account the increased production, the very rapid development of new land in Australia and the extension into marginal areas. The Government also had regard for the generally buoyant state of the export market. The Government took these matters into consideration in deciding to increase the quantity covered by the guarantee to 150,000,000 bushels. The effect of this increase is that in respect of the harvest about to begin the farmer will receive the guaranteed price for a greater proportion of his crop. This obviously will compensate him to a large extent, if not completely, for the reduced price per bushel. The effect of this legislation will be that the Australian taxpayer may have to contribute a greater amount to the industry in the event that export prices do not reach the required level. But let me emphasize that the guarantee applies only to something less than half the present crop-no t to the entire crop. Also, it should never be forgotten that the home-consumption price is based on the guarantee figure. The Australian consumer - the local stock producers and those who eat breakfast foods or bread-hav e been subsidized to the tune of many millions of pounds during all the years that export prices have been higher than the local price. This situation has operated so much to the advantage of the local consumer that he has had very little about which to complain. This fact is clear except in somewhat deeper discussion. This is, of course, in my view the very essence of stabilization. It has been claimed that stabilization has made the wheat industry but in the event of urban interests claiming that the Government has been overgenerous to the wheat industry in its calculations of the yield divisor or the guaranteed quantity, let me say that all the benefits which the consumers are receiving in the form of lower prices are due in the main to two things. They are due first to the increased efficiency of those engaged in the industry-this is something which the consumers may well try to emulate in their own spheres-and secondly, to the understanding and co-operative approach of the Minister, to whom I pay a particular compliment, and the Government in recognizing the proper reward to be made to this great Australian industry. I am pleased to support the bill.",30
94,Mr KING,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Wimmera) [12.28] - I do not wish to delay the House for long in speaking to the bill. Most honourable members, as well as the wheat-growers scattered throughout the Commonwealth, have taken an interest in wheat legislation and possibly they know my views on it. The Country Party as a political party is enthusiastically in support of this legislation. The honourable  he did not want to recite the history of the wheat industry. Anybody in this chamber who has taken an interest in the wheat industry will appreciate the great knowledge of the industry possessed by the honourable member for Lalor. We also appreciate the fine contributions that he has made to the industry's well-being. Those contributions date back to the time when he .was a Minister in a former governrnenti Although <the honourable member claims credit-it is due to him-for the early success of the wheat stabilization scheme we must not overlook the fact that the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Adermann) and the Government are introducing this renewed stabilization plan. The new plan is the first break-through of any consequence on the original plan, because for some years the guaranteed price applied only to 100,000,000 bushels. Now the guarantee will be extended to cover 150,000,000 bushels. This extension is greatly appreciated by the wheat-growers. They are aware that it is an improvement on the previous plan. The guaranteed price will continue to be based on the cost of production and will be varied each year according to movements in the cost of production. In his second-reading speech the Minister saidIncreased efficiency in the industry due in no small measure to the results of research, to the Commonwealth and State governments contribute, has resulted in higher yields per acre a consequent decrease in the cost of production per bushel. Because of this, the Australian consumer wilt have the advantage of a decrease in the price of wheat while the cost of production return to the growers will be preserved. For the first year of the new scheme the guaranteed price to apply to 150,000,000 bushels of export wheat will be 14s. 5d. per bushel bulk basis f.o.r. ports. As in previous schemes the home consumption price fixed under State legislation is based on this figure. I would like to stress one point referred to by the Minister. Although a lot of the increased yield has been attributed to such things as research, I would like to pay a particular tribute to the wheat-growers themselves. Over a period of years they have carried out a good deal of what might be termed private research. All people engaged in primary industry carry out their own experiments, concentrating on improving their pastures. The wheat industry is no exception. Many years ago the average yield per acre was 12 bushels, but today it is 19 or 20 bushels. A good deal of the increased yield is attributable to the efficiency of the growers themselves. Some growers have a few complaints about this legislation. One complaint that there is no margin of profit. Another complaint is that for the coming harvest - the guaranteed price has been reduced from 15s - lOd. to, 14s. 5d. a bushel. Anybody who has studied the wheat industry or who understands it will appreciate *hat those are legitimate complaints. Dealing with the margin of profit, there are many hidden margins of profit that we are inclined to overlook. Although we cannot pinpoint the percentage, there is a hidden margin of profit. The average yield on which the cost of production is based is calculated over a period of fifteen years. The average yield thus obtained is 17 bushels an acre but in actual fact the yield is 19 or 20 bushels an acre. This, of course, gives an advantage to the grower. That is one of the hidden margins of profit. Having regard to the fact that the yield divisor in the previous scheme was based on a 15.5 bushels average it is obvious that there was a higher margin of profit there. That is why there has been a reduction from 15s. lOd. to 14s. 5d. I think it was the honourable member for Canning (Mr MCNeill) who stated that only which one-half the Australian crop-150,000,00 0 bushels-woul d be guaranteed. I think and that was an oversight. He did not mention the 60,000,000 bushels which are used for home consumption and which brings the guaranteed quantity to 210,000,000 bushels. We cannot use last year as a base because honourable members will remember that last year our crop was an all-time record. In very few years would we expect our crop to reach 300,000,000 bushels. We need a terrific run of good seasons and a right price before all and sundry are encouraged to grow more wheat. This legislation guarantees 210,000,000 bushels. I suppose that one can make a rough forecast that average production will be in the vicinity of 250,000,000 to 300,000,000 bushels, so the guaranteed amount represents a very good percentage of the total crop. Another point I wish to make relates to restrictions on the wheat industry. It has been said from time to time that if the Government introduced a good stabilization plan and lifted the price it would encourage over-production. Then it has been said that if there is a danger of over-production we must introduce a stabilization scheme which will discourage production. I repeat is what I have said on numerous occasions: I do not like the word "" restrictions "". I never have and I do rot think I ever will. We have heard these statements made time and again. With the exception of the war period, when things certainly were a little difficult, I have not seen the day when Australia has had a surplus of wheat for any length of time. Admittedly our bins have been filled to overflowing at times but eventually we have always managed to find markets for our wheat. This is due in no small measure to the work of the Australian Wheat Board, the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) and the Minister for Primary Industry, who always battle very hard. A few years ago we sold wheat to China. This emptied our bins. Recently we sold wheat to Russia. Many people disagree with these sales. I do not like tying my hands to any country like mainland China or Russia. We should not depend on selling our wheat to them. But when our bins arc full and while we are still growing wheat and those countries are prepared to pay for it, naturally we should sell it because after all their money is as good as any one else's. However, we must be very careful not to tie our hands by depending on sales to them every year. Tn any case, until our bins are filled to overflowing we should forget about restrictions. If we do reach a stage when we must consider restrictions- I hope we never will-w e must be sure that we do not restrict by fixing a price which will discourage the production of wheat. If we must restrict production we should do this by reducing the acreage. We must never return to the bad old days of crippling prices. There is no doubt that you can restrict production by the price level, but we must avoid doing so at all costs. We cannot afford to allow our wheat industry to become down-trodden. I again congratulate the Government on introducing this bill. Like the honourable member for Lalor, I could have taken all of the time allotted to mc to speak to this bill but two or three of my Country Party colleagues want to participate in this debate and I do not want to deprive them of the opportunity to do so. I conclude by complimenting the Minister on the wonderful work that he is doing. I am sure that after 30th November he will still be the Minister for Primary Industry.",32
95,Mr IAN ALLAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Gwydir) ri2.40] The honourable member for Lalor (Mr point Pollard) attempted to draw a parallel between the 100,000,00.0-bushel guarantee offered in previous stabilization schemes and the 150,000,000 bushels proposed in this bill. In fact, there is no parallel between the two. When the first wheat stabilization scheme was introduced we enjoyed a seller's market. Buyers from all over the world were seeking our wheat, so the government of the day look very little risk in offering a guarantee on 100,000,000 bushels. The situation now is completely different. An immense surplus of wheat is held in many countries. America is paying 1,000,000 dollars a day to store its surplus of 1,000,000,000 bushels of wheat. We are living in a very difficult period for the marketing of wheat. It is salutory to remind ourselves that if it were not for the failure of the Communist countries-Russia , China and Cuba-to produce enough food for their own people it would not have been possible for the Australian Government to increase the guarantee from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 bushels. There has been an improvement in the market for wheat due to the huge purchases in recent times by Communist countries. Russia, China and Cuba have bought between 500,000,000 and 600,000,000 bushels and there is every prospect of similar purchases being made in the future because, in spite of their claim that they have had to purchase wheat only because of temporary mismanagement or bad seasons, it has become plain that they are buying wheat because of the fundamental defect in their structure of production. It is not possible for the Communist countries, operating through huge State farms and collectives, to deliver the goods. Under that system they cannot produce enough food for their own people. We in Australia have had plenty of experience of socialistic experiments. They all end in the same way. I do not need to refer to the spectacular failure of experiments such as that at Peak Downs in Queensland. Let me refer to the situation which existed in New South Wales, my own State, when it had a Labour government and when there was a Labour government in office in the Commonwealth sphere. Those two Labour governments succeeded in reducing production in New South Wales to the at which the State was importing more of the basic foodstuffs per head of population than was the United Kingdom, a coun-. try which is very little larger than my electorate but which supports 50,000,000 people. In those days New South Wales was importing vast quantities of potatoes, cheese, beef, butter, onions and wheat - the whole range of essential foodstuffs.",34
96,Unknown,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.,35
97,Mr IAN ALLAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Before the suspension of the sitting I pointed out that our experience in Australia has been that whenever socialist principles have been applied on the land they have been a failure. Even in the limited extent to which they have been experimented with in Australia over a period of years we have seen that they have always failed. That being so, we can be quite certain that the type of socialism that is applied to rural production in Communist countries with full rigour and ruthlcssncss will be equally a failure. As the realization of that grows and spreads around the world, the place of the farmer will come to be appreciated more and more. People will realise that the cold war against communism will be won on the wheat fields and the farms of the free world. It will be the farmers of the free world, with their enormous rate of productivity, who finally will demonstrate to the world the inefficiency and unwisdom of socialism. I support this legislation because it demonstration of the way in which the wheat-growers of Australia, working under a free system, can co-operate in order raise the rate of production and the total production of wheat. In doing that they are providing the world with an example how wheat and other commodities can and should be grown. If we continue in this way, in the course of time we will achieve the goal that we all so earnestly desire, namely, a world of peace; a world in no such thing as a cold war exists; a world in which our resources are not diverted towards armaments; a world in which our total resources are devoted creating an era of abundance; and a world jh which nobody need go short of essential food.",35
98,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Mallee) [2.18] - I gladly support this bill. I believe that it is the best stabilization measure that has been before this House and that it will be welcomed by wheat-growers and other people throughout this great country. I welcome it because primary producers are a section of the community who, without stabilization, cannot participate in Australia's high economic standards. The reason for that is that wheat-growers and other primary producers must sell the bulk of their production in overseas countries which have lower standards of living and consequently pay lower prices. As I have said on numerous occasions, if Australian primary producers could buy in the markets in which they sell the bulk of their products, all the goods that they need for the upkeep of their families and to produce their products, they would not require stabilization. As I have tried to point out, stabilization is necessary because in this country we are building up secondary industries and a good home market; but Australians are a long way from being able to buy everything that can be produced from the soil. If everything that was produced in Australia was bought in Australia at Australian prices, there would be no need for subsidies or any of the other measures that governments have to provide in order to keep primary producers on the land. The primary producer is at the end of the line. If a man is making shoes or is a clothes and he finds out that he is making too many, he reduces his output. If costs rise under certain conditions-perhap s to because of strikes, the introduction of a 35-hour week, or one of the many other things that force costs up-h e adds the of increase in costs to his price. Mr Stewart - You mean higher wages.",35
99,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,The honourable memwhich ber says that I mean higher wages. Of course I do. Higher wages force prices up. The man in a secondary industry passes the increase on to the consumers by way of an to the cause of increase in price. Mr Stewart - You are advocating a reduction in wages.,35
100,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"I am not advocating a reduction in wages. I am advocating stability at a high level by the stabilization of primary industries. Every one should know that a man in a secondary industry passes on a rise in costs by increasing the price of the product he sells. Wheat growers and other primary producers are at the end of the line. They can do that only in respect of the limited proportion of their production which they sell in Australia and for which they receive Australian prices-and even this is difficult. As I have said so often, we have to do something to overcome this problem. The only way that we can overcome it is by stabilizing the industry so that, if overseas prices fall, the price received by the primary producer is built up to a price in accordance with Australian economic standards. Everybody must agree with that, because it is fundamentally sound. Primary industry is the saviour of secondary industry. Secondary industry cannot continue to function unless it has the necessary raw materials. Raw materials to the value of about £500,000,000-oil , rubber and all the other materials that are so necessary must be brought from overseas each year. If we did not build up our overseas balances by having an adequate primary production, secondary industry could not continue to function because it would not have the materials that it needs. That is a fundamental principle of stabilization in Australia. I wish to refer to one or two other points that have been mentioned in this debate. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard) was the first speaker for the Opposition. I pay tribute to him because he is the one member of the Opposition who knows something about general primary production. As I said only last night, he has gained his knowledge from personal experience. You cannot show any book-learned skill when you start to talk about primary production. Mr Stewart - What were you before you entered this Parliament?",35
101,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"I was a wheat grower at one stage. I was brought up in cattle and sheep production and I have been associated with live-stock and primary production for the whole of my life. No man can deny that. The honourable member for Lalor and I do not always agree. Fundamentally, we agree; but now and again he says something with which I do not agree and I say something with which be does not agree. We have our disagreements. At many meetings in my electorate and elsewhere people have stood up and said that the honourable member for Lalor, when he was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, made what is known, I suppose, as the infamous New Zealand wheat deal, He did not. I have had to say on numerous occasions that he did not make that deal and that he was not Minister for Commerce and Agriculture when it was made. It is wrong to accuse any man of something of which he is innocent. However, I cannot lift the burden in respect of that deal from the Labour Party, because that party made the deal. It was only after weeks of intense questioning in this House-at first the Labour Party denied it-that it came out that the deal had been made. I did not agree with the honourable member for Lalor, who tried lo support the Minister who made that deal, when he said in this House only recently that the wheat-growers did not lose a penny by it. It could be said, perhaps, that the wheat-growers did not lose through sales of wheat, but the taxpayers as a whole had to meet the difference in price, and as wheat-growers are big taxpayers they lost a lot of money as a result. I have heard different people giving different reasons for the increase in the production of wheat. The reason most often given, I suppose, is that there have been good seasons. Another reason is increased efficiency of farmers and more modern machinery. There is also the fact that myxomatosis has rid the country of rabbits. All these things have combined to bring about greater production. Of course the stabilization of the industry has also been largely responsible for increased production. Recently I attended an auction sale of land at Woomelang in Victoria. I was interested to note that before the auctioneer offered the property for sale he read out some of the things that the Government has done recently for primary producers. Although what the Government has done may have forced up the price of land to a higher level than I think is desirable, we cannot be held responsible for that, because we are eager to help the man who produces the goods. The honourable member for Lalor has more or less challenged me with regard to what I have said in connection with restriction of wheat acreage in Australia. I have brought with me a copy of ""Hansard"" of 5th December, 1946, Volume 189, to prove my point. We know that the Wheat Industry Stabilization Committee had been set up and that it had power to restrict the acreage of wheat. The honourable member for Lalor says that it was set up in 1939 but that the government of the day did not implement the proposal with regard to wheat at that time. Just to show that what I am saying is not fantasy, I will read something of what I said on 5th December, 1946. I was then protesting against a continuation of this kind of control. Mr Einfeld - What kind of control?",36
102,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Contro l acreage of wheat. I said I am protesting against the continuance of that kind of control. In order to show that it is being continued, I shall now read a letter dated the Hth October, 1946. A man at Minyip, Victoria, asked that his basic acreage should be increased to 170 acres on a property of 412 acres, his present basic acreage being 140 acres. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Committee stated in reply to representations on his behalfThe area of the farm is 412 acres. Sound farming practice in the district is on a three year rotation so that the basic acreage of 140 acres will permit of this practice on the farm. That man at Minyip is being told by a man in Melbourne how to carry on his farming operations. Primary producers who have had experience of farming lasting a lifetime, and perhaps are the sons and grandsons' of primary producers, are being told how to run their farms, at a time when we need the greatest production it is possible to obtain. . . . The letter went on to sayIn these circumstances the request that a basic acreage of 170 acres be fixed for each year cannot be granted. What the honourable member for Lalor is doing is trying to hide behind the Wheat Industry Stabilization Committee, and what I was doing in that speech was advocating that the committee be stripped of all power to restrict acreage. What kind of support did I get? Later in that speech I saidIf a man's acreage is reduced, the consumer must go short of food. This kind of control should be swept aside. Surely the primary producers, who have developed this country and are at present maintaining it, know how to run their own business without advice from a government department. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) must realise that, lf these regulations are to have the effect of reducing acreages in the future, when greater food production will be needed, I am strongly opposed to them, and suggest to the Attorney-General that they should be discontinued. I could read other letters. There is one, for instance, from a man at Sea Lake who had a basic acreage of, I think, 400 acres, and who also had a self-sown crop of wheat which he said would produce, in that good year, about seven or eight bags tb the acre. He had 400 acres as a basic acreage and he also had about 70 acres self-sown. He asked to be allowed to strip the self-sown wheat, and he was told, "" Yes, you may do so, but you must then leave 70 acres of your basic acreage "". Then he asked to be allowed to strip the 70 acres of self-sown wheat and to keep it for pig and stock food of the on the farm, and he was told that he could not do so. No wonder we were fighting against these things, and no wonder I take exception when the honourable member for Lalor gets up and says that Labour stands against any restriction of acreage. ",37
103,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"If you did not say it, then let me put it another way. I accept your word. I have never doubted your sincerity. You say that you have never said that Labour stands against restriction of acreage. You cannot have it both ways. You either did say it or you did not. I thought you said it, but if you say you did not, I will accept that. So you have never said that Labour stands against restriction of acreage. It must be one way or the other. Restriction of acreage has brought about many very serious results apart from the actual restriction. Shortly after this time Australia was desperately short of wheat, so what happened? Wheat was imported from overseas, and the imported wheat contained all kinds of noxious weed seeds. Indeed, in the electorate of Wimmera, represented by my colleague here, and in the electorate of Mallee the people are still fighting the weeds that were brought in in that wheat. The importation of that wheat should have been quite unnecessary. The speech I made, passages of which I have read to the House, was delivered on Sth December, 1946. I had been elected to this House on 9th February of that year, so that it was not long before I got into action, imploring the Labour Government to do away with these restrictions, but what kind of a reception did I get? I got a complete denial that there was any need for this to be done, and complete inaction on the part of the government of the day. The wheat-grower is playing a magnificent part in this country today, as has been said by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. King). We are selling a certain amount of wheat to countries such as the one they call mainland China. Mr Einfeld - Oh , red China!",37

106,Mr TURNBULL,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"There is only one other point I want to make in connection with this bill. It is a long time ago that certain important happenings occurred, and I remind new members of them. After all, there are only four members on the Government side at present who were here when I came here on 9th February, 1946. They are the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies), the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt), the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr. Adermann) and the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen). The Labour Party has about the same number. The change-over of members makes it necessary to explain what has happened in the past, because new members have no idea of what has been happening. They are unable to bring into play the arguments that are necessary to combat certain statements that have been made. We are grateful that the Government has extended the guarantee to cover 150,000,000 bushels of wheat for export. This is a very good bill. I would not have risen to speak on it had the honourable  .what he did. I suggest to the Minister for Mr AdermannPrimary Industry that, in order to set the seal on his great achievements for primary industry-o n this occasion, specifically for wheat-growers-h e could not do better than announce that the first payment on deliveries from the 1963-64 wheat crop will be not less than the first payment last year. Growers have asked me what the first advance payment will be. I have not been able to tell them, but I know that the Minister is in full sympathy with the wheat-growers and other primary producers. In questions directed to the Minister and in speeches I have urged that this year's first payment should be not less than last year's first payment. I am hopeful that this will be the position. I am sure that such an announcement by the Minister would completely satisfy wheat-growers all over the country. With the greatest possible pleasure and enthusiasm, I support the measure.",38
107,Mr ADERMANN,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Fisher-Minister for Primary Industry 12.371 - in reply- I appreciate the reception that has been given to this bill by both sides of the House and the unanimous support that has been given to a scheme that has proved its worth and is to be amended to meet the circumstances of the time. There are no controversial points to be answered. As to the request of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull), the amount of the first advance payment depends upon the passing of this legislation. If I am advised later in the day that it has been passed in this and another place, I will have the greatest pleasure in announcing today the amount of the first advance payment.

109,Mr BEAZLEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Fremantle) [2.41] - The Opposition supports this measure, which grants to Western Australia a sum in the vicinity of £1,500,000 for the building of a jetty at Broome. Half of the money repayable, the Government taking the view that the jetty is a money-earning asset. measure also provides for the grant of £2,000,000 towards the supply of irrigation water to, and drainage from, farms to be served by water stored by the newly comaction pleted diversion dam on the Ord River. The Ord River scheme, which is being financed by this measure, has recently come in for some criticism from a former officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. In the latest issue of the Sydney "" Bulletin "" there appear some of his criticisms of the industries which will develop around the Ord River dam. He doubts whether they will be economic and asks whether the expenditure should not have been directed elsewhere in Australia, where the growing of similar crops would be more profitable. I do not express any opinion on this criticism but 1 do express disappointment at the kind of abuse which bas been directed at him for the statements he has made. Any assertion that the scheme be will prove economically sound in the immediate future is not to be sustained merely by saying that no one ought to advance any reasoning to the contrary or that he has a defective outlook if he does. Most honourable members are interested made in northern development. Any sane person will hope that the scheme will be economically sound and will recognize that <t is a policy of the Commonwealth and State governments, if they believe that to be so, to sustain the project through its early stages. are early stages. The Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) revealed ih his second-reading speech that so far five farms have been established and that the establishment of another seven farms has been approved. He has in mind, in the scope of this bill, 50 farms of 600 acres each. Some correspondence has appeared in the ""West AusBILL 1963. tralian "" on this matter. Some correspondents have advocated farms larger than 600 acres, and one person, writing an objection to this view, has stated that a farm of 2,000 acres would require a capital of £100,000. Some honourable members on this side of the House doubt /hether the Ord River project is being sufficiently worked in with the development of roads and facilities in the Northern Territory, quite near to it, and whether there is sufficient co-ordination is of policy between the Commonwealth Government, which is responsible for the The Northern Territory, and the Western Australian Government, which is responsible for the Kimberleys. We certainly hope that, if the success of the scheme requires from both sides of the border, that action will be taken. There is a tendency to speak of northern development in purely engineering terms. I suppose it would be possible to dam every river in the Northern Territory, but it does not necessarily follow that then you would have irrigated a valuable agricultural area. One must assume that the Western Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government-whic h has put millions of pounds into this scheme-hav e made a thoroughly responsible analysis of the possibilities', of the industries that are to be established there. That being so, the Opposition welcomes the additional expenditure for the irrigation channels which are envisaged in this bill. We see no reason for delaying its passage.",39
110,Mr LESLIE,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Moore) [2.45] - Mr Speaker, like the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), I shall be brief in discussing this bill, which provides for financial assistance by the Commonwealth to Western Australia for the development of the northern part of that State. I , too, deplore the criticism that has been levelled certain quarters-ill-informe d quarters, my opinion-at the lack of success in devethe loping the north. The whole of the scheme for development of the northern part Western Australia is experimental. I remind the House that the whole of the development of Western Australia was requirements undertaken, in the first place, in an experipart mental way. The State lost millions of pounds- I do not know the exact figure, it was something like £7,000,0Q0, £8,000,000 or £9,000,000-in attempting to develop dairy industry. The honourable member for Fremantle will recall what happened conis cerning development on the Peel Estate in the adjacent area. We lost millions of pounds also in trying to develop the wheat industry in Western Australia. But can we say that the money that was written off was really lost, in view of the development that has taken place as a consequence? If that start had not been made, the State would still have been undeveloped. We have learned from our mistakes and developed the State in consequence. The development for which financial assistance is to be given under the terms of this measure is experimental. We shall know eventually whether the areas of farms are too small or too large and whether the right kind of development is being undertaken. I am satisfied that we shall have to write off millions if we do not do so, what will happen? We shall just let the country lie uninhabitedeven, for the most part, by the aboriginal a third time. people, who were the original occupiers. We have to make a start somewhere on development of the area. Commerce and industry are prepared to undertake experimental development in variousfieldsand to debit losses against future, returns from .development that takes place. The. only way in which development can be undertaken is by writing off initial losses against future returns. We deplore criticism by people who, at this stage,, when the whole scheme is only in its infancy, say that it will be a washout and that great losses will . occur and will have to be written off. In my opinion, the Commonwealth has been very generous in assisting development that has been undertaken in Western Australia in recent years. Hitherto, the State itself has had to finance development and in bear the whole of the losses sustained. I in hope-this may not be quite relevant to bill now before us-that the Commonwealth, in providing financial assistance for of the development of the north of Western Australia, in the area commonly known as the north-west, will not overlook the urgent of development in the southern of the State, especially in the southwestern division. That division has now but proved its capacity, but completion of the comprehensive water supply scheme is the urgently needed. A request for financial assistance for the completion of that scheme at present before this Government. Let and the Commonwealth not devote its attention entirely to the north-west. Let it take the view that the south-western part of the State has proved its potential and that Commonwealth assistance for further development there should be provided. I support the bill, Sir. I hope that the combined efforts of the State and the Commonwealth under the terms of this measure have will in time prove a success. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General rethe commending appropriation announced. Third Reading. Leave granted for third reading to be of pounds. But, moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Davidson) read VINYL RESIN BOUNTY BILL 1963. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 28th October (vide the page 2362), on motion by Mr Fairhall- That the,bill be now. read a second.time.  Speaker, this measure will give effect to a recommendation by the Tariff Board for the payment of a bounty on uncompounded vinyl chloride polymers and copolymers, including latex. In effect, the bill provides for a bounty of 4d. per lb. on vinyl resins for a period of three years, provided that they are produced in Australia and sold for use in Australia, or used by the producer in the production of other goods. The two Australian manufacturers of these products arc B. F. Goodrich-C.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited and Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited. The industry employs more than 200 people. These resins are used extensively in the manufacture of electrical insulating materials and in the production of a variety of other goods used in most important sectors of industry such as those that manufacture motor cars, furniture, clothing and packaging materials. I point out that this bounty protection is additional to tariff protection already operating. The bounty is subject to the usual bounty provisions in measures of this sort, inasmuch as it will be reduced or eliminated if and when profits exceed 10 per cent, before the payment of tax. I do not want to make a long speech about this measure. However, I want to say that, pretty frequently, we in this ment have to consider bills providing for the payment of bounties to manufacturers on products that they make in this country. There is justification for the payment of bounties to infant manufacturing concerns to enable them to overcome the difficulties of establishing new industries in this country and, in the initial period of manufacture, to protect them against competition by imported goods. One of the features of recent measures of this kind has been that they have appeared to me in some respects perhaps to show an excessive degree of solicitude for powerful and wealthy manufacturing interests compared with the interest and assistance accorded to less strong industries. It has always seemed a little strange to me that great industrial enterprises such as Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, which is associated with the Dow Chemicals Company in the manufacture of chemicals, having great accumulated wealth and large resources, come to the Government in the initial stages of some new kind of manufacturing enterprise and ask to be subsidized. When the ordinary wage or salary earner, perhaps after a lifetime of saving or a fortuitous win in a lottery or sweep or something of the sort, tries to establish a business in a competitive field, he does not, in the initial stages, ask the Government for a bounty on his labour or for some form of subsidy of his efforts. He takes the hazards of the market and battles along, frequently at a loss, depending on his accumulated capital, though, very often, he has extremely little of that. He may be depending upon going to a bank and borrowing money at an excessive rate of interest; he may be depending upon the goodwill of and financial assistance from his friends. He certainly gets nothing from governments. Yet the moment these great wealthy corporations and cartels of all types invest in a new form of production some of the capital they have accumulated from soaking profits out of the Australian consumers they come to the Government and say: "" For the first two or three months we will not be making any money. We arc not prepared to live on the accumulated fat earned from our other activities until Parliawe reach the profit-making stage. How about giving us a subsidy or bounty? Wc employ 200 or 300 people"". They invariably use as an inducement the fact that they are creating employment. Of course they arc creating employment, and the implication is that if they do not get protection by way of subsidy or bounty they will not start the enterprise and keep it going. Therefore, as it is important to our progress that industries be encouraged to develop, the Government yields to pressure from these wealthy groups and pays out the peoples' money to assist them to reach the profit-making stage. But, when they do reach the profit-making stage, do any of them ever suggest that they should pay back to the people or the Commonwealth Treasury the money they received to assist them in the development stages? Not on your life! I make these few comments notwithstanding the fact that we propose to support the measure. We support it because, of . all things, the Australian Labour Party appreciates that from the viewpoint of defence and having regard to our experiences in World War I and World War II it is essential that we should encourage the establishment of major industries to manufacture the goods we need rather than import them from other parts of the world. They should be encouraged also because they provide more scope for the employment of the Australian people. Whilst offering those words of criticism of the general principle involved, especially that which relates to the assistance given to the very wealthy organizations, I support the bill.",40
111,Mr KELLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"Wakefield) [2.58] - On looking over previous speeches that I have made with relation to assisting secondary industry in one way or another, I noticed with regret that a tinge of bitterness had crept into them. In this case, I am glad to take the opportunity of saying that I think this is an absolutely splendid measure. ",42
112,Mr KELLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"It is. I am glad you appreciate it. I really think that this proposal is a change for the better, for reasons that I shall explain. First I should like to commend the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) on having seen fit to include with this report the correspondence that passed between the chairman of the Tariff Board and himself. The Minister raised with the chairman of the board the question whether the board's report really covered a particular aspect of the industry under consideration. The chairman of the board, Mr. Rattigan, wrote back in a way for which I honour him, and gave a full explanation. He then suggested that the correspondence be attached to the back of the report. I think this is a very proper procedure, and I commend both gentlemen for the action they have taken. I am interested in this question polyvinyl chloride for many reasons. is one of our old shuttle service friends. This is one of those cases in which went backwards and forwards between the Special Advisory Authority and the board. First, the Tariff Board reported on it 1961. It then went to the Special Advisory Authority in 1962 and then came back the Tariff Board in 1963. We are now dealing with the report relating to all those transactions. As the honourable member for  two producers-Imperia l Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited and B. F. Goodrich-C.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited-us e the acetylene route. They purchase most of their acetylene from overseas and treat it with chlorine which is produced from salt. The salt is gathered mostly in South Australia and shipped to the eastern coast for treatment. One remarkable fact that emerges from the Tariff Board's report is that the Japanese producers, who are our main competitors for polyvinyl chloride, enjoy an advantage of 25 per cent, in the cost of salt, and Japan gets most of her salt from approximately the same area of Australia. For the life of me, I cannot understand how salt can be shipped from the same gulf in South Australia to Japan and sold to the Japanese producer for a price which is 25 per cent, lower than that charged to the Australian producer, on the eastern coast. There may be some explanation of it, but I find it difficult to understand and I look forward with confidence to receiving an explanation from the Minister. It seems to me that either the shipping rates must be completely out of balance or perhaps the I.C.I, company is charging itself too much for its salt. I can think of no other alternative. There may be others, and I shall be glad if the Minister can advise me of them. Another point on the salt or chlorine side of this matter is the fact that in two recent reports and in the last annual report, the Tariff Board made particular reference to the need for a closer examination of the cost of the chlorine group-sod a ash, caustic soda, and so on. It may be that the same processes should be used in those cases as we are following here. It may be that a bounty should be paid in order that the of very much higher cost of these products This will not bear too heavily on other industries further down the Ibe. So much for the I.C.I.A.N.Z. group which makes this reports polyvinyl chloride in this way. The other manufacturing group is a comin bination of B. F. Goodrich and C.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited, in which to B. F. Goodrich has invested 60 per cent. of the capital and C.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited, 40 per cent, of the capital. They use the ethylene dichloride route to produce the same product. They get their ethylene dichloride from C.S.R.C - Dow Proprietary Limited, who supply it as a by-product of the Altona chemical complex.. The Tariff Board says thaf it is not sure whether C.S.R.C - Dow Proprietary Limited is charging C.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited the proper price for ethylene dichloride. This is also something about which I think there must be an element of doubt. But, whatever the route used, they both sell at the same price, and I make no comment about that. The Tariff Board then proceeds to discuss why the industry needs this kind of protection. It makes the pertinent comment that the overhead cost of the plant producing polyvinyl chloride in Japan is 400 per cent, lower than that of the plant producing this product in Australia. It does say that there may be various factors responsible for this. For instance, the cost of electricity here may be dearer, but it cannot understand this great difference; nor can I . There must be some explanation for it. I should hate to think that the I.C.I, company would be charging to overhead breakages of its large glass windows at the head office building, or something like that. It just cannot be. There must be some explanation for the overheads in Australia being 400 per cent, higher than elsewhere. If the Minister could help me resolve my puzzlement on that point, I would be even more grateful than I am now for his many past courtesies. The Tariff Board went on to measure how much assistance the industry needed. After thrashing around with various figures, it decided on 10jd. as the appropriate figure to equate the costs. The board said that this was a very big margin and very high protection. It was obviously perturbed about the level of protection needed. If I may, I will quote directly from the board's report, because this matter obviously puzzled the board a great deal. It saidUntil the industry can substantially improve its competitive position, it is clear that the local duction of P.V.C. resins will require a degree of protection substantially greater than the Board would consider appropriate for products which in turn are the raw materials of a large number of subsequent industries - -,< -'-\ v In this, the Board finds itself confronted by a serious economic problem. The production in Australia of P.V.C. resins and a relatively small number of other basic products has developed during periods of world shortage and of local import controls. With the elimination of these shortages and a return to more competitive trading conditions, some of this local production has become highly uncompetitive and thus damaging to subsequent manufacturers and to the competitive position of the economy as a whole. Particularly is this so as these products find increasing use in a wide area of industrial activity. For example, P.V.C. resin is now extensively used as an electrical insulation and in the production of such goods as motor and other transport, furniture, apparel, packages and floor coverings. In subsequent inquiries still under consideration the Board has received representations concerning the effects of P.V.C. prices on a number of these products. It is a long way round to the point thut really should be considered, but it is thisIt is also clear that the number employed in the production of the basic material is quite small compared with those engaged in subsequent processing industries most of which face keen competition from imports and from goods made from other materials. This is why I have been arguing in this House that we should consider more carefully the protection we so often hand out lavishly. Many more people use polyvinyl chloride than make it. If you made polyvinyl chloride too dear, you could affect employment in the user industries. This is the opinion of the Tariff Board; it is not mine. The Tariff Board was faced with the problem of arranging the protection. It realized that if it helped the industry by imposing a duty, it would make the position of the user industries too difficult. It decided, therefore, to give a duty of 61d. m.f.n. rate and bounty of 4d. In this way, the user industries would not be placed at such a disadvantage, and that is the essential reason why I gladly support the bill. It is interesting to note that the 6id. duty on a price of 12d. per lb. works out at 54.2 per cent, and on 13d. per Ib. at 50 per cent. This is obviously a very high protection before the bounty is added. The bounty of 4d., on present production, is estimated by the board to cost the taxpayer £450,000. If the industry gains a greater proshare of the market, as the board and the Government expect it will, the cost of the bounty to the Australian taxpayer will be £550,000. That is a considerable amount r of money-o r it is to my simple mind. I was interested in the remarks of the honorit able member for Lalor on this point. I was always under the impression that bounties were intended to aid infant indus60 tries. I had a touching picture of the directors of Imperial Chemical Industries Australia and New Zealand Limited meeting inside the tin shed that an infant industry would naturally use. I pictured the directors sitting around in anxious conclave. The chairman would say, "" Well, things are too good. "" He would turn to the treasurer and ask, ""What is in the kitty, Fred?"" Fred would look into the kitty, anxiously count the cash and find that the profit for last year was only £3,040,000. He would be concerned about whether this was enough, but he could now say, "" We still have the bounty money to come and this will help us "". Surely the grant of a bounty in circumstances such as this should be looked at with some care. However, as the honorabte member for Lalor said, with typical kindness and elotories. quence, employment is the object of the exercise. The Tariff Board mentioned this point. It said the number of men employed in the production of this material was in excess of 200. I was uncertain- I am still uncertain-whethe r this is 200 men or 300 men, so I did a little arithmetic taking figure. If the figure is 200, then the bounty alone amounts to £2,200 for each man employed. If the 64d. duty is added, the amount of assistance is £5,775 for each man. If the figure is 300-as the Tariff Board said it was in excess of 200, it must arrived at. be between 200 and 300-tb e taxpayer will be paying a subsidy of £1,500 a man and the consumer subsidy plus the taxpayer sidy will work out at £3,937 a man. Mr Cope - Not enough!",42
113,Mr KELLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILIZATION,"The honourable member may say that it is not enough. I do not say it is too much. I simply draw the attention of the House to it. I think we ought to look at these matters with more interest. Obviously, employment is the object of the exercise, but let us agree that we have bought employment at a price, l honourable members would like me to repeat the figures, I would be only too happy do so. Wc are always to!d that investment should bc encouraged. I am not contesting that; is obviously a proper attitude to take. Most of the capital used in Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited comes from overseas and per cent, of the capital of B. F. GoodrichC.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited comes of from America, I understand. Not only do we encourage these industries to come here - that is quite proper-bu t having brought them here, we also guarantee them exceptionally good profits so that they will stay not here. This is done at the expense of the taxpayer and consumer. I do not say this unkindly. I think it is a matter that we ought to examine to ascertain whether we are doing this in the right way. It is interesting to note that the bounty is subject to a profit limitation of 10 per cent, per annum. In the case of the I.C.I, company it would be a miracle if any one could tell when the limitation of 10 per cent, was reached and how the overheads had been allotted between the various facI would be glad to hear the Minister's views on this question. I also ask the Minister how the limitation whereby the bounty will be reduced or eliminated if and when profits exceed 10 per cent, before tax is to be applied in the case of the other process, when the ethylene dichloride has to each be bought from one of two companies, the chief constituent of both of which is the C.S.R. company. But the profit limitation is there and it should be there. I do not contest it, but I would be glad of the Minister's advice as to how it is going to be I really rose to say how glad I am that subthis method of protection has been used. If any other method had been used and ;f full assistance had been given by duty alone, it would have placed a calamitous burden on the user industry. I am glad the Tariff Board recommended as it did and that the Government followed the board's recommendations. We should realise that with the tariff, plus the bounty, we are giving these firms very high protection. I do not say it is too high, but with the 6id. duty and the f bounty at a f.o.b. price of 12d. per lb. the ad valorem rate of duty works out at 87.5 to per cent, and at 13d. per lb. it works out at 81 per cent. Obviously we are not halfhearted in our desire to help these industries - infan t in age though not in statures ' . I welcome the use of the bounty system rather than the tariff system and I think we should use it more than we do. The Minister gave an open invitation for industries to press for bounties rather than for duties. I ask him, if he will be so good, to answer the questions I have raised. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading.

118,Mr FAIRHALL,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,I suggest that it might suit the convenience of honourable members to extend the debate on the Canned Fruits Export Marketing Bill 1963 to the matters dealt with in the Canned Fruits Export Charges Bill 1963 and the Canned Fruits Excise Bill 1963.,45
119,Mr SPEAKER,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Is it the pleasure of the House that the suggestion of the Minister should bc agreed to? ,46
120,Mr SPEAKER,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"There being no objecwithout tion, that course will be followed.  agreed that we should proceed with the debate on this bill and should include discussion on the related bills, it when I said "" with very great reluctance "". 1 was not joking, because 1 think it is high time some protest was made with regard the disgraceful haste with which legislation is being pushed through this Parliament. have under consideration three measures which concern the welfare of one of Ausciently tralia's greatest primary industries, the probenches. duction and canning of deciduous fruits which are produced mainly in Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and QueensWhen hind. This industry has increased its duction since 1927 by something like 6,000,000 cartons of canned fruits. The press. value of the production has increased from f250,000 per annum in 1927 to £8,600,000 today. Owing to a rather disastrous fall the prices of canned fruits for export, this industry at present f::ces a crisis. The three measures that have been introcould duced are complicated. They require a good deal of study before anybody is able to make an intelligent analysis of their meaning and effect when applied to the industry. Members of this Parliament should be allowed at least a fortnight in which to study bills of this nature before being called upon to debate them. An out intelligent study of the legislation means analysing every clause in the bills. To lation expect this Parliament intelligently to pret measures that were brought before it and explained for the first time as late yesterday is unfair. Such action is wrong, whatever may be the merits of the bill legislation. This situation arises because only recently the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) determined that he would abandon the ship of state. Notwithstanding that he had suffered a defeat in the Parliament, the Prime Minister decided to walk off the deck and ask the people to look for a n.w provisions captain. He offered himself as the new captain but at a time when the ship still was in effective working order. The right honourable gentleman saw a virile, intelligent and capable Opposition in his path. Rather than continue to indulge in combat with the Opposition he walked off the deck any consideration of the fact that primary industry and the general economic state of the nation required that the Parliament proceed intelligently and deliberately with consideration of measures necessary in it to advance the economic welfare of the 1 really meant Commonwealth. Mr Turnbull - You tried to push the to Prime Minister off the deck.  We so long since the press of this country was accusing the Opposition of not being suffistrong in confronting the ministerial Mr Freeth - The press was about right. you complain about having an election proit seems to me that there must have been some substance in the complaints of the  about having an election. The Opposition in has always wanted an election. It is the people who will complain at being involved in additional expenditure of £500,000, which give them a parliament constituted exactly as is the piesent Parliament. That could happen. If it did happen, would the Prime Minister accept office or would he say again: "" I cannot do the job. Let us have another election.""? Those arc the factors that have resulted in legislation like this being brought to this Parliament withopportunity being given for the Opposition to consider maturely whether the legisis justified or whether it is likely to interbe of effective help to the industry. The Canned Fruits Export Marketing Bill as is said lo relate to the export of canned fruits and purposes connected therewith. The provides for the repeal of the various Canned Fruits Export Control Acts, restores the powers that were contained in the old acts and changes and adds to some of those powers. In effect we have a new consolinever dated act dealing with the Australian canned fruits industry. What problems that arose under the old acts are some of the in this bill designed to remedy? They are of such a nature that the Government has seen, fit lo reconstitute completely - the board which, up to date, has been in control of the industry. There will be a number of additions to the constitution of the board and some changes in representation. Clause 7 of the bill states7 -(1. ) The Board shall consist of(a) a member to represent the Commonwealth, who shall be appointed by the Minister; fb) three members elected in the prescribed manner to represent co-operative canneries engaged in the production of canned fruits other than canned pineapples and canned pineapple juice; (c) three members elected in the prescribed manner to represent canneries, other than co-operative canneries, engaged in the production of canned fruits other than canned pineapples and canned apple juice; (d) one member elected in the prescribed manner to represent canneries engaged in the production of canned pineapples or canned pineapple juice; (e) three members appointed by the Minister, on the nomination of the Australian Canning Fruit growers Association, to represent the growers of apricots, peaches and pears used in the production of canned fruits, being members not all of whom are residents of the same State; and (f) the additional member, if any, appointed statedunder section eight of this Act. Under the old act co-operative canneries sell and canneries other than co-operative canto neries were represented on the board by the only one member each. As far as I can advances ascertain the new board will a new set. of powers. The bill provides that upon recommendation by the board the Government may impose an excise levy on all canned fruit consumed in Australia. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the imposition of a levy on goods for consumption in Australia invariably leads to an increase in price to consumers of the particular product concerned. If a can of peaches today is worth ls. 2d. and a levy of 2d. a can is imposed, quite likely the price to. the consumer will rise to ls. 4d. On the other hand, if the board so recommends the Minister may, under the complementary legislation, impose a levy as high as 6d. a can. We are told that the levy is designed to allow the board to promote the sale of canned fruits and to assist generally in the marketing of canned fruits in overseas markets. The Government taxes the local consumer in order to raise funds to assist the controllers of the industry to foster the sale of Australian canned fruits on export markets. That is not unusual but I should like to know- I will deal with this matter further in the committee stage-wha t limitations are imposed on the manner in which promotional funds are to be spent in overseas markets. Can moneys collected by the levy imposed on canned fruit consumed within Australia be distributed to assist in increasing the income derived from the export of canned fruits to overseas markets? In other words, you collect 2d. excise on a can of fruit sold in Australia and you apply id. a can to each can of fruit sold in the export markets. Is that feasible or possible? Can such a levy be constitutionally imposed when this bill becomes law? This is what pine- I would like to know. Is the money so raised to be apportioned for advertising, for the payment of rewards, for printing and cinematographic work, and for the payment of agents who peddle canned fruits from door to door or from agent to agent? For what purpose will it be used? That is one quesdon that arises. Then there is a completely new departure. In his second-reading speech the Minister The board will be permitted to purchase and canned deciduous fruits under certain conditions. Provision is also made in the legislation permit the board-wher e it desires to finance purchase of canned deciduous fruits-to obtain from the Reserve Bank under guarantee be clothed with from the Government. It appears that this purchase power could be applied to canners who perhaps had a surplus on their hands and offered it voluntarily to the board for purchase. The board could purchase the surplus with funds guaranteed by the Reserve Bank, backed in turn by the Commonwealth Government. I do not know the purpose of this provision, and I think the House is entitled to an explanation. Does it mean that a canner who has on hand 1,000,000 cartons of canned fruits that he cannot sell can approach this newly created board with an offer to sell at a specific price? If the board agrees to purchase, but has insufficient funds, can it then approach the Reserve Bank for assistance? Will the Reserve Bank then say: ""We will advance £200,000 to purchase the 1,000,000 cartons of canned fruits, provided the Commonwealth Government is prepared to sign a guarantee to us""? Will the board then hold the fruit in store if at that' time the market is not suitable and the price offered is not sufficient? Will the board await its chance to feed that fruit on to the export market at an appropriate time? Is that the meaning behind the proposal? Is that the kind of transaction which is' envisaged? Does that come within the range of the power vested within the board? Perhaps the Minister will tell me later. At this stage let me say that the Australian Laboui Party has never opposed any measure introduced during the life cf this Parliament that was designed for, and in reality was in the interests of the primary producers. We do not want to oppose this measure, but t say here and now that we do not view with any great favour a bill which, of its very nature, is likely to result in the price of canned fruits to the Australian people bein,» increased, if the industry is in need of assistance- I believe that it is desparately in need of assistance - w e would prefer the Government to assist by way of bounty. It is unfortunate that this measure has not reached us until the dying hours of the Parliament and when we are faced with an election. The canned fruits industry is not the only industry in this field which is desperately in need of assistance. The Government has done nothing to assist the dried fruits industry in Mildura and elsewhere, although it needs assistance. The relief now proposed is confined to the canning industry which, in the main, is centered in the electorate of the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen). The people in the dried fruits industry, who also need assistance, have been neglected. No one can deny that. The Opposition takes the view that it would be more just to assist this industry by a straight out bounty payment from Consolidated Revenue Fund than by imposemphasize ing a levy, the proceeds of which could applied lo promoting the export of canned fruits at an unsatisfactorprice. With bounty payment of £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or whatever is necessary, Ihe burden of assisting an industry is shared by the tralian people in accordance with their ability to pay. The levy proposed by this bill can and will place on the shoulders of purchasers in thr. lower income group, with large families, a greater share of burden of assisting the industry than they should be required to .bear. We. criticize this measure from that point of view,. We have just disposed of a bill relating to the payment of a bounty on vinyl resin. That bounty will assist the two local producers, B. F. Goodrich-C.S.R. Chemicals Proprietary Limited and Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited. 1 think the bounty will amount to £600,000 or £700,000. The burden will not be placed on individuals in the low income group. It will be spread over the whole community, which means that those receiving higher incomes will pay a higher share of the cost of assisting those organizations. Another bill is to be introduced relating to assistance by means of bounty to the copper industry. A bounty payment is the right way to assist industries. The end result of the payment of a bounty on copper is that the Minister, who because of his income pays a high rate of tax, will do more to assist the copper industry than will the man on the basic wage or £20 a week. And the Minister should pay more! However, in relation to the canned fruits industry the levy, which could amount to as much as 6d. a can, will be borne by the local consumer. If a levy as high as 6d. a can is placed on canned fruits and increases the price of a can of fruit by 6d., there will be a diminution of the consumption of canned fruits in Australia. That will not be good for the industry, but it probably is something in the nature of a brake on a high levy. These are aspects of the proposal which we should have had a better opportunity to debate. We should have been given a better opportunity to study and consider the implications of the bill now before us as the well as the associated excise bill. I that we on this side are not te opposed to the purpose of the measure, but we quarrel with the principle of putting the a burden of a levy on the shoulders of the consumers of canned fruits in Australia. Although perhaps instances can be cited in Auswhich the Opposition has supported a form of assistance based on the principle of a levy, there is no reason why that principle should be continued unduly. It is not one that we view with any degree of favour. the If no bounty is provided or if nothing is done to assist the industry except by means of a levy, the.price of canned fruits to the /Australian -. .consumer could increase. The Government could appeal plaintively to the respective canning interests to make - a contribution to a fund to assist promotion and the marketing of exports of canned fruits. We know what would happen. We vvould have the same experience as we have had in other cases. Some people would play ball and some would not. The advantage of this compulsory levy on the industry by excise duty is that it eliminates the unfairness and the impossibility of effective collection of a voluntary levy from the canning interests. The canning interests will now do compulsorily what they might have done voluntarily. Those are the features of this measure about which I am concerned. I believe that the Australian public, however great is their desire to assist this industry, when they realise that this Parliament, in its dying hours and without sufficient mature consideration, is empowering a government to inflict an excise duty on the consumption of canned fruits within Australia, will agree with the Opposition that this is not the right way to assist an industry which they would be only too willing to assist. This is a marveUous industry. I think, in the economic sense, the Australian industry is better than any other deciduous fruits or canned fruits industry in the world, in that we have thousands of fruit-growing blocks all over Australia. We hope that they are sufficient in size. Under normal circumstances, they provide a reasonable income for a man and his family. The home is situated in a 10, 20, 30 or 40 acre block, or whatever it might be. The Australian position contrasts with the circumstances in some other countries. For instance, in California you will see a 100 or 200 acre block producing fruit for canning, jam making or some other form of consumption. There is one mansion in the centre of the block and the labour comes from itinerant workers camped around the place during the picking and processing season. The Australian industry is magnificent. Its little communities, with their churches, schools and business centres, contrast with what happens in other parts of the world. The Labour Party and I are anxious to help the industry. But we do not view favourably at this stage this method of assisting the industry. We will not vote against this bill, although we ought tot . However, we certainly will investigate the incidence of taxation when we form a government after 30th November. The Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen), who is the villain of the piece in respect of the imposition of this levy, will not be jibing at the person who will be occupying the position that he now occupies. He will not be saying, ""Now you had better do what you said you would do "". There is the bill as I see it. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us on some of the questions that I have asked. I want to know- I want a straight and clear answer to this question-whethe r the levy can be spent not only on promotion but also on the payment of a bounty in respect of the section of the production of the industry that is exported, thus enabling by an equalization process the distribution of a uniform payment to the industry as a whole.",46
121,Mr BEATON,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Bendigo) [3.49] - I wil! not delay the House for very long, but there are a number of points which the honourable  Opposition generally would like to clarify. We are greatly disappointed with and critical of the Government for introducing this bill yesterday and not giving adequate time for members of the Opposition and Government supporters to examine its implications. That gives rise to the doubts that we express today. This is unfortunate. If members of the Government, including the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen), wanted an election so quickly, they should have ensured that we would have adequate time to examine the implications of the bills that had been introduced and were yet to be introduced. There is no question about the fact that this industry is in trouble. That is indicated by a number of factors. It is also true that this was one of the industries which were directly threatened by the prospect of Great Britain's entry into the European Common Market. This industry, because of its great dependence upon the traditional market in Great Britain, would have been affected gravely. I point out, as no doubt honourable members know, that whole communities in Australia are greatly dependent upon this industry and this industry alone. They have been built upon this industry and its activities as a result of what was known in the early 1 -1930's .as.imperial preference and what hus been known since as Commonwealth preference. If Great Britain had entered the European Common Market- 1I have no doubt that that prospect still exists-this industry would have been gravely affected and some government action would have been required. The Labour Opposition recognized the threat at the time and said that it would have no hesitation in financially assisting the industry to obtain additional and alternative markets to the traditional markets on which it has relied for so long. The situation in the industry now is that it is being under-sold in competition on :ts traditional market in Great Britain and on other markets. We know that South Africa has increased tremendously its production and its sales to Great Britain and other countries. As a result of that, our overseas sales and export markets have been threatened. That is indicated clearly in the thirty-sixth annual report of the Australian Canned Fruits Board, which shows that the United Kingdom imported 2,760,000 cartons from Australia in 1961, whereas South Africa exported 5,029,000 cartons to the United Kingdom in that year, lt is apparent that Soulh Africa is now a major supplier of canned fruits to the British market. That has undermined Australian sales on that market. One of the factors which enables South Africa to undersell Australia is that its labour costs are far lower than Australia's. The ordinary costs of South African orchardists, including pruning, fruit picking and all the other necessary costs, are probably only one-quarter of the costs of Australian orchardists. That is brought about by policies adopted in South Africa, in which we do not believe. In mentioning this matter, I certainly am not saying that we should endeavour to lower the wages and working conditions of the people who work in the orchards of the Goulburn valley and other fruit-growing areas throughout Australia. I have said that whole communities depend upon this industry. The centres in the Goulburn Valley-includin g Kyabram, Ardmona, Mooroopna and Shepparton-and the centres as you go north towards Cobram, depend almost entirely upon the fruit industry and the co-operative and company canning factories. Griffiths, Leeton and other towns in the Riverina district are also very dependent upon this industry. On the overseas market the fruit growers and the canning factories of Australia have be^n in trouble, and there is a prospect of greater trouble if Great Britain joins the European Common Market, which is not, of course, out of the question. On the home market there has been intense competition. Any honourable member who has time to watch television on odd occasions has seen evidence of this competition, in the form of costly advertisements advertising brands such as Ardmona and S.P.C. This intense competition on the home market has undoubtedly been brought about largely by the big carry-over of canning fruit that has built up in the last few years, and which I understand amounts to 1,000,000 cartons or more this year. This has resulted in a drastic fall in prices. It is obvious that the canning companies are trying hard to sell their products and are using everything that is available to them in the field of sales promotion. The canning companies that sell overseas dispose of about 70 per cent, of their pack on the overseas market, leaving about 30 per cent, for the domestic market. There arc certain questions that I would like answered. First, I would like the Minister to tell me whether this legislation discriminates against canned fruit. ft apparently does not apply to fruit packed in glass. I would like to know whether this is so and whether fruit packed in glass is to be given an advantage in competition against canned fruit, with what is in effect a sales tax being imposed on canned fruit sold on the domestic market. The honourable member for Lalor raised the point that it will be possible under this legislation for a levy of up to 6d. a can to be imposed in respect of the domestic market. Although prices have dropped in recent times because of the intense competition, any levy of this magnitude must surely build up buyer resistance, which would cancel out the benefits that the levy is designed to confer. If the price of canned fruit goes up 6d. for a 29-ounce can, obviously the housewife will think twice about buying it. This can only result in a lowered volume of sales on the home market. If the levy is used to give a little more return to canning factories in respect of overseas sales, they could lose on the merry-go-round; obviously if their sales were reduced at home they would have' to sell more overseas. There is another point I would like cleared up. What sort of levy is proposed? What will be the rate of the levy and what will it cost the industry itself? What is it estimated will be raised by this levy in a period of twelve months? Will it be £1,000,000, £2,000,000 or £5,000,000? This is the kind of question I would like answered. I would also like to know whether it is proposed that the levy be imposed on canned berries and canned pineapple. I know that the levy will be applied in the case of canned peaches, canned apricots, canned pears and canned mixed fruits, but will it apply to canned pineapple and canned berries? If it will not, will the canners of those fruits be given an advantage over the people in the Goulburn valley and other centres who concentrate on peaches, pears, apples and so on? We all know that when the Budget was presented on 13th August the Government announced that it was removing sales tax other or both. on foodstuffs. This was applauded by the community generally and by the Labour Party in this House. After all, we of Opposition have been advocating this for long time. What is now proposed will be, in effect, a tax on a foodstuff, on canned fruit, and it must inevitably have its effect on domestic consumption. I make this if point because, as the honourable member for Lalor has said, this industry needs assiscentres tance, but we question the. kind of assistance that it is getting, assistance at the expense of the domestic market to aid sales overseas markets. The honourable member for Lalor has questioned whether this levy will be able solely for sales promotion. Sales motion can do a great deal in a great many industries. Every manufacturer of a probe duct endeavours to promote his sales advertising and other means. Will this levy be used solely for sales promotion, or will it be used, in effect, to buy excess producindustry. tion of canned fruit from the canners? Will it be used to make up losses on this excess production that is purchased by the board for a certain amount of money and sold overseas for a lesser amount of money? would like to have a clear explanation exact way in which the levy will be applied, at what rate it will be applied and the manner in which the money raised by it will be spent. The honourable member for Lalor also said that the Opposition recognizes the need amount to aid the industry. That is true. We realise that in future years the industry may be in greater trouble, and it is essential to right the wrongs now existing in the industry if we can. In 1956 Victoria experienced a very wet year and floods inundated many hundreds and perhaps thousands of acres of Goulburn valley orchards. Orchardists lost a great deal of production and also many thousands of trees. With Government assistance they re-planted after the floods receded, in some cases on virgin land and in other cases on the land.on which the trees had previously been growing. We now find that those trees are bearing fruit and we will have added production from them. It is quite obvious that this will increase the industry's problems. It will have to sell the additional production on the home market and overseas-on e or the I point out that the areas in which the the deciduous fruit industry and the canned a fruit industry are carried on are decentralized areas. For this reason alone, if for no other-and there are others- I would advocate assisting the industry. After all, we are ever to achieve and maintain some sort of balanced population we must assist like Shepparton, Mooroopna, Ardmona, Kyabram, Griffith and Leeton to maintain themselves at their present popuon lation, and to expand if they can. I ask the Minister to say exactly how much money will be raised. There must be availsome sort of estimate of the amount prorequired in the next twelve months. I would like to know also how the money will spent-whethe r on sales promotion or on by some means of price support. We are in favour of assistance to the Although we support this bill, in a way we disapprove of it because the fruit growers and canners will be helping themselves. We believe that the help should come from the general community, out of We national revenue, by the payment of a of the bounty such as other industries have received. Payment of a bounty could operate only temporarily. I am sure that the Labour government which will oe in office after 30th November will assist the industry, out of national revenue, so that it can solve the problems which confront it now and the even greater problems u'.!:b will confront it in future.",49
122,Mr DUTHIE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wilmot) [4.5] - This is a hazardous industry and this is a very hazardous way of assisting it. That is the opinion of honourable members on this side of the House. We appreciate the organizational capacity and the tightly knit workings of the Australian fruit canning industry. We know how long the industry has been in existence. We have a great admiration for the growers of fruit for canning. We realise that fruit growing may be troubled by all kinds of diseases and weather conditions. The fruit-growers do not know from one year to another what their returns wil] be for all the hard work they have done in maintaining their orchards. I am amazed that the Government has waited for so long to help the industry. Why is it that in the dying hours of the twenty-fourth Parliament we have such an important measure before us? The Government has been in office for fourteen years, and for all of that time the fruit-growing industry has suffered so much from loss of export markets because of competition from other countries as to warrant the kind of assistance provided by this measure. The presentation of this and so much other legislation in the last week of the Parliament suggests to me that the Government is trying to jam through as much legislation as possible before the election. Mr Howson - We have not stopped any member of the Opposition from speaking.",52
123,Mr DUTHIE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I am not referring to that angle. I am saying that the Government has brought in so many bills of a similar type in the last fortnight that we cannot help but think that they have been introduced for election purposes. The Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen), who introduced the bill, represents a portion of the biggest fruit-growing area in Australia. ",52
124,Mr DUTHIE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I am not going to say that. 1 repeat that this is a hazardous way of assisting the industry. We do not know how much will be raised by the imposition of a levy. The fruit-growers will not know from year to year or even from month lo month how much they will have to contribute. We do not know precisely how the amount raised will be spent. It is amazing that there is not one indication in the bill - excep t in a broad sense-of how the money will be used in the promotion of export sales. No details are given of how the money raised by the levy will be spent. We on this side of the chamber are convinced that an increase in the price of canned fruit to the consumers will depress home sales immediately, and we all know that the home market for any of our primary products should be encouraged first. A kind of vicious circle will be created. An increase in the price of canned fruit to the home consumer will reduce home sales and reduced home consumption will in turn reduce the levy as it is paid only on fruit consumed. We all like canned fruit. The quality of our canned fruit is equal to that of any canned fruit in the world. Our fruit is attractively presented for sale. We must congratulate the industry on the way its products are marketed. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to pay more than we pay now for canned fruit. An increase in price will place canned fruit fair and square in the luxury class. Why should the products of Australian soil be sold at luxury prices? The more canned fruit that is sold, the greater will be the amount paid as a levy and used to promote export sales. As the  has said, it would be far better to pay a straight-out bounty from Consolidated Revenue, as is paid to assist other industries, than to have this method of an excise tax on each can sold in Australia. If this means a price increase of 6d. a can, it will price Canned fruit out of many Australian homes. Canned fruit is one of our most delicious products, and it is appalling to think that by this measure we may reduce its sales. In his second-reading speech the Minister saidA new feature of the proposed, legislation provides for the chairman of the board to be elected by the board instead of being appointed by the Minister as at present. I would like the Minister to explain the purpose of that change. The Minister then saidA further provision enables the board, should it feel that special skills and or knowledge are required, and in this case subject to approval by the Minister, to appoint a chairman from other than board members. In this case the chairman shall be an additional member of the board. If I have understood that correctly, the chairman will be brought in from outside. Why should this be so? It is a hotch-potch kind of arrangement. I am in favour of bringing in skilled men to assist the board with advice, but why should an outsider be appointed as chairman? It is not necessary to do that in order to get the benefit of his knowledge. In fact, it would probably shut him up, because most chairmen feel that the more they speak the less chance they have of remaining chairmen. I would be pleased to hear the Minister's explanation of the change. We have mixed feelings about the legislation. We believe that the industry should be assisted, but we are not very happy about the way it will be assisted. We believe that a levy on canned fruits sold in Australia is a very haphazard way to raise money to promote export sales. We appreciate that there is great competition on the overseas markets and that there is a surplus of over 1,000,000 cans in Australia at the moment. That is a tremendous quantity of fruit to be seeking to sell on overseas markets which are already cluttered up. I appreciate the Minister's concern for the industry. When he was absent from the chamber I said that I was amazed that representatives of the industry had not asked him for assistance a long time before this. I cannot understand why the Government should suddenly decide that assistance is needed. Mr BeatOn - They probably asked for and were knocked back.",52
125,Mr DUTHIE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Yes , that may have hapsounder footing. pened. The Minister may enlighten us on that point. Mr Uren - Is not this also intended protect the Minister for Social Services, represents the , Riverina electorate?",53
126,Mr DUTHIE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Yes . The Riverina and also the central part of Victoria come into it. This proposal is intended to assist the Minister for Social Services (Mr Roberton), who represents Riverina, and also the honourable member for Indi (Mr Holten), as well as one or two other honourable members opposite. It is very strange indeed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that legislation of this kind has come before the Parliament at this precise time. The Minister for Trade would not tell us the real reason for its introduction, I suppose, and probably he will not answer any questions about that. The fact remains that I believe that a better and surer method than this of raising funds to help promote overseas sales of canned fruit could have been found. The method chosen is a haphazard and hazardous one based on a home-consumption levy. If home consumption is reduced, the levy will be reduced. That is as clear as the fact that two and two make four. I believe that, after the first season during which this legislation has operated, the industry itself may try to scrap it in favour of some better method. The method suggested by honourable members on this side of the chamber is the payment of a bounty on fruit-growing for canning so as to assist the industry. That is all that I wish to say about these measures. Very little deciduous fruit is grown in the Wilmot electorate, but those growers in my electorate who grow deciduous fruit for canning will be assisted. There are areas in the electorate represented by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Falkinder) where a lot of deciduous fruit is grown, and a great deal is grown in Queensland and in parts of Western Australia. In conclusion, I say that I do not think that the Minister for Trade includes berry fruit in the application of this legislation. It will apply purely to canned deciduous fruits. There will be no benefit in respect of the it great deal of berry fruit grown in Tasmania. I hope that a Labour government will be able to put the fruit-growing industry on a",53
127,Mr CAIRNS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Yarra) [4.17] - Mr . Deputy Speaker, I want to say something to about these measures before the Minister who - for Trade (Mr MCEwen) finally answers the questions asked and assertions made by honourable members on this side of the House, because I think that this legislation has produced a difference of approach between the Opposition and the Government that deserves closer examination. I believe that this is really a difference of approach as between the Australian Labour Party and the Australian Country Party on the one hand and, on the other hand, the Liberal Party of Australia, members of which comprise the majority of those in this Parliament who support the Government. I fancy that the Country Party and the Minister for Trade would prefer to attack this problem in the way that the Labour Party suggests-by payment of subsidy or bounty rather than by the method that is proposed in this legislation. I wonder whether in the background there has been a submission emanating from the Country Party, submitted to the Cabinet through the Minister for Trade, for the payment of subsidy or bounty on the production of fruit for canning in Australia and whether, perhaps, the submission has been rejected by the Liberal Party majority in the Cabinet. The payment of subsidy or bounty seems to me to be the logical way of attacking problem that any practical man would adopt. And the members of the Country Party and the Minister for Trade are practical men. In the Liberal Party, on the other hand, we have a number of men who have been brought up in the fairyland of certain kinds of economic theory. Mr Howson - Who is talking now of economic theory!",53
128,Mr CAIRNS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I include the honourable member in that category. Those members of the Liberal Party believe that the best and easiest way to solve problems is to use laisser-faire methods based on tax and expenditure. I think that the present situation reveals a difference not only between the Australian Labour Party and the Government but also between the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party section of the Government. In many respects, there are common ground and a common approach on the part of the Labour Party and the Country Party. In both cases, F.9601/63 - R -[91 ] the approach is practical and not so theoretical as that which emerges very frequently from the Liberal Party majority in the Government. I should like to have the views of the Minister for Trade on these differences. 1 should like to know whether, at any stage, he considered the payment of bounty or subsidy on the production of fruit for canning and whether, in fact, he tried to have such a method adopted, or whether he is satisfied with this less practical and more theoretical way of assisting the fruit growing industry. The growing of fruit for canning is a vjry specialized industry that is confined to certain areas of Australia. In those areas, the great majority of people are employed, directly or indirectly, mainly in the growing and canning of fruit. We heard the very vivid description given by the Minister for Trade, at the time of the European Common Market debates, of what would happen if Britain went into the Common Market. He said that in that event he main industries in certain parts of Australia would be wiped out overnight by the loss of markets in Great Britain. It is true that the these areas are highly specialized. It is true that they have problems that will increase even if Britain never enters the Common Market. It is true that the access of Australian canned fruit to markets in Britain and in Europe is declining steadily and significantly as a result of the natural diversions of trade in those parts of the world. In that respect, changes due to the Common Market are simply an accentuation of something indigenous that is natural in the circumstances. So these problems exist apart from anything that may be related to the Common Market. They aTe getting more serious. The Australian Labour Party disagrees, not with the giving of assistance to the fruit-growing industry, but with the method adopted. We prefer payment of subsidy or bounty to the imposition of a tax-that is what the levy will be-o n canned fruit sold for home consumption. However, we differ with the Government more widely than that. I believe that, sooner or later, more significant action in relation to the canned-fruit industry will have to be considered. We shall have to take the initiative at Commonwealth Government level in the development of new industries in those parts of Australia where fruit is grown for canning. Those are perhaps some of the most attractive parts of the country in which to live, and they provide favourable conditions for the development of many new activities. But Commonwealth initiative and assistance are required. One has only to think of ithe New South Wales town of Orange, which owes a great deal to government initiative and assistance in the development of industry, to realise what can be done in the Murrumbidgee valley in New South Wales and in the Goulburn River valley in Victoria to develop other forms of activity and other industries that do not depend on canned fruit. Measures to establish new industries will have to be undertaken seriously on a regional basis. The tragedy of the short-term measures ithat the Government adopts in cases like this is that they just put off tive action and divert attention away from what will be needed in the long run. I should like to know from the Minister for Trade whether these matters that I have mentioned have been considered and whether he is satisfied with this very limited, short-term method of assisting an industry that is completely significant in his own electorate. I think that if he, in his very influential position, is able to produce nothing better than this on the eve of an election, he cannot expect any great gratitude to come from his own electorate. I should now like to say a little more about the method that the Government has adopted. I have said that it is short-term and Umited. It in effect imposes a tax on th: sale of canned fruit in Australia in order to give the Government a fund to use for particular purposes. The honourable  honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Beaton) have pointed out that the Government has given us little or no information about how this money is to be used. Presumably it will be used either to pay some kind of subsidy 'on the proportion of production exported, or to finance an advertising or sales promotion campaign overseas. Although we do know that a large proportion of our canned fruit is sold overseas and that therefore a certain amount of money should be spent on sales promotion in those markets, it seems to me that a great deal more could be done in the way of advertising and promoting the sale of canned fruit in Australia. I remember my own experience many years ago. Whenever I raided the pantry, the first things I went for were a tin of canned fruit and some cream. This combination of foods seems to me to have a strong attraction to Australian consumers. I should like to see more programmes on television depicting canned fruit being placed in a bowl and cream being poured over it. I feel that if we saw more of that kind of advertising sales of this product in Australia would be improved considerably. What the farmers in the Country Party must surely realise-and this is one point on which the Country Party and the Australian Labour Party are on the common effec- ground that I mentioned earlier in my speech-is that the Australian farmer depends mostly upon the Australian consumer for his prosperity. The more money the Australian wage-earner has the better market he provides for the Australian farmer. The Australian farmer and the Australian wage-earner bave a common interest in this direction, and I think it is tragic that sometimes the employers of labour in the country, men like some members of the Country Party and a great number of the members of the Liberal Partythink about these questions primarily as employers always anxious to keep down labour costs. What they should be more concerned about, especially the small farmers amongst them, is preserving the common interest that exists between farmers and the workers in the cities. How much consideration has been given to the relative advantages of increased expenditure on promoting the sale of canned fruit in Australia as compared with expenditure on sales promotion overseas? As the honourable member for Bendigo has pointed out, competition is more intense in Australia. For instance, on the Australian market we have to compete with fruit canned by slave labour in South Africa. It is extremely difficult for the Australian producers to meet that competition. Mr Chaney - Are you sure it is slave labour?",54
129,Mr CAIRNS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Of course it is slave labour. This increases the intensity of competition Mr Chaney - Hav e you been there?,56
130,Mr CAIRNS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"If the honourable member for Perth desires to be an advocate of apartheid, let him get up and say so. Mr Chaney - That is a complete twist of what you said.",56
131,Mr CAIRNS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"If you are trying to split straws on this matter, that makes you better. No decent person would seek split straws on this matter of policy. we see that there are bad working condithe tions in any part of the world, such as there are in South Africa, it is our duty to say that we are opposed to such conditions. Only by opposing them can we hope to improve our competitive position on the world's markets. If any member of the Liberal Party wants to split straws about apartheid, let him get up and so so.",56
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Mr Drury). - Order ! I ask the honourable member to return to the bill.,56
133,Mr CAIRNS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wit h all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you would keep the interjectors under control I could keep to it. We of the Opposition would like supports the bill. to know why a more practical method of paying a subsidy or bounty to assist the canned fruit industry has not been adopted in this case. In this instance we have conflict not only between the Australian Labour Party and the Government with and relation to the practicability of the method proposed to be adopted on this very duced important question, but also between the Country Party and the Liberal Party. We support this bill which seeks to vide assistance for the canned fruit industry because we realise that the industry must have some help, but we are not satisfied with the method which is to be adopted. We would like to see adopted a method by which the necessary funds would be raised according to the ability of Auscould tralians to pay instead of the imposition a flat rate increase in the cost to the sumers of canned fruit in Australia, irrescommences pective of the income of the person being required to contribute. As both the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) have pointed out, the method proposed by this measure could result in a decline in the consumption of canned fruit by many people in Australia who should not be compelled to go without this product. Canned fruit is not a luxury; it is almost a necessary of life, and the proposed imposition will place too heavy a burden on some consumers. We disagree with the method to be adopted, and the Australian people should recognize the difference between the no principles advocated by us and those to adopted by the Government. The AusIf tralian Labour Party believes that when Government needs money for any purpose that money should be raised according to the ability of individual Australians to contribute. The more they have, the more they should pay. The principle more commonly favoured by the Government is that the less you have the more you should contribute. In other words, the Government adopts the principle of inflicting impositions upon people according to the amount they spend on the ordinary necessaries of life. Further, we of the Labour Party say that this short-term or limited method will not be successful in the long run. Something more practicable and enduring should be planned for the canned fruit industry. With those qualifications, the Opposition",56
134,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Murray-Minister for Trade) [4.32],-in reply- I wish to refer briefly to the various points made by the  other speakers during this debate. First, let me make it clear that this bill is introhaving in mind the election, but not electioneering. The industry itself has been working on a plan which, in its judgment, prois designed to meet its particular circumstances and it wants the plan to be operative during the forthcoming canning season. In my elec'orate, the canning season generally begins between Christmas and the New Year. It is obvious that a scheme containing the provisions embodied in this one never be fairly introduced in the of middle of the selling season. It can be conintroduced fairlv only before the season so that it may-operate for the whole of a season. The industry realized that it had to hasten to a conclusion on its needs and present its proposal to the Government, assuming as it did at the time that this session of Parliament would run on perhaps until the end of November or early December, as I had been predicting it would a few months ago.  the fault of the industry; it was the fault of the Prime Mmister.",56
135,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"No . The industry had been working on a scheme and finally reached a conclusion. Its representatives then spoke to me and to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Adermann) and asked us to put the scheme before the Government so that, if appoved by the Government, it could be presented to the Parliament before the Parliament dissolved and, if approved by the Parliament, put into operation a year earlier than would have been otherwise possible. Mr L. R. Johnson - Is this the first time you have had a request from the industry?",57
136,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"This is the first time there has ever been a request of this kind from the industry. As honourable members know, this is a very self-reliant industry. That is exemplified by the fact that this proposal, which is almost 100 per cent, the industry's own proposal, does not request Parliament to vote any money for the purpose of assisting the industry. It merely invokes the authority of the Government to tax, not the consumer, but the seller of the produot-the canner. Whatever one may think of the scheme- I think it is a very good one-at least we must respect the industry's intention to remain self-reliant this instance. There is at the back of the proposal, of course, the knowledge ithat have been planted and are coming into production. There is to be a very steep increase in the production of an item that cannot be switched on and off, as the production of an item in a factory can or even as annual crops such as wheat and potatoes can. Peaches have been known to be in production for 25 years or so and pears are known to have been in production for 70 years. We do not know how long they will remain in profitable production. Once the trees have been planted and the investment made, this is a long-term"" mdustry'. International markets are now becoming more highly competitive and the Australian production is growing at a fast rate. There is one old-fashioned way in which a grower can always be sure of selling his products and that is by keeping on lowering the price until a buyer is found and all the goods are sold. This is the way to insolvency; but this industry is very prudent and business like. It has spent a lot of money and has devoted itself to winning a good reputation on the home market and particularly on the markets in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. These are its three preferential markets and its three great markets where it has a good reputation and a ready sale. The industry does not want to be driven to reducing its price on these established markets. It wants to hold its price there and by promotion and hard selling to get into other markets on a permanent basis. It will not be easy to do this. Several questions have been very properly asked about the amount of money that will be raised and the purpose for which it will be used. On last year's domestic salesthat is the point at which the levy is to be made-and at the proposed initial rate of 2s. a dozen cans, I am told that £600,000 would be raised. Honourable members know that the legislation contemplates the possibility of the board asking that the amount be increased. In an effort to sell its products, the industry has been dropping the price on the Australian market. If the industry went to the extreme that the legislation contemplates and proposed a levy of 6s. a dozen cans, and if that were added to the present price, it would do no more than raise the price of canned peaches to what it was about a year ago. This is an in indication of the extent of the price reductions on the domestic market that the industrees try has been compelled to accept. Mr Stewart - How much per 30-oz. can would that be?",57
137,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"It would be 6d. If I may explain this, 1 said that the Government had accepted almost all of the industry's proposals. I think there was only one aspect of the industry's proposals that the Government did not accept, and that was that a sales tax should be imposed. The imposition of a sales tax would mean an addition to the price at which the canners sold and therefore an addition to the paid by the consumers. The Government said, "" No, for a variety of reasons we cansugar. not accept that, but we will agree to impose an excise duty "". ",57
138,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"It does not have the same effect at all. Sales tax is to the invoice price; excise is a subtraction from the invoice price. Therefore, it is not prima facie an addition Mr Beaton - They will put up their prices.",58
139,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"They may put up their prices. I hope the honourable members for Bendigo and Lalor, who display a very great interest in and a very great sympathy for this industry, will not be upset if the perhaps goes back to what it was a year ago, before the industry was driven into price cutting competition within its ranks. Just as the labourer is worthy his hire, so the peach-grower is worthy his hire. We do not want any more than this to happen. Mr Beaton - Hav e you any figures on the cost of production?",58
140,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I do not have them in my mind, but the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has conducted a study into the market. cost of production. I am sure the honourable member would be supplied with this by my colleague if he were to ask for it. The Australian Canned Fruits Board only with peaches, pears and apricots an some mixtures of them. These are the only items to which this legislation will apply. does not apply to canned berries or pinecash apple. It is true that there may be some distortion of the relationship between these items. The industry has faced this problem. It feels that the plan we considered is rhe best plan that it can present to the Government. I add that there been a very close liaison between the canned fruit industry and the sugar industry ovc. the years. They are to a certain extent inter-dependent. The sugar industry hts been very understanding and very helpful to the fruit industry, and the fruit industry reciprocally has been helpful to the sugar price industry. After all, the canned fruit industry is one of the big consumers c.f Opposition members have made the point that, instead of the money being raised by excise, it would be better to provide the money from general revenues as a bounty. In this respect, the honourable member for an addition Lalor mentioned copper.  to the consumer. respect of butter.",58
141,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"No . Well, technically, it does operate in respect of butter.  deficiency in the wheat stabilization fund.",58
142,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Yes , technically that is quite correct. Let me speak of copper for price a moment. The bounty for copper is very discriminating and it is known to be dea signed to help the isolated communities at own Mount Lyell and Mount Morgan and other of such distant parts. Mount Isa is excluded of on a profit test. It is a very specialized application of a law that is tailor-made to help these isolated communities where mines which are not rich are operating. They could be put out of business by mines that are rich if there were not some very highly specialized and tailor-made provision such as this. The production of these centres goes predominantly on to the domestic In recent years I have spent a good deal of time arguing that our competitive opportunities, which arise from the marriage deals between our skills on the land and our 1 natural environmental conditions, should not be negatived and destroyed on overseas It markets by other governments paying a subsidy to aid the price cutting of some product that is in competition with ours. This is the complete reason why I would not wish to see us have a Treasury have bounty. The arrangements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has are designed to forbid this.  able to dodge out of it.",58
143,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I will not comment on that. As I have been described as a practical person, let me put it on a more practical ground. Our principal competitor is the United States. The United States has a longer purse than we have. If it is a matter of one government digging into its Treasury resources to subsidize its product to the detriment of the product of another country, we must realise that we do not have sufficient resources to compete on this basis. That is putting the matter in the most practical terms. I am glad to be able to say that the United States subscribes quite meticulously to the practices of Gatt in regard to export subsidies. We do so in respect of butter, as the honourable member for Lalor said, and in respect of wheat. This has been argued out and discussed and approved in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, because of two things: Those two industries had arrangements of long standing in which there is virtually, in theory, a self-insurance scheme, for the wheat-growers have paid into the fund much more money than the Government has. This is not a straight Treasury subsidy for wheat. It is a balancing arrangement that, in certain circumstances, the wheat-growers pay into the fund and, in certain circumstances, the Government pays into it.  industry.",58
144,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"It is not the same in this case, but it is the same with butter and there is no hokey pokey business about this in Gatt. What the industries do and what the Government has done have been fully discussed and approved of in Gatt, but a simple, unadulterated Treasury bounty on export, which would enable you to undercut the other fellow, is not approved of in Gatt. If we defied Gatt and went to work on that basis there are other people with greater resources than we have. I do not want to go further with that.  of how it works the other way.",59
145,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I hope you will not complicate life by doing so. However, that is why we have not taken a certain course and why the industry has not asked us to take the course to which I have referred. This is a highly organized industry, with very intelligent spokesmen, and it believes that nothing could put it in greater jeopardy than for Australia to establish a state of affairs which would justify the governments of the countries of its competitors engaging in competitive subsidization of the product in world markets. What is intended in respect of this fund? It is intended, in the first place, that the fund shall be used on advertising and for straight promotional purposes to do as we have done with success in many markets and in respect of many products; that is, to get in and promote sales by every device that can be dreamed up and try to sell more stuff at better prices. The second thing the industry proposes to do is concerned also with sales. If, notwithstanding the best promotional activities, at a point of time the whole crop cannot be sold, instead of following the almost constant commercial practice of dumping the surplus at a pricebreaking rate the Canned Fruits Board will stand ready to buy that quantity.  be available for that purpose?",59
146,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I am coming to that.  Mr MCEWEN No. The legislation contemplates that, if the board agrees, by arrangement with the canneries, not to sell but to insulate from the market a certain quantity of the product, the Government will guarantee the board with the Reserve Bank of Australia for the purpose of purchasing or financing the holding of this fruit until it can be fed back onto the market in circumstances which do not break the level of values on the market. It is not impossible that in this process and in sales in some markets-and particularly markets we are trying to break into-frui t might be sold for less than its cost. That is contemplated and, if that should happen, this is the second purpose for which levy money may recoup the loss. This is the kind of thing which may occur. It is in the mind of the industry. But I think honourable members will agree that if this industry can avoid destroying itself by price competition in the home market and also can avoid destroying the markets it has spent 40 years to build up in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, and if it spends money to protect only fresh markets and to buy the fruit and hold it until it can be fed into markets as they are found, this is a pretty good and pracable tical approach by the industry itself help and to expansion without destructive price competition by the units within the industry. This industry has a long record of successful management of its own affairs. I do not stand up here-bu t I would be proud and happy to stand here-and say that Government, the Department of Trade, my colleague the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Adermann) and I dreamed this arrangement up. The industry dreamed and agreed to. it up and I am merely presenting to the Parliament what the industry-havin g examined everything that has been said in the House today and having accepted some of it and rejected other parts of it-ha asked us to do. That describes most of readsthe matters that have been raised here. I have stated in quite clear terms that the industry has not previously put forward the proposal and had it rejected. I am putting it in clear terms that I am not presenting to the Parliament something other than what the industry has proposed to us. The industry has carefully considered whether it would be better or worse served by the introduction of the idea of a cash subsidy from the Treasury on exports, with all the consequences that could follow. One honourable member raised a question about the chairman of the board. Hitherto Ihe board, which does not lean on the Government financially, has had a chairman nominated by the Government. The industry feels that it would like its own board to choose its chairman and the Government says: ""Right. You can choose your own chairman. We will have one government man on the board."" There is the possibility in my mind - and it is implicit in this legislation-that the board, looking at its own membership, as chosen, may feel that there is not a person with the highly specialized qualifications in merchandising that it would like to have and say, "" If that is the situation, we would like to be able to choose a chairman, from outside our own members, for that purpose '. The law is designed to give the board that opportunity. ",59
147,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I think this is very desirlegislation. The industry is a very to selfworthy one, as every honourable member who has spoken in this debate has testified, and I hope the bill will be passed without delay. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.1 Message from the Governor General the recommending appropriation announced. In committee: Clauses 1 to 6-by leave-take n together, Clause 7 (Constitution of the Board).  7 provides for the constitution of the Auss tralian Canned Fruits Board. The clause 7 -(1. ) The Board shall consist of(a) a member to represent the Commonwealth, who shall be appointed by the Minister; (b) three members elected in the prescribed manner to represent co-operative canneries engaged in the production of canned fruits other than canned pineapples and canned pineapple juice; (c) three members elected in the prescribed manner to represent canneries, other than co-operative canneries, engaged in the production of canned fruits other than canned pineapples and canned pineapple juice; (d) one member elected in the prescribed manner to represent canneries engaged in the production of canned pineapples or canned pineapple juice; (e) three members appointed by the Minister, on the nomination of the Australian Canning Fruit growers Association, to represent the growers of apricots, peaches and pears used in the production of canned fruits, being members not all of whom are residents of the same State; and (f ) the additional member, if any, appointed under section eight of this Act. The board appears to be reasonably satis1 factorily constituted but I note that a later clause of the bill provides that the member appointed by the Minister to represent the Commonwealth may be removed on the authority of the Minister. I do not quarrel 1 with that. The member is the direct appointee of the Minister and when he is appointed he probably knows what he is in for. I note also that a later clause in the bill gives the Minister power to remove, on the recommendation of the board, any of the members referred to in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of clause 7 (1.). That is rather an arbitrary power to repose in the Minister. The members referred to in those paragraphs are elected in the prescribed manner but if one of them persistently voices views that do not coincide with the views held by the majority of members of the board at a particular time, the board may, by majority decision, recommend to the Minister that the member concerned be removed from the board. The bill does not say that he should be removed for misconduct or some offence. He may be removed merely because the board feels that he is becoming a nuisance. It may simply be that he does not agree with the views held by other members of the board. Mr Makin - He may be the most intelligent member of the board.  only one right. This has happened in the past. Mr Duthie - As in the case of Mr Date.  mention names but that sort of thing could happen. I do not think it should happen unless the member concerned has recourse or appeal to an intervening authority. The members appointed under paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this sub-clause are not appointed by the Minister. They are the elected representatives of particular sections of the industry. But simply because a member in one of those categories holds views that do not coincide with the views held by the majority of members of the board, the Minister, who has had nothing to do with the member's election to the board, may dispose of him arbitrarily. This is not right and it is something which the Minister might look into before the bill reaches the Senate so that some safeguard may be provided. I recollect an occasion in my past parliamentary experience when the chairfor man of an authority in Victoria- I will give the his name privately to the Minister latercame to me and asked me to sign a minute relating to the affairs of the authority. I into it. read the minute- I am careful about that sort of thing-and discovered that the authority had recommended the dismissal of one of its officers because the man's wife had been a little friendly with people associated with the authority. The no right of appeal. The person who placed the minute before me was held high in my esteem. I asked him whether the man whose dismissal was sought had a right of appeal to any other body. I was told that he did not have a right of appeal. I said that I would not dismiss him. The member of the authority who sought my signature to the minute said that his board would resign. I said that I would get a new board. I told him to go away and think the matter over. After the next meeting of the authority that man came to me again and said that the authority had adopted my suggestion and had transferred the officer concerned to some other place. In that case if the Minister had accepted the recommendation of the authority a grave injustice would have been done. The individual whose dismissal was sought had no protection between the authority and the Minister. I think there is room in the bill now before the committee for something better than is provided and I suggest that the Minister give this matter further consideration. The bill provides that the three members appointed by the Minister on the nomination of the Australian Canning Fruit growers Association may be removed from the board on the recommendation of the association. Those members are members of the association and in this respect they are a little different from other members of the board. If a member of the association ceases to put before the board the views of his association there may be some justification for seeking his removal but I do not like the power vested in the Minister in relation to other members of the board.",60
148,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Murray-Minister for Trade) [5.2] - The provision to which the  has referred has been in this legislation for 40 years. That is a pretty powerful reason leaving it there, but perhaps it is not complete reason. The honourable member asked me to look into this matter. Without guaranteeing anything, I will look Clause agreed to. Clauses 8 to 17-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 18 (Power of Board to purchase man had canned fruits for export.)  clause refers to the power of the Australian Canned Fruits Board to purchase canned fruit for export. The clause gives the board very considerablefinancialpower, limited only by the consent of the Minister in relation to the guarantee of repayment to the bank. The clause also gives the board power to purchase canned fruit. As has been pointed out in this place in two years, proposals such as those contained in this clause of the bill are in line with the proposals that I oudined on behalf of the Australian Labour Party in the speech that I delivered in 1961 relating to Labour's rural policy. That is another slab of Labour Party policy which the Government has adopted. At that time we expressed the opinion that the power and authority of most of these export control boards associated with primary industries should be enlarged substantially so that, subject to certain safeguards, they could engage in a good deal more trading, financing and promoting of the product with which they are concerned. I am glad that this is the case here. In passing, may 1 say that I appreciate the Minister's statement that this industry has not been continually on the doorstep of the governments of this country, seeking assistance. He recalls to my mind an occasion 32 years ago when I happened to be associated with the Victorian Department of Agriculture. A deputation of representatives of the canned fruit organizations in Shepparton approached me, as the Minister administering the department, in an effort to raise the small sum of £29,000 to enable the Shepparton canneries to pay the growers £4 a ton at the door of the cannery, to process the fruit and to export it in an attempt, as the deputation pointed out to me, to offset some of our very onerous overseas liabilities at that time. The State Government had no resources of its own because the financial powersthat-be had clamped down on financial accommodation, following years of sad mismanagement of the economy. However, my colleague, the late William Slater, and I approached the Commonwealth Bank and appealed to the then governor of the bank, the late Sir Robert Gibson, for assistance. We said, "" If this money is advanced to the industry, the industry will process and produce an exportable commodity"". Sir Robert-ver y imposing, very conservative - stroke d his beard and then offered me a cigar, which I accepted. My friend did not smoke. After pacing the room for a considerable time he said: ""Well, gentlemen, your suggestion is a sound one. The money will be made available."" Then his political spleen came to light and he said, quite sincerely, ""But I will not help that the last man Lang"". That is why, due to the machinations of those who hated the Labour movement at that time, the doors of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales were closed. That is just a little story in passing.",61
149,Mr BEATON,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Bendigo) [5.8] - Clause 17 (1.) is in these termsThe Board has power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions. Will the power given to the board by this clause enable it to approach the Tariff Board to seek additional protection against imports from overseas or will the industry itself, or sections of the industry, have to make an approach to the Tariff Board? I should like the Minister to clear that point for me. In the lastfinancialyear about £130,000 worth of canned fruit was imported into Australia, the majority coming from California. Honourable members will know that in the capital cities the big stores, such as Myer's in Melbourne, have on their shelves for sale to the public Californian peaches and pears. This seems to be a ridiculous situation. The Australian industry is struggling for survival. We have legislation to assist the industry in its battle for survival, yet canned peaches and pears are permitted to come here from overseas and to compete against the Australian product. It may be said, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) has said so often when discussing legislation relating to tariffs, that imports prevent inefficency, but my estimation of this industry is that it is extremely efficient. It does not require the importation of canned fruits to keep it, shall we say, on its toes. The industry has a carry-over from last season of something like 1,000,000 cartons of canned fruit, so it isridiculousthat we should be importing canned fruit from America or anywhere else. Surely, in addition to this legislation, which has been introduced at such short notice, the Government should consider giving immediate protection to the industry against the inroads of canned fruit from overseas. Will the Minister tell me why the Australian industry should not be protected against competition from canned fruit from California? The next thing that we can expect to happen is that South Africa, which competes against our canned fruit on the British market, will export her canned fruit to Australia and attack the domestic market here. Wage costs in the South African industry are probably one-quarter of those in the Australian industry. We should protect out industry, which is battling for survival, by some form of import control. Can the board approach the Tariff Board and ask for either emergency assistance or the imposition of import controls, or must the individual canners make this approach?",62
150,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Murray-Minister for Trade) [5.11] - The Australian Canned Fruits Board would not approach the Tariff Board because normally it would not be an owner or a seller of fruit. To that extent it normally would not be an interested party. The interested party would be the cannery. There is a tightly-organized Australian canners association as well as a canning fruit growers association. Under Australian law and practice, if an industry makes a prima facie case of the need for protection it is entitled to a reference to the Tariff Board. Mr Beaton - But under this legislation the board will be a seller.",63
151,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"It is contemplated that the board will be a seller in only a very minor way, by comparison with the normal channels of disposal. However, I think the question is academic because the canners, who are well organized, have the right to ask for a reference to the Tariff Board. There is in fact a tariff on these products at present, so there could be a request for the tariff to be increased. The general implication of the honourable member's speech was that, as we quite clearly can supply the Australian market and as this industry has its difficulties, there should such a tariff or control as would result in no overseas fruit being permitted to come into Australia. I agree immediately that there is no need for any overseas fruit to enter Australia, but let us remember that if Australia adopted the policy suggested, we would have no grounds on which to argue if another country said that it would adopt a similar policy. Some European or other country could then say, "" Because we can produce canned fruit here no Australian canned fruit will be allowed to enter"". There would be no future for Australia, as the twelfth largest international trader, if by its own actions it established grounds upon which countries that import our commodities would be justified in saying that they would not allow our products to enter because they could produce those products themselves. Clause agreed to. Clauses 19 to 30-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 31 (Directions by Minister).  clause is somewhat obscure to me. The Minister for Trade probably has the easy answer. The clause reads(1.) The Minister may, by instrument in writing, direct the Board that moneys standing to the credit of a Fund specified in the instrument shall not be applied for a purpose specified in the instrument. (2.) In this section, "" Fund "" means the Canned Fruits Export Fund or the Canned Fruits Excise Fund. In simple terms, does this clause mean that the Minister may direct that money standing to the credit of the Canned Fruits Export Fund or the Canned Fruits Excise Fund shall not be used for the purposes of those funds, in order to facilitate the utilization of that money for the purpose, say, of subsidizing the sale of part of the export pack? I may be a little dense, but this clause is a little obscure to me.",63
152,Mr MCEWEN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Murray-Minister for Trade) [5.17] - The functions and powers bestowed on the Australian Canned Fruits Board by this legislation are very wide. They are set out in clauses 16 to 22 of the bill. The language is very broad in order to give the board complete flexibility in assisting sales of canned fruits, which may be made by a variety of means and in a be variety of places. Because these provisions have been consciously drafted so widely and because these funds will be raised as a result of a decision of the Parliament, it is felt that it is proper that there should be preserved to the Parliament, through the Minister, some residual right in this regard. I think that it is a proper matter of government policy. Clause agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-take n as a whole, and agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; adopted. Third Reading.

On behalf the Opposition, I thank the Minister for answering, to the best of his knowledge and experience, the questions that have been (vide page 2411), raised during the debate on this bill. Unfortunately, the provisions of this bill do not apply to the berry fruits industry in Tasmania, particularly in the Huon and Derwent valleys. We believe that the bill will give some benefit to fruit-growers on the mainland. After 30th November a federal Labour government will consider a similar bill for the berry fruits Tasmania, which is in difficulties similar to those of the canned fruits industry. It has third time. come to my notice that the Minister for Social Services (Mr Roberton) has sold his farm and has come to live in Wagga. am wondering why he has not spoken on this bill, which relates to an industry in which he is so deeply involved.",64

Following international consultations and talks .with representatives of both manusilk facturing and importing sections of tralian paper industry, proposals No. 95 spells out in a more practical manner the changes recommended by the Tariff Board in its report on paper and paperboard which was tabled on 17th April this year. Briefly, the changes involved in the proposals, which are in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board in each case, follows:-On refrigerating appliance parts increased protection is imposed on sealed motor units up to 2 horse-power. Othervalidate wise duties revert to the level applying before the temporary duties were imposed. In respect of television receiver components minimum duties of 25s. each and 10s. each, respectively, are imposed on channel tuners for television receivers and deflection for cathode ray tubes. For vinyl acetate the duties are imposed at a level of £57 a adjourned. ton most-favoured-nation tariff. This is higher than the ordinary duties previously applying but lower than the combined ordinary and temporary duties. Consequent on the. implementation of Tariff Board report on glycerine, fatty acids, soaps and other detergents, duties have been increased on refined glycerine, oleic acid, stearic acid and on organic surface^active agents and preparations thereof. Crude glycerine remains admissible at non-protective rates of duty while the duties on crude tall oil, which is not produced in Australia, are being removed entirely. The protective duties on soaps remain unchanged. On floor coverings of linoleum, cork, vinyl, rubber, asbestos and like compositions, the changes recommended by the Tariff Board in general provide moderately increased protection against competition a first time. from the main source, of imports. On engravers' blocks, the board has again recommended a moderate increase tection against imports from the main source of competition affecting the production in Australia of engravers' zinc plates. Linen fabrics become dutiable at ad valorem rates of 37i per cent. British preferential tariff and 47i per cent, intermediate tariff in lieu of the existing cumulative duties. Prepared painting canvas, which is not produced in Australia, becomes admissible at non-protective rates of free British preferential tariff and 7 i per cent, otherwise. Increased protection of 9d. a square yard is accorded for the printing of piece goods in accordance with the the AusTariff Board's recommendations. The tariff changes in Proposals No. 95 relating to paper merely allocate the Tariff Board's basic recommendations for coated paper and paperboards in a somewhat more sophisticated manner. The extra divisions have the full support of Australian paper are as manufacturers and importers. I commend the proposals to honourable members. The Government proposes to the collection of duties imposed under these proposals until 30th June, 1964, by means of a bill to be. submitted to the Parliament shortly.

159,Mr DAVIES,ADVANCE TO THE,"Braddon) [5.35] - The Copper Bounty Bill was introduced this morning by the Minister for Supply (Mr. Fairhall). It implements recommendations of the Tariff Board which were made recently after an inquiry into the copper industry. Payment of the bounty will be extended for a further two years from lst January, 1964. The industry will continue to receive assistance through a combination of the bounty and a duty. The duty operates when the overseas price of copper falls below £290 a ton. The bounty rate of £35 a ton applies when the overseas price of copper is £290 a ton or less. The Labour Party strongly supports the measure. It is of great importance not only to Tasmania but also to other areas. It is of particular importance to the west coast of Tasmania where Queenstown, with a population of about 5,000, Gormanston and the port of Strahan are almost entirely dependent for their existence on the well-being and prosperity of the Mount Lyell copper mine. The Tariff Board's report which was presented to the Parliament this morning recognizes this state of affairs. On page 21 of the report it is saidWithout bounty assistance to Mount Lyell, the population of Queenstown, Gormanston and Strahan would be forced to move to other centres, the nearest being more than '100 miles away, and substantial public and private capital would be lost. It has been estimated that the replacement value of the property and public amenities in the district, even after excluding State roads and the company's operating buildings and installations is about £10,000,000. I want to pay the highest possible tribute to all associated with Mount Lyell. It works on the lowest grade of copper ore being used anywhere in the world. It is because of the excellent management of Mr H. Murray-and of his father before him-and because of the excellent employer-employee relationship that the mine has been able to operate and play such an important part in the economic life of this country. The Tariff Board's report, which has led to the legislation before us this afternoon, recognizes the efficiency and the high degree of management skill displayed at the mine. At page 10 of the report the board statesImprovements in the company's operating efficiency have been achieved at the various of production. For example, at the mining stage, trucking costs per' ton have been reduced by 39 per cent., and the tons of material moved per man shift increased from 34.3 in 1959 to 36.4 in 1963. Also the recovery from milling and treatment has increased by the equivalent of approximately 720 tons of copper per year, representing an increase of net revenue of £140,000 per year. Coke consumption by the company's smelter decreased by 28 per cent, per ton of copper between 1959 and 1963, equivalent to a cost saving of £90,000 per year. Mount Lyell recently ceased its railway operations, and is now relying on road transport for haulage to. and from Strahan. The company expects that this will reduce costs by £120,000 annum. As well, a study of operating and maintenance methods and techniques is being undertaken in all departments, and Mount Lyell anticipates that appreciable cost reductions will result. We are sorry to see the railway line go. linked the mining town of Queenstown with the port of Strahan. It was operated the Abt system. A cog lowered from underthe neath the engine fitted into a saw-toothed arrangement between the two rails. By this means the train was hauled up through about 6 miles of very picturesque country and let down the slope on the other side. It was the only train of its type anywhere in Australia. As well as transporting the products of the company to Strahan, it hauled passenger carriages. A trip in train through 26 miles of beautiful country to Strahan was looked forward to and experienced with a great deal of pleasure tourists from all over the world. Howhas ever, because of competition from Mount Isa and other mines the Mount Lyell comcapacity pany has been forced to give up the railMount way line. Its products are now transported to Strahan by road. Various attempts were made to keep the railway line open, but when you consider that its closure will save the mining company £120,000 a year, you see that the closure was inevitable. Such a saving must be particularly considered by a mining company which operates on the lowest grade of copper ore worked anywhere in the world today. At Mount Lyell the copper content of the ore is .7 cent. At Mount Morgan it is about 1 per cent. At Mount Isa it is 3 per cent, at Peko, in the Northern Territory, it is per cent. Last year the Mount Isa company treated almost 2,000,000 tons of ore and recovered 55,000 tons of copper. At Mount Lyell more than 2,000,000 tons of ore was treated, but the copper recovered was only stages one-quarter of the recovery at Mount Isa. About 13,344 tons of copper was recovered at Mount Lyell from the treatment of 2,000,000 tons of ore. The estimated average ratio of waste to ore is .83 to one at Mount Lyell. This means that the company must remove almost 1,000,000 tons of overburden and almost 1,500,000 tons of ore to produce 10,000 tons of copper. These figures stress the high degree of efficiency of the mining operations at Mount Lyell. I consider that the Tariff Board has acted correctly in recommending assistance to the industry. The Mount Lyell mine is recogper nized in mining circles throughout the world as being possibly the most efficient mine operating in the world today. The bounty provided for in this legislal t tion is payable only on copper sold in Australia. In their statements to the Tariff by Board, the Copper Producers Association, Mount Lyell company and the Mount Morgan company all requested that the bounty be paid on the production of copper in Australia, rather than on sales of copper in Australia. Until a few years ago, the Mount Lyell company was practically the sole producer of copper in Australia. So the bounty applied to every ton of copper produced by that company. But, in recent this years, Mount Isa Mines Limited has increased its production tremendously and has now taken a great share of the Ausby tralian market. Production at Mount Isa risen from about 40,000 tons four years ago to more than 55,000 tons last year. The of the mine and the smelter at Isa is about 75,000 tons of copper a year. Further expansion that is under way there will be completed in the financial year 1966-67. This will allow for an annual production of 100,000 tons of copper at Mount Isa. When we consider that the demand in Australia is for only 50,000 to 55,000 tons a year, we realise that the proportion of the output of some companies taken by the home per market is diminishing and that they must export more of their finished product. The and fact that the proportion of production 6 exported does not qualify for bounty, and the fact that the increased production of various mines has forced them to export rftore, no doubt led the copper producers at Mount Isa, Mount Morgan and Mount Lyell to put to the Tariff Board the submission that bounty be made payable on all copper produced in Austraha rather than just on the proportion of output sold here. I mention this because it is estimated that, in 1965, Australia will produce about 130,000 tons of copper. Since at least half of that will be exported, only half the production will qualify for bounty under the present arrangements. That presents a problem to these mines in isolated areas, which are doing a wonderful job in developing resources and maintaining outback communities. So this problem will have to be looked at again, Sir. The Mount Lyell company, in its submission to the Tariff Board, requested that the cost of removing waste over the next three years be charged against operating costs, regardless of the theoretical average of the ratio of waste to ore. But this submission has been rejected. I have already mentioned the huge amount of overburden that has to be removed in operations at Mount Lyell. The removal costs are very considerable, and they have to be debited against some sections of normal mining operations. I do not know whether it is possible at this late hour for the Minister for Supply, who is in charge of the bill, to tell me why these costs cannot be charged against operating costs. Perhaps he can let us have some information about this when he replies to the debate. The continuing of the bounty for the next two years is a wonderful thing for the mines at Mount Lyell, Mount Morgan and elsewhere. We of the Australian Labour Party wholeheartedly support the measure. However, I would bave liked more time to examine various aspects of it. I am sure the Minister appreciates that, as it was sented to us this morning and as we have to dispose of it this afternoon, time is too limited for closer examination of its provisions and more detailed discussion of the effects on some of the mining companies of the non-payment of bounty on the proportion of output exported. I understand that only one copy of the Tariff Board's report is available, and I greatly appreciate the Minister's co-operation and courtesy in F.9601/63 - Ji - f.93 ] enabling me to examine it. Having looked through the report, I realise that the board has considered certain matters in arriving at its recommendation that the rate of bounty be the same as the rate paid for the last two years. I should have liked, also, to examine more closely the effects of the bill on the position of the smaller producers and various other aspects of it. I point out that the present act will expire on the last day of this year. Therefore, with an eleotion to be held shortly and the possibility that the Parliament will not meet again until next year, after some months have passed, it is important to the economic life of the people and the districts concerned that this measure be passed. The Tariff Board has recommended that the bounty continue at the same rate as before, and that will be of undoubted benefit to the company at Mount Lyell and the mines at Mount Morgan and elsewhere that produce copper. For these reasons, as I have said, we on this side of the chamber heartily support the bill. At this stage, Sir, I should like to pay tribute to the Tariff Board. It has shown by the conduct of its inquiry that it appreciates the wonderful work that is being done by the mining companies in remote areas and in earning export income by the export of copper, which is an important export commodity for Australia. Although, as I have said, I would have liked time to examine certain matters in more detail, I certainly have no complaint about this measure. I realise how important it is, and how beneficial it will be, particularly to the Mount Lyell company which, as I have said, mines the lowest grade copper ore in the world. The bounty will be very valuable indeed to that company. Perhaps a member on my side of the House should not commend this Government so close to pre- election day, but I commend the Government on the introduction of this bill.",76
160,Mr RIORDAN,ADVANCE TO THE,"Kennedy) [5.53] - Mr . Speaker, I do not propose to detain the House long in speaking in support of this bill. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) has just stated the position of Mount Isa Mines Limited but the effect on the gougers' mines in the Mount Isa area is the aspect of the measure with which I am particularly concerned. This bill results from a Tariff Board inquiry. In 1960, a similar measure was introduced after a Tariff Board inquiry. On that occasion, the board recommended that legislation be enacted to enable bounty to be paid for five years, but the Government decided that it would provide for bounty to be paid only for three years. Now, after another Tariff Board inquiry, this bill will give effect to the Tariff Board's recommendation in 1958 that bounty be paid for five years. The Minister for Supply (Mr Fairhall), in his second-reading speech saidThe board has made its recommendation for continuation of the existing rate of bounty as, in effect, a holding action for the next two years. By that time, the position in regard to the potential new mine at Cobar, New South Wales, and its effect as a new major producer on domestic and export sales of the present mines, will be clearer and easier to assess. If the Government is honest and sincere about its desire to encourage development, why should what happens at Cobar have any effect on the payment of a bounty to a small producer elsewhere? This bill will benefit only those who produce 100 tons over two years. Why should they be adversely affected by what happens at Cobar? As I have said, this bill provides for the payment of a bounty to the small producer. We know what the mining industry has done for the north-west of western Queensland. The honourable member for Braddon referred to the development of Mount Isa. That is one example of the development which follows mining. The Mary Kathleen, which is suspending operations temporarily, is another indication of what mining has done in an isolated and under-populated part of Queensland. Therefore, irrespective of what happens at Cobar or any other place, why should not every possible encouragement be given to the small producer? Indeed, the bounty should be paid not only on the copper sold on the domestic market but on all copper produced by the small producers.",78
161,Unknown,ADVANCE TO THE,Sitting suspended from 5.56 to 8 p.m.,79
162,Mr RIORDAN,ADVANCE TO THE,"Before the suspension of the sitting, 1 referred to the fact mining had led to the settlement of a virile population in the sparsely settled areas of north-west Queensland. Such centres of population can be found at Mount Isa and Mary Kathleen, which are two very fine towns. The limitation of 100 tons over a period of two years will mean that quite a number of copper gougers or small producers will be covered by the bill, if they can have their ore treated and sold on the domestic market. These men work more than 600 miles west of Townsville. The only place where they can sell their ore is at Mount Isa. However, Mount Isa Mines Limited has placed a limit on the amount of customs ore that it wiil buy, because it has its own ore to treat. In consequence, many men who have leases are unable to sell their ore. In addition, Mount Isa Mines Limited has decided that if there is the slightest suggestion of a nickel content in the copper ore, it will not buy the customs ore. The only places the miners can sell this rejected ore are Mount Morgan, which is about 1,000 miles away, or Port Kembla, in New South Wales. ' If they sent their ore to these places, they would be working for the railways, because freight would take any money they received for the ore. If the miners were allowed to sell their ore on the export market as well as on the domestic market, many leases which today are not Being worked would be worked. Japanese buyers are on the Cloncurry field now negotiating with the copper co-operative, which was formed a few years ago by the gougers on the field. The gougers wanted to have a treatment plant established so that they could develop their leases. I know that it is of no use appealing to this Government now, because we are only four weeks away from an election. However, after 30th November, a more sympathetic government will take office and it will give favourable consideration to the requests of these small gougers who are covered by the bill. Irrespective of where their ore is sold, whether on the domestic market or the export market, they sbould receive the bounty. This would have a twofold effect. The production of copper would be increased and this would mean the development of an area in which the Government says it is interested-tba t is, the north of Australia. In addition, the town of that Cloncurry would be developed. This, of course, is only one centre of population in the area. The business people in the town would derive some benefit from the increased local income, and the whole of the Australian economy would benefit because these people would be selling their copper overseas and helping to increase our overseas balances. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said that this bounty would cost between £490,000 and £660,000 in a year. If the incoming government agrees to pay the copper bounty to the small people producing up to 100 tons in two years, the whole of the community will derive some benefit. Miners' costs are very high. The lorries used to cart the ore from the leases to Mount Isa are very costly. They travel through areas where there are no roads or, in some cases, even bush tracks. The wear and tear on tires is very heavy. In consequence, the cost of the transport of ore is high. 1 know that the incoming government will give sympathetic consideration to the suggestions I have made. Whoever produces the ore should receive the bounty, whether the ore is sold on the domestic market or on the export market. I do not wish to detain the House any longer. I have been told that I am the second last man in. The wicket is playing very well and there are plenty of runs in it. 1 know that on 30th November the Australian Labour Party will score a record number of runs.",79
163,Mr NELSON,ADVANCE TO THE,"Northern Territory) [8.6]. - I want to say just a few words on the in the dying hours of the Parliament. This measure is important to the Northern TerriThis tory. A substantial bounty such as that provided in the bill would result in hundreds of small mines in the Northern Territory being worked. We in the Northern Territory at this time want mineral producThere tion more than anything else. The bill will enable small producers to take advantage of facilities such as the treatment plant Rum Jungle when the mine there ceases produce uranium. The mining of uranium ore there has ceased, but ore is still treated. The Government announced recently that the treatment plant at Rum Jungle will be made available for the ment of ores from other places. We in the Northern Territory believe that hundreds of deposits of copper ore would be worked if the facilities for treatment were available on an economic basis. We have asked the Government to provide bonuses and subsidies for the treatment of the ore, because it has to be carted over distances of 100 to 150 miles-fro m places far afield-to the treatment plant. Subsidies such as that, together with the subsidy granted in this bill, would give a distinct advantage to copper producers. We know that gold is a very attractive proposition, but the mining of base metal ore bodies leads to the establishment of centres of population. In the mining of copper, lead, zinc and similar materials, we have the best means of creating work and establishing towns. Mr Luchetti - Would you say that copper is one of the main metals?",80
164,Mr NELSON,ADVANCE TO THE,"Yes , it is one of the principal metals. It is an export commodity that could provide big exchange benefits for this nation. In addition, it could create, as Mount Isa and other copper fields have shown, the means of developing centres of population. No other activity could give the same benefit. We support the measure. We support any measure that will encourage the production of any base metal or gold. In this instance, a bounty is being paid for a base metal. I join with my colleague, the honbill orable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), in saying that we welcome this proposition. and other forms of assistance given on a consistent and long-term basts will increase mining activities in the Northern Territory. If this assistance were not given, these activities would not be undertaken. are other types of ore such as silver, silver-lead, zinc and so on, but copper is a commodity that has a world-wide attracat tion. The sale of our copper overseas cams to exchange for Australia. Copper mining is a means of establishing communities if the being Commonwealth Government at this stage provides, in addition to the subsidy, communications in the form of roads and railtreatways, which would benefit not only the Northern Territory but also the rest of Australia.

165,Mr KELLY,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION,"Wakefield) [8.12] - I expected an Opposition member to resume this debate. I rise only to protest against what seems to be an unreasonable procedure. Before today, we had many tariff proposals in the machine, so to speak, founded on twenty Tariff Board reports. This afternoon, another set of proposals, founded on seven more Tariff Board reports, were presented. It is evident that we will not debate them now. If the reports continue to come in even at considerably less than the present rate of intake, by the time House again meets, perhaps in the middle of March, we will have 57 reports before us. The reports may not be as interesting to other honourable members as they sometimes are to my morbid mind, but I protest of that it is impossible for any to deal with 57 Tariff Board reports in one tariff debate. There arc limits to the endurance of the House, if not to my endurance, and I do not think such procedure is reasonable. If the House wants these tariff items to be debated seriously-as I think they ought to be-and democratic processes require that they be so debated-this method of proceeding imposes an impossible on any honourable member, however dedicated or devoted to the subject he may be. I cannot let this bill be passed without entering a protest. Whatever government may be in power in March, the House will have to debate 57 Tariff Board reports am not issuing a threat, but it is obvious fhat some one will have to debate them some detail. I have had the morbid on experience of having to discuss sixteen Tariff Board reports during one debate and it is not a pleasant experience. To debate 57 Tariff Board reports on one occasion would be a mournful experience not only for me but for the whole House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading.

166,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Kooyongload Prime Minister) [8.17] - Mr Speaker Mr Curtin - Will ye no come back again?,81
167,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"The answer to that question, to use a homely phrase, is -1 '* Too right"". But now that we have reached the end of the session, and indeed, the in end of the Parliament, I just want to say, behalf of all honourable members, that we are anxious to express our indebtedness, lo you, Sir; to the other presiding officers; lo the Clerks at the table who manage to keep us out of an almost incredible amount of trouble; to the members of the "" Hansard "" staff who record and improve our speeches; to all those who minister to our comfort and our needs, in the Library, in the dining room, in whatever part of the Parliament we may be. We are greatly indebted to all of them. But I never come to the end of a parliament without thinking that we are primarily indebted to each other in Parliament. I think I have had occasion to say before that the few trifling skiffs which cross the water are occasionally magnified, I believe, into very serious trouble. Having been here a long lime, I must say that I have not known very much serious trouble. In fact, looking back on my own time, I have known, from both my friends and foes, far more friendship than I have enmity. I think this is a not uncommon experience in this House. We are going out to attack and baltic with each other. If I may say so, I bave not failed to notice this week a few vague hints on the conflict to come. All sorts of people will tell us what the results will be, but the electors will tell us all on 30th November. All I want to say now is that I tbink this has been a very interesting Parliament-ver y interesting and very difiicult, I suppose, for all of us-becaus e almost equally divided parliaments present their own problems, not all of which present themselves on the surface. There is a state of constant tension and difficulty. But speaking as one who has had a long experience of many parliamentary terms, I look back on this one as a term of immense interest. I do not want to say to my opponents that I wish them well except in a personal way. I hope that they remain in good health. Mr K.'irdan - Many happy returns?",81
168,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Oh , yes! Looking at four or five of my opponents I am confident that they will be baek with us. I shall do my best to prevent some of them from coming back and, of course, they will reciprocate the courtesy and do their best to see that some of my colleagues do not come back. This is all part of the great conflict of politics. All I can say is .that it is a conflict which is the proof of democracy. If we conduct the conflict like honest democrats, fight hard and take he f verdict, this will be a wonderful experience for all-, of us. I wish all honourable members a Happy Christmas. Christmas comes 25 days after St; Andrew's Day, and St. Andrew's Day is polling day. I would not have you believe that I am so Scottish as to be superstitious, but I think this is a handsome event. I offer the personal good wishes of all of us to all of our fellow members in this Parliament, because although we are in different parties and we sometimes have violent points of difference, we all are honoured by serving in this Parliament the people of Australia by the choice of the people. On this occasion one cannot foretellone never can-wha t voluntary retirements may occur. I should refer on this occasion to several honourable members who are leaving us. First there is my most valued colleague, the Postmaster-General (Mr. Davidson). He has not had the easiest assignment in the world. He has occasionally encountered troubled waters, but I have pointed out to him more than once that he has a singular advantage over me because if a question is put to me all I have to do is to stand up in my place, which does not give me much time to think of an answer, but my colleague walks all the way from his seat to the table, which gives him time to think of three bad answers, discard them, and come down in favour of a fourth. I have explained this to him many times. Every member of this House respects him. He is a very fine Australian. He has served Australia in many fields. We are sorry that considerations of health have induced him to leave us. I will miss greatly seeing the honoraMe member for New England (Mr Drummond) stand, look at me and say, "" I have a question to put to the right honourable the Prime Minister"", because I know full well w'.at the question will be about. He has had a long and honourable service, not only in this Parliament but also in the Parliament of New South Wales. We shall miss him. We shall miss also the honourable member for Moore (Mi*. Leslie). His health has been indifferent. He suffers from some physical disabilities which are the pure result of gallantry and patriotism. He has a.remarkable record of service to our country. I would like him to know that no matter what party we may belong to, he leaves us with our profound respect. Then of course two veterans on the other side of the House are leaving us, if 1 may refer to them. Mr Calwell - And the honourable member for Cunningham.",82
169,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I am indebted to my friend. 1 was thinking, as 1 always do in point of time, first of my old and valued friend, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Makin). Here is a man who has been a Minister, a great and zealous member of the Parliament and an ambassador for Australia in a very great country. He has been my constant opponent, except when he was in the Speaker's chair, when he really behaved, I thought, with singular impartiality. Mr Griffiths - Did he ever put you out?",83
170,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"The only Speaker who ever put me out was the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark). If I may forget for a moment the forms of the House, I would like to say to Norman Makin that I will miss him. We all will miss him. We are quite sure that he goes out of parliamentary life, although I dare say not out of public life, with a high spirit and with great pride. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) also is a great friend and a fine member. 1 would like to tell him that only today 1 was speaking about bim to somebody and I said, "" He represents to me one of the finest examples of what I call the classical virtues of the Labour member and the lifetime servant of the Labour movement"". He has complete integrity-w e all respect this. He bas recovered remarkably from a period of ill health. I hope that he lives for a long, long time. We are losing also the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Kearney). We shall miss him. It is an extraordinary thing how, as time goes on, we come and we go. I always comfort myself by knowing that when the day comes for me to leave, if I leave on my own flat feet 1 will be surprised to find how many nice things may bc said about me. To-night, however, 1 speak in terms of utter substance. These men who are leaving us, voluntarily as I have said, will leave a great gap in this House. We shall look back on the enjoyment of their company with great pleasure. Sir, I want to extend my warm good wishes to all those who have tended to our needs-to the Leader of the Opposition and to all mcmbers of the House. I thank my colleagues for their most faithful support. Last but not least I want to say that in a parliament that is almost equally divided the Whips have a man-sized job. We have been very fortunate to have such good Whipssuch zealous Whips-and in my case such commanding Whips to see that the numbers are right. Sir, a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you.",83
171,Mr CALWELL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Melbourne-Leade r of the Opposition) [8.29] - To-nigh t I agree with everything that the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) has said. I may not agree with all that he says from here onat least until 30th November. He has spoken very fairly, very eloquently and very justly about all the people who serve usabout ali the people who minister to us and about those who are with us now for the last time and who, because of ill-health and other reasons, are leaving us. Thcie is always sadness ir departure. There is always sadness in the thought that those who are with us will not be with us if we happen to be among the lucky ones who will come back. The Prime Minister has taken consolation in the fact that 30th November is St. Andrew's Day. Sir Robert Menzies Not consolation, dear boy; pride.",83
172,Mr CALWELL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Well , may I say pride and consolation. After all, he did not go to St. Andrew's Cathedral to be installed; he went to St. Giles's. I do not know when St. Giles's Day happens to fall, but I do know that lst December is Advent Sunday. I know that the day on which the Prime Minister issues the writs is All Saints Day.",83
173,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Obviousl y that docs not apply.,83
174,Mr CALWELL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I take consolation, pride and hope from the fact that 30th November and lst December have been honoured at least canouically. For the last two years we have had a balanced Parliament, even if the debates have not always been balanced. We have done the best that we can to carry on the government of the country. There have been losses on our side which we deplored. All honourable members have mourned with us the deaths of three members of this House and one of another place. One never knows the fate of members once elected to a parliament. I hope that the next Parliament will be like the Parliament elected in 1946 which in three years did not suffer a death or have any tragedy befall any honourable member. I hope that the next Parliament will be the one that we want to see elected, but whatever the people decide will be acceptable to us. The voice of democracy must always be honoured. There are some people in the world, even in the Western world, who still think that the only good government is the one that they want to choose. To me democracy means majority rule. There is nothing sacred about majority rule. It is the principle of order but not necessarily of justice. We can only settle for the proposition that whether the majority be 99 to I or 51 to 49, majority rule is the best system of government that we know. The only other system is one of dictatorship or semi-dictatorship. We in the English-speaking world have learned to work along democratic lines, so we will survive. We have been able to make democracy work. That is our great strength. We have our hopes and sometimes, of course, we have our disappointments. The people will decide the constitution of the 25th Parliament of the Commonwealth on 30th November and we will loyally accept the decision, whatever it may bc. We will fight our fights according to the best of our ability. We will impress our personalities upon our electorates. We will persuade the electors to the best of our ability and then, when the vote is taken, we will say, "" Well, the people have made their decision for the next three years"". Whatever government is elected to Office, may I express the hope that some move will be made to enlarge this Parliament in a logical manner. May the next government, from whichever side it comes, Adjournment. . 2525 put to the people the recommendation of the Constitutional Review Committee with respect to the relationship of the two Houses so that ultimately we will be able to enlarge the membership of the Parliament as the population increases. This Parliament has great responsibilities and it will have greater responsibilities. The process of time will not work in favour of any eroding of Commonwealth powers; it will work in favour of more centralization of power, irrespective of whether State Parliaments and State politicians like it. Perhaps this is not the time to say these things but I am saying them now because I think that the future of this country demands that the National Farliament, which has enormous responsibilities and will have even greater responsibilities in the future, should be large enough to represent the views of the people and the nation. On behalf of the Opposition, I wish all honourable members a very happy Christmas. I wish them personal good health and good luck. We will try to take seats from honourable members opposite. We have great hopes and expectations. They, too, have great hopes and expectations. Well, we will join issue with them. They will fight their fight; we will fight ours. Ultimately, when the result is known, the people of Australia will be able to say that they have been fully informed during the campaign of all the relevant issues. I trust that no one will be able to say that he cast a vote without first having the fullest information on all the issues involved. To the Prime Minister, to whom I owe some debt for his personal consideration of requests that I have made to him from time to time on behalf of Opposition members, I express my thanks. He has not been unmindful of the Opposition's position in this Parliament. He has played the part of a good parliamentarian. He has recognized that there must be an Opposition in this and in every democratic parliament, because in a democracy the opposition is the alternative government. If we were the government we would have to do the same as he has done. We would be recreant to our duty if we did not do what he has done ih the long period in which he has been the Prime Minister of Australia. There is nothing more that I can do, except to say to the honourable member for New England (Mr Drummond) with whom I served on the Constitutional Review Committee, that I hope he lives long enough to see the realization of his dearest dream, which I will not mention.",83
175,Mr MCEWEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Murray-Minister for Trade) [8.39] - Mr Speaker, 1 should like to join with the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Calwell) in expressing my thanks and the thanks of my party to you for the fair and able manner in which you have presided over the House, and to the Chairman of Committees and your deputies. I join in the expressions of thanks to the staff of "" Hansard "" and of the Library and to the multitude of other people who service the Parliament-includin g those who personally serve Ministers. I thank the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Whips and all who combine to make the institution of parliament operate. 1 join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in recognizing that, particularly in this 24th Parliament, the Whips have bad a particularly difficult job. Without exception they have discharged their onerous duties most ably, faithfully and fairly. This has been a hard Parliament, but when it commenced we recognized that it would be hard in the personal sense. The calls on us have been more exacting than we have been accustomed to previously, but we have come through. We go presently to give the people an opportunity to choose a government which will command a more comfortable majority in the House. Of course, 1 join with all my friends on side of the House in hoping, and indeed in being confident, that we will be the people's choice. But we, like the Leader of the Opposition, will accept the verdict of the people as the proper expression of democracy. This is an occasion of some sadness for me in thnt I am now speaking in the presence of three of my colleagues who, of their own decision, will not hereafter sit this Parliament. My deputy leader, the Postmaster-General, the Honourable Charles Davidson, has served this Parliament and our Government with ability, distinction and unchallenged integrity. He has had a difficult portfolio, but 1 think friend and foe alike would say that he has done a jolly good job. His service to this country has not been only in the Parliament. He served this country in the two world wars with great distinction. In fact, there are topographical features in New Guinea known as Charlie's Hill and Davidson's Ridge. So he will be remembered there. He came to us with a very specialized knowledge of the sugar industry, of which he had become one of the great Australian leaders before coming into this Parliament. All of us-and I in particular - wil l miss our close personal acquaintanceship with the Postmaster-General. My colleague, the honourable member for New England (Mr Drummond), chooses to go out of parliamentary life now of his own decision, after a phenomenally long period of 29 years in this Parliament and the Parliament of New South Wales. He served in that State Parliament with distinction. He served in more than one cabinet. He then elected to come into the federal arena and, as we all know, he has served here since 1949 with continuing devotion to the general high standards that he upholds and to the particular objectives that are dear to him-the establishment of new States in New South Wales, the principle of new States generally, the welfare of rural interests and furthering the cause of education in this country. We will miss him, and his contributions to this Parliament will be missed. To-night we thank hjm. My colleague, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Leslie), like my other colleagues, has elected not to contest his scat this again. He is a man with a great record. He served in his teens with the forces of South Africa in the First World War. He came to Australia and served in the Second World War. He was severely wounded at Tobruk. He has the distinction of belonging to that excellent band, the "" Rats of Tobruk "". He turned to the Western Aus^ tralian Parliament, in which he served my party with great distinction, as he has done in this Parliament. He has an indomitable in fighting spirit. When friend or foe got in his way when he was fighting for what he believed in, he went on fighting. Hugh Leslie will be remembered in Ihis Parliament as a friend, a man of distinction, a man of honour and a man of principle. We will miss from the Parliament- I certainly shall-the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Makin). Here is a man who has a tremendous record of service to his party. Of all the present members of this House, he was the earliest elected. He was elected to this Parliament away back in 1919, His period of service has not been continuous, but that is because he assumed another form of office for a period at the request of the government of the day. He has been a Speaker, a Minister and an ambassador. What higher succession of honour could come to any one man? He has brought honour to himself, to his party, to his State, to this country and to this Parliament. We shall miss him. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) is a man of direct approach and the utmost probity, who has earned the respect of every one in this House. He might well have served in a higher office than those in which he has bad an opportunity to serve in this Parliament. We will remember his record as one of service and example to which any one might willingly aspire. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Kearney), unhappily, has not enjoyed good health in recent times. He has served his cause and his party in this House. He has carried the banner of his party in the cause for which he has fought well in this Parliament I think it is right, in the difficult life that we all lead, that when men choose go ©ut voluntarily expressions of this should be voiced in this Parliament, because there is not much reward other than the satisfaction that one gets from serving this Parliament. It is good to tbink that those with whom they serve are willing anxious to put on record some recognition of the service performed by them. We see objectives and policies differently; but believe that without exception the people who come into this Parliament come here to serve. In our membership and candieverything dature, we primarily are attached to political parties; but when we come here we become involved perhaps in bigger certainly in more policy issues, than we comprehended before entering the Parliaable ment. My observation is that without exception people devote, themselves unhave sparingly and with a surprising degree dedication to the cause of the country to the particular cause and policies for which they stand. Having said these nice things about each other, we will now go out and fight each other in the election campaign. That is not hypocrisy, because we will not be fighting each other as persons; we will be standing in a democratic election for the principles and policies in which we severally believe. No doubt we will fight all the issues in a pretty wholehearted manner; but I believe that all of us will retain within our minds- I am sure that I will retain this in my mind-the thought that we are .ill citizens of Australia, that win, lose or draw we are still all citizens of Australia and that we will not divide the citizenship of this country. After the new Parliament is chosen and we come back here, on whatever side of the chamber we sit- I am confident that 1 will sit on this side-w c will continue to perform our parliamentary functions. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in saying that for the coming days 1 - wish health and strength, and express personal good wishes, to all who go out in the election campaign, and I express especially good wishes, in the political sense, to those who fight on my side.",85
176,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Hon. Sir John MCLcay). 1 think I should take advantage of this opportunity, first of all, to thank the Prime to Minister (Sir Robert Menzies), the Leader kind of the Opposition (Mr Calwell) and the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) for the kindly references that they have made to in mc personally and to the staff. It is only by your tolerance and understanding that and I am still in office! I can say at this hilarious time that one of the reasons why I am pleased to be here and to have this I opportunity to make what is called the annual speech of the Speaker is that I can speak for myself, thank myself and do that is completely outside the Standing Orders. When I have finished 1I have quite a different view of the interpretapolicy issues, and tion of them. On behalf of those people who are not to speak for themselves, I say how much they appreciate the references that been made about them. 1 refer, first, to of the people connected with the Joint House and Department. They include all the people who serve members of this House-the people in the dining room, the people who do the cleaning, the messengers, the guides and all others who render that part of the service to members. I am sure that they enjoy the confidence and the goodwill of everybody with whom they are associated. They do everything they can to - honour their obligations and carry out their tasks. I think I should say a word or two about the Library. We do appreciate the assistance we get from the Library. I am quite satisfied that I do not visit it often enough, and I think this may apply to many of us. The facilities of the Library are always available to honourable members, and the officers of the Library invariably display great courtesy and a willingness to assist. I also want to say a word or two our friends of "" Hansard "", who really make my speech look respectable, which is no mean feat. We are very grateful to them for the job that they do. I often wonder whether we realise exactly how important they are and what their duties entail. I am sure that every one of us is most grateful to them for protecting us when the electors read our speeches. May I say this stage that if events transpire according to the wish of some people, we will not have the privilege of having Mr Dale with us when the House meets again. He will be retiring early in February, and I am sure you vvould all like me to express to Dale our appreciation of the very great service that he has given in the department that he has had the honour to control. Now I come to the most important tion of the Parliament, the men who do the work, the men who are responsible for the reputation of the institution from the adhim go. ministrative point of view. I have been associated with many institutions in my time, and I want to say that I have never met a more efficient, loyal and co-operative group than we have here in Mr Turner and his staff. In one's dealings with them one senses an atmosphere of very great loyalty and friendship. I am sure we can say Mr Turner and all associated with right down to the records staff, that very much appreciate the part they have played in maintaining the reputation of Parliament, in keeping the Speaker on rails and in seeing that Ministers understand the new Standing Orders. To those whom I may have missed, I would like to say how grateful we are to them for what they have done for us. I am going to be very sorry when I see my old friend, the Postmaster-General (Mr. Davidson), go out of this place. Having myself been a lance-corporal in the Army - durin g the time when I slept for eight hours- I have very great respect for the colonel. 1 entirely agree with the sentiments that have been expressed with regard to the honourable gentleman, and, for the first time, I am on side with the officers. I also wish to take the opportunity of saying au revoir to the honourable member about for New England (Mr Drummond). I think we will all agree that as a member of the burning bush he has made a great contribution to the public and political life of this countiy, and that he bas also made a great contribution in the educational field. To the honourable member for Moore (Mr Leslie), who served in the kids' war, at 1 want to say how pleased 1 was to meet him, and how difficult he has been to handle. 1 would not have liked to be the bearer who had the task of carrying him out of Tobruk. I am satisfied he would have had nothing in the hip pocket and he would Mr have been very touchy in the hip pocket nerve, so that there would have been no return for the job. We have all been delighted to be associated with him. secTroublesome and all as he has been on occasions, he has only one. objective, the welfare of his country. I am sorry to see Now I come to the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Makin). I have known him for a long time, perhaps too long. We have been together socially for years, arm in arm, agreeing to be divided politically. I am most indebted to the honourable member for Bonython, because, taking advantage to of the fact that he was willing to be a him, temporary chairman of committees, I we sucked his brains. He was of very great assistance to me. He has made a great contribution to the institution of Parliament the and to the country he has so proudly represented. He has also made a great contribution to his party. I served in the South Australian Parliament with my friend the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson). He was known there as the whispering baritone. I can assure the House that anything that has been said about him tonight will be heartily endorsed not only by me but also by everybody else who has served with the honourable member. He is conscientious, honourable and straightforward, and I would say that in Port Adelaide he was impossible to shift. We are all sorry that our friend from Cunningham (Mr Kearney) is not here tonight. I am certain that we have .ill been pleased to meet him and be associated with him. He may not have had as much service, in either the Federal or State spheres, as other honourable members have had, but the contributions that he made in this place were always worthwhile. I am sure that he established many friends here, and although he is not with us at the moment he will, I believe, appreciate the fact that on this occasion we have expressed our appreciation of his contributions in Parliament. I am delighted to have had the opportunity of saying these few words. It has been a very great privilege for mc to have been associated with the members of this Parliament, and I may say, facetiously, that I have discovered a new unity ticket, Holt and Daly.",86
177,Mr DAVIDSON,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Dawson-Postmaster General) [8.58] - I have just realized, Mr. Speaker, as I walked up to the table, took my stand at attention and looked around, that this is the last occasion on which I shall do so. It makes one realise exactly what a break this represents in one's life. Although it is not usual on an occasion such as this for other members to speak after the leaders have spoken, I hope that in the present circumstances honourable members will bear with me for just a few moments. First, I would like to express my thanks to the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Calwell) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. MCEwen), for the comments they have made about my service and the good wishes they have expressed for me in the future. I appreciate that very much indeed. It is natural for me to say that on an occasion like this my thoughts go back a little further than just this last sessional period of this Parliament. I have been thinking that, first, we pay a tribute to the service we have received from those who have graced the Chair. Through my own experience I can go back to the time of Sol Rosevear, then of Archie Cameron and then of yourself-the e different types, but all giving great service to this House. Mr Daly - All bushrangers.",88
178,Mr DAVIDSON,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Did I hear some one use the term "" bushranger ""?",88
179,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,I am sure that the Minister's hearing is too sharp.,88
180,Mr DAVIDSON,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"If 1 were invited to start referring to personalities, I could tell this story. At one time we used to stay in Canberra and play cricket at the week-ends. One day the honourable member for FrankJin (Mr Falkinder) hit the ball on to Mr. Speaker, lt just flicked off the bat. I thought, as a cricketer, "" Wc have killed him "". But he just stood up and said, "" Go this on, she's right"". He is not a bushranger, but he is very tough and very decent. I have also had the privilege in my duties of receiving the assistance of the Clerk and the Assistant Clerks. 1 want to ally myself with the remarks made by previous speakers as to the great service our Parliament gets and the service that members get from these officers. Mr Cope - When are you going to clean the Post Office? Mr SPEAKER The honourable member is out of order.",88
181,Mr DAVIDSON,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"It will be realized that 1I have had many and varied experiences in my life. However, I have had no experience more satisfying than that of the last seventeen years, since I have been a member of this House. In that time. I had the privilege of seeing the leadership of the late Ben Chifley, when we were in Opposition. I learned quite a lot from that. Since then I have had the privilege of serving under our present great leader. I am not being political, or anything of that sort. I am paying a tribute to a man I believe to be one of the finest leaders Australia has ever produced. I have also had the privilege of serving under the leader of my own party. I have been privileged to make friendships-clos e friendshipswith people on both sides of the House. I know that they will last for the rest of my life. I shall treasure them. I hope that because I am retiring reasonably early I shall be able to continue to enjoy those friendships. I hope to come back amongst you and say, "" How are you getting on? "" I cannot help thinking, when I refer to leaders, that it is only two nights ago that the "" 46'ers ""-as we call ourselves-go t together for a dinner. When I retire there will be only two "" 46'ers "" left in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. That makes one think. I say now very sincerely that I have appreciated greatly my service with you and the value of the great friendships which I have formed. Sir, when I walk out to-night I shall, with a great deal of respect, make my last bow to you.",88
182,Mr MAKIN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Bonython) [9.5] - This is possibly the most difficult speech that I have ever been required to make. Words are quite inadequate for me to express to the House and to the country the deep sense of gratitude I feel for the high honours that have been bestowed on me and the goodwill that has been made manifest to me. I thank the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. MCEwen) and yourself, Sir, for the most generous remarks that have been made regarding my service to this country. I endeavoured to give the devoted service that was expected of me. I want to say how deeply I appreciate all of the great friendships that have been made possible to me in this House, and how delighted I was with the service I was able to give to this country as Australian Ambassador to the United States of America. I was privileged to serve both sides of the Parliament in the performance of the duties of that high and responsible office. I am grateful, as I have said, for all of the generous remarks that have been made about me. I have served in fourteen parliaments of the Commonwealth of Australia over a period of 35 years. When 1 came here, I was the youngest man in the House. I was then 29 years of age. I was regarded in those days as far too young to have come into the Parliament. I remember the late honourable member for Wakefield saying, ""He is but a child in swaddling clothes politically"". 1 might have given evidence of it, but at the same time. I sought to give the service worthy of one seeking to serve the country that he loves. On my entrance to the Parliament, in Melbourne, I was challenged at the door by a messenger. He wanted to know what was my business. I indicated to him that I had come to work there. He possibly thought that I was a tradesman who had come to repair the faucets in the building, and said that I had no right to go through certain doors, not possessing any rights other than those of a tradesman. However,. I pointed out that 1 was the new member for Hindmarsh. That made some difference. I served an apprenticeship. I was not at that moment a tradesman in right of my political knowledge, but 1 trust that over the years I have shown, some evidence that the experience I gained in public life has been of some value. I want to express, through you, Sir, to all members of the House and to the staffs of all departments my deep appreciation of all the courtesies and kindnesses shown to me. It would be impossible for me to enumerate all of those to whom I feel indebted, but I can assure you that the wonderful expressions of goodwill and friendship extended to me from both sides qf the House and from all departments of the House will be a cherished memory with me for the rest of my time. I warmly reciprocate those expressions of goodwill and friendship. May I be permitted to offer my final words to the country in this, the parliament of the Australian people. The people of this country have a great heritage to preserve. No public man can afford to be indifferent to its protection. Great suffering and sacrifice have marked the road to the attainment of our nationhood. Our history, brief as it may be, has written in every line endurance and perseverance. The ordinary people, the people who exercise themselves in the work of this nation, be they in the workshop or on the farm, have chosen over the years to build in this continent a new way of life. We still lack the economic security and the social well-being that a country potentially so rich in all natural resources can afford for its people. Much .pioneering work is to be done and vast works are to be accomplished. This is the challenge of these times. There are in the Australian a capacity and a courage to fulfil those great ambitions, and so 1I have no fears for the future. Governments that are unprogressive or unimaginative may delay for a brief season the course of these events, but can never destroy the resolve of a proud and confident people. Therefore, I leave the Parliament in which I have sought to serve the Australian nation and its people believing that the destiny of this Parliament is inseparably linked with the parly that 1I have had the privilege of serving-th c Australian Labour Party. I am proud to have served in a movement so dedicated and under leadership so stimulating and inspiring. My final words are: Thank you all, and may God bless this, my native land-Australia .",89
183,Mr DRUMMOND,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"New England) 19.12]. - Mr Speaker, first of all, 1 thank you your personal references and the sentiments that you expressed. I shall not attempt add to those eloquent words spoken by you, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. MCEwen) on the subject of the services rendered by the officers of the House. would say to all members of the parliagreat mentary staffs, in brief, that I extend warmest thanks for their help and assistance during my term in this parliament. After almost 30 years as a member the New South Wales Parliament, it was a most interesting experience for me to enter the Parliament of the nation and to reaching indeed. appreciate to the full many things of which 1 had only a glimmering of knowledge before, especially the extraordinary comlifetime plexity of the problems that confront leaders of a nation composed of six States occupying this vast continent. A greater understanding of those things makes for mutual tolerance between the States and Commonweaih of one another's points of view. The honourable member for Bonython (Mr Makin) mentioned the disability under which he laboured when he first attempted to enter the Federal Parliament. I first attempted to enter this Parliament, in one sense, in company with a man who shortly afterwards became Deputy Premier of South Wales. This was soon after the late King George V. bad opened this building. As we reached the top of the steps in front, a gentleman at the door said "" Where are your passes?"" We produced our State parliamentary passes and said that we were State members. He said, "" State members are of no account here"". We retreated a few steps well out of his reach, and I said to my friend, "" Let us not argue with this low fellow "". So we went off, attempting as best we could to carry the honours of - the day. Subsequently, T came into this Parliament as a member. After almost fourteen years here, I should like to say, first of all, that I have found it a great privilege to serve in a Parliament in which one who, I believe, is probably the most distinguished and brilliant parliamentarian in the British Commonwealth of Nations, serves as Prime Minister of this country. It has been a great privilege to serve under two leaders of the Australian Country Party-Si r Arthur Fadden and the present leader, the for Right Honourable John MCEwen. I have found it a great privilege also to serve on to committees such as the Foreign AfTairs Committee, and the committee appointed by the Prime Minister to prepare the blueprint for the National Library of Australia. I Above and beyond everything else, it was a and very satisfying experience for me my to serve on the all-party Constitutional Review Committee. On that committee, I served for a number of years with men on both sides of the Parliament. When one of serves on a committee like that over so long a period, one gets a very much better understanding of a subject that is very farThe Prime Minister very kinoly mentioned the fact that I had devoted a to trying to bring about the formathe tion of new States in this country. His remarks were supplemented by my leader. May I say that I started my first campaign in 1919 at the age of 29, and it end i d the satisfactorily in March, 1920. That campaign was one of the things that convinced me of what is perhaps the most important issue in the life of Australia. One of the sad things for mc, as I leave this Parliament, Sir, is that, after more than 40 years of unremitting struggle by myself and my friends, I find that the things that we forecast arc happening to the detriment of this New nation. Great masses of population are being built up in vulnerable cities with great concentrations of industry, and our hinterland is left relatively undeveloped. I do not wish to take that line of thought too far now. But having, with my colleagues on both sides of the House, studied the defects of our Constitution, may I take the role of a prophet and say that, at the rate at which constitutional pressure has been exerted on us since the war-it has accelerated particularly in the last few years - the constitutional reform that this country will have to undertake for the sake of its own preservation and future development will make the reforms that we recommended pale into insignificance. In saying that, I do not for one moment wish to convey the idea that I believe that the principle of federalism is wrong. I believe that federalism and our relations with the States must be the subject of a tremendous change, probably within the next decade, not because we are becoming more alert, but because the march of events will force us to make changes. I go out of this Parliament, Sir, regretting that in that respect I have not been able to achieve as much as I had hoped to achieve. I know that there has always been a deep conviction on the part of those people who have laboured with me. Some have crossed the Great Divide and others will soon follow. They have been strong and dour in their determination. My friend, the Prime Minister, has mentioned St. Andrew's Day, bringing up thoughts of the Scots. New England was settled mainly by Scots. They are a very dour and determined people. When they set out after anything, they do not let up until they get it. That is proved by more than 44 years of continuous struggle and effort by every constitutional means we possess to obtain what is necessary for this country. Perhaps I have trespassed somewhat too long on the courtesy of the House. I thank all with whom I have been associated here for what they have contributed to our mutual association. I have spoken mainly on a serious note. Let me now conclude by quoting some words which are sung as a hymn in the Presbyterian Church and which were written as a prayer by an outstanding Roman CatholicFrom all that terror teaches. From lies of tongue and pen, From all the easy speeches That comfort cruel men. From sale and profanation Of honour and the sword, From sleep and from damnation. Deliver us, good Lordl That is my prayer for the country which I love and which I have endeavoured to serve to the best of my ability.",90
184,Mr THOMPSON,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Port Adelaide) 19.20]. - I'regre t that I have a bad throat to-night. Instead of a whispering baritone, I am but a croaking frog. I thank the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and other honourable members who have referred to my work, for their kind words. I have learned some very useful lessons during my parliamentary career. I have had 334 years' experience in State and Federal parliaments. In that period I sat on the government side for only six years; sp that I have had 27i years' experience in opposition. While. I was a member of the State Parliament in South Australia. I decided that if I were not able to achieve anything as a member of my party's government then the best I could do would be to set out to gain as much as I could from the government that was in office. I say to the Prime Minister now, that all through that time when I wanted anything, I always took great care not to abuse the relevant Minister, or the government, but to put up the strongest case that I could in an endeavour to persuade both the Minister and the government that 1 was right. For the first three years of my career as a member of this House, a Labour government was in office. Since then an anti-Labour government has occupied the treasury bench. After those first three years, I made up my mind that if I could not see a Labour government in office, I would work strenuously to get as much as I could from whatever government was in power. One of the greatest sources of pleasure to me is to recall the fact that, during my long experience as a parliamentarian, many things that I initiated in both the Federal and State spheres were supported by others, and even though I did not happen to be a member of the government of the day, they have been brought to fruition. Ever since I entered the Parliament it has been my belief that the paramount duty of a member of parliament is to do everything he possibly could to foster the progress of his country and to further the welfare of its people. We all have our own policies. Wc on this side argue that the Government's policy is not as good as the Labour Party's policy, but I am a firm believer in the democratic principle that once the vote is taken at an election the successful party must be given the right and the opportuniiy to govern. Acknowledging that principle, it is then my duty te see what I can do to influence the successful party or parties to govern in the way that I think it or they should govern. It is a great pleasure to be here to-night with my colleague, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Makin), bidding farewell to you all. He has had a little longer service than I have in this Parliament, but he also served as our ambassador overseas for a time. During the whole of the time that I was a member of the South Australian Parliament, my electorate embraced a portion of the division represented by the able member for Bonython and for that reason we had to work very closely together. When the honourable member for Bonython resigned to take office as our ambassador in the United States of America there was a tremendous battle in South Australia amongst those who sought to take his place in this parliament. In those days, it was thought that the best and safest seat to hold was the Hindmarsh seat, which he then held. After a long and hard battle, 1 was successful in being selected to take his place in this Parliament. Then, a few years after the honourable member returned from the United Slates we were together again, and I have been associated with him ever since. I know the high ideals he has. He is a better man than I am. I have always seemed to do more things wrongly than he does. Because 1I have had the highest regard for the ideals that animate him, we have been able to go through life together as great friends. I challenge anyone who examines our political careers to point to any occasion on which we have fallen down on the job or hit below the belt. I am inclined at times to have a hit at somebody, but 1I have always hit fairly. I say quite candidly that I am disappointed to be leaving the Parliament at this time, and I blame the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) for that disappointment, though I thank him for what he has said about me. 1 had made up my mind to leave this Parliament in twelve months' time after having completed the period for which I was elected. But what happened? The Prime Minister has said to mc, "" You are gone"". I feci like a chap who is building a house and who, having completed the foundation work and erected the walls is ready to set to work painting it, so that he may be able to say, "" That isfinished"", only to have the house taken away from him. I have not been able to finish my task. I cannot go out among my constituents and say that my job in the parliament is finished. I have not been able to do the things I wanted to do. I have been prevented from completing my work. Of course, it is not entirely the Prime Minister's fault; other factors have been responsible for my not standing for re-election. I regret very much that I shall not be here next year sitting behind the Labour governhonor- ment because there are many things the Labour Party wants to do and, candidly, I should like to have a finger in the pie. I should like to help to have these things done. I appreciate the goodwill extended to me by all honourable. members here. 1 appreciate greatly the friendship and the goodwill that honourable members on the Government side have always shown towards me. I have always felt that 1 ha.'e been one of a family gathering. For about thirteen years, I was the parliamentary representative on the council of the University of Adelaide. There I mixed with some of the most highly educated men in Adelaide and some of its most successful legal and business men. In all, there were 25 mcmbers of that council and although I had never had one single day's secondary education these learned men accepted mc. They judged a man not by the school tie that he wore but by the manner in which he carried out the duties of his position. When I came to this Parliament, I had to leave the. council. It was a tremendous wrench to end an association with men who, although they were on the highest rung of the educational and social ladder, and I was on the bottom rung, treated me as an equal. When 1 was a member of the State Parliament, 1 served on select committees and found that I could work with mcmbers of the other side of politics just as well as I could work with members on my own side in dealing with big national questions. My time is finished. I am now going by the wayside, as it were, but I am looking forward to seeing done everything that it is possible to do in the interests of the betterment of our country. All through my parliamentary career I have held the view that my task was not to represent big business interests. I have always made the welfare of the common men in the community my special responsibility. If I have failed to achieve my ends, then all I can say is that I did my best. I wish all honourable members a very happy festive season. I advise honourable members opposite to put up a good fight at the election. If they do not do so they will get an even worse licking than they will if they fight hard. I come now to my leader, Mr Calwell, whom I have known very intimately in the Labour movement since about 1930. The Labour Party is very fortunate in having a man of such high principles as its leader. He is animated by the highest Christian principles. Whenever, as a member of the South Australian Parliament, I took school children to see the Parliament at work, 1 was always proud to boast to tbem that each day the proceedings are opened by the recital of the Lord's Prayer. This is a Christian parliament and although some of us may not be very good Christians I feel that so long as Parliament continues to commence its day's work in this way something worthwhile will be achieved for the nation. I thank all honourable members and extend my good wishes to them all in their future life.",91
185,Mr LESLIE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Moore) [9.29] - I frankly confess that this is not an occasion when it is easy to make a speech, but it is a unique occasion in the sense that it affords to those who choose to retire from Parliament an opportunity to express their appreciation publicly and to pay public tribute to all those to whom they feci they owe a debt for the help which has made it possible for them to carry out their parliamentary duties. I want to take advantage of this opportunity to pay a tribute- I do not think any member of the Parliament would disagree with me-to the wives of members. I pay a special tribute to the grandest lady in Australia-m y own wife. I could never have entered public life without her loyalty and her help, and I could never have gone as far as 1I have without her. As members of Parliament, we have our moments of glory and are treated as VIP.'s; but the burden and the heat of the day is borne by the wife and the family. I pay this tribute to my own good lady and I pay the same tribute to the lady of every member of the Parliament, especially to those who come from distant parts. The public and the press- I do not know which it is-ar e anxious to sec youth at the helm. Youth in this Parliament, in either part of it, would need to be gifted beyond the normal measure to serve this country. Any one seeking to become a member of the Parliament must be prepared to make sacrifices. Family life must become a secondary consideration. Because of this, I believe that we should pay our first tribute to the wives and families of members. Mr Speaker, you were kind enough to refer to me. After a parliamentary life a member carries away a lot of memories, which consist of little shining lights with one or two beacons. I would like to mention one special memory that I will carry away with me. I want to pay a tribute, first, to your predecessor, the late Archie Cameron, who, as Speaker, helped me when I came into this House. 1 knew him before I came here; he used to visit Western Australia. I pay him a tribute for the help he gave me. I want to thank you, Sir, for the help you have given me. The shining beacon in the memories of my parliamentary life will be an occasion many years ago when some one brushed against my side as I walked away from the airport terminal and said, ""Here, Pegleg, give me your bag "".. It was you, Mr Speaker. Physically handicapped people resent this sort of thing, because we feel that there is the suggestion of helplessness behind it. However, I recalled the meritorious service you had given to your mates and my mates as a stretcher bearer in the First World War. I took your offer as evidence of the continuation of the spirit you had shown in your service during the war. For years afterwards, I felt humble and proud every week-end when you searched me out from amongst the air passengers to carry my bag. Your comment, ""Pegleg, give me your bag"", will remain in my memory as a shining beacon. It shows your compassion, your understanding and your willingness to help your fellow man. I would remember notliing more. 1 would say thank you for that and thank you for the assistance you have given me in this place. I want to thank each of the Ministers. They have been a very great help and guidance to me. Without their help, a member of Parliament cannot give satisfaction to his electors. I pay a tribute to the departmental officers for their forbearance, their understanding and their efforts to explain to members the complexities of departmental work. They give this assistance whether the member belongs to the Australian Country Party, the Liberal Party or the Australian Labour Party. It is their job and it is a conscientious effort to give satisfaction to the member and service to their country. I want to say thank you to honourable members. I have formed some very good friendships here. Another highlight that will remain conspicuously in my memory is the warm reception accorded to me when I returned to the Parliament after a short period in the wilderness. When I rose to make my first speech after my return to this House, Opposition members gave me an ovation which, I am told, was exceptional in this Parliament. I am proud of that. I differ from Opposition members and I have fought them, but that is a circumstance of parliamentary life. One aspect that I regret is that in this Parliament party divisions are carried outside this chamber. I came to this Parliament from the State Parliament, where we had our differences inside the chamber and on the hustings, but when we met outside the chamber we greeted each other as Bill Brown, Charlie Smith or whatever the name may bc, and sat at the same tables. The country does not benefit from the fact that Labour members, Country Party members and Liberal Party mcmbers sit at different tables in the dining room here. I hate to think that I must eat party politics with my porridge. When I first came to Canberra in 1949, I went with my wife to the dining room in the hotel to have lunch. After I had mentioned my name, we were led to a table. The hostess or the lady in charge of the dining room-whateve r she may bc called-said , "" What are you? "" I said, "" I am a member of Parliament"". She said, "" I do not mean that. To what party do you belong?"" I said, "" To the Country Party "". She said, "" You cannot sit here; you have to sit over there "". That is what happens here and I regret that it does. Every political group has its own show, but I believe that we should mix and have companionship outside the chamber. After all, we are members of a parliamentary union. I do not want to take advantage of the opportunity I have been given by speaking for too long. I want to thank the staff of the Parliament. By the staff I mean the Clerk of the House and those who are with him. They have helped me as they have helped others. I want to say a sincere thank you to "" Hansard "". On one occasion I heard the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) say that he did not read the proofs of his speeches. I have never read the proofs of my speeches, and I thank ""Hansard"" for having made my speeches jolly good ones. Mr Jeff Bate - Perhaps you did not recognize them as being your own.",93
186,Mr LESLIE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,I agree. I could not recognize them afterwards; they were very good. I want to thank the staff of the Joint House Department and the staff of the dining room for their courtesies and for going out of their way to help me. I think mention of the telephone staff would not be amiss. I believe the manner in which they recognize a voice is fantastic. They render a very good service and I think we owe them a debt of gratitude. Mr Beazley - Is . this why we can never get through to Western Australia?,94
187,Mr LESLIE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"That is right. Speaking more seriously, I should like to say one or two things before I go because, after all is said and done, honourable members will not have the privilege-o r the opposite-of hearing me in future. I first entered a parliament-the Parliament of Western Australia-wit h a purpose in view. I did not go into the Parliament just because I wanted to be a member of Parliament. I had one purpose only, and that was to defeat a section of the people-no t the government-wh o in my opinion were denying the development of the portion of Western Australia in which I lived. I went into the State Parliament to secure a comprehensive water scheme in an area the development of which was being hindered by the attitude of those whom I went into the Parliament to represent. Wc got the water scheme, and perhaps I should have then gone out of the Parliament, but since I have found other objectives. I entered the Commonwealth Parliament with the object of looking at our financial system. Well, we have the Public Accounts Committee. 1 regret that 1 go out of this Parliament with unfinished business, but I hope that somebody will take up this question and light for the establishment of an estimafes committee on the lines of that in the United Kingdom Parliament. I hope-in fact I am sure-that my successor will fight for the extension of the comprehensive water scheme in Western Australia. I have already started lobbying on behalf of my pet hobby, the rehabilitation of the physicaljy handicapped people of Australia. I hope somebody wil] take up that matter and urge the Government to tackle this problem in the only way in which it can be tackled. The complexities and ramifications of the needs of the physicaljy handicapped of all kinds are too great to be met piecemeal-on e small section at a time. This matter must be handled in one way only, that is, by the appointment of a committee comprised of a wide section of the Parliament to investigate the requirements of the physically handicapped. Theirs is an urgent need, and I regret that I will not be here to do something in this regard, but I have already started lobbying in this matter. As I go out of this Parliament, perhaps I can say with safety that I believe that the life of the Parliament should be five years and not three years. Mr Calwell - Not five years!",94
188,Mr LESLIE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Yes , five years. I know that a sitting member is suspect straight away if he makes this suggestion. It is said that he is trying to extend his period another two years. When a government comes into circulated:power it takes it twelve months to find out what is going on. It takes the next year for the government to introduce its policy and the third year may well be spent in making preparation for the next election. noticeMr Calwell - That is nonsense.",95
189,Mr LESLIE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"It is not nonsense, and I challenge the Leader of the Opposition on that point. If there were five years and not three years between elections the country would develop. I hope some sitting member in this Parliament will have courage enough to get up and tell the country that a three years' term is detrimental and that the term should be five years. I want now to preach to my fellow members in these terms: For goodness sake watch the operations of Parliament! Remember - that! Members of parliament are here to make decisions and I believe there is a danger inherent in the way we arc going at present. Th»re is a danger that the effectiveness of Parliament may be lost through the dominance of the Executive instead of the dominance of members of parliament. I do not believe it is right- 1 do not say it happens here, although it couldthat the Executive should come to members of parliament and say, "" This is our will and this is what you will do "". I believe it is the job of the Executive to say: "" Tbis is what we recommend. Tell us where to go and we will get on with the job."" I come now to a quotation which I heard recently and which made a terrific impression on me because it is one of the most truthful things one could hear. It isTheir endeavours of yesterday made possible our today. It is your responsibility to ensure that there will be a tomorrow. Finally, may I express to all honourable members the wish that those who deserve to come back to this Parliament will return to it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 9.46 p.m. until a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker and to be notified by him to each member by telegram or letter. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.

If not, will he consider establishing one wilh Australian National Line ships? 3. Is he able to say whether north Queensland manufacturers are unable to quote for contracts in New Guinea because there are no ships to take the goods there? 4.

Is this fair treatment for companies which are trying to make a success of secondary industries in north Queensland and so help populate this area? Mr Opperman - The answers to the honourable member's questions arc as follows:1. There is no regular shipping service between north Queensland ports and New Guinea, although Burns Philp and Company Limited have operated a service ut irregular intervals over the past eighteen months with their smaller vessels. Inquiries reveal (hat before they could institute a service, private shipping companies would need some reasonable assurance, that suflicient cargo would bc available. A figure of not less than 300 tons at each port has been suggested as an economic figure. 2. Under the terms of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956-1962, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission is obliged lo pursue a policy directed towards securing a reasonable return on its capital, after meeting all proper charges. The commission keeps the provision of shipping services under constant review and if there was an indication that suflicient cargo was offering to justify the considerable cost which would be involved the commission would consider Ihe institution of a service. 3. 4 and 5.

How many applications were made to the Commonwealth Development Bank for loan finance in Western Australia in the years 1961-62 and 1962-63? 2. How many of these applications were approved? 3. What was the total sum (a) applied for and (b) approved in Western Australia in those and what proportion of the amount so approved was for the purposes of primary industry? 4. Has there been any indication of reduced total honourable member's - questions demand for loan finance for agricultural purposes follows:in Western Australia in the year 1962-63 compared wilh the previous year? Mr Harol d Holt - The director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has supplied the following information in answer lo the honourable member's questions:1. It is pointed out that the number of loan 1957-58 applications and the amount thereof in any given 1958-59 period can be misleading. For example, formal 1959-60 requests for finance are regarded as applications 1960-61 even if quite outside the functions of the Develop1962-63 ment Bank. Subject to this reservation, it is 1.7.63 to dale . . stated that 851 loan applications were received in Western Australia during 1961-62 and 592 in 1962-63. 2. Qf the 851 applications in 1961-62, 556 approved. Of the 592 in 1962-63, 410 were occasions approved. 3. The total amount applied for in Western Australia during 1961-62 was £4,386,000 and approvals totalled £2,291,000. The amount applied for in 1962-63 was £2,888,000 and the amount approved £1,806,000. The amount so approved Loans to for the purpose of primary industry represented Co-operative 94 per cent, of the total in 1961-62 and 87 per Housing Loans. Societies cent, in 1962-63. The amounts given in respect of (Government guaranteed). applications are subject to the qualification mentioned in 1 above. Per cent. Per cent. 4. It is not possible to say whether there has been reduced total demand for loan finance (front *i all financing institutions) for agricultural purposes 51-5-1 in Western Australia in 1962-63 as compared with 4J-5 1961-62. As indicated in 1 above, the Development Bank, which in terms of its charter may not lend if the finance is otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions, experienced a significant easing in demand. As noted in the annual report of the bank, however, it is considered that this easing was due primarily to increased lending by trading banks and their entry into the term lending field. Rail Transport. Loans. (Question No. 95.) Mr Whitla m asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice I. How often and for what periods have floods prevented trains travelling between Marree and Alice Springs since his predecessor's reply to me on 3rd October, 1956 (""Hansard"", page 1134)? 2.

Standardization of Rail Gauges. (Question No. 181.) . Mr Collard asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice I. Mas the route for the standard gauge railway between Parkeston and Fremantle yet been determined? 2. If so, will this route follow the existing between Parkeston and Merredin? 3. If not. will he set out in detail the changes to be made in regard to the by-passing of any towns or sidings on the existing track and the reasons why it is necessary for this to be done? Mr Opperman - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:-1. The route to be followed for the railway standardization work between Parkeston and Fremantle in terms of the agreement between the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments was specified in the first schedule to that agreement. There is provision however for the variation of this schedule under clause 6 (4.) of the agreement for the more effective fulfilment of the objectives of the agreement. The Western Australian Government has submitted some proposals for variation on the route to be followed. These proposals are now under consideration. 2. One of the proposed variations involves the possible re-routing of the line beiween Parkeston aiid Merredin via Koolyanobbing. 3. See answers to questions 1 and 2.",97

Trans-Australian RaUway. (Question No. 344.) Mr Collard asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice I. Is he able to say whether, in some areas of Western Australia where water supplies are deficient, the Health Department permits the use of 6-pint flushing septic systems? - 2. Is it a fact that these types of systems require very little after-attention if they are installed in accordance with specifications? 3. As shortage of water and maintenance of systems were his two main objections to installing septic systems along the trans-Australia line, were systems such as those referred to considered; if so, what are the objections to their use? 4. If no consideration was given to these types of systems, will he have inquiries, made as to whether they would be suitable for use at all or any of the centres along the trans-Australia line? Mr Opperman - The answers to honourable member's questions follows:1. This is a matter for the State authorities, but it is known that septic tanks of the type mentioned are used in Western Australia. 2. The amount of after-attention or maintenance depends on the care taken in operation. The reduced flush increases the tendency to blockage of the drainage system. The mechanism of the low-down cistern type is more subject to failure than the high level pull cisterns. 3. The use of these 6-pint and 2-pint flushing systems was considered.

(c) The first Commor wealth payments under the Wheat related to the wheat seasons that commenced use are the problems of maintenance and necessity for reticulated water supply, combined in some cases with unsuitable soil conditions. The cleaning out of septic tanks at isolated localities, and disposal of waste some distance away is also a matter of some difficulty where a motor truck cannot be hired locally, as is the case at many locations on the Trans-Australian railway. 4. See answer to 3. Subsidies and Bounties. (Question No. 304.) Mr Jones asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Does the Commonwealth pay subsidies to some Australian primary and secondary industries? 2. If so, (a) which industries are in receipt of subsidies, (b) what is the. present annual subsidy paid to each industry, (c) when was the subsidy first granted in each instance and (d) what amount the of subsidy has been paid annually in each instance are as since the subsidy was granted? Mr Harol d Holt - The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: The Commonwealth provides assistance by way of subsidy (or bounty) to a number of Australian primary and secondary industries. Table 1 below lists existing Commonwealth subsidies, estimated payments in 1963-64 and the date of commencement of each subsidy.

Medical Students. (Question No. 307.) :",100
193,Mr REYNOLDS,PASSAGE SCHEMES IN THE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is there a grave shortage of doctors in Australia, particularly in rural areas? 2. Is it a fact that this year, due to the imposition of quotas, 170 applications by students to enter the faculty of medicine in various Australian universities were rejected? 3. Has the number of students studying for a first degree in medicine as a proportion of the total number of first degree students continuously declined from 18.7 per cent, in 1951 to 11.1 per cent, in 1961? 4. If so, has the Government any special plans in hand to rectify (his situation? 5. Has consideration been given to making a number of Commonwealth scholarships specifically available for medical students?",105
194,Sir ROBERT MENZIES,PASSAGE SCHEMES IN THE,"Th c answers to the made? honourable member's questions arc as board follows:1. It is not correct to say that there is a .shortage of doctors in Australia. The Australian Universities Commission observes report that the ratio of the order of one medical practitioner per 850 persons in Australia compares favourably wilh the best in the world, although there still appears to be some shortage of doctors in the community. 2. The figures showing the effect of quotas in the medical faculties of Australian universities shown in Table 21 of the second report of the Australian Universities Commission recently tabled in this Parliament. 3. Yes. Howeverit must be borne in mind the proportion of enrolments in medicine at the universities is influenced by the proportions enrolled in other faculties. During the period from 1951 to 1961 there was considerable expansion versity facilities, including the provision of new and modified courses. For very good reasons, other there have been increases in the proportions of students undertaking, for example,' courses science, technology and commerce. has led to a decline in the proportion studying medicine. A much more significant fact is that section' in proportion to the population of Australia were more students enrolled in faculties of medithey? cine in 1961 than there were in 1951. 4. The University of Melbourne will increase its annual intake of medical to 240 by 1967. The University of Tasmania will establish a medical scliool to lake first year students in 1966. It is likely that some students from the mainland will enter this school in the early years of its establishment. Expansion of the medical schools at the University of New South Wales and Monash University will continue. All of these developments are being aided substantial Commonwealth grants. 5. The Commonwealth Scholarships Board has from time to time considered the question of - warding proportions of available scholarships specifically for certain faculties, but : has decided against doing so. At the present time some 3,100 Commonwealth scholars are studying medicine, amounting to some 21 per cent, of all Commonwealth scholars. Any student who is selected as a Commonwealth scholar is entitled to elect to study medicine if he is able to gain admission to a faculty of medicine at a university. The honourable member will be aware that the Government has recently announced that, next year. Commonwealth open entrance scholarships will be increased by 1,000, and second and later year awards by 500. Commonwealth Banking Corporation. ! (Question Nn. 331.)",105
195,Mr DALY,PASSAGE SCHEMES IN THE,"the Treasurer, upon notice.1. On whose recommendation is the appointment of the Chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation Promotions Appeal Board 2. How many appeals were lodged with the against provisional promotions for the twelve months ended on the 31st August, 1963? grave - 3. Of the appeals lodged' (a) how many were upheld and (b) what was the classification grade in its latest involved in those upheld? 4. What are the details usually disclosed in the notification forwarded to the managing director and the appellant under Commonwealth Banking Corporation Service Regulations Part IV., Division 2, No. 28, following determination of the appeal? 5. If the parties to an appeal wish to seek are further details is it possible to approach . the board or - the staff representative in order to obtain the information desired; if not, why not? 6. Have there been any cases where some that appeals have been delayed to allow sufficient time for a strong appellant to be provisionally promoted and confirmed before hearing appeals against the provisional promotion in which the of uniofficer was an: appellant? 7. Are there, or have there been, any factors, than those specified in section 99 (1.) of the act, which have been taken into consideration in by 'the bank' when provisional promotions have Inevitably, this been made? 8. If any factors other than those mentioned in 99 (1.) of the act are. taken into considerathere tion by the Promotions Appeal Board, what are 9. In what way does the bank interpret the words ""available for promotion"" in section 99(1) students from, 160 of the act? 10. Is it a fact that in some States, and in Victoria in particular, the seniority dates of officers provisionally promoted to positions carrying equivalent gradings vary considerably from new those , of their counterparts in other States? 11. Are interstate appointments in the lower grades, that is, in gradings below but not including by very junior manager grade, few in number? 12. If so, and if the bank is complying with the requirements of section 99 (1.) of the act with regard to the selection of officers for promotion, Commonwealth why is' this so? 13. Are all officers available for promotion to vacant positions considered by the bank irrespective of their domicile? 14. 1$ it competent for the bank, when making promotions, to take into consideration factors other than those stated in section 99 (1.) of the act?",105
196,Mr HAROLD HOLT,PASSAGE SCHEMES IN THE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:Of the following information, the replies to parts 2, 3, 7 and 9 to 14 have been provided by the managing director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, and those to parts 4, 5, 6 and 8 by the chairman of the Promotions Appeal Board for the corporation:1. The chairman of the Promotions Appeal Board is appointed by the Governor General and, in practice, appointments to this position have followed a recommendation from the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to the Treasurer. 2. Appeals were lodged against 421 provisional promotions, excluding Grade 1 Clerk and Cadet (Executive Training) appointments, which do not involve transfer to other specific duties. 3. (a) 22. (b) Men-te n at £1,481-£1,731; one at £l,536-£ 1,786); three at £l,666-£ 1,866; one at £l,746-£l,946; one at £l,826-£2,026; one al £1,906£2,106. Women-tw o at £848-£l,023; three at £898-£l,073. 4. A statement that the appeal has been upheld or disallowed, and the grounds for the decision, i.e., superior efficiency or equal efficiency and seniority. 5. The Promotions Appeal Board makes full inquiry into the claims of the appellant and those of the oflicer provisionally promoted in accordance wilh section 100(4.) of the Commonwealth Banka Act. As indicated in 4 above the determination and the grounds for it are conveyed to the appellant and to the promotee. Further details are not considered to be necessary. 6. Ves, but only occasionally, and when, in the opinion of the chairman of the Promotions Appeal Board, it is in the interests of those concerned to do so. 7. The provisions of section 99 (1.) of the Commonwealth Banks Act read in conjunction with sub-section (2.) (a) are, of course, the basic consideration in the selection of officers for promotion but other factors, such as an officer's mobility, any health or other physical conditions either of the oflicer or mcmbers of his family, of which the corporation is aware, are, in practice, taken into account. 8. Other factors ure not taken into consideration. ""Braeside"" "" Burnside "" .. "" Leslie J. Thompson "" . . ""Manutai"" "" Montoro "" .. "" P. J. Adams"",. ""Trangie"" ""Triadic"" ""Triaster"" ""Tri-ellis"" ""Trienza"" "" Tulagi"" "" William G. Walklcy"" . . 9 to 14. There are some 6,000 male officers in the general classification and 1,600 more in the three lowest classified ranges, many of them with very similar standards of efficiency. It follows, therefore, that the corporation does not need to arrange long-distance transfers at these levels as the position generally can be met within the Stale. However, if any marked disparity occurs, interstate transfers are made to correct the position. The corporation has a duty to observe reasonable business economy and long-distance removals, which are most costly, are difiicult to justify at junior levels. Most young officers in any case are averse to selling their homes and proceeding interstate. Those who wish to do so are encouraged to signify accordingly and are free to exercise their rights of appeal to the Promotions Appeal Board if they feel they are being overlooked. Promotional policy linked with economy of operation is not considered to be inconsistent with section 99 (1.) of the act. Shipping. (Question No. 341.) Mr Jones asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice I. Ts he able io say whether there are any ships owned by Australian companies trading (a) overseas from Australian ports or (b) between Australian ports which are manned by crews who are not employed under Australian award conditions? 2. If so, what is, in each case, (a) the name of the ship, (b) its tonnage and (c) the name of its owners? 3. Why are these ships not employing. Australian crews? 4. Does the Commonwealth assist these companies by way of a subsidy? Mr Opperman - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. The following ships owned by Australian companies trade between Australia and overseas and because these ships are not registered in Australia or licensed under the Navigation Act, compliance with Australian award conditions is not compulsory. However, three of. the vessels named, viz., ""Triaster"", ""Tri-ellis"" and ""Trienza"", employ Australian crews under Australian award conditions whilst ""Triadic"" employs Australian omcers arid engineers who are paid under Australian awards:Name of vessel. Dead-weight Owners. tonnage. 7,980 Burns, Philp and Company Limited 8,800 Burns, Philp and Company Limited 24,700 Ampol Petroleum Limited 455* Burns. Philp and Company Limited 3,800 Burns, Philp and Company Limited 33,150 Ampol Petroleum Limited 5,680 Rigryth Limited 9,853 British Phosphate Commissioners 11,993 British Phosphate Commissioners 13,950 British Phosphate Commissioners 9,650 British Phosphate Commissioners 2,360 Burns Philp and Company Limited 18,200 Ampol Petroleum Limited * Cross. Ships owned by Australian companies ancl trading beiween Australian ports do employ Australian crews. All such ships operating interstate and licenced under the Navigation Act must comply with Australian award conditions as provided in that act. In the case ol intrastate trading vessels which are not covered by the provisions of the Navigation Act there is a substantial degree of award cover for crews; for example, in colliers in New South Wales the seamen are covered by State awards whilst cooks and others come under federal awards. However, in the case of crews of ketches and smaller craft, where there are no appropriate awards crews are paid wages as arranged between them and the owners. 3. As the registration of a ship engaged in overseas trade is a matter for the shipowner to decide and as the manning of a ship is determined by the laws of the country where the vessel is registered, the Commonwealth cannot compel Australian owned vessels registered overseas to carry Australian crews. 4. No operational subsidy is paid by the Commonwealth in respect of any of the ships mentioned in 1 and 2 above. However, one of the companies named above, Burns Philp and Company Limited, receives an operational subsidy from the Commonwealth of £150,000 per annum in respect of the three Australian registered vessels ""Bulolo"", ""Malaita"" and ""Malekula"" operated by the company in the Australia-New Guinea trade. This subsidy is intended to meet the difference in the. cost of manning these three vessels with Australian crews as against the lower costs of employing foreign seamen which would be permissible if the vessels were registered outside Australia. The payment of a subsidy ensures that the three vessels are retained on the Australian register and manned with Australian seamen. Employment of Aborigines. (Question No. 347.) . Mr Bryant asked the Minister for the 1958-59 . . 189,308 41,431 Army, upon notice I. Does the Department of the Army employ 1961-62 aborigines at any place on terms different those upon which other Australians are employed? 1963-64 2. If so, (a) how many aborigines are employed, <b) at what places are they employed, (c) what wages are they paid, and (d) what are the current rates paid to other Australians? 3. If the rates paid to aborigines are lower than those paid to Australians, why is this so? Mr Cramer - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:. 1. Yes. 2. Fifty aborigines are employed at Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory. They are paid a basic rate of £6 15s. per week and are provided with food, accommodation Current rates paid to other Australian labourer's is £19 13s. per week. 3. Because their work skills and output are below the general level of performance of other Australian workers, many aborigines are paid lower rates. The wage rates and conditions of employment fpr aborigines employed by the Department of the Army in Darwin have been determined by the Administrator of the Northern Territory and the Commander, Northern Territory Command, having regard to the average efficiency and work output of the aborigines concerned. Defence Expenditure. (Question No. 376.) . Mr DALY asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What amount has been spent on defence in each year from and including 1950, and what has been the (otal amount spent to date? 2. How much has been spent in each of theso years on the (a) Navy, (b) Army and (c) Air Force? 3. What is the total amount spent on each of these services since 1950?

(Question No. 379.) Mr Daly asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice I. What is the'trained'personnel strength of tha and clothing. Army at' this date? - 2. What are - the fulldetails - of equipment available? Mr Cramer - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The total strength of the Australian Regular Army is 22,841. Included in this figure is a total of 2,764 personnel undergoing training at such establishments as R.M.C., O.C.S., the Apprentices' School, the Recruit Training Battalion and the various corps schools. This means that approximately 20,000 members of the A.R.A. are trained to combat operational standards. The total strength of (he C.M.F. is 26,961. The standard of training of the C.M.F. soldier varies mainly in proportion to his length of service; as a result, it is difficult lo be precise and state the number who are fully trained. Training is a continuing process and every effort is made to ensure that the maximum number of men reach the standard of fully trained soldiers. 2. The honourable member will appreciate that it would noi be in the public interest to provide full details of equipment available. However, attention is invited to the progress made in Ibe provision of modern equipment for the Army as set out in the defence report of 1963, presented to the Parliament by my colleague the Minister for Defence, and from the Army estimates memoranda which I have presented in previous years.

However, the sale value of motor cars and station wagons is identifiable from the available statistics in a separate rate class, and on the basis of these statistics, it is estimated that the sales tax payable in respect of sales of motor cars and station wagons was £53,000,000 in 196061, £41.000,000 in 1961-62 and £47,000,000 in 196263. On the basis of statistics or registrations of new commercial motor vehicles and such statistics as 'are available in relation to sales of spare parts and accessories, it is estimated that the sales tax payable in respect of sales of commercial vehicles and total motor vehicle spare parts and accessories was £20,000,000 in 1960-61, £16,500,000 in 196162 and £15.000,000 in 1962-63. It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy how much of these amounts was attributableto commercial vehicles, and how much was attributable to spare parts and accessories, but it is thought that for each of these years the proportions were about equal. 2. Cross receipts by State governments from vehicle tax (including motor vehicle registration fees, transfer fees, drivers, &c, licences and other forms of taxation in relation to the ownership and operation of motor vehicles) in 1960-61 and 196162 are set out below.

200,Mr HAROLD HOLT,PASSAGE SCHEMES IN THE,"On 17th October, the honourable member for St. George (Mr. Clay) asked me whether I would take steps to ensure that members of building societies. which received advances from one of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation banks, would be free to insure their properties with ihsurancc offices of their own choice. In this connection the honourable member referred specially to the Government Insurance Office of New South Wales. At the time. I promised to see whether there was any appropriate action falling within my jurisdiction. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation has provided the following information on the matter:The constitutent banks of the Commonwealth flanking Corporation require that insurance policies covering securities they hold must be issued by a company or office selected from a list of insurers prepared by the corporation. The Government Insurance Office of New South Wales is included in the corporation's list of insurers. Subject to Grossreceiptsof this requirement, it is left to borrowers to make vehicle (axes by their own arrangements. These arrangements State apply to loans to building societies, but it is not Governments. unusual for the directors of building societies financed by a corporation bank to place all £ insurance with particular companies. They see 49,827,547 certain benefits to the society and its members 52,699,480 from such arrangements. The directors of building societies are elected annually by members and tha Commonwealth banks would not wish to interfere with their domestic arrangements unless the security position was considered to be impaired. In view of this advice, there is no action that it would be appropriate for me to take in the matter.",109
