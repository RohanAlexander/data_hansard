2,Mr HOWARD,HOWARD MINISTRY,"Bennelong-Prime Minister}-- Mr Speaker, for the information of honourable members, I table a revised ministry list. I should inform the House that, since I tabled the previous list on 30 April 1996, I have appointed the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the Hon. Warwick Smith, as minister assisting me for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. NA National Respite for Carers Program",13
3,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. The minister would be aware that the Prime Minister has given an absolute commitment to honour his election promises ahead of balancing the budget. The coalition's policy document Security for Older Australians promises: . . . to implement a national respite for carers program with additional funding of $6 million year. Will the minister give an absolute guarantee that this promise will be met?,13
4,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister has said on every occasion that the election commitments we made will be honoured and in this respect that program will be no different. We will meet our election commitment. Gun Control  the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. I ask: is he aware of widespread public support for the government's proposed total ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, the establishment of a national gun register and enactment of uniform gun laws across the states? What action has the Attorney-General taken today towards achieving a nationwide approach on gun control?",13
5,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I am aware of the wide support the public is giving for the government's proposals for effective nationwide control of arms. In today's press there are indications that the overwhelming majority of Australians support the measures being proposed by the government. For example, the AGB MCNair poll indicates that 90 per cent of voters across Australia support a ban on automatic and semiautomatic weapons. It indicates also that 95 per cent of voters support a nationwide system for the registration of all firearms. It is also clear from the published opinion polls that the Australian public recognises that all states and territories need to cooperate in a uniform approach to gun control. It is particularly heartening that the polls are indicating strong support for the measures among both coalition and Labor supporters and across the states and territories. The majority support is expressed in both the city and country areas. As the Prime Minister foreshadowed in parliament yesterday, I have today circulated to the police ministers in the states and territories a paper setting out the Commonwealth's detailed proposals for effective per nationwide control of firearms. I have also provided a copy of this to the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General. In addition, a copy of the paper has been provided to all members and all senators. I very much welcome the opposition's expression of bipartisan support for the general thrust of the proposals. Having distributed a copy to all members and senators, I would request of them that they make that paper available to their own electorate offices so that any member of the public who seeks a copy of it and lives outside Canberra has ready access to a copy. It is clear that the people of Australia will no longer tolerate a situation where the enforcement of appropriate standards for the control of firearms is thwarted by different approaches taken by state and territory governments. This government is fully committed to the standards set down in the proposals and I believe that the Australian public will accept nothing less. Home and Community Care Program",13
6,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I refer the Minister for Family Services to the Prime Minister's absolute commitment to honour his election promises ahead of balancing the budget. The coalition's policy document Security for Older Australians promises to maintain the real rate of increase of home and community care funding in the forward estimates. I ask: will the minister give an undertaking that this promise will be met?,14
7,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are going to have to just wait. I hope you have booked your tickets for the night of 20 August when the budget is brought down, because all of the mysteries of budget night will then be revealed. Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Area",14
8,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the great community concern in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment area over outbreaks of blue-green algae, urban run-off, water quality and weed growth? Bearing in mind that this river system is important for agriculture, tourism and recreation, what action is the government taking to ensure that this important New South Wales waterway, along with other national river systems, is restored and preserved for future generations and does not continue to suffer from escalating environmental problems?",14
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker. I am aware of the concern that is felt in the Hawkesbury area, and I am very much aware of the problems of blue-green algae, urban run-off, sewage water quality and weed control in that and many other areas. Similar to the concern that is felt by many people in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin, so it is in relation to the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment area. As . the House well understands, and as the Australian public increasingly know, it is the Liberal and National parties alone who are committed to doing something about this. Mr Speaker, our national river care initiative will receive $85 million in additional funding over the next five. years, and the majority of this funding will be derived from the interest earned, Senate willing, by our $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. So the very simple answer that I would give to the honourable member for Macquarie to take back to the people of Hawkesbury is in fact that, if they want this problem addressed, they should use their best endeavours to encourage all senators from the state of New South Wales-not just the coalition senators but all senators from the state of New South Walesto give effect to the proposals of the coalition. I was very interested yesterday, when I answered a question in relation to the Murray-Darling, to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that I was engaging in blackmail. What the Leader of the Opposition was saying was that it was absolutely shocking and outrageous and akin to blackmail for a government to say that it could only fund the establishment of a heritage trust out of the sale of a capital asset, that in some way that was blackmail. In the light of that, it is very interesting because into my hand has come a document. It is entitled 'New South Wales government heritage policy'. This is the government of Mr Bob Carr of the Australian Labor Party. The document is dated April 1996. And it is not a bad document; I will tell you why in a minute. It is a very good document. Let me read from page 4 of the New South Wales Labor government's heritage policy: The state government will establish a $30 million heritage fund to restore and conserve the state's heritage. Now doesn't that sound familiar? But I will tell you what, my friends: it gets even better. It positively echoes in the ear and the consciousness when I read on. Listen to this: The funds will be raised from $5 million allocated from the sale of the State Office Blockand listen to this; it gets even betterand $25 million allocated over three years from the disposal of land assets held by Landcom. They are a lot more adventurous than we are. They are seIling the whole of the State Office Block, not the top one-third of the floors of the State Office Block. They are selling the whole of it. All I can say, Mr Speaker, is that there are two things that emerge very clearly from this debate. If you want to protect the long-term future of the Australian environment, there only two parties in Australia who really care about it, and they are the Liberal and National parties. They are the two parties who care about it. And when it comes to political hypocrisy-just as you were exposed as hypocrites on privatisation when you put your hand across the heart and said, 'We'll never sell the Commonwealth Bank', when you said, 'Ben Chifley would spin in his grave if we sold the Commonwealth Bank', when you said Ben would also spin in his grave if you sold Australian Airlines-you were hypocrites on that, you are· hypocrites on the environment, and you are hypocrites on privatisation generally. Natural Heritage Trust of Australia",14
10,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am glad the Prime Minister's sense of proportion equates the office block in Sydney with Telstra.,15
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Oppoment sition will move to the question.,15
12,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw the Prime relation Minister's attention to his promise in respect of the proposed Natural Heritage Trust in which he has promised that 'all the funding commitments in this document are additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the vironment' , and ask him whether his promised differently. $1 billion is additional to the forward estimates published for the 1995-96 budget or additional to the revised forward estimates published in January 1996 that include ing for Labor's 'Our land' environmental package.",15
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The commitment that was made was a commitment to add $1 billion to existing levels of environmental funding. . Mr BEAZLEY - Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. He was given a very clear-cut question and he chose not to answer it. Ask him which one it applies to.",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of capital order. Commonwealth Debt,15
15,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is addressed to the Treasurer. What is the are government's strategy to reduce Commonwealth debt?,15
16,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is committed to reducing Commonwealth debt. Commonwealth debt tripled over the last four years under the maladministration of the negligent and failed Labor administration. Mr Speaker, you would be aware that that was notwithstanding a government which was committed vigorously to privatisation. The Labor government was committed to the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. The Labor government was committed to the privatisation of Australian Airlines. It was committed to the privatisation of Qantas. It was committed to the privatisation of the balance of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Despite all of those privatisations, not $1 of the proceeds of those asset sales was used to retire debt. At the time that the Labor governwere flogging off national assets, they were tripling Commonwealth debt. This was a government which had no responsibility into the national assets that the people of Australia had built up. As a result, there are people in Australia who think that asset sales have been given a bad name. Indeed, they were given a bad name. That is where enthe coalition government stands entirely We have made it clear that, in relation to the part privatisation· of Telstra, the overwhelming amount of the money from the sale fundwill be used to retire Commonwealth debt. Out of $8 billion, $7 billion will be used to retire Commonwealth debt. The balance is to be put into a trust fund for capital works in relation to the environment in perpetuity. This coalition government has the most fantastic program for rebuilding Australia's environment that has ever been announcedand it is fully funded. What the coalition government proposes to do is to take part of the proceeds from selling part of a national asset and use it to rebuild Australia's greatest heritage--our environment. Yet the Labor Party would put phones in front of trees. That is your policy. It is more important for the government to own phones than it is to rebuild the environment. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 82, which refers to members anticipating debate, and I draw your attention to item 1 on the Notice Paper today-the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. I ask whether the member is infringing the rule of anticipation.",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,16
18,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out that the principle of using assets to develop heritage is a well recognised principle. It is recognised, as the Prime Minister said, by the only remaining Labor government in Australia-the Carr government. As the Prime Minister said, in relation to the Carr governmentMr Crean- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order that has been made, the other day when I raised this point of order you ruled it out because the matter was a notice of motion. Clearly this is an order of the day. The legislation has been introduced and the second reading speech made. It is clearly going to be debated today. Standing order 82 is quite specific that ministers cannot anticipate debate. What the Treasurer is doing is anticipating the debate. I urge you to rule his answer out of order.",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,16
20,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am actually talking about funding hereMr Crean- Mr SPEAKER ,16
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We debated this the other day. Resume your seat. Mr Crean- Mr SPEAKER ,16
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is this a different point of order? Mr Crean-With the greatest of respect, I seek an explanation as to why you have given that ruling. I think we are entitled to know",16
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Crean-If the standing order is as specific as it is, we are entitled to know.",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,16
25,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was explaining, in relation to funding heritage works, the Carr government has taken a brave position-a position which endorses the federal coalition government. Around Australia at the moment, there are five coalition state governments, two coalition territory governments, and one Labor state government-which happens to agree with us. That leaves a remnant in the federal Labor Party which opposes the use of the proceeds of asset sales for capital funds to rebuild heritage in perpetuity. As the Prime Minister said, the $30 million heritage fund proposed by the Carr government is a proposal to put aside assets and to . use interest from those assets for heritage. We could not have put it better ourselves, except in the way we did in our own environment package. That package made it clear that the proper way to deal with asset sales was to repay debt and to set up capital funds. This package presents an opportunity to put something aside for rebuilding our greatest capital asset-the environment-in perpetuity. It is an opportunity which this coalition government stands committed to make good on and it is an opportunity which only one party in Australia would try and defeat-the Labor Party. They would do so not out of any principle. They would not do so because they don't believe in privatisation. They do believe in it. They believe in privati sing airlines and in privati sing banks. They stand for privatising everything. There is no reason why you could possibly stand against privati sing telephones, except that you don't regard the environment as important as this side of the House does. This side of the House considers the environment to be important. This side of the House will make sure it comes to fruition. Mr O'Keefe-Sit down before I take a point of order on you.",16
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. Taxation: Research and Development,16
27,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism been advised of any rorting of the system which allows access to tax. concessions by approved syndicates for research and development projects? If so, how was the rorting able to occur, given the approval and registration processes place? If not, why have administrative barriers been erected by AusIndustry which defer unreasonably delay approval or registration applications? Is a figure of $1.30 cost to revenue for every $1 spent on research and development accurate across the board; or does that figure apply only to research and development by tax. exempt research bodies?",16
28,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am very grateful to the member for Curtin for raising this matter. Mr Crean-Are you going to give him answer?,17
29,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you don't usually put up questions that are worth answering.",17
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will address the question.,17
31,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
32,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have got 300 days for three years, so get used to it. You have a time to go. The honourable member Curtin has raised a very important issue. Syndicated R&D was one of the areas that the former government allowed some time ago to be brought up. It is very important to Australthis is that we encourage companies to get into R&D. The contribution made by the former government towards R&D has been signifiEmergency cant, but the contribution made by proprietary companies in the whole has not been so significant. The programs that have been up to encourage R&D have been taken up some part. However, I have to say that the government which departed had not bothered to attend the very tricky problems that are currently occurring within the R&D area. There are number of applications currently there which are being processed by the board which raise some questions as to their validity. It is - unfortunate that the previous government did not bother to process them and just left them there to be considered. It is a very sizeable problem. However, this government is pressdrops, ing on with it and we will resolve the matter in due course. Floods",17
33,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the very severe flooding that is occurring in southern Queensland and northin ern New South Wales? Is the Prime Minister also aware that evacuations are presently and occurring at Grafton and Maclean on the of Clarence River, where a near record flood is occurring? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the role that the defence forces and equipment can play in providing assistance?",17
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I certainly am aware of the severe flooding. I think all honourable members will be particularly conscious of the impact that it is having on people in both an Queensland and New South Wales. I invite my colleague the Minister for Defence to supplement the answer in relation to the role of the defence forces.,17
35,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Page for his question. I am sure that all members of the House would like to know what the arrangements are in regard to these floods and express their sympathy for the long people involved. Having been there at the for weekend for the Arnberley air showMr Crean-By helicopter.,17
36,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure you think is very serious. I would be very careful about expenses if I were you. In these arrangements, requests come from the State Service in Queensland to Emergency Management Australia, which is the defence agency which brings the ADF into set such emergencies. On the recommendation of in the EMA last Sunday, I approved the use of two Iroquois helicopters and one Kiowa, which is a light observation helicopter, from to the Army School at Oakey. The report said that there was potential for 100 people to a have to be moved out of the Lockyer Valley. In the end the crisis diminished somewhat and do two of those helicopters went home. My information this morning is that the flood situation there has stabilised but the Iroquois is still there. It has made a medical evacuation, a number of emergency food and medical supply drops, and it has been dropping in line crews to fix the power supply. This morning I was alerted by the Queensland SES in Dalby that it might require the use of a helicopter for food supplies to the Tara community. That has since been undertaken by the SES helicopter. The latest message is that we have had a request from Lismore for a Unimog, a high clearance vehicle which can operate in flood conditions, to be on stand-by. That will remain on standby. I will make sure that the House is brought up to date of any further circumstances that require our help.",17
37,Mrs CROSIO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Family Services. The Minister has stated that she is aware of the Prime Minister's absolute commitment to honour his election promises ahead of any budget balancing. I would like to remind her of the coalition's child-care policy document promise which states: An expansion in this sector of more than 85,000 places in long day care (and) . . . an additional 12,000 places in family day care over the next years. Will you now give an absolute guarantee that this promise will be met?",18
38,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for her question.,18
39,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
40,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Opposition members are not listening to the answer. They also did not listen to the electorate. They certainly did not listen to the electorate in relation to child-care questions. That is why they are sitting on those benches and not on these. In answer to the member's question, firstly, you left the child-care system in a mess. It is in a disgraceful mess. There are too many places in some areas and not enough in others. In the area of baby care and out of school hours care the system is inadequate. We have inherited a system that is in great need of an overhaul . to deliver to the parents of Australia a system that is accessible, a system that has quality and a system that is affordable. We have made commitments in relation to the childcare system. We will honour those commitments. Equal Pay",18
41,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the House of the steps that the government will take to guarantee equal pay for equal work and prevent discrimination in remuneration on the basis of gender?,18
42,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to advise the House that the government's intentions are to strengthen the equal pay for work of equal value provisions in the federal act by ensuring Child Care that the commission is instructed to take that criterion into account in its award making functions. We are going further. We will also require, as a minimum condition in certified agreements, that that principle be applied. In respect of Australian workplace agreements, as a mark of our consistent approach here, the requirement of equal pay for work of equal value will be a minimum condition for those agreements. I am also pleased to say that there will be continuing access to remedies five against discrimination in non-award matters, such as access through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and state tribunals. More generally, our commitment on this issue is demonstrated by the representation, which is now obvious to all in the House, of the number of women MPs who were elected in the recent federal election. That is a demonstration in concrete, real terms that on this side of the House it is merit that counts and not quotas. Whilst we on this side of the House were, by concrete measures, ensuring the application of that principle, those on the other side were refusing women the opportunity to stand for office with the Australian Labor Party. One of the candidates who sought office on the other side was Jenny Mikakos. Mr Martin Ferguson-She wasn't in the real estate game.",18
43,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This one hurts, Mr Speaker. Let me remind honourable members of the memorable words she said of the member for Batman: During his leadership, real wages and conditions of employment have been lowered, especially for women. Union coverage of the labour force has dropped. Is this the record of someone who is fighting for the battlers? So said Jenny Mikakos, who was bumped out things. of the way by a factional deal done by boys within the ALP. Mr O'Keefe- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is a factional deal that pales insignificance with your casino deal.",18
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,19
45,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It gets worse for them. Not only was the Labor Party humiliated in the recent election, and their hypocrisy on this issue was there for all to see; in the postfor election position the hypocrisy continues. the preselection fight for BlaxlandMr MCGauran-What's happening?",19
46,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, the former Prime Minister-remember it was the former Prime Minister who, at the Tasmanian conference the ALP, joined hands with the women of the ALP to celebrate their decision to adopt a 35 per cent quota-is now dictating that the seat of Blaxland actually be given to a long serving male party hack by the name of Hatton. On this issue, we have a clear policy posijob tion as to the bill we are introducing. have the runs on the board in terms of excellent result we had in the recent election. Our commitment to the women of this counly try is strong, will be in legislation and backed up by practice. Ministerial Responsibility",19
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Prime Minister to the guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility which he tabled in this place last week. I understand that ministers are required to lodge statements of interest with you by 27 May 1996. Since the document was tabled, there has been a series of revelations in recent days concerning the business interests of the Minister for Aboriginal and ""Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Minister Primary Industries and Energy and the make Minister for Industrial Relations. In light these revelations, is it the intention of Prime Minister to table those statements interest in the parliament?",19
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am rather pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question. Can I just say a couple of It is true that the ministerial guide, as the tabled, requires statements of pecuniary interest to be made to me by 27 May. I expect that there will be 100 per cent compliinto ance with that request, that I will have the statements of pecuniary interest by 27 May. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: Senator Herron, the Minister· for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, is, as every member of this House knows, an extremely skilled surgeon. His contribution to humanity included volunteering his services to operate two months with the Australian surgical In team in Rwanda. He did have a number of patients under his care at the time he was appointed to the ministry. I think I can say without betraying any confidences that he was agreeably surprised when I rang him and of offered him the ministry. Mr Crean-I think he was shocked. Mr Gareth Evans-I'll bet he was.",19
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-Can I say-and I do not mind how long the Leader of the Opposition obliges me to answer this question-that I think Senator Herron has done an outstanding in the ministry he has been given. If the We members opposite draw some kind of mirth the from that I do not know what-they are even more puzzling to me than they apparentwere to the Australian people on 2 March. Senator Herron obviously has some patients who are in his care. I think it is only plain common sense that he be allowed to see some of those through. The idea that you suddenly drop a patient on whom you have operated the previous week because you have become a minister is ridiculous. Anybody who argues that is even more ridiculous. That is the first part of the question I have answered. The second part is that there is no question at all of Senator Herron continuing a medical practice-and I have made that perfectly clear for to him. He will be a full-time minister. I also it plain to those opposite that it would of repay them to re-examine the Bowen report the in relation to these matters which canvassed of these issues of people maintaining their formal professional qualifications even though they did not continue a practice. The idea that you would continue a professional practice whilst being a minister would not be acceptable to me. It has never been my intention to allow any of my ministers to do that. Let me tum to the question of people,19
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You asked me the question. Let me deal with it in some detail. Let me come to the allegations, if you can dignify them with such a description, that have been made by Senator Bob Collins about the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Apparently, in some way, it is wrong to be a primary producer and a qlinister. That is the proposition implicit in what Senator Collins said. The truth of the matter is, and it has long been the situation, the ministerial code that tabled expressly allowed for the ownership of shares and directorships in family and investment companies. It enjoined against the ownership of shares in public companies. The idea that somebody who is a primary producer cannot be a cabinet minister is ludicrous. You mob were prepared to stand behind a Prime Minister who had a several hundred thousand dollar investment in a piggery. You must not mention that! Talk about hypocrisy!",20
52,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order.",20
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is the point of order?,20
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My point of order is this: the gentleman concerned being slandered by the Prime Minister got rid of the pig fann when he became a minister again.,20
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat!,20
56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,20
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right!,20
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The proposition apparently is that, if you are a primary producer and - you own a family farm, if you become a minister you have to divest yourself of the farm. Is that what you are arguing?",20
59,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's what he did.,20
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, are you arguing that?",20
61,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not arguing against that.,20
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are not arguing against it? Why did you ask the question?,20
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question was about whether you would table it.,20
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Table it? I tabled it. Here it is. I tabled it when I announced the ministry. The guidelines that were laid down in this document will be complied with in full. The guidelines do not require, and it would be patently absurd of the guidelines, patently absurdOpposition members-Oh!",20
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat, it would be patently absurd-for the third time, patently absurd-for a person who owns a family farm to divest himself or herself of that family I farm on becoming a minister. Finally, implicit in the argument that is advanced by Senator Collins is the idea that in some way if you are a primary producer you belong to a class of people that precludes you from making decisions on issues that affect primary producers. That is as ridiculous as asserting that the mother or father of children attending a university should be precluded from participating in a decision that affects the terms and conditions on which you attend the university. Small Business",20
66,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of progress on implementation of the government's action plan for small business?  member for his question and for his interest in small business matters. The government has made substantial progress in setting the foundation to achieve its goals in regard to small business. There are five key elements of the lOO-day plan, including the important area of deregulation reform-something that your mob over there excluded and did not do for 13-odd years. Firstly, the establishment of the small business deregulation task force was announced by the Prime Minister in this House last week. It is something that you ignored. You ignored the impost and cost on small business of regulation and red tape. Secondly, this task force will review the paperwork and compliance burden on small business, and regulations. Secondly, the government is consideringMr Crean-You just said 'secondly'.  is considering the implementation of sunset clauses on regulatory activity. Thirdly, national small business summit will be held in Sydney on 12 June. Mr Crean-Page 2.  the fact that for 13 years you failed to deliver. You gave small business Beazley's black hole-that is, $8 billion worth of debtsomething that we are going to have to fix. right! This summit will bring together the small business ministers and local government I representatives to address the coordination and impact of government decision making on small business of all spheres of government. Progress has been made on the fourth element of the IOO-day action plan-the for establishment of the micro small business consultative group. I am in the process consulting with small business representatives on the responsibilities and composition of group. I have already met with the Small Business Coalition to discuss the government plan. In addition to the five key elements of the IOO-day action plan, the government has also established an Office of Small Business within DIST-something that your government would never do-and on the focal point it will deal with the consideration of other small business issues. The action taken by the government in regard to that is a major part of our commitment to small business. We solid in what we intend to deliver to small business-something that you failed to do and failed to recognise in your 13 years of government. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of Thursday order: as the minister was clearly reading from a document, could I ask that it be tabled. so we can check his incorrect delivery?",20

71,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. ask the minister: last Thursday, in answer to a question, did you advise the House that late last year I had been informed by the chairman of AN, Mr Smorgon, of an $80 million blowout in the cost of running AN, taking losses the year up to $106 million? Did you tell this House that I had replied to Mr Smorgon of in the following words: 'Don't do anything about it now; it's too close to the election'? this I ask the minister: has Mr Smorgon now contacted your office to complain about the answer you gave in this parliament and to reaffirm that no such financial briefing on the affairs of AN occurred? Mr Speaker, I ask the honourable minister: how does he reconcile his actions with his leader's commitment that all ministers will conduct themselves at all times with honesty and integrity?",21
72,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is fascinating that the Labor Party puts up as a person who is concerned about ministerial responsibility are none other than the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, whose reputation tells a story in itself. Can I inform the House that, as the shadow minister for foreign affairs indicated, the chainnan of AN, Mr Jack Smorgon, contacted my office after question time on and said that he had been contacted by the member for Kingsford-Smith and that he had had an ear-chewing from the member for Kingsford-Smith, who was very upset about what allegedly had been said in the House earlier that day. Honourable members will recall the circumstances of question time on Thursday afternoon when I highlighted the fact that the debt or the losses of AN had exploded by some $80 million up to $106 million. Following that, I made the point that the former Minister for Transport, now shadow minister for foreign affairs, had been aware of problems. If he had cared to quote my words from the Hansard of the day rather than twist them, as he did in his personal explanation after question time and as he has done today in his question, if he actually quoted the words that I used in my answer, he would have known that I said to the chairman of AN, 'How long have you been aware of the circumstances about the problems of AN?' He said, 'For some months now.' Remember that the current chairman, Mr Smorgon, was not appointed that long ago. I said, 'What have you done about it?' He said to me-I am recounting the story-'I approached the former Minister for Transport and informed him of my serious concerns about the management of AN.' I did not say, as the member for Kingsford Smith is implying in his question and implied in his personal explanation that followed, that the chairman of AN told the former minister that the exact losses were of $106 million or thereabouts. I did not say that. Indeed, if you read the Hansard you will find that to be so. I said at the time of answering the question that the chairman of AN informed the minister of his very serious concerns about the management problems of AN. Then I said to the chairman, 'What did the minister say?' He said, 'Don't do anything about it because it's getting close to the election; we don't want to create a problem.' Indeed, the chairman of AN did not have available to him at that time the exact nature of the losses, and I never said that that was the case. I said, and this is the truth-if you . read the Hansard of Thursday you will see this to be true-that they knew they had enormous problems and that the chairman of AN informed the former minister of the nature of those problems; and he put a course of action to the former Minister for Transport to correct those problems and the former minister said, 'Don't do anything about it.' You read the Hansard, member for Kingsford-Smith, and you will see that your personal explanation that followed question time on Thursday and the interpretation that you put in your question today are inaccurate. You claim that other people have misled the House. That cap might better fit you than anybody on this side of the House. NA",21
73,Mr TAYLOR,APEC,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Can the minister outline whether Australia has completed its draft individual action plan for APEC and whether Australia will table its plan during the forthcoming APEC senior officials meeting in the Philippines at the end of this month?,22
74,Mr TIM FISCHER,APEC,"Mr Speaker, I am happy to confirm that the Australian government has completed preparation of a draft individual action plan in accord with the Bogor declaration and the Osaka agenda. This has now been cleared for tabling at the meeting to be held at Cebu in the Philippines later this month. This will commence the process with regard to further negotiations on trade liberalisation in the APEC context. The lAP is fully consistent with the Osaka action agenda agreed to by the leaders last year, including the requirement for comprehensiveness, WTO consistency, comparability and transparency. The lAP is also consistent with the government's commitment to a comprehensive program of micro-economic reform. Australia's lAP will address tariffs, non-tariff barriers, investment and services. It will not prejudge outcomes of previously announced reviews in certain sectoral categories. I thank the member for Groom for his continuing interest in the trade and foreign affairs and defence policy areas and I take this opportunity to point out that the government will be using the APEC process and the consultations on the lAPs to vigorously pursue Australia's market access priorities to increase opportunities for Australian exporters. We have considerably liberaIised our own market and expect others to match our record. We will be doing everything to maximise our negotiating circumstance as a consequence of our lAP and we expect other APEC members to table draft lAPs of high quality substance which will make real progress in the APEC context for trade liberalisation. The government will continue to consult closely with industry in relation to this. I accept that there is no such thing as an international level playing field, but we will address this in a comprehensive way, as I have said previously, on the bilateral front with extra effort and also on the regional and multilateral fronts. In that context, the swift action taken by the coalition government to develop the lAP and to clear it for presentation at Cebu represents solid progress at the regional level with trade liberalisation. Australian National Railways Commission",22
75,Mr BEAZLEY,APEC,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I remind the Minister for Transport and Regional Development that he has for some months now been wandering around the country accusing both the former Minister for Transport and me of concealing $106 million in alleged losses. I ask him whether he recollects these words spoken in the House last Thursday: So we now have an $80 million blow-out in the operating costs of AN. I asked Mr Smorgon how long he had been aware of this situation, and said, 'For some months now.' I asked whether he made the former Labor government aware of the problem. The $80 million. He continued: He said, 'Yes. Late last year I approached the former Minister for Transport' - who is now the shadow foreign minister-""and I made him aware of my concerns about the management of AN. Indeed, I put a course of action to him that I thought would help correct the problem. Would you not agree that that was a clear-cut reference-'this probIem'-to an $80 million alleged blow-out? In which case, why would you maintain in the face of it that you had not misled the House?",23
76,Mr TUCKEY,APEC,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the first constraint on people asking a question is set in standing order 144; that is, you will not debate the question. That was a debate, not a question.",23
77,Mr SPEAKER,APEC,There is no point of order. Had the Leader of the Opposition finished asking his question?,23
78,Mr BEAZLEY,APEC,"Yes, Mr Speaker.",23
79,Mr SHARP,APEC,"The situation I referred to, which was reported to me by Mr Smorgon, was made known to the former Minister for Transport. The exact size of the situation was difficult to detect",23
80,Unknown,APEC,Opposition members interjecting,23
81,Mr SPEAKER,APEC,Order! Members on my left!,23
82,Mr SHARP,APEC,"I just said that earlier. Do you know the reason why that situation was difficult to determine in its exact nature? I will tell you the reason why. It was in the nature of the advice that the former Minister for Transport received from the now chairman of AN, Mr Jack Smorgon. That was, 'We cannot tell you the size or nature of the problem in its exactitude because we cannot depend upon t-e advice and information that we are receiving from the managing director of AN.' In the process of correcting the problems, as the honourable member for Kingsford Smith well knows, the chairman of AN put to him as a proposition for him to support and approve that in order to correct their inability he to detect the size and nature of the problem they dispense with the services of the managing director of AN. That is what he put to you. He told you that there were very serious problems. He told you that it was difficult to identify, to the exact dollar, that this problem existed because they could not depend on the advice and information of the managing director. You rejected the proposition he put to you on the basis that it was too close to the election and it would cause you and your party political problems that you did not want to have to live with, so that those problems at AN continued to run at a cost of about $9 million a month because you would not act according to the advice you received from the chairman of AN. Papua New Guinea",23
83,Mr GEORGIOU,APEC,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to his recent visit to Papua New Guinea and ask: will the government change Australian aid policies to provide for more budgetary aid?,24
84,Mr DOWNER,APEC,"I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I know that he has an enduring interest in Papua New Guinea, having visited that country on several occasions. I visited Papua New Guinea between 2 May and 4 May and did indeed discuss issues of aid, as well as the financial situation of Papua New Guinea. The reception I received in Papua New Guinea was a very warm and friendly one. It was a warm and friendly one partly because our government gives a very high priority to the relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea. I note, for example, that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea said after my visit that I had been 'refreshingly forthright' during my visit. I also notice that after I had made my visit the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea said publicly, 'We are satisfied to be back in the mainstream of Australian foreign policy.' I am satisfied to have Papua New Guinea back into the mainstream of Australian foreign policy. Mr Costell«r-Who took it out?",24
85,Mr DOWNER,APEC,"Indeed, as the Treasurer says, 'Who took it out?' You don't have to look very far from where I am standing now to find the answer to that question. I did discuss the aid treaty Australia has with Papua New Guinea. It is no secret that Papua New Guinea would like a moratorium on the decline in budgetary aid and the increase in project aid, as they see it, in order to assist with some of their financial problems. However, I made it clear to the Papua New Guinea government that the Australian government would not change the aid treaty and we would not provide such a moratorium but that the best we could do-and we would do it-would be to sit down with the Papua New Guinea government and talk about the types of projects our project aid is spent on and review the operation of that project aid. Those talks will go ahead very soon. This was a successful visit. It did, as Sir Julius Chan pointed out, bring Papua New Guinea back into the mainstream of Australian foreign policy. Papua New Guinea is a country for which I think all Australians have a good deal of affection and that affection is reciprocated, but it is not a country that should be taken for granted and it is not a country which appreciates being patronised and lectured. Sometimes there has been a sense in Papua New Guinea that that is the treatment they have received. I am glad to have been able to make these strides forward in Australian foreign policy because that relationship is an important relationship to the Australian government. Pensions  to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I remind the minister of the Prime Minister's commitment to maintain the previous government's benchmark for the basic pension, which is to keep it at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I also mention the Prime Minister's pledge that election commitments would be honoured even if this meant delaying the achievement of a fiscal surplus. Has the minister been briefed by the Department of Social Security that meeting this commitment will mean substantial pension increases over and above normal indexation because of projected average weekly earnings growth outstripping the consumer price index and that this issue will have to be addressed in this year's budget? Has the minister also been advised that the additional 1997-98 cost of maintaining this benchmark, together with the existing flow-ons to other payments, is between $250 million for the least rigorous interpretation and $640 million for a more generous interpretation and that for 1998-99 the corresponding costs are between $600 million and $970 million? Can the minister give an unequivocal guarantee that this key election promise to Australian pensioners will be kept?",24
86,Mr RUDDOCK,APEC,"I thank the shadow skills minister for his question. The government is committed to maintaining a strong and secure safety net for those in need. The government marketplace. made it clear that it is committed to maintaining the current pension benchmark of at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That was set out in the coalition's social policy statement and obviously, in the context budget matters, we will look at all of the ramifications of those questions and make anmight nouncements in the budget and not before. Skill Shortages",25
87,Mr WAKELIN,APEC,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Edubusiness cation and Training. I draw the minister's attention to articles in the media about nesses seeking people from overseas because of skill shortages. Will the minister inform House what the government is doing to overcome skill shortages in key industry areas?",25
88,Dr KEMP,APEC,"I thank the honourable memstates ber for Grey for his question. I have seen recent reports concerning a company in recognised Western Australia which has brought 10 a skilled workers from the Philippines on month visas to work with the company as state or territory. boilermakers, welders and fitters because it was unable to find Australian workers to fill the positions. I am advised the company did its very best to find Australian workers to fill these positions and that it went through the appropriate procedures to do so. It did employ some 30 tradespeople, but the fact was that there were simply not enough qualified people with these trades qualifications to take positions. I must say that this is no criticism of the company. The company has to be the admired for its commitment to trading be that cause it currently employs some 14 apprenarrangements tices. The former minister for employment will and incentives. recall that this is not the first time that this sort of problem has arisen. He will recall a reported incident in South Australia last year which, again, raised the issue this also illusthat trates; that is, the failure of the government have put in place, over its whole 13 years, a training system which is able to cope with the requirements of Australian business, particularly those Australian businesses which are seeking to compete in the international One of the major reasons for the failure of these skills being available is the fact that the arrangements the previous government put in place are so complex and bureaucratic that of small and medium sized enterprises have simply felt unable to operate that system. It be of interest to the House if I outline some of the complexity that exists in the system the former minister for employment put in place. Typically when a small or medium sized wants to take on an apprentice or a trainee, if there is no training package availbusiable off the shelf, employers have to wait until an industry working group puts one the together. This usually takes some three to six months. Then the package has to go through a whole variety of bureaucratic processes and the Industrial Relations Commission. The and territories decide on the accreditation of the package. If training has not been in the field, there will have to be declaration of the vocation. Training provid12ers will have to seek registration from the After the training package has got through all this, the Commonwealth will determine its eligibility for subsidies and incentive payments and the training arrangements will then have to be incorporated into the industrial relations arrangements. All of this adds another couple of months to the procedures of the system that the previous government set the in place. When a package is ready the employer has to enter into two agreements with government, one with the state or territory is responsible for monitoring the training and another with the Commonwealth, for the payment of employer subsidies All of this adds further weeks to the effort of this enterprise to get a trainee to do the job that it wants them to do. This is the system has been set in place over the last 13 to years. There is the additional problem that employers in small and medium sized enterprises fear that when they take on a trainee that trainee will be supervised by a trade union in their previously non-unionised workplace. One of the key reforms that we will be introducing into the training system is the separation, as far as is possible, of training arrangements from industrial relations arrangements so that training is no longer sacrificed to the internal politics of the Labor Party and the Aero. The member for Batman would know this well. This has denied opportunities to tens of thousands of young Australians because the member for Batman was more interested in defending his mates and in defending the system that built up his privileges, not in making sure that young people got the training opportunities they needed. We will be putting in place a training system which is simple, not bureaucratic, which is accessible to industry and in which there is a genuine sense of ownership by the small and medium sized enterprises of this country. This system will create a great expansion in opportunities for young people and will provide small and medium businesses in this country with the skills they so desperately need and which were denied to them by the previous government.",25
89,Mr HOWARD,APEC,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",26
90,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",26
91,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the minister claim to have been misrepresented?,26
92,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes.,26
93,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,26
94,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In an article entitled 'Government shifts to aggressive regional defence policy' published in the Canberra Times on Saturday, 4 May, Mr Ian McPhedran misquoted remarks I made at a conference conducted by the International Institute of Strategic Studies on the previous day. Paragraph 3 of the article states: Mr MCLachlan also said Australia would have been bound under the terms of the ANZUS alliance to commit forces to assist the United States had a conflict broken out with China over Taiwan. I said nothing of the sort. In answer to a question on the subject. I said that we have obligations under ANZUS and that they would no doubt be brought to account. I refused to speculate further about a hypothetical question. The extent of our obligations under ANZUS commits us to consult with the United States and New Zealand whenever, in the opinion of the parties to the alliance, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened. This is quite contrary to the commitment of forces. Mr MCPhedran has clearly attributed to me words that I did not use. In addition, in the same article",26
95,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The minister is drifting from the point of his explanation.,26
96,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No, I am not. I claim to have been misrepresented twice in the same article. In the same article, Mr MCPhedran directly quotes me as saying in regard to offshore operations: And not only that, I would have said that we must be one of the senior initiators of running offshore, allover the place. . . This is not true. In fact, I said the opposite on this subject. I said that we would not be the initiators of running offshore. I wish to make these corrections. NA Standing Orders",26

NA Small Business",27
108,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The threat to the capacity of small business to develop export potential as a result of the planned abolition of trade and industry development programs, in particular the Export Market Development Grants scheme. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",28
109,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"-The subject matter of the MPI today is the government's lack of a real policy commitment to increasing exports, to creating jobs and to providing small business with the incentives to do precisely that. The lack of the government's policy commitment is best expressed by the proposed abolition of the export market development grants scheme. The concern about the proposed abolition by the government of that export market development grants scheme is best articulated by  Australian Business Chamber. I quote from a public statement by Mr Holt reported in the Telegraph of the weekend of 20-21 April: Australian Business Chamber managing director Philip Holt said that any attempt to abolish the $237 million export market development grants would be a major backward step for small and medium-sized businesses. He said, I repeat, 'a major backward step for small and medium-sized businesses'. The report of his statement continues: Mr Holt said if reports of the abolition were correct, the Government would be breaking an election promise and affect job creation and increase the balance of payments deficit. 'This scheme helps small and medium business get into export markets ... So this was a condemnatory comment by Mr Holt in respect of the proposed abolition by the government of this particular industry and trade development program. In this chamber, within the last week, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) refused to recommit himself to the government's election commitment of 200,000 new jobs in the manufacturing sector by the year 2000. Last week, in response to a question from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), the minister refused to commit himself to the continuation of a range of trade and industry development programs. Last week the honourable member for Forrest, the Minister for Small Business and Con mit himself to guaranteeing the government's election commitment of extending the EMDG scheme to single tourist operators. The Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer), whom we find absent from the chamber for this matter of public importance and who has ministerial responsibility for the scheme, is deafening by his silence. Mr Deputy Speaker, the increase in Australia's export achievements was one of the significant economic achievements of the last government and we saw, in the course of our government's term in office, a massive increase in exports, in their range, diversity and qUality. Yesterday, by way of a dorothy dixer, we saw the Minister for Trade-and it took him two bites of the cherry-try to understate the significant economic achievement of the previous government by referring to export market share, which anyone with a modest or modicum of interest or knowledge in this area knows is a very specious way of proceeding. Indeed, the Minister for Trade's comments in the House yesterday were referred to in this morning's edition of the Sydney Morning Herald as 'specious'. When we look at the export statistics and the enhancement of export perfonnance by the previous government, we find some very interesting and important statistics. Firstly, if our export perfonnance of the last decade were maintained over the next couple of years, Australia would achieve a trade surplus by 1997-98 year in and year out. That stands in stark contrast to the report we saw from Access Economics yesterday, which suggested that, if the government's macro-economic policies are implemented, growth in Australia's exports will fall from 8.7 per cent to 3.1 per cent. In the 10 years to 1994, exports increased by 107 per cent and it has been calculated that that brought with it somewhere in the area of 500,000 new jobs. We saw exports grow, as a proportion of our economy, from 19 to 25 per cent. We have seen value added exports or elaborately transfonned manufactured exports grow by 17 per cent per annum since 1984. In addition to that, we saw the range and diversity of exports increase, with services exports increasing by 13 per cent. Manufactures and services now make up 50 per cent of our total exports, and they were less than a third a decade ago. So, in tenns of exports and jobs, they are the real effects of the perfonnance of the previous government. In the course of the last parliament, we saw a range of reports which suggested that the great increase in our export perfonnance as a country was not only in its range and diversity but also in the types of companies, small and medium sized enterprises, and small businesses which are now exporting. That is as a direct result of the trade and industry policies implemented by those on this side over that period of time in office. We saw a reference made yesterday to Access Economics, and there was a suggestion in the Access Economics report that growth in Australia's exports would fall from 8.7 to 3.1 per cent if the government's macroeconomic policies were applied. It is interesting to refer to an article by Tim Colebatch in the Age entitled 'Pruning for growth', where he makes some comments about our country's export perfonnance. I will quote from Mr Colebatch's article. It states: Above all, keep up the growth in value-added exports that was Labor's greatest economic achievement. In less than 10 years, Australia's exports have more than doubled, $39 biIIion to $92 billion. Most of that growth was in non-traditional areas: services exports trebled to $21 billion, and manufactured exports grew fivefold to $17.5 billion. The export boom in manufactures and servicehas added almost $30 biIIion a year to Australia's output, and perhaps 500,000 jobs. If they can continue to grow at anything like the rates of the past 10 years, the next tranche of benefits will be two or three times that size. Mr Colebatch goes on to say this: What is alanning in the coalition's policies and Budget agenda is the evident lack of any strategy for ensuring they will continue. 'They', of course, being the trade and industry programs that he has referred to. He went on to say: Trade and industry programs are being tossed up as targets for the axe with no sign that ministers . . . are weighing their importance to achieving the growth the Coalition and Australia need. In the course of his article, Mr Colebatch goes through the range of trade and industry programs that we know are up for the chop. They include research and development programs; ITES-the international trade enhancement scheme; factor F; DIFF; the Market Australia program, which, despite the fact that the coalition expressly committed itself to building on that program, has definitely already gone; and the EMDG program. The EMDG program has been reviewed on a number of occasions over the last few years and, on each of those occasions in the course of those reviews we have discovered that the money which is expended by way of EMDG is more than met in terms of the export return. We have also seen in a range of reports-in particular the report entitled Helping to meet the export challenge, which was published by Austrade in April 1994that the vast bulk of recipients of grants under the EMDG scheme are, of course, small and medium sized business enterprises. It has been suggested and calculated, in accordance with those and other reports, that more than 75 per cent of the companies that take advantage of the EMDG scheme employ fewer than 25 employees. It has also been suggested in that report and others that, for every dollar spent on the EMDG program, the return to Australia is anywhere as high as $25 by way of any export return. Mr Lee-How about the tourism industry?",28
110,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The former minister for tourism refers to the tourism industry. It is, of course, the case-and I will come to the coalition's commitment at the last election shortly-that not only did the coalition commit itself to retaining the EMDG scheme, but it also committed itself to extending it to single traders in the tourism industry. Mr Lee-I hope they can keep that promise.",30
111,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We do hope they keep that promise. Mr Martin-You pre-empt my speech.,30
112,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will not preempt the speech of the shadow minister for tourism, but I will go directly to the coalition's document, which was published in the run-up to the last election. It is entitled 'Meeting the challenges: Liberal and National Party trade strategies for the future'. I will quote from various aspects of that particular document. On page 3, it states: Australia's Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme has been in operation since 1975, and has been supported by Australia's export businesses. The Coalition will retain the Scheme ... On page 9, it states: When all is said and done, the foundations for a successful trade strategy are the export activities companies and individuals. Accordingly we will welcome the contribution of the business community through Chambers of Manufactures and Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and other similar bodies to improve our international trade performance. I hope they listen to, among others, Mr Holt, representing the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, and his view on the EMDG scheme. Page 30 of the same document, under the heading 'Export incentives', states: We will: maintain the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) Scheme ... In another document published by the coalition, they, as I have said, committed themselves to extending the scheme to sole traders in the tourism industry. On 15 February this year at the National Press Club, the then shadow minister, now the Minister for Trade, described himself as being in the privileged position of presenting the coalition trade policy. I quote from page 8 of the transcript of his address: . . . we of course have as the fifth track in relation to our approach to trade, the promoting and financing Australian exports. Austrade stays, the EMDG scheme stays-refined, re-focused, improved-and a range of other schemes. So there we have in the course of the election the coalition expressly handcuffing itself to the continuation of these trade and industry development programs. What have we seen so far? We have had a deafening silence from the Minister for Trade in respect of the speculation that these programs are for the chop. We have seen the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism refuse in this House to commit himself to the continuation of those programs. We have seen the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, now at the bar table, refuse to commit himself to the extension of the EMDG program to assist small business operators in the tourism industry. Calculations released by the deputy chairman of the Australian Manufacturing Council suggest that, if these programs that I have referred to are abolished, Australia risks of losing $4.5 billion a year in net exports by the year 2000 and 80,OOO-odd jobs by the year 2001. In the course of the last few weeks, I and my colleagues have received a range of submissions and representations from exporting companies calling upon the government to ensure that the EMDG scheme is not abolished. I refer to a letter that ChiIlsaver International, which is an exporting company in Gwelup, Western Australia, sent to the Minister for Trade. It states: As a newcomer to the world export arena, I wish to register my support for this scheme, for without it small companies such as ours would not have a hope of entering this market place. The Export Market Development Grant is one of very few major assistance programs available to exporters, and I believe that of some $200 million paid out through this scheme last year, that the exporters this country returned something like $2 billion in additional Australian exports. Do I need to remind you of the negative impact on the economy that the abolition of the EMDG Scheme would havesurely I do not. The overwhelming support that you received this last election was largely related to your promises to help small and medium sized businesses, one of which was to maintain the Export Market Development Grant scheme. Those representations have been repeated or referred to me by colleagues from the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association, by 4WD Equipment, referred to in the House yesterday by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), and by the Hotel Motel and Accommodation Association. So what have we seen happen in respect of the EMDG program? We have seen a commitment by the coalition in the course of the previous election to continue the scheme, to maintain the scheme, to enhance it and to extend it. We saw the Minister for Trade personally commit himself to that. Since the election, there has been deafening silence from the Minister for Trade and, effectively, negative comments from the minister for small business and the minister for industry. I was surprised to see the minister for industry, reported in the Australian of 29 April, referring to the EMDG program. He said that small business had not greatly taken up the EMDG program. This shows his complete ignorance of the effectiveness of this program, so far as small business is concerned. We have the minister for industry refusing to commit himself to this particular range of programs. The view of the minister for industry, in the case of jobs and exports, is that more equals less. In regard to the Minister for Trade, we saw enthusiasm before the election, but there is a deafening silence now. One minute before the election we saw the Minister for Trade at the National Press Club committing himself to these programs and, one minute after the election, there is a deafening silence. The Minister for Trade showed one face to the small business community before the election, and one face after. With the minister for industry it is more of equals less; with the Minister for Trade it is either two-minute or two-faced policy Tim. The government committed itself absolutely to the continuation of this scheme and to its extension. On behalf of small business, we call on the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to guarantee that their commitment made to Australia's small business will be met and that - the EMDG scheme will be maintained and extended as promised.",30
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the minister, while I did not interrupt the flow of the member for Perth, I suggest to him and other members of this House that the words 'two-faced Tim' are inappropriate. I will not tolerate that in future.  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (3.33 p.m.)-Small business played a key role in the election of the government, and our commitments to that sector remain undiminished. The government has in place an aggressive plan to reduce the burdens on small business. As a first step, we need to bring the budget back into surplus to repair Labor's $8 billion black hole, which has cost taxpayers $9 billion, in addition to the borrowings, to service budget deficits of the past. In fact, it will cost $9.3 billion to service this year's budget. It has not dawned on the members on the other side of the House that the reason we have an absolute commitment to bring the budget back into surplus and to use the proceeds of privatisation sales to reduce Commonwealth government debt is that if we can reduce that servicing component we will help not only all taxpayers but particularly the small business sector. One should not forget what Labor's record was during its 13 years in office. Who can forget the words, 'This is the recession we had to have,' the aftermath of which saw 18,516 small businesses go bankrupt. One of Labor's greatest legacies for small business during the entire term of its government was the 41,121 bankruptcies, an average of five employees per business. This represents some 200,000 people who directly lost their jobs. If those opposite want to talk about jobs lost, their actions during the period of government lost some 200,000 Australians their jobs. Who can forget the unfair dismissal laws which paralysed the small business sector? It was the very reason why small business did not put on people. Even the former Prime Minister came to recognise the devastating impact of this policy when he said during the campaign that they would review Labor's unfair dismissal laws. In spite of this, the former Prime Minister had the gall to say, 'This is as good as it ever gets.' I say to small business that the coalition government is going to make things a dam sight better for small business. We on this side of the House recognise that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. We recognise that in the last nine years 1.1 million jobs have been grown by the. small business sector. We recognise that if we are going to tum around the level of unemployment in this country it will be the small business sector that will do it. We have put in place a very aggressive plan, in a policy sense. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) seems to take delightand so he should-in reading from our policy document. If those opposite read from a few more of our policy documents they would finally realise why we won the election and they lost the election. We put in place policies that will tum around the devastation that 13 years of Labor have wrought on the small business sector. Mr Martin Ferguson-What's your jobs target?  for Batman come to this House after supporting Labor's unfair dismissal laws which scared the pants off small business? They did not employ people-it took you a long time to work that out-because you did not understand small business and you did not understand the absolute fear they had with your legislation. It took the former Prime Minister a long time to wake up, but during the campaign he admitted it was not too good. Finally, after the whole nation was crying out about this draconian piece of legislation, he said that he would review it. As I mentioned-and the member for Perth has quoted from our document-we have recognised the importance of small business and its importance to the Australian economy. In our 100-day action plan, as I announced in an answer to a question, we have established the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. Members of the House would be aware that many small businesses are absolutely bogged down with the paperwork burden. Indeed, I can remember back to when I was actively involved in my business operations. Members, if they cast their minds back to even 12 years ago, will remember that they did not have to worry about complying with fringe benefits tax and the complexity of the fringe benefits tax, they did not have to worry about capital gains tax and they did not have to worry about Labor's unfair dismissal laws, because they were not around. In addition to the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) last Thursday about the make-up of the deregulation task force was a down payment of a 20 per cent reduction in the compliance of ABS stat forms. I, as a businessman, could never see the value of sitting down and filling out forms. I wanted to be out in the marketplace running my business. The opposition have failed to realise that small business want a reasonable run. They want a predictable and healthy economy. They want a climate where they can grow their business with certainty. They want to build their business and to employ more Australians. The second part of our 100-day program and our policy commitment is to ensure that all new regulations have a five-year sunset clause, to convene a national small business summit, to involve the three tiers of government, to look at the regulatory overlap and to establish a micro business consultative group. The opposition might say, 'What is all that going to do?' They have failed to realise that, of the 860,000 small businesses in Australia, just on 212,000 of them fit the micro category. Generally, just on one-third of the small business sector in Australia are either owned by or run by women. That figure is expected to be at 50 per cent by the year 2000. We want to get a better handle on, and a better link to, the micro business sector, because we think there is a great opportunity for that sector to grow, particularly with new technology. The previous government ignored that sector and ignored its growth potential. We do not intend to do that. I have already commenced some discussions with groups to put in place the establishment of that micro small business consultative group. The government in its election campaign made a commitment to meet with the Small Business Coalition to discuss our three-year plan of action. I met that commitment and spoke with the Small Business Coalition two weeks ago. Even at the halfway mark, we have achieved the bulk of our commitments. Freeing small business from the burden of red tape and compliance is a major component of the government's plan. Last Thursday, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a deregulation task force. The task force will report back to government on revenue neutral ways to reduce the paperwork burden by 50 per cent. A sign of our commitment to this is, of course, the 20 per cent down payment. The small business summit will be convened on 12 June. To ensure that the legislation does not run out of control, I have already committed that we intend to put in a sunset clause. The opposition has failed to realise the importance of small business. The member for Perth was keen to quote from our small business policy. What he did not go on to quote was that, in addition to what I have mentioned, the government intends to lower Labor's provisional tax uplift factor. The previous government, the Labor Party, put the uplift factor at eight per cent. What that is zap capital from the small business sector so that they cannot use those retained earnings to fund growth and expansion. We are going to reduce that uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. Legislation relating to that will be introduced to the House shortly. In addition to that, we are committed to introducing a capital gains tax rollover provision, commencing 1 July 1997. Remember that it was the Labor Party that introduced the c,,:pital gains - ax on 19 September 1985. They faIled to realIse that that was stalling small business from making decisions in their business's best interests. It constrained small business from making a decision to grow a big business-to sell their factory to buy a bigger factory, to sell their business to buy a business and to grow their business. Mr Anderson-I think it's lost on them.  opposition because they still have not worked out why they lost the election. They have now at least got something right. At least they are quoting from policies that helped us win the election. At least they have recognised that much. I hope that they read the rest of our policies; it will make them realise where they have gone wrong over the last number of years. More importantly, the opposition really missed the point in regard to some of their own documents. What they should realise is th-t ?r Vince FitzGerald, whom they commiSSioned to do a report on national savings, reported: We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt. FitzGerald was arguing the case for national savings. Who has been the greatest dis-saver? The federal government. Mrs Sullivan-The Labor Party.  blew out borrowings by funding budget deficits. They had to borrow to fund budget deficits. That figure has quadrupled in the last number of years, and the figure in the budget to f-nd that is $9.3 billion. More importantly, as FitzGerald said, we have to borrow to fund does that amount of money. I recall the former Prime Minister in 1990, when talking about debt, saying: In thr- years there will no government debt, domestic or external. It's an enormous claim-Paul was into making c1aimsthat I can make on behalf of the government of Australia. I doubt there is any other OECD economy that will not have any bonds on issue What happened past that point? It blew out. would go away. and he borrowed about another $50 billion. Not a bad record when he had said that in three years time we would have no government debt. Mr Anderson-Who's got to pay that back?  back. What that left us was Beazley's billion black hole. It should not be the business sector but the Labor Party getting out there explaining to small business why they have put this impost on the small business sector, why they have to tum around pay interest rates higher than they should have to and why they have to pay the price repairing the economy that Labor failed to during the entire recovery. The former Prime Minister said, 'This is as good as it's ever going to get.' The former Prime Minister said, 'We are in a growth phase; we have been through the greatest growth period recorded since the end of Depression.' During that whole period you did not repay any debt. With asset sales blew the money, you rattled up debt and rattled up borrowings, and it is the small business sector in fact that paid the price. We will not be doing that to small business. We are committed to running balanced budgsays ets and a predictable economy. If we run particular matter. balanced budgets, we do not have to go into the marketplace and borrow billions of dolits lars. Money is like any other commodity; if you take $ I 00 billion-odd out of the market, that leaves less in the market for small ness to borrow, it ratchets up rates and it constrains the growth of the economy. Small business has had to live with the uncertainty that the Labor government business wrought on it. They have still not understood that, if you really want to grow small busitunities ness, if you want to give them the opportunity to springboard into export markets, the thing you have to do is give them a strong home base so they can grow their business, grow their markets and use that strength that base to springboard into export They have forgotten that. They thought that you could keep throwing money at these sorts at all. of things and that somehow the problems",31

116,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cunningham) (3.48 p.m.)My concern in the debate today is associated with the Australian tourism industry. In fact, I had pen poised and some paper here to take the down some notes about the export market development grants scheme-which was, after you all, the basis of this MPI-so I could see you what the Minister for Small Business and  say about it. Regrettably, the paper is blank; he didn't mention it once, and that I think something about his commitment to that The tourism industry in Australia today, and projected growth into the future, will in fact be the basis for very healthy growth in the Australian economy. Importantly, as the· busiMinister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs was saying, it will impact greatly in the small business area. How many members in this place represent electorates where small operators in the tourism industry are looking for continuing advantage, for opporto create ongoing employment and for opportunities that the export market developfirst ment grants scheme might give them to promote not only their region but also economic development and subsequent job and growth? But did we hear anything of that markets. from the minister? Not one word. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, your electorate of Cowper, a superb location on the north coast of New South Wales, is a great tourist destination. You would have been sitting there waiting to hear what your small business operators in the tourism industry-whether they be the Big Banana or whatever-were actually going to get from your government. You would have been sitting there interested to hear whether some of the noises in the industry at the moment are accurate or not. Or was it the case that what the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) said during the election campaign before they came to government about the future of that scheme and how it was to be extended to tourism was in fact still the policy? Was that exactly what those people on the government side really stood for? Could I just remind honourable members of some of the comments made during the election campaign. In a report in the Financial Review of 14 February 1996, the coalition, it is said, promised to extend the export market development grants scheme, already worth more than $200 million a year, to tourism. This will cost roughly $30 million over three years, although costing is not to be seen anywhere in the coalition tourism policy. All right, we will let you get away with that one for now, but at least there was still a clear commitment to do that. It was a bit of a reverse from what the honourable member for Bennelong, now the Prime Minister, said in 1987. In that campaign he was actually honest enough to say he did not like the export market development grants scheme and that he wanted to give it the flick. But then, in the 1996 campaign, he was out there with the rest of them saying, at a breakfast, 'I this near obsession with creating a climate providing the right incentives to small business to get going and employ people.' He went on to say that the tourism package showed that he meant it. Here was the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, strutting around Australia saying that they would support the tourism industry that had been looking for a full extension on equal footing of the export market development grants scheme for their industry, particularly for single operators. There they were, strutting their stuff around Australia, giving that commitment-and everyone believed them. Now, after the event, we have had the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism suddenly back-pedalling. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism is scratching his head because the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) and others are saying, 'No, no; everything is on the table again.' Yet, interestingly, when you hear some of the concern that is being expressed by people out there in the marketplace, I would have thought that the minister for tourism might have taken those comments fairly seriously. For example, has the minister seen the press release from the Tourism Council Australia headed 'EMDG Scheme must stay-Tourism industry'? It is dated Friday, 19 April 1996 and states: Managing director of Australia's peak tourism body, Tourism Council Australia, Bruce Baird today expressed grave concern about reports the Federal Government was planning to scrap the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme. 'Reports in today's press that the EMDG scheme may be abolished are of great concern to the tourism industry nationally,' Mr Baird said. 'The Coalition gave a commitment to the industry that all operators would be eligible to receive the full grant of 50 per cent rebates under the scheme... ' Mr Baird goes on to say in that press release: The EMDG scheme greatly assists small to medium tourism operators in Australia to compete internationally. He was not alone, because the Hotel Motel and Accommodation Association issued a press release also dated 19 April 1996. Friday, have 19 April must have been a big day because they all must have been panicking in the tourist industry. They could not wait to get to their pes and put out a press release to hop into the government about this. In that press release headed 'Dumping of Export Scheme to Spell Disaster for Tourism' the Hotel Motel and Accommodation Association says: . . . reported threats by the Federal Government to scrap the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme represented a 'kick in the pants' for Australia's biggest and fastest growing industry. That press release goes on to say: Any move to scrap EMOG would also be a bad omen for this Government's attitude to an industry that generates so much income and employment for Australia. That is dead right. Not only would it be a worry for this industry but also it would be a worry for industry generally in this country and would send the wrong signals out about this government's commitment to industry policy. The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia Ltd had similar concerns. In its press release-and, dare I say it, it is dated 19 April, and they were all getting panicked about it at this stage-that organisation stated: Tourism is one of this nation's biggest export earners and it would be devastating for the industry and the Australian economy if the export assistance scheme was abolished. Say no more! The one I like most is the publication Tourism Now put out by Tourism Council Australia. On the front page is a photograph of the managing director, Bruce Baird, with the new Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, our own John Moore. The only person you will not see in the background is the Minister for Finance because he and the managing director did not get on very well in the New South Wales parliament. Mr Latham-The Olympics.",34
117,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, the OlympicsJumping Jack and all that. Mr Baird is quoted in that document as saying: The Minister reinstatedI think it probably means 'restated'the Coalition's agreement to wipe out the discrimination relating to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme (EMOG) as soon as possible. There it is time and time again, both during the election campaign and after it, and now that the coalition is in government it has said, 'The export market development scheme is a great thing and should be extended to the tourism industry. No question about it. It is of great benefit to small business and we are all hairy-chested about small business. That is where all the employment will be created for Australians. Young Australians will benefit from the tourism industry.' They will all go up to the Queensland islands, to the Northern Territory and the electorates of Cowper and Cunningham. They will go allover Australia looking for jobs because the coalition said, 'Small business is where it is at.' Indeed, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs said that this was the engine room of business. Yet in a vital industry for Australia such as tourism, where they are looking to promote themselves because of what is likely to happen over the next few years in this country, where we will see something like 122 million international visitor nights by the year 2000 and something like 6.3 million visitors projected to come by the year 2000 and where 12.4 per cent of Australia's total export earnings have come from the tourist industry, the government is saying, 'Hang on, we might not be able to help you now, we might not be able to say to people in the small business sector of Australia and to those in the tourism industry that we are going to help them to employ people anymore. Forget what we said in the campaign. Forget what our policy is all about. We have had a change of heart.' How do you think they will respond to that? I implore the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to have a chat outside to his senior minister, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, get in his lug and say, 'Read what the supporters are saying. Read what tourism is on about. Read where jobs can be created in small business.' Don't scrap the scheme. The minister should have a talk to his own members on that side of the House who depend on tourism in their own electorates. He should go back and read Undersold overseas, a report by a parliamentary committee in this House. He should ask his own coalition members who were on that committee if they still support extending the grant scheme. The answer is yes. (Time expired)",36
118,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is ironic that I who represents Australia's premier tourist destination should follow the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who has concentrated his remarks on the tourism industry. I want to assure him and the House that I understand and know as much about the tourism industry as anyone in this place. I can assure him that the tourism industry welcomed the election of this government on 2 March. The tourism industry was never given the proper recognition that it deserved by the previous government. In fact, it took a long time, if ever, for the previous government to recognise that the tourism industry is an export industry. They never seemed to come to grips with that very fact. It is ironic members of the Labor Party should be talking about the treatment of the tourism industry under the EMDG scheme, because the previous government discriminated directly against the tourism industry through that scheme. Our proposal was to redress that. We objected to the fact that all other export industries received 50c in the dollar, but for some reason the tourism industry was discriminated against and only received 25c in the dollar. The former government has nothing to crow about in its treatment of the tourism industry. In fact, the tourism industry, comprised as it is of thousands of small businesses, was successful and grew in spite of the former government's efforts. As the debate has recognised, the tourism industry largely comprises small businesses. I was rather surprised that the opposition in raising a matter of public importance should seek to raise the matter of small business. I would have thought that there was something extremely ironic about the opposition deciding to attack the government on that particular issue. The former government had absolutely no credibility at all when it· came to its treatment of small business. What we should be hearing from members of the former government are apologies to the small business sector. We have not heard an apology. There is no hint of contrition from former government members as to how they treated the small business sector for the 13 years that they were in government. That is what we should be hearing. Of all the areas in which the previous government failed the people of Australia, it was its treatment of the small business sector which stood out. That is why we went to the election on 2 March with policies specifically directed and aimed to reinvigorate Australia's small business sector. Obviously, the result of the election on 2 March was an acceptance and an endorsement by the small business sector of those policies. The resounding victory that we received has given us an opportunity to implement those policies. As we look back over 13 years of Labor government of this country and observe the many failures which occurred, we can only that say that they were philosophically bound to big business, big unions and big government. Because of that, of course, they were big failures as well. When the subject of the MPI came up, I was interested to look back to the 1990 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology-the so-called Beddall report.",36
119,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Ah! I bet that was a revelation!,37
120,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Yes. ,37
121,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It did sink without trace and that was the point I was about to make. The member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), who is not in the House today, achieved some notoriety because this House altogether.",37
122,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was one of the two Queensland members of the Labor Party who actually made it back. At least he did get back with a respectable margin. But his committee, the so-called Beddall committee, actually did a pretty good job with this report. I ought to say, a little modestly, that in my former life I made a submission to this committee. My name is here as having made a submission to this committee on behalf of the retail industry of Australia. This report made 66 recommendations to the government of the day which would have assisted small business. As the minister said, how many of those recommendations actually surfaced in government policy? It is very hard to find out, but my recollection is that there were probably no more than 10 out of 66 recommendations of the Beddall committee which actually found their way into government policy. I would suggest to those on the other sideMr Martin-What year did that report come down?",37
123,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This came down in 1990. You had plenty of time to address these recommendations and hardly anything came of it. So I suggest to members opposite that, if they are serious about assisting small business, they can do no worse than go back to the report of that committee which made a lot of recommendations to assist small business. The recommendations were aimed at a number of the issues that the minister raised--capital gains tax reform, for instance. The recommendation of that committee in respect of the rollover provisions was quite clear. It was never picked up, never accepted by the former government; but it has been accepted by this government simply because it is obviously a benefit. This report talks a lot about changes to the wholesale sales tax regime. It talks about the imposition of wholesale sales tax on small business. What was the response to that recommendation? More, not less. ",38
124,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They increased rates of wholesale sales tax and implemented a greater extension of the wholesales sales tax regime. There is mention in this about the need for business deregulation and so on. What did we get from the government instead of an acceptance of the recommendations of this committee? We got just about the opposite all the way down the line. We got increases in wholesale sales tax, and small business had the imposition of the training guarantee levy. Do you remember that little one? It was imposed on us for a few years until business complained so much that the former government took it off. We had the superannuation levy. These sorts of impositions used to be called taxes, but we had this quaint renaming of these things as levies or charges. Over and over again we had new charges, new levies, new taxes on small business. We had more regulation. This report talks about the need for less regulation. What did we have under 13 years of Labor government? We had more and more regulation, more forms to fill out, more paperwork, more 'I'm from the government; I'm here to help you.' That is the sort of approach the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) espoused today. But that is not our approach. It has not worked. The last thing business wants to hear is those lines ringing in their ears: 'I'm from the government; I'm here to help ,you.' Our approach, as the Minister for Small  has already said today, in the formation of the task force that was announced last week is to really get to the point where those soits of impositions on small business can be lifted. If we can take the shackles off small business, if we can remove those sorts of requirements and impositions, then small business can get on with the job of doing what it does best: making products, providing services, making profits, ultimately adding to our national wealth and more importantlyMr Bilison-Employing people.",38
125,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, employing people. That is what the small business sector is all about. Wasn't it interesting-and it must be embarrassing for you people opposite-to hear the minster talk about the fact that in 13 years of Labor government 200,000 jobs were actually lost, 200,000 people were sacrificed by the government, because it neglected the small business sector. The minister reminded us of the famous words of the former Prime Minister about this being as good as it gets. But it was actually worse than that. The more insulting thing that he said to small business people in the economic climate that existed at the time was, 'If you can't make a profit, well, go and get a job.' That was the ultimate insult to people in the small business sector. ",38
126,Mr BRADFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They could not get a job, for a start, because there were no jobs available. Most people working in the small business sector were already working 60, 70 or 80 hours a week just to try to make ends meet. It is, as I said, quite ironic that the opposition should come into this place today with what they call a matter of public importance and pretend to speak on behalf of the small business sector. Rather than such a pretence, they should be coming in here and apologising to the small business sector for the damage that they did to it over 13 years. NA",38

NA NA Motion (by Mr Cadman) agreed to: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration: Ministers of State Amendment Bi111996; Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1996; Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment Bill 1996; and Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1996. TELSTRA (DILUTION OF PUBLIC OWNERSInP) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 May, on motion by Mr Warwick Smith: That the bill be now read a second time.",39
128,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE,"The Telstra Bill is a bad, bad piece of legislation. Every Labor Party member in this House of Representatives and in the other place has a direct mandate from their electors to vote against it-and vote it down we will. I promised the people of Werriwa before the last election that if they returned me to the Australian parliament I would vote against the privatisation of Telstra. Today I fulfil that promise, as my colleagues do for their constituents. This is a bad piece of legislation because it seeks to water down the parliament's support for and commitment to universal service provision in telephony. Until now, Australia - has had a system whereby no matter where you live-in the bush, the provincial centres, or the capital cities-all Australians are treated the same. All Australians are basically treated as equals on their basic telephone service. There are universal rental charges, universal installation costs, universal service charges, universal call rates and universally untimed local calls. Shamefully, this bill seeks to water down the parliament's commitment to universality. The ideal--the great Australian ideal-that no matter the tyranny of distance, no matter where Australians live, we are all entitled to the basic services associated with a civilised society. In this respect I draw the attention of the House to clause 8CM(1)(b) on page 48 of the bill: (1) The Parliament re-affirms its intention:· (b) that the universal service obligations described in section 288 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable; They are new words added to a clause that had stood for five years in the Telecommunications Act 1991. This government's bill seeks to link the universal service obligations of Telstra to the efficiency and economic position of those willing to pay. It seeks to link the universal service obligations of Telstra to this definition of being delivered 'efficiently and economically' by Telstra. This is a downgrading, a watering down, of the parliament's historic commitment to universal service obligations being fulfilled, full stop. The commitment was not that those obligations be fulfilled with a condition linked to the efficiency and economic position of Telstra, or according to some qualification as to whether or not Telstra was willing to pay those universal service obligations, but fulfilled full stop. Those obligations were to be fulfilled without a condition, without any economic or financial qualification. It is shameful that this government, through this legislation, is seeking to water down that commitment. The Labor Party opposes that rider. It opposes that qualification. It opposes that opportunity for private owners and foreign owners of Telstra to get out of their universal service obligations. If, in their assessment, the universal service obligation is not efficient or economically practical, they will say that they do not want to fund it. That is what this provision in the legislation allows them to do. It is the great get-out clause for the benefit private owners and foreign owners of Australia's great public asset-Telstra. It is the first time that these universal service obligations have been linked to financial considerations. It is the first time that their delivery has been linked to the willingness to pay on the part of Telstra. This will allow private and foreign investors buying into Telstra to water down their commitment to rural and regional Australia. I would seriously ask members opposite who hold some of the electorates which are receiving large cross-subsidies from Telstraelectorates which are the major beneficiaries of universal service obligations-to reconsider their support for this legislation. I would ask the Independent member for Calare (Mr Andren) to look at the $3.3 million subsidy his electorate receives because of the universal service obligation. He should ask himself, 'Will a private owner or a foreign owner of Telstra regard the payment of $3.3 million to Calare in isolation as efficient?' 'Will they regard that cross-subsidy as economically feasible?' They will not. It will be withdrawn. The new member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) should look at the $3 million subsidy paid to his electorate and ask, 'Will a foreign owner regard that as efficient, as economically feasible, under this legislation?' They will not regard it as efficient or economically feasible. It is not in their economic interests. The subsidy will be withdrawn. So will the $5.8 million that is being paid to the electorate of Farrer, represented by none other than the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Someone who says he is wanting to defend and lead the interests of the people from the bush is actually being party to the withdrawal of $5.8 million of public money from his electorate for telephone services. The list goes on. The sum of $13.5 million goes to the electorate of Gwydir represented by the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson). No foreign owner will say that that is efficient or economically feasible, that it is in their economic interests to pay a subsidy of that amount. The new member for Page (Mr Causley) should look at the $1.7 of million subsidy his electorate receives and consider how foreign owners will examine its efficiency, its economic feasibility. The same applies to the electorate of Paterson, which receives a public subsidy of $1.1 million. The electorate of Bendigo-one of the important regional centres in the state of Victoriareceives a public subsidy of $1.1 million. The electorate of Gippsland, represented by another National Party member, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) receives a $4.5 million subsidy. The returned member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) should ask whether or not the $2.3 million in public subsidies for telephone services in her electorate will be viewed by private and foreign owners as efficient. Why would the business houses of Zurich, New York and London regard the payment of $2.3 million of Telstra money-what they would see as their money-to the electorate of MCEwen in Victoria as efficient? Of course, they will not. It will be withdrawn. It is the same in the state of Queensland. The new member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) should look at the $4.2 million of subsidy for his electorate. In the electorate of Dawson the new member should look at the $2.8 million and make sure it is not stolen away by private and foreign owners who say it is not efficient and economically feasible. The electorate of Herbert has a subsidy of $1.7 million. In the electorate of Kennedy it is $10.8 million. In Maranoa it is $16.5 million. In the electorate of O'Connor, represented by Wilson Tuckey, it is $27.4 million. In the electorate of Grey it is $21.5 million. I refer to the electorate of Bass, the electorate of the minister at the table, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith). He has just been returned by the people of Bass. What is the first piece of legislation he brings before the House of Representatives? It is a bill which threatens $2.8 million of public money for telephone services that provide the universal service obligation for the lasting benefit of people in his electorate. Shame on you, Minister, for bringing this legislation to the House to threaten the interests and the living standards of people in your electorate. In the seat of Northern Territory a massive subsidy of $9.6 million is now at risk because no private owner and no foreign investor in Telstra would regard the payment of nearly $10 million of their money to the Northern Territory as efficient or as financially feasible. In this debate the Labor Party-I hope we get to the consideration in detail stage-will be moving for the deletion of those words. Those words about efficiency and economic feasibility did not feature in the 1991 legislation. They should not be in this bill. There was no reason for the government to change the words that were evident in the 1991legislation to slip that clause in, other than its intention to give foreign and private investors an alibi by which they can withdraw public subsidies from rural and regional Australia. If the minister at the table thinks that that is not the case, he should withdraw the words. He should support the Labor Party's amendment. If he stands up in his response and says that they are not intending to withdraw any of these subsidies and levels of support for rural and regional Australia, he would know full well that the words are not needed. The universal service obligations do not need to be linked to issues of efficiency and economic feasibility seen through the eyes of Telstra's private and foreign owners. If that is the case, the government should support that Labor Party amendment at the consideration in detail stage. The government presently subsidises the losses of rural and provincial services on telephony. Privatisation will mean increases in the annual cost of a telephone line in New South Wales of between $200 and $3,500. In Victoria it will be between $200 and $1,800, in Queensland between $200 and $2,500, in South Australia between $400 and $6,800, and in Western Australia between $500 and $4,200. The minister is going to force the residents of his state of Tasmania, including those in his own electorate, to pay somewhere - between an additional $500 and $5,000 for their telephone line. This is hardly surprising when one looks at the international experience. No-one should think that these things would be happening in Australia by precedent. No-one should think that these things would be a surprise only under Australian conditions. In the United Kingdom in the first eight years of privatisation local call prices rose by· 27 per cent and the cost of domestic household phone installation increased by more than 60 per cent. The precedents are there in the United Kingdom and New Zealand for those who can least afford to lose their subsidy straight away to have prices go up, to have charges go up and to have telephone costs go through the roof. The great losers in this are the households of regional Australia. The households of regional Australia, by and large, if the truth be known, supported this government on 2 March on a promise that they would have enhanced living standards. The first major legislation of this government hits them in the neck by leaving open the great gaping loophole in this legislation by which their universal service obligation for telephony can be withdrawn by private and foreign investors. It also hits hard on the small business sector in rural and regional Australia. Remember all those promises about support for the small business sector. If one believed the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during the election campaign, by now, two months after the election, every small business in Australia should be a thriving medium sized business. Such was his high level of expectation for that part of the economy. His first major piece of legislation is kicking small business in the guts. It is kicking small business in rural Australia well and truly in the guts because they will be one of the great losers out of this legislation. As the universal service obligations and the public subsidies are withdrawn from regional Australia, it is those small businesses that can least afford to meet the increased costs. They are the small businesses that can least afford to pay their bills to Zurich, London, Berlin and the great business houses of the world as a product of foreign ownership in Australia's telephone company. As these subsidies are withdrawn, they go straight into the coffers of foreigners. Out of it what safeguards are left in the legislation? Say I am wrong in presenting these things and a few months from now, if the legislation was to be passed, the minister decides that he wants to reverse the provisions by directive to Telstra.1t could say, 'Look, we are not going to have any of this. We are still the majority shareholder for the time being. We are not going to withdraw any of these subsidies from rural and regional Australia.' Shamefully, the power of ministerial directive to Telstra is lost in this bill because it is being abolished. Not only are they taking away the public subsidies and the universal service obligation by virtue of this loophole, they are even taking away the opportunity for a diligent and compassionate minister to direct Telstra not to do those things. They are taking away the power of ministerial directive. All the new members who have joined the House should be aware that if you take away the power of the minister you also take away the power of the parliament. If the minister is not responsible for these things, he cannot be held accountable in this House or in the Senate. So as they take away the universal service obligations, the public subsidies and the ministerial directives, so they seriously diminish the authority and power of this parliament. It is a disgrace. It should not be tolerated the parliament. All those members who have come here purporting to represent rural and regional Australia should reject this legislation. They should look at their universal service obligations in their electorate through the eyes of foreigners. They should look at their public subsidies through the eyes of Zurich bankers. They should look at their public subsidies and the needs of their electorate as the foreign investors would. If they look that way, they can· draw only one conclusion-that is, if they are good representatives for their electorate, they will vote down this legislation and, at the very least, support the Labor Party's amendment in the consideration in detail stage. It is not only living standards which will be damaged by this legislation but also employment, jobs-jobs lost indirectly in regional Australia through higher costs for small business, higher telephone costs for all those small business operators in the provincial cities and rural towns. Punishing small business is the hallmark of this government's first major piece of legislation. Also, jobs will be lost directly from Telstra. Again, as we look to the overseas experience, New Zealand Telecom shed two-thirds of its jobs between 1987 and 1995. British Telecom lost half its jobs as a result of privatisation. Yesterday, in another debate, I mentioned how I was so amused in the mid-1980s by the Reagan administration's motto in the United States. They had this curious idea: arm to disarm. It reminds me of what has become the catch cry, the hallmark, of the Howard government: sack to employ. They have this funny idea that somehow in Australia you can reduce the unemployment rate by sacking 30,000 public servants. They have this funny idea that you can reduce the unemployment rate by partially privati sing Telecom, knowing full well the overseas experience shows it sheds jobs. Sack to employ is the curious motto of the Howard government and no-one in this parliament should be supporting it. Through this legislation there will be not only direct job losses to Telstra itself but also a genuine body blow to the electronics and telecommunications industry in Australia. by These equipment and service industries are Australia's great success stories. Export sales of equipment grew from $50 million in 1983 to $970 million just last year, and they are forecast to grow to $1 Y2 billion by the year 2000. This success has been built on the basis of Telstra's support of local content in its domestic network and its championing of industry policy needs. There is no doubt that foreign and private investors will abandon those industry policy aspects of Telstra's operation. At the moment, Telstra purchases $2.5 billion each year from local companies. Australia's electronics and telecommunications finns make more than 50 per cent of their sales to Telstra-not in total, but each and every one. Each and every one of Australia's electronics and telecommunications companies-a lot of them small to medium sized businesses emerging onto the national and international arena-make more than 50 per cent of their sales to Telstra. All of that will be lost. If we look across the Tasman to New Zealand, we see that the advent of privatisation killed their industry dead in the water. So the public interest role of industry policy is lost. As you move from full public ownership to private ownership, you lose public interest considerations. Nothing is more important for this nation's economic future than for Telstra, under full public ownership, to keep a good industry policy in place. Later in the debate the Labor Party will be moving an amendment that 70 per cent of all Telstra purchases be mandated in law to assist local companies-that is, 70 per cent of Telstra purchases would come from Australian firms. The government should support that amendment. A government serious about industry policy and wanting to support Australian industry, one of our great industry success stories, should support that particular amendment. This is also bad legislation because it is ideologically driven. It reflects the coalition's ideological obsessions. I can tell you, as sure as night follows day, that one-third now will be followed by one-third later on and a final third by the end of this decade. A third plus a third plus a third is the full Telstra. This is just the start. This is just the start by a government that is obsessed with ownership. On this side of the House, the Labor Party takes a balanced view about ownership issues in the economy. We support the active role of the public sector as an equalising and civilising force in our society. We also support the growth potential of the private sector. We have no hang-up about ownership issues. We do not always assume that the private sector is best. Sometimes, and certainly in the case of Telstra, the public sector is best. We are interested in market competition. We are interested, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, in market outcomes. We take these things case by case. We take them . industry by industry, market by market. There are four key questions governing privatisation: is the market already competitive; can private capital play the role held by public capital; will the taxpayers have to contribute to the capitalisation of the public enterprise; and is the market structure, its technology and public interest consideration such that public capital can be withdrawn? When the former Labor government applied those four questions to the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, the answers were yes, yes, yes, yes. When we apply the four key questions to the issue of privati sing Telstra, the answers are no, no, no, no. On the first question-is the market already competitive?-of course, in banking and airlines the former Labor government made those markets competitive. In the case of banks it introduced foreign banks, which is a fairly competitive market these days. In the case of airlines, it opened up the skies by making available a third player. Compass made some use of it, while on the international scene open skies are the order of the day. In the case of Telstra we are talking about a market dominator, a firm that is dominating the market to the extent of 90 per cent of market share. In asking about the nature of the market, while we could say that Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were part of a competitive market, it is not the case for Telstra. Telstra is the 90 per cent market force privatisation of in telecommunications. The second question is: can private capital play the role of public capital? It was fairly clear in the operations of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas that there was no great difference between the public interest functions of those enterprises and private sector functions in their particular industries. However, in a big country like ours that relies on universal service obligations delivered and the absolutely critical industry development policies of Telstra, only Telstra in full public ownership can play those roles. Again, there were legitimate reasons, according to the criteria, for the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, but there certainly are not for Telstra. The third question is: will the taxpayers have to contribute to the capitalisation of the public enterprise? There is no doubt that, with regard to the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, the taxpayers were going to have to kick in if the government did not privatise. So it was better to let those capitalisation issues be worked out on the share market rather than hit the Australian taxpayer. But Telstra flush. It is operating so well that no-one in wildest dreams could ever say that the taxpayport er would have to prop up its operations. The fourth question concerns market structure and technology. In banking and the airlines those things have been worked out for a fair while. There was no big technological change that indicated to the public sector that it needed to keep a strategic asset in the It market. But telecommunications is undergoing a revolution in Western civilisation. The information revolution is upon us. It is set to transform the type of information we receive and how we receive it. We all know-and this was commented on in the public debate this week-that 40 years of television has made an important impact public culture and public values. Imagine the sorts of changes that will take place as information superhighway rolls around Auswhen tralia. There will be all sorts of implications for the way in which we receive information. There are big access and equity terms of the information superhighway. Social relations and values will be overby turned. Society will fundamentally change, most commentators in this field now recogshingle nise. That is all the more reason for the public sector to keep its greatest strategic assetSouth Telstra. We should not dispose of a public asset when technology is in a rapid state change. Only when the technology is sorted out will we know what the superhighway They holds for society in terms of public values and issues of access and equity. Only then should ownership issues even be considered, rushed into the parliament, at this early stage of a new government. I liken this decision to off-load Telstra the private sector to an equivalent decision at the time of the Industrial Revolution. If we bills, are now experiencing the information revoluin tion, let us compare the off-loading to a circumstance at the time of the Industrial Revolution. What this government is trying do with Telstra is the equivalent of the Engprivate lish government, five years before George Stephenson invented the passenger train in 1825, going. out and selling its transport corridors. If the government had done that is then, there would not have been the great his national development that that form of transbrought to England and so many other countries, including Australia. The seIling of Telstra is the equivalent situation for the information revolution. The government is selling a great strategic public asset, our stakeholder on the information superhighway, to the private sector for profit. is seIling it to foreign interests that really do not care at all about information access and equity issues in a country like Australia. It makes no sense from that perspective. It is also bad legislation because it reflects on this government's mismanagement-mismanagement of the biII and mismanagement of the economy in general. On election night, on the people of Australia thought they had handed the sale of Telstra to the member for the Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). They were relieved that was not the case, but it was only temporary relief. It turns 'out that it has been put in the hands of the new member for issues in Macarthur (Mr Fahey). The new member for Macarthur-unwanted the people of New South Wales; unwanted as by the private sector when he hung out his for a bit of employment; someone who was described by officials in the New Wales Treasury as being psychologically incapable of making a decision-has been of brought into this place, and what have we got? It is the Fahey bunch allover again. have decided to try to sell Telstra, while at the same time they are trying to change the ground rules, trying to change the market let alone fundamentals. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 1 May, said: to The Federal Government has unveiled a high-risk strategy to scrap Labor's draft telecommunications raising fresh doubts over its capacity to put place legislation required to partially privatise of Telstra Telstra by mid-1997. Here is a government in the hands of the to Fahey bunch trying to raise $8 billion on the capital markets, while sending out a message that it does not yet know the market rules. That is like saying to a farmer, 'Come and buy this parcel of land, and in about two years time the local council will tell you whether or not it has got a rural zoning.' That is like saying to a manufacturing company, 'Come and buy this factory, and in about 12 months time the EPA will tell you the environmental guidelines.' That is the equivalent. This government is saying to companies interested in telecommunications, 'Come over and buy an $8 billion slab of Australia's major public asset, and when we get around to it, when we have a review, we will try and get some legislation through the Senate, and we'll let you know the market rules. We can let you know how it all fits into the market circumstances and whether or not you can make a quid.' No wonder the market is saying, 'Hang on, we're not going to do that. We've lost interest. We think that is mismanagement. We think that's a bungle. We think that's the Fahey bunch moved from the New South Wales parliament to the Commonwealth parliament.' It is a terrible indictment of this government's skill as an economic and financial manager that it is putting at risk the $8 billion it hopes to raise from this privatisation. I would hazard a guess that, now that the market does not know the rules, now that the market does not know the guidelines, the $8 billion is looking a bit skinny. While the old Costello con talks about budget blow-outs, what the government is in fact getting is a budget self-inflicted wound. This is a stab to the government's own heart on the biggest public asset on the Australian table. Mr Bradford- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",39
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for MCPherson. Mr Bradford- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Earlier on, the First Deputy Speaker wamed the House about the use of the words that the member for Werriwa just used in respect of the Treasurer. He needs to take note that the First Deputy Speaker ruled that was unparliamentary language and that he should refrain from using it. He should also refer to the Minister for Finance as the Minister for Finance and not by his surname.",45
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Order! I was not here when the First Deputy Speaker made his ruling. What are the words the honourable member is referring to? Mr Bradford-The member used the words 'Costello con'. They were specifically ruled unparliamentary by the First Deputy Speaker.,45
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,"Order! In that case, the honourable member for Werriwa will withdraw.",45
132,Mr LATHAM,COMMITTEE,"I do, Mr Deputy Speaker. As my time is coming to a close, I repeat that, because this is mismanagement hand over fist, mismanagement of the public purse, and for all the other reasons I have outlined in my speech, I urge members opposite to support the amendment I have circulated and vote down this legislation. If they do, they can truly regard themselves as good representatives of their electorates. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House is of the opinion that the Bill should not be proceeded with, for the following reasons: (1) it represents the start of a process leading to the full privatisation of Telstra; (2) it will lead to a loss of jobs, investment and exports, and the Bill also fails to establish an Australia-first purchasing policy for Telstra; (3) the remittance of profits overseas which will follow enactment will damage Australia's balance of payments; (4) it provides inadequate protection of universal service obligations and preservation of services in regional, rural and remote Australia; (5) the Government's failure to bring outer metropolitan telephone zones into the capital city local call zones; (6) the Government's failure to fulftl its commitment to establish an ISDN service throughout Australia plus establish A and B share categories to monitor foreign ownership; (7) the failure to preserve Ministerial directions and accountability to the Parliament for the delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations; (8) there are much better ways of funding environmental programs than seIling Australia's major public asset; (9) it represents an ideological obsession with ownership issues instead of focussing on the competitive features of the telecommunications market; (10) at a time of rapid technological change in telecommunications, the public sector should continue to hold a major strategic asset Telstra to avoid inequity of access and affordability on the so-termed 'information superhighway' ; (II) with the Government's recent decision to review the 1997 telecommunications regulations it is inappropriate for the Parliament to be considering the sale of Telstra"" .",45
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Macklin-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,46
134,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"MCPherson) (4.39 p.m.- Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been rather enlightening for those of us on this side of the House to hear what the shadow minister for communications, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), considers to be the crux of this debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. It reveals the paucity and illogicality of the reasons for opposition to this measure. I do not know whether the member for Werriwa has read the second reading speech but in it the minister has answered a fair majority of the questions the member posed, and I am sure he will have no difficulty in answering the balance. I suspect that, despite his contention that this is some sort of ideological debate, he is having great difficulty generating any great enthusiasm for opposing the proposal at all. In fact, the member for Werriwa is one of the few members of the opposition who are economically rational. I suspect that in quieter, more reflective moments he would actually support this legislation. I would like to have been a fly on the wall in the opposition party room while this matter was being debated to hear what the member for Werriwa and the shadow cabinet contributed. Having served with the member for Werriwa on a committee, I know that, to his credit, he has often been entirely rational in his pronouncements. He understands the benefits of privatisation. I can only assume from listening to his remarks-remarks which stretched his credibility-that opposition to this legislation will be very thin on the ground. Some of the analogies the member for like Werriwa used were so contradictory that, with some of the points he made, I thought he was arguing for the legislation. He seems to be making the point that because of the vast amount of technology involved, because of the rate of technological change, there is a primary argument for maintaining Telstra in public ownership. That is entirely illogical and a very good reason why we should do exactly the opposite, ensuring Telstra is exposed to and has the opportunity to take full advantage of the change which is occurring in the industry. I must say that I am rather disappointed, particularly after all that has been flowing around on this matter from the opposition and the Australian Democrats about their concerns over the sale of Telstra. But, in one sense, I am pleased because the arguments we heard today are very thin and easily answered. Mr Lee-You'd better start soon.",46
135,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Most of them have been answered by our proposal in detail. The honourable member set out what we call the 'Werriwa test for privatisation'-the four questions. I was trying to write them down as he spoke but I could not quite get them. Apparently it was yes, yes, yes for Qantas, yes, yes, yes for the Commonwealth Bank, but no, no, no for Telstra. That shows even more howMr Lee-What's your position on Australia Post?",46
136,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"You only just got back here, Michael; you just be quiet for a while.",46
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Order! The honourable member for Dobell will cease interjecting. The honourable member for MCPherson will ignore the interjections and will address his remarks through the chair.,46
138,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. It appears from what we have heard here today that this debate will go on for some time in this place, generating a lot of heat but, I suspect, very little light from the opposition. As I said, it is ironic that the member for Werriwa, of all members, should be leading the opposition in this debate. It exposes the extent of the hypocrisy that we are likely to experience in this debate from opposition members, and from the Democrats when this matter goes for debate in the Senate. Despite the attempts of the member for Werriwa to qualitatively differentiate between Telstra, on the one hand, and Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank on the other-on which basis is not entirely clear-the question that needs to be asked-and perhaps the member for Dobell or others could tell us the answer more succinctly and clearly-is what that difference is. Is Telstra more of an Australian icon and somehow more sacrosanct than Qantas or the Commonwealth Bank? Mr Lee-Or Australia Post?",46
139,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"We are not talking about Australia Post in this debate at all. The position of Australia Post is not under discussion. What I would like to hear clearly from the member for Dobell when he gets his chance is: what is the difference? If this is not just a matter of hypocrisy, then let us hear the answer to that question from opposition members when they get up to speak. The former government rushed in, with the support of the Democrats, to privatisation of some of what many other people would have regarded as valuable Australian assets, like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. You do not need to be reminded about how that was sacrosanct from the Labor Party point of view. We were told prior to the election that that would never be sold. Of course, after the election it was a different story. That says heaps about the different sort of approach we have in terms of coming clean with the .Australian people-making clear our intentions before the election and not saying something before the election and coming in after it and doing exactly the opposite. It seems to me that in many respects the debate is being held in something of a vacuum. It almost seems unreal in view of the Labor Party's record on privatisation. The Labor Party is now trying to set up some scenario that would give some credibility to its opposition to the partial sale. As I have said, the sorts of questions posed are not difficult to answer. The member already knows about the guarantees in respect of the one-third, for instance. He poses that as major issue. That question has. been answered and is easily answered. And so it goes on. I can only assume that this was purely an opportunity for the opposition and the Democrats to come up with something, at least one thing, they could grab hold of to maybe win a few votes. But of course that did not succeed. In fact, it is quite clear that the Australian people have given the government a mandate for this legislation, as they have for all the other legislation that we will introduce. This legislation is important and I congratulate the minister for the speed with which it has been brought in-not that there is a rush, but this legislation is important. It is important for a number of reasons which are quite obvious. It honours an election commitment we made. It is interesting that the opposition's questions in question time today actually focused on the government delivering on its election promises. The irony is that the opposition's stance would have exactly the opposite effect. The Democrats talk about keeping us honest, but by opposing this legislation they would actually be creating a situation where we would be dishonest. In introducing this legislation we are honouring a pre-election promise. I remind the opposition that our intention . is to honour our election commitments right down the line. I am anticipating and expecting that that will happen. The previous government's commitment to privatisation, to the extent that they had a commitment, was not based necessarily on economic rationalism, although the member for Werriwa may have seen it in those terms. For many, particularly in the left wing of the Labor Party, it was only a means to an end; they could see the dollars from privatisation. Of course, the result of that was that they saw the Commonwealth Bank, that great Australian asset, and Qantas, our wonderful airline, in effect squandered to pursue some of their social engineering or socialist goals or programs. We saw program after program introduced. What do we have to show for it all after 13 years? We have more debt-not less debt but more debt. There was no rational approach to privatisation by the former government. It was simply an opportunity to grab hold of some dollars. All of that money is gone and more money is gone with the debt that they created. There was public debt in June 1995 of over $100 billion. We, however, are committed to privatisation for the right reasons. That distinction needs be made very clearly. We believe in the benefits of privatisation. We believe that Telstra will be better as a result of partial privatisation. That is the reason for this particular legislation. The former Prime Minister, who had his rational moments-I think he had quite a few irrational ones, too--showed his true colours on Telstra when he admitted on lAteline in June 1994 in answer to the question whether it mattered if Telstra was publicly or privately owned, 'Not of its essence, no,' which in Keating-speak was 'no'. In fact, Mr Keating had already attempted to sell off part of Telstra. During the election campaign it actually came to light that they had a neat little business arrangement going on the side which amounted to a de facto privatisation of part of Telstra. So the former Prime Minister had some tricks up his little sleeve as far as Telstra was concerned. He was caught out during the course of the election campaign with a neat little effort on the side. In fact, I would not have been at all surprised if, had the Labor Party won the election, Mr Keating had come in here-they have done it before-and told us all the good reasons for Telstra to be privati sed, and completely if it comes to that. Our proposal is to privatise only one-third of Telstra. The difficulty the opposition will have is that our approach to privatisation is qualitatively quite different from anything we saw from the former government. Most of us understand that privatisation is internationally accepted as a rational, progressive concept. It is accepted in most countries around the world for obvious reasons. The benefits of smaller government are recognised everywhere, and it is simply a fact that state ownership is the least efficient and most expensive way to deliver services. Of course, it is understood that the government must deliver things which would not otherwise be delivered, but that is not the case in point here at all. In that context, we understand that governments must ensure that people have equal access-the question of rural electorates has been raised-to fundamental services. The provisions are there into this legislation to ensure that that happens. In the couple of minutes remaining, I will look at the other side of the equation. I have mentioned already what had happened to the millions of dollars that the former government had raked in through its privatisation, in many respects for the wrong reasons. We intend to use the proceeds from the one-third sale of Telstra-the $8 billion that is estimated-for entirely proper purposes. Prudent financial management indicates that funds raised from the sale or partial sale of public assets-we do not dispute that we are talking about a valuable public asset-should be used to retire debt or to provide long-term benefits. The basic accounting understanding of that sort of process is clear-that is, if you were going to sell a public asset or a long term asset in a business sense, you would not use those proceeds for recurrent expenditure. That is what you did with the proceeds from previous sales, but our intentions are quite different. We intend to use the bulk of the proceeds from the partial privatisation for the retirement of debt. Let us be very clear about the benefits that that will bring to the Australian economy. If we are to have a stable economy, if we are to have a continuation of low inflation, if we are to have a regime of low iqterest rates and if we are, by virtue of that, to have economic growth and to generate employment, the government debt must be reduced. It is a very worthwhile objective to use the bulk of the proceeds from the one-third sale of Telstra to retire government debt. We are doing exactly the right thing with money that is raised from the disposal of public assets. The amount of $1 billion of the $8 billion is to be used for capital projects-I stress the word 'capital' because that is the operative word in how this money is used-to maintain and replenish Australia's environment infrastructure. When one looks at the list of those projects which are to be funded, one will see that they are all extremely worthwhile: the national vegetation initiative to tackle Australia's land and water degradation problems; the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin, which we heard about in question time today; the undertaking of a national land and water resources audit; the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system; and the coasts and clean seas initiative to tackle the pollution problems in our coastal areas, which is of particular interest to me as I have a valuable coastal electorate in a tourist area. That is not a wish list of any sort. That is our commitment to spend, from the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra, $1 billion on those projects. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made the point very strongly in the parliament-and I can only reiterate-that for the opposition to oppose this legislation would be utter environmental vandalism. I do not believe the opposition will get away with it. I do not believe the opposition or the Democrats in particular, who seem to have locked themselves totally into a comer on this, will get any credibility in the electorate when it comes to voting against that expenditure of $1 billion on those particular capital projects. My electorate needs that money. My electorate needs those projects, particularly the coasts and clean seas initiative. Let us hear exactly why from the opposition and from the Democrats, which will be even more enlightening, I suspect.",47
140,Mr REID,COMMITTEE,I wouldn't count on it.,49
141,Mr BRADFORD,COMMITTEE,"Perhaps the member for . Bendigo is right. Knowing the Democrats' performance, we perhaps should not count on it. It will be interesting to hear what they have to say in opposition to this: how they can argue against the sale of Telstra; how they can argue against using the proceeds for the right purposes, for debt retirement and for expenditure on capital projects; and how they will qualitatively justify their opposition to that, given the support they gave to the sale of the Federal Airports Corporation, Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and so the list goes on. The opposition must answer that question. It should make it entirely clear to us why it is prepared to oppose this sale, other than because of some sudden ideological shift, some change of mind, since the election. Before the election privatisation was a good thing on your side, even if it was for the wrong reasons. Now, suddenly, you have decided for some reason that you should oppose it. I have not had a chance to look at the opposition amendments. They have only just been handed to me. No doubt they will be the focus of the debate by the members who follow. Let me summarise: the privatisation of one-third of Telstra will make Telstra better. Let there be no doubt about our intentions in that respect. It will mean better phone services. Just in passing, as if we owe anything to what used to be Telecom! Until Telecom got a hint of competition, telephone call charges in Australia were the highest in the world and the service was lousy. It was not until Telecom got a bit of competition that it got its act even half together. There is a long way to go and no-one can argue that Telstra does not need to be improved. It has given notoriously bad service. It has constantly underperformed, despite the enthusiasm the member for Werriwa had when talking about the profits it has generated. In terms of the capital that is employed, Telstra is underperforming. Our proposal will improve it. Telstra will be better and Australia will be better as a result. I commend the legislation to the House.",49
142,Mr LEE,COMMITTEE,"The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) was very unwise in seeking to attack the Labor Party for allowing Telstra to develop a joint venture with mM and Lend Lease Australia, commonly known as the ISSe joint venture. This issue was notoriously raised by the Liberal Party 10 days out from the election. The reason the honourable member for MCPherson was rather foolish to raise it today is that his Treasurer (Mr Costello) promised that that joint venture would not proceed. The now Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, said that he would direct the board of Telstra to block the joint venture. Within a month of coming to power, what happens? Embarrassingly, Senator Alston has to put out a press release late at night-hoping that no-one would pick it uannouncing that he has approved the mMLend Lease joint venture. The member for MCPherson was not the wisest backbencher in town to have brought up the infamous ISSC joint venture. Perhaps the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, could explain to us what was the rush of information that persuaded the Liberal Party that the mM joint venture, which was asset stripping of Telstra before the election, suddenly became a positive deal for Telstra. I am going to go through a series of issues in this debate that I would like the minister at the table to answer in his summing up. I know from past experience that the advisers in the box provide the minister at the table with very detailed notes of the points that we in opposition make in these speeches. I would like the minister to go through, point by point, the issues we are going to raise this afternoon, in addition to the many issues already raised by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). The first thing is: will the minister tell us why he did a backflip on ISSC, the venture that was asset stripping and suddenly became a good deal for Australia? The second point I would like to raise is the attempt by the member for MCPherson to argue that, if ever you support any privatisation, you must support all privatisations. If the Labor Party supported privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, it must therefore support all privatisations. That is the privatisation path. ridiculous argument that he has put to the chamber this afternoon. If he is foolish enough to put that argument to us on this side of the House, why are the Liberal Party and the National Party not also arguing for the privatisation of Australia Post? The reason they are not arguing for the privatisation of Australia Post is that, according to Tim Fischer, at the moment for this parliamentthey are not sure about the next parliamentthey are saying that Australia Post should not be privati sed. They are also saying that two-thirds of Telstra should not be privatised. So the suggestion that, if they support the privatisation of any part of anything, they must support privatisation of anything is just plain ridiculous. The reason why Telstra and Australia Post are different is that they are essential utilities providing essential services to the public. Much as I like, as a customer of the Commonwealth Bank, to stay with the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Bank has only about 20 per cent of the market in banking in Australia. Telstra has about 90 per cent of the telecommunications market when you factor in local, mobile, international and long distance calls. Certainly, if you look at the barriers to entry, they are much higher in telecommunications than they are in any of the other industries we have discussed; just as in postal services the baniers for entry are much higher as well. For all of those reasons, we in the Labor Party strongly oppose this measure which seeks to privatise Telstra. That is the first point to make. My colleague the member for Werriwa made the point that in every other country where they have gone down the Liberal Party path of privatisation of their telecommunications company there have been massive job losses. He mentioned the figures. Two-thirds of the jobs were lost in New Zealand Telecom; half the jobs were lost in the United Kingdom. I would like the minister at the table in his summing up to tell the people who now work for Telstra how many of them are going to lose their jobs as a result of the Liberal Party pushing Telstra down the partf We have already had Mr Blount on TV softening up the company for major reductions in the number of staff, and we would like to know: what is the government's target for Telstra? How many staff does the government think Telstra should have? Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, keeps talking about international comparisons and making a bogus comparison of statistics on the number of lines for every staff member. If you follow down those statistics, then it means you are going to have many fewer people working for Telstra than is the case today. I would like the minister at the table to tell us in his summing up: is he going to blindly adopt and apply the number of lines for an employee that they have managed to follow in European countries or in countries that are much smaller, that do not have the vast rural distances that we have in Australia and that do not have the smaller exchanges that we have in electorates such as Bass? It is ridiculous to say that we should have the same number of lines per employee in a country the size of Australia as there are in Luxembourg, Belgium or some other country that should not be compared to Australia. I am pleased that the member for Bass is the minister at the table today because one of the crucial issues that the Liberal Party have made in this whole debate is to say that they are putting a limit on foreign investment. Only 35 per cent of the shares that are getting sold off, that is, 11 per cent in total of Telstra share ownership, will be able to be bought by foreigners. The reason I find this interesting is that the member for Bass had a very different view on this particular issue in days gone by. The member for Bass was quoted in the paper some time ago as saying there should no longer be rigid foreign investment controls on Telstra. I would like the minister at the table to tell us: does he still have the view that 'there should no longer be rigid foreign investment controls on Telstra', or does he now subscribe to the commitments that were made in his second reading speech that only 11.6 per cent of Telstra will be owned by foreign shareholders? The next point I would like the minister to explain to us on foreign ownership is: what happened to the class A and B shares that we heard so much about in the election campaign? In the election campaign the Liberal Party said that to make sure that we have no more than 11.666 recurring of the shares in foreign hands, we will actually have a different type of share category and the shares can be traded in different areas on the stock exchange-class A shares for Australians only, class B shares for the foreigners-and the different categories will guarantee that the limits are never exceeded. Somewhere between the election campaign, the swearing in and the preparation of this bill the class A and B shares have been washed down the drain. We on the Labor Party side would like to know why you have abandoned the proposal for class A and B shares. We all know that the Qantas share register has got into difficulty because the government can never guarantee that foreigners or the representatives of foreigners are not buying the shares of companies after they are privatised. That is why the Liberal Party said they were going to have class A and class B share registers. Please explain to us why the Liberal Party has broken that promise and why it has breached faith with the Australian people in not having the class A and class B share system. The thing that really outrages me is the line that has been circulated in the past by the former coalition spokesman on privatisationnot the member for Bass; in a past role he had that job, but he was able to pass on the torch of responsibility to the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) who, some would say, did a better job than him. One of the lines that the member for Mackellar has used is that, by privati sing Telstra, the 'mums and dads' of Australia can own it. I am sure you have all heard that once or twice on talk-back radio: that privatisation is the only way you can ensure that the mums and dads can own Telstra. But that completely misleads the people of Australia. The mums and dads of Australia already own Telstra-and their parents and grandparents have been paying for Telstra for 100 years through their telephone bills. That is what has built Telstra; that is what has built this network right across the country. To suggest that, in some way, the Australian people do not own Telstra until it is privatised is a complete and absolute misleading of the Australian people. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that many of the investments that have been made over the last 100 years by Telstra, and by Telecom and the PMG in the days before Telstra existed, were uneconomic. Many of the investments made in the electorate of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) would not have been made if Telstra had been a private telephone company that only made investments where it could get a particular return on those investments. Many of the construction projects that have been undertaken right throughout Tasmania, including in the electorate of Bass, would never have been made if AT&T had owned Telstra. That is because once you move to a privately owned Telstra, it will only be making investments that provide it with an adequate commercial return, ones that will give it a that is better than all the other ways it can invest their money. At least when Telstra was a lOOper cent publicly owned utility, the government ultimately was responsible if people in the bush did not get an adequate service. People would get up in the Senate and attack me and other former ministers if we were not able to deliver on equality of service. We had to answer to the parliament if people in rural provincial Australia could not get the service to which they were entitled. It becomes a very different issue when it is fully privatised-and even when it is part privatised, because as soon as you go down that path of part privatisation the government ceases to be able to direct Telstra on what it should do. In fact, the government have admitted this. They have deleted the provision that allows the minister to direct Telstra. The difficulty they are going to face-and the Liberal Party knows it-is that, by retaining two-thirds of the shares in government hands, they create the impression for the National Party, the National Farmers Federation and other people that, in some way, the government can still protect people in the bush who are going to have their services placed at risk. But anyone who studied what happened in the AIDC, where only 20 per cent of the shares were sold, knows that under the Corporations Law once you have a significant private shareholding, even though it is a minority private shareholding, the government ceases to be able to direct the company on what it should do. The majority shareholder, the government, cannot oppress the minority shareholders. So even though the government will have two-thirds of the shares in Telstra, under Corporations Law it will not be able to intervene in the affairs of the company. I would like the minister to tell us whether or not that is a fact, because in the second reading speech he made the following statement: Since 1991 Telstra has been a Corporations Law company with an independent board of directors, bound by that law to act in the best interests of the company. This will continue to be the case ... That very sentence--that Telstra will continue return to be bound by Corporations Law-means that the board of Telstra will answer to those minority shareholders: the board of Telstra will answer to the 33 per cent of the shares that are privately owned, and the two-thirds of the shares that are in the hands of the people of Australia, through the Commonwealth of Australia, will have no say on what happens in Telstra. Sure, there is page after page of assurances and that let the minister request information. There is page after page of provisions that ensure the minister can request reports or briefings. But, after the minister gets all that information, can he or she do anything? The answer is that, no, they cannot because, under Corporations Law, the majority shareholders cannot oppress the minority. So as soon as we sell off a third of the shares of Telstra, the board will answer to those minority shareholders. That is going to be a problem because in the bush, in rural and provincial Australia, the cost of providing services is much more than the revenue Telstra receives for them. I can assure the House that the statistics are really quite frightening. In the electorate of Maranoa, for example, if the consumers there have to pay the real cost for their services they are going to be paying an extra $3,300 each year for their telephone service. And the electors of Capricornia will be paying an extra $1,000 each year for their telephone service. That is how much the cost exceeds the current revenue. In Ceduna, in the electorate of Grey, people will be paying an extra $6,800 for benefit. their service, and in Bendigo the cost will be an extra $2,300 a year. It is not going to happen tomorrow. It not happen next week. It will not even happen in January 1997. But everyone in this House should know that, as soon as you head down the path of part privatisation, it is inevitable that the user-pays principle will be adopted right across the country. And, yes, business will get discounts. If you are a big company that buys a lot of telecommunications services in the capital cities and the CBDs, your prices will go down. But the people who live in bush and in the rural and provincial cities the ones who will pay the price. They will the people who will no longer get the crossAustralians subsidies from the people who make the in the CBD. The economic rationalists like the member for Bass are quite happy for people to pay for the real cost of their telephone services. They think that is a good thing. They think the businesses in the capital cities should discounts, that they should only pay the much cheaper real costs of their calls. But the that will be paid by people in the electorate of O'Connor, and in outback electorates around Australia, is that prices for them will increase year by year by year. Inevitably, prices will become unaffordable for large numbers of Australians throughout the counBass try. I see the honourable member for Calare Andren) is in the chamber. I can let him know that his constituents in Bathurst will paying, on average, an extra $1,900 because disorderly. that is the real cost of providing telephone services to the electors of Calare. That is amount by which the cost exceeds enue that is now received by Telstra in the electorate of Calare. One of the reasons why the Liberal Party were able to get this meaSure up in opposition was that they conned the National Party- They conned the National Party, and people like the member for O'Connor, that there would be that some good things that would flow from a part privatisation of Telstra. In provincial electorates--even in South Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker-they said that constituents would The way they were able to get the National Party and the rural Liberal members on the will hook was to say that John Howard made a promise to the National Farmers Federation. It was a promise that said, 'Wherever you have a telephone anywhere in Australia, we will give you the ability to convert that to ISDN,' the high speed data links, 'by 1 July 1997.' He got a few good headlines out of that. What he did not explain to the National Party or to the rural Liberals is that that is either, firstly, a promise that can never be the kept-therefore, they have been conned--or, are secondly, it is going to bankrupt Telstra to be deliver the promise. Even if only one in four take up ISDN, that is a $4 billion calls promise-a $4,000 million promise. Frank Blount has already been on television saying that the Liberal Party promise is going to 'distort the financials of the company', so we would like the minister at the table to tell us: is the Liberal Party going to stick to the get promise that was made by Mr Howard in his speech to the National Farmers Federation? price He can tell us across the table now. The member for Bass can tell us right now: will right John Howard keep his promise to deliver ISDN right across Australia by 1 July 19977 the Silence. I know it would have been out of order for him to reply, but the member for has interjected across the table once or twice in his II-year parliamentary career. I (Mr am a bit shocked that for some reason he is unable to even answer yes or no across the be table today, even though it would have been",49
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Mr Andrew)the The member for Dobell will direct his rethe revmarks through the chair.,53
144,Mr LEE,COMMITTEE,"I am glad you did not reply to the invitation either, Mr Deputy Speaker. But it is a crucial point. The Prime Minister got the National Party on the hook by promising ISDN right across the country. It is either a promise that will not be met or it is a promise is going to 'distort the financials of the company' . So what is the Liberal Party going to do? Is it going to keep the promise or is it going to allow the National Party to be absolutely fooled by all these things? The final point I want to make is that Telstra is crucial to the maintenance and further development of a top class telecommunications manufacturing industry in Australia. In a decade, it has gone",53
145,Mr LEE,COMMITTEE,"The member for Chifley has been on the record for many years as being one of the industry's strongest supporters. It is an industry that has grown from $50 million-when the member for Chifley was first elected and wanted to introduce reforms in this area-to today exporting more than $800 million worth of exports for Australia right around the world. The reason why that industry has grown is that Telstra and Optus and Vodafone are buying more than 70 per cent of their equipment from Australian factories. They might be owned by multinationals, but they employ Australian workers in the factories and Australian engineers to do the software. It will one of the most important growth industries for Australia in future days. If you privatise Telstra-one-third today, 50 per cent in a couple of years' time, 100 per cent by the end of the century-we are going to see the new owners of Telstra no longer sourcing from Australian manufacturers. What will come first is price-not industry development, not job creation and not the opportunity to develop a world-class IT industry for Australia. All of that will be placed at risk the path that the Liberal Party is now treading. So we expect detailed answers from the minister at the table on all of those issues. are going to do all we can to make the Liberal Party members and the National Party members explain to us why they are not prepared to ensure that this House has a guarantee that there will be no charges for directory assistance. We want you to tell us why you cannot expand the local call zones in capital cities, expand the number of people who are entitled to community call rates, because of the growth that is taking place around the capital cities. You can explain to us why you have walked away from all of the promises you have made about class A and B shares, about providing ISDN to people right across the bush and, ultimately, how you can make sure that people who live in rural and provincial Australia are not the big losers from this privatisation measure.",54
146,Mr REID,COMMITTEE,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996, because it became a major issue in the 1996 election campaign. In fact, it should be called the 'Telstra Public Opportunity Bill', because what it will do is provide the opportunity for the public to purchase shares-all the mums and dads that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) referred to. It will give the mums and dads and the employees the opportunity to participate in the shareholding of a fine company. That company, of course, will be retained as a separate entity. It will not, as the former government decided, be sold off in little bits and pieces on the way to their objective. In be fact, only one-third of those shares in the sale of Telstra will be sold to the mums and dads and employees in Australia, so it is an opportunity. The former Prime Minister thought that he was on a winner when he came to Bendigo during the last federal election campaign. He visited the headquarters of Telstra and held a media conference out in the backyard. He was not game to hold it out in the front street, because he knew that there had been another by media conference called on the other side of the road, where a point of view could be put which would lead to some debate over the issue. So he took the media to the back of the We building. He skulked around to the back of the building and held the media conference around there so that it would not be open to scrutiny by me and other local members. It is an extraordinary thing that people in the Telstra organisation in Bendigo were whipped into a fury by some of the telecommunications unions to have a couple of demonstrations during the campaign, both of which I was not invited to attend. But it is funny, because I have friends in the Telstra organisation and they did let me know that those demonstrations would be held. Naturally, I sought the opportunity to address the employees of the Telstra organisation during those rallies and was able to put a point of view to them that there would be an opportunity for the Telstra employees to participate in the ownership of this fine organisation that they work for. I had a number of after hours calls on my home phone number from interested Telstra employees wishing to purchase the shares. This is the thing that really sticks in the of the Australian Labor Party. They cannot abide the thought that people would want to take out shares and participate in the equity and ownership of an organisation that they are proud to work for. It is in the interests of the opposition to keep them down-do not allow them to have a shareholding, that would be the last thing you would want them to do. They might start to understand a bit more about the organisation and want to invest in it. I have had a number of approaches from people who have wanted to be shareholders, and who still will want to have shares, in the organisation. They are looking forward to it. In fact, a number of them are wanting us to get this legislation through as quickly as possible. They want it to be passed through this chamber and then go to the Senate to be passed so that they can participate in the benefits of being a shareholder and have equity in the company for which they work. There have been very strong undertakings by the government and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to limit the individual foreign.ownership in Telstra. Foreign ownership will be limited to 1.667 per cent, that is, five per cent of the non-Commonwealth equity in Telstra. That is important because we want to retain as much Australian ownership of this company as possible. By retaining Australian ownership of this company, we will be able to do the very thing that the member for Dobell said would not be done, and that is ensure that Australian companies who produce componentry and technical gear for Telstra have the opportunity to provide and to continue to provide for it. I am disappointed to see the member for Dobellieaving the chamber, skulking out and not staying until I answer some of the issues that he raised. The member for Dobell raised a number of issues which need answering. He pretended that the Labor Party, when in government, were concerned about rural and remote phone services and other communications services being supplied by Telstra. I can assure the House that I wrote to the former Minister for Communications and the Arts, throat the member for Dobell' on many occasions, asking him to look at Telstra and to look at the zoning system around the city of greater Bendigo. In fact, I wrote to Mr Frank Blount, the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra, on many occasions about the zoning. There are areas within the city of greater Bendigo that have to pay SID calls into their service centre. Whereas local Bendigo residents pay only 25c for a three-minute call, the residents of areas like Heathcote, Metcalfe and Elmore, surrounding areas which are all within the city of greater Bendigo, have to pay 51c for a three-minute SID call. I wrote to the former minister on many occasions and to the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra to try to do something about it. I got a negative 'response on each occasion. It was totally negative. Now the opposition has brought in an amendment-after 13 years of being in government, and after 13 years of neglect of telecommunications in rural and regional areas-which fails to recognise rural and regional areas. Amendment No.5 of the opposition amendments points out the government's failure to bring outer metropolitan telephone zones into the capital city local call zones. Their focus is on, and their concerns are about, outer metropolitan telephone services. The concerns are not about rural and regional areas, which our government represents and will continue to represent. There is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done in improving the services to rural and regional areas. The former minister said that the cost of doing these would be extraordinarily high. He. obviously has not kept up with the technology that has been implemented over the last few years, otherwise he would know that the cost factor bears little or no relationship to the charges that Telstra makes. There is an enormous amount of fibre optic cable in the ground now, and the services can be provided at a fraction of the cost at which they were provided several years ago. The technology has galloped on. There is much to be done in that area. There was further hypocrisy from the former minister for communications when he talked about privatisation. Where were the previous government when the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank was at issue? This was the icon that they held up as something that they would never sell over the dead bodies of their former leaders. Their former leaders would be twisting and turning in their graves if they knew about its privatisation. Yet it took only half an hour before a budget speech for this to eventuate. Some of the members of the former government did not even know that the Commonwealth Bank was going to be privati sed until the Treasurer walked into the chamber. They had no compunction at all about privati sing the Commonwealth Bank. They had no compunction about privatising Qantas. They had none at all about the Federal Airports Corporation. Yet they come into this House today, after 13 years of neglect of telecommunications, and try to put up a phoney amendment rejecting the appropriate legislation which we put before the House to try to improve telecommunications services in this country. As I indicated to the House, I will be pursuing the Minister for Communications and the Arts with the view that there is a need for further expansion of rural and regional telephone services. Of course the new shareholders, when this bill goes through, will have an input into the affairs of Telstra. Obviously, in place. they will be looking for more customers. They can see that, if the telecommunications system in regional areas is improved, it will lead to improved revenue for any number of services which are currently not available to people in regional areas. You can operate your business now in any part of Australia, providing you have access to communications services. In many areas of the Bendigo electorate people do not have access to itemised billing. They get an account, but there is no itemised billing on that account. They do not know what the charges are for. At the bottom of the bill is a bulk figure, a certain amount, and they do not have any idea what it comprises. You cannot run a business in that manner. The opportunity for Telstra to provide those itemised billing accounts will generate more business and more reVenue. These days, with the access we have to communications networks both here and overseas, you can run any type of business anywhere. If you have access to the communications network-fax, video, or whatever you need; access to all the international services-you can operate a business anywhere. That technology is available, but it is not available to people in many regional areasfor example, Bendigo. Many people in regional areas do not have those services. That is an area the new shareholders will be interested in. They know that there is competition in the telecommunications field. That telecommunications competition is going to increase over the next few years. For Telstra to retain its market share, it will have to look at every opportunity. This also applies to mobile phone services. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, would be aware of this. There are many areas of your electorate, as there are of mine and many other regional and rural areas throughout Australia, which do not have access to any sort of coverage of mobile phone communications. That is another area where upgrading is essential-whether it be by digital or analog. The analog system, I understand, is going to be phased out, but it is still In many areas just outside the city of Greater Bendigo, which has a population of over 85,000, you only have to move a very short distance-approximately from here to Queanbeyan-and you do not have any communication by mobile phone. Honourable members would understand that the Telstra organisation needs to improve some of those services and undoubtedly it will. Improving those services will generate a lot more work for Telstra employees. The important part of the legislation before the House for rural and remote areas and the members representing those electorates is the guarantee of the universal service obligation. To assure members that that service will continue is important because country people will recognise that there is an obligation from the organisation to provide them with a service. I would also like to talk about the introduction of a new scheme for a customer service guarantee, which is a very important aspect of this legislation and sets the performance standards for carriers in relation to the period taken for connecting telecommunication services, the period for rectifying faults and service difficulties and keeping appointments with customers. The new scheme also sets out the penalties that apply if carriers do not comply with those performance standards. This is an important part of the legislation. It will ensure that performance standards improve not only in the performance of the existing services but also in the expansion of the telecommunications system. It will enable customers to tap into the technology which is currently available to people in the metropolitan areas of the capital cities of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, et cetera, but which is not universally available throughout regional areas of Australia It is important that the performance standards are met not only in the existing system but also in the expansion of the network. I will be watching that and having further discussions with the minister on rnat aspect. Competition from other companies and other carriers will increase pressure on Telstra to expand their network and get more customers. I will look at the timing of that because it will be important to areas such as the Bendigo electorate, which I have the pleasure to represent. What really appeals to me about this legislation is the commitment from the Howard government and my party to the environment trust. The setting up of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, with $1 billion for the environment, is extremely important to members in rural areas and is probably one of the most significant things done during my time in state or federal politics. I believe that setting up this fund will be of tremendous advantage to the area I represent, which is bordered by the Lodden and Campaspe rivers, which flow in a northerly direction into the great Murray-Darling system. Mention has already been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the improvements to the Murray-Darling system. I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, will have a great interest in this because you do not want the dirty waste water from areas in Victoria heading over into your state of South Australia-nor do any other South Australian representatives. I am sure that the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who is at the table, would have an interest in this and would want to improve the quality of water for the residents of South Australia. I am sure he will be voting for this legislation to improve the water quality for the residents of his area. The honourable member for Makin (Mrs Draper), whom I have the pleasure of sitting alongside in the House, would obviously want this bill to proceed. It will be of great advantage to her and her constituents if we can improve the environment and the water quality of the Murray-Darling system. I am sure that many organisations in my electorate will be putting submissions for funding to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia to improve the waterways that head in the northerly direction and ultimately flow into the Murray-Darling system. I can assure honourable members that we have already had representations from organisations on this matter, and we will be working closely with them. This legislation will be a great thing for Victoria and it will be of tremendous value to South Australia. South Australia is dependent upon it not only for drinking water but also for a vast irrigation system which produces untold wealth for that state and contributes greatly to the Australian economy. I am sure that we will have the support of the South Australian members of this place, just as I am sure we will have the support of the Victorian members of this place as we try to improve the environment in north central Victoria. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting this bill. It is a tragedy that the Labor Party is not more supportive of this legislation, especially when we look at the benefits that will accrue to the community of Australia. By the time this legislation gets into the Senate, the Labor Party may even have a change of heart and give us the support to initiate one of the greatest conservation measures ever undertaken by any government in Australia.",54
147,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"Hotham) (5.39 p.m.}-If the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) is concerned about the community service obligations-as he says he is-he ought to do more than just look to the minister to give him the guarantees he is being given in his party room. If he really is concerned about those obligations, he should look to the amendments that we on this side of the House are moving to guarantee that those obligations are retained. I will come to some of the other issues that the member raised later. We oppose the Telstra bill because it is blackmail politics and because it is bad policy. It is bad policy because it does put those community service obligations at risk, because it does not support industry development in the way in which we have nurtured a hugely growing telecommunications industry and because it is the first step in dismantling a hugely and highly profitable public asset for no good reason. Let me come to the aspect of blackmail. Members opposite have placed great weight on the proposition that some $1 billion of the expected $8 billion yield of this part sale go towards a capital fund which, together with the interest and draw-down, will fund a number of significant environmental projects. We on this side of the House do not quibble with the environmental projects that are said to be in need of support: the national vegetation initiative, the Murray-Darling basin initiative, the national water and resources programs, the plans to preserve Australia's biodiversity and the coastcare initiatives. We support all of those projects. But we don't just say that for the sake of it: our track record demonstrates that we did support them. We support all of them and more but do not believe that the only basis for their funding comes through the sale of Telstra. We believe that those initiatives stand in their own right. It is no good indicating that this support is vital for repairing the degradation of our land, for improving farm productivity, for addressing the great waterwaysthe life-blood of much of this country-if that support is conditional. The support of the government of the day for those initiatives is conditional; it is not absolute. Therefore, one has to question how serious they are about these initiatives. In the policy that we took to the last election, we indicated a preparedness to put another $460 million into landcare, over and above the forward estimates. There was no conditionality. It was an absolute commitment. Similarly we said that we would support coastcare over three years in addition to what was already indicated in the forward estimates. We announced a commitment to the Murray-Darling basin and we funded it. It was not just the capital works that we were prepared to fund. We also recognised that we could address a lot of this repair of degradation and improve the quality of water and address salinity and those types of things if we cleverly combined the capitalimportant as that is-with the labour market programs that Working Nation funded. Under the Working Nation initiative we saw a huge growth in the number of jobs involved in environmental repair. If we look at the situation before Working Nation-the environmental projects, the original LEAP scheme, will the landcare for the environment action program-we see that under Labor there was a 39 per cent increase in the number of jobs aimed at improving in the environment. That represented around a quarter of a million jobs. Working Nation alone made a commitment of $1.1 million just on labour market programs. During the election we heard how the present government would honour all commitments to the labour market programs. We will be very interested to see how that pans out when the budget comes down because we have already seen the dismantling of very important initiatives under Working Nation. But the fact is that we made these commitments and we made them unconditional. We were prepared to ensure that some 26,500 new environment related places would be created for young people per year over the next three years. In contrast-again, let us test the seriousness of the government's credentials-all they were prepared to do over three years for the labour market programs was inject $68 million versus our $1 billion and to introduce a program, green core, which would see only 2,000 places created by the end of the Howard government's first term. They are talking about creating 2,000 places in three years when we were creating 26,500 places every year. In terms of our commitment, none of it was conditional. We say that the projects are worthwhile. They are worthy and we support them, but we do not support the means by which they are to be funded-that is, through the sale of Telstra. Those on the other side of the House have been asking: what is the difference between selling Telstra and what we did in government for Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank? There are a number of important differences. The first is that everyone in the country uses the telecommunications network' operated by Telstra. Telstra dominates the total telecommunications market-90 per cent of it, in essence. We should compare that with Qantas. Whilst Qantas has a significant proportion of market share, a small proportion of the Australian population uses it. In the case of the Commonwealth Bank, only 20 per cent of the Australian public bank with it. In relation to those two cases-Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank-there is another important distinction. We came to the view about their part sale after two important considerations: first, that there had been significant deregulation in the respective markets in which they operated. That has not Occurred in the telecommunications market to date. We opened up competition in the telecommunications industry, but there was still a very strong regulatory environment because that was the only way in which you could protect the community service obligations. That is not so with Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. The second thing that is important is that as a government we were confronted with the fact that if Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were to remain viable they would have to get a large capital injection. Therefore, we were confronted with whether we should pay an injection of funding on behalf of all of the people that would only benefit some of them. If the airline and the bank did not service the whole of the population, why should we draw everyone's money into general revenue to assist that organisation to continue to grow? The capital injection is not the case in point here. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. We have seen a huge growth in the telecommunications industry in particular, a huge expansion in the case of Telstra. In relation to the decision to sell one-third of Telstra our concern is that in the end you cannot guarantee the community service obligation. If you transferred that universal service obligation from the existing act you would have no guarantee that it will be fully maintained, despite the assurances that you have been given on that side of the House in the party room. A board which can no longer be directed by the minister simply has to take note of what the minister says. If the minister is of the view that the community service obligation is paramount and has to be adhered to, under the current legislation he or she can direct the board. That is the position that we had in place. That same guarantee cannot be given if you open up the board to the representation from those outside interests. Why do we not need the capital injection in Telstra that I referred to before? Because that organisation has been hugely successful since we opened up more market contestability into the industry in a regulated sort of way. Over the last four years we have seen profit increase enormously in the case of Telstra. Labour productivity in the work force has gone up almost 55 per cent over the past four years. Employment growth in the whole of the industry has grown by 30,000 jobs. Even in circumstances in which Telstra has downsized, there has been overall growth in the telecommunications industry. A report that I released last year, 'Employment 2005', indicates that under existing policies employment growth in the communication industry is projected to grow some three per cent per annum between now and the year 2005. Not only have we made Telstra itself more viable; we have nurtured and developed a hugely successful locally based telecommunications industry, competing against the international giants who have brought investment and employment opportunities here, at the same time nurturing our own industry. Investment has gone up by 94 per cent in this industry in that four years and exports in the industry have grown by some 345 per cent. I can understand the argument about the need to sell Telstra if it were a liability on nation. But this hardly represents a liability. It also completely contradicts the ideological view that many on the other side of the House have that these large enterprises cannot be managed effectively, efficiently or competitively if they are still in public control. This puts the lie to that argument. Properly managed, not only do they compete well; they compete with the best of them and they nurture a whole lot more in the networking environment that they support. It is interesting that Telstra's 1995 annual report shows that its revenue was $14 billion, up almost 20 per cent from $12 billion in the last four years. In addition, operating profit before tax was $2.4 billion, up from $650 million in four years. It paid $650 million in taxes, more than a doubling in four years, and the dividend that it paid to the government was $944 million in the last year. Again, it has doubled from $478 million. This is not just a significant figure on an annual basis; this is an indication that these sorts of returns to government will continue to grow, not that they will fall back. One of the important questions that has to be .asked in this House when we talk of selling off the public assets is: what are we giving up? We are giving up a third of the profit, a third of the dividend every year. We will certainly not get as much by way of tax revenue under the split up arrangement as we do in the current arrangements. The fact that the federal government received $2- billion from Telstra's operations in 1994-95 indicates what we really are giving up. I would simply indicate that, under the arrangement we art; talking about, we are effectively giving up a third of that-$0.8 billion-in one year, which is four-fifths of the way towards the very fund that you say you need to establish into perpetuity. Why do you not look at other sources for funding the arrangements, particularly when you are going to get that revenue stream to undertake the very initiatives that you have talked about? The other matter I want to address is the concern about industry development if this legislation goes through. Whilst we have seen a lot of guarantees about what will be protectthe ed under this legislation, there is no commitment to address the industry development aspects. I can understand that because, again, there is an ideological view on the government's side of the House that any payments to support and encourage assistance to industry is business welfare. We on this side of the House reject that notion. We do accept that industry in this country has to become competitive. But, if we expect it to become competitive, we have to understand that there are circumstances in which they need support to become so competitive-their size, the economies of scale and the sort of competition they have to compete with in terms of the already established global players. We set out a number of initiatives by which, in the new competitive contestable arrangements where we allowed the two other carriers into the marketplace, there was active encouragement of the telecommunications supply industry in this country-initiatives such as taxation incentives, infrastructure resource support, research and development and the export market development grants scheme, all of the things that we on this side of the House know you will cut into in the budget processes. In the last few days in the House we have tried to get a commitment from your side that you will honour your commitments to the export market development grants scheme. There has been no such commitment, yet these are the very things that have helped the industry. We also understand that the R&D concessions are under a cloud. In addition to that, what we entered into under the arrangements that saw the operators come into the market were requirements that they would support, through long-term contractual arrangements, sourcing and supply from local industry. Telstra, in the current circumstances, is sourcing something like 70 per cent of its supplies from Australian industry. I can tell you this: there is no commitment in the legislation to encourage that to continue, which is one of the reasons we have moved an amendment to help secure that. But the reality is that, if you have a board of directors made up of people who are not required to follow the existing arrangements, people who represent overseas interestsbecause foreigners will be able to buy into the third and will look after their profit interests rather than just the community interests-the commitment to sourcing from Australian based manufacturers will be non-existent. It may well be that many of them have established themselves in a way in which they can compete effectively, but you have to sensibly encourage that arrangement-build the network, build the commitment, get into long term undertakings, get into long-term arrangements. Labor policies of industry development have overcome the barriers to smaller firms getting in, by giving them a hand up-giving them a base, but not a handout-to get them established, to get them going and to help them understand that they will only be supported and will only get into these long-term contracts if they supply competitive1y. But if they have to compete with the economies of scale of the huge companies that can outprice them, cut price them, get them out of the marketplace, then we will see the end to the growth in the industry that has been so successful-30,000 jobs in the last four years-not because we have expanded Telstra but because we have made Telstra compete. We will see a three per cent job opportunity each year for the remaining 10 years but only if the existing policies remain.",58
148,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEE,"O'Connor) (6.00 p.m.)Just before the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) goes, I would like to give him a simple lesson in arithmetic, which I am sure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, would understand. We are told that we are going to lose a $944 million dividend from Telstra. We would lose that if we sold the entire business. We are going to sell only a third of it, so arithmetic tells me that by the sale we will lose something over $300 million. Of course, it is recognised-and, I think, even agreed to by the member for Hothamthat the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra will be of the order of $8 billion. With the exception of the $1 billion that we are going to put out on interest-so we might say it is still an opportune amount of money and there will be opportune interest-let us say, for the sake of simple arithmetic, that we are going to use to the $8 billion to repay federal debt, accumulated for the nation by his government from $15 billion to $100 billion. Interest on $8 billion is $800 million. So we save $800 million in interest and we retain $600 million-plus in dividends, as compared to the loss of $300 million in dividends. The member for Hotham says that the nation is going backwards and that the taxpayer is going backwards. The taxpayer wins a huge amount of money because we will maintain our commitment to paying off debt. We will save $800 million in interest and we will forgo $300 million of dividend. Net profit is $500 million. The other interesting point worth mentioning at this time is that when we first proposed our policy, the then Prime Minister-he did not use the favourite words of the previous Prime Minister, Hawke, 'That would be an obscenity' - said that his government would not sell Telstra. Chanteclair wrote a very interesting article on the back pages of the Australian Financial Review in which he said that Paul Keating would sell the lot. He then gave us some very commercial reasons why he might do it-not political reasons. The most outstanding one was that, because of the then Labor government's legislation, there was never a better time to sell out in the interest of the taxpayers as the true shareholders-they might be shareholders in a technical sense, but when it comes to telling Telstra what to do they find out they do not have much influence as 'shareholders'-because Telstra's value c-not continue to grow. It cannot continue to grow because the previous government legislated for competition, as the shadow minister, the member for Hotham, has said. Optus, Vodafone-and in two years time the world? They are all coming. Chanteclair's suggestion to us, in purely commercial terms, was: get the money. He said that we are being painted this wonderful picture of Telstra of going out into the world and fighting for its share of the market in places like India and all these other places, and that is why it will continue to grow. It will be able to shovel aside the AATs and all these other people, the big deal operators in the world who are already privati sed. But he pointed out the pitfalls of some of those markets, and I was reminded as I read the article of a very large American company in power generation that went.into a state in India and got about $200 million or $300 million dollar of a $2 billion project up and running and then there was a change of government and the new government cancelled the contract. They are still fighting it. In what court is it going to win? It is a very dangerous place to be. There are markets out there as long as you can hang on to them and get paid. The reality is that, on purely commercial terms, there are great assets and there is great benefit to the Australian people in getting rid of a net $500 million of annual costs. There is great benefit in asking the private sector to come on board in our public institution and bring the sorts of profit motives that go with that. Let me just say this simple thing: when we get down to these issues, the worse thing anybody can do for a nation is to create an artificial job. In my electorate, for over 15 . years I have had to argue that you cannot have a station master at a station where the train no longer stops. It is not possible. It is not good for the people that live there. This is the sort of argument we are getting at the moment from those opposite. The absolute number of jobs in Telstra is the right number of jobs, not the number that the union thinks. If Telstra is to succeed and the people are to be given the appropriate service at the appropriate price, you cannot afford to have one wasted employee. We went through all this rubbish years ago when the Labor Party was telling us that, if you retired everyone at 50, there would be all these jobs for kids. No, there would be all that additional liability for kids. This is a fundamental issue. We have to look at what we are doing and why we are doing it. We are doing it to make Telstra more efficient by giving it an injection of private enterprise to balance with its public enterprise. ",61
149,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEE,"The reality is that is a good thing. Roger, settle for the simple arithmetic. Talk your way out of how a $944 million dividend, discounted by the one-third, is better than the saving of $800 million worth of interest every year. Just talk your way around that one. We heard other rubbish figures from the member for Dobell (Mr Lee). I was down in Tasmania when the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) said that one of part of his electorate over was going to have pay $30,000 for a phone connection. You can get a satellite phone for $8,000 cash and talk to the world. I made the point-and it is a pity it is Dick because it is probably applicable-that if Dick believes that, then he stands gUilty not of dishonesty but of stupidity. I think that being stupid is worse than being dishonest, particularly if you are representing the people. I say to those opposite: don't come those stories. We have had a parliamentary inquiry into telephone charges which said that the real loss leader was the domestic private phone. That is what it told us. We are reversing all that now. We have forgotten we had that parliamentary inquiry. SID is the big profit area, and a lot of that is country telephones. Where did Optus go when it arrived? Did it run around the city putting in domestic phones? No, it is going to do that in conjunction with its video. It went out and put in SID cables. Why did it do that? Because it was going to lose money out there? Tell me about it! I know that SID profit is made primarily between the capital cities. But the thing with telephones is that you have a person on each end. When Elders or Wesfarmers rings up a country bloke, a large percentage of revenue is generated but it is credited to the city. So yours is a dumb argument. It is not true. Stop using it. It does not add up and it does not recognise that competition will continue to lower the cost of installations and calls. I read the other day about a lecture in which it was said that call time will become irrelevant, even on international calls; we will be charged nothing because it will be so cheap. Where will Telstra be if it does not know how to do that? You should tell your unions that you took Telstra's monopoly away, that you have thrown it out into the real world. We are saying that Telstra needs a few people on its board who will tell it how to deal with that situation. In the process, it would not be a bad idea if employees had the opportunity to buy a few shares in their own business. They would queue up for them. Someone made a joke about them being their superannuation. Good luck; they just might be. People might think it the best investment they could have and so be totally dedicated to the growth of their organisation. Let me say something else about jobs and redundancies. People used to stand up on this side and tell us about how dreadful Jeff Kennett was and about the 40,000 public servants who had lost their jobs. I made some inquiries recently and I found out that 35,000 of them are back in employment. They have got real jobs, they are contributing to the economy and they are going to make it easier for our kids to survive in the future, and that is the big deal. You sold Telstra lock, stock and barrel. You sold it when you borrowed $85,000 million, using our kids as security, to fund all your ridiculous promises. In any commercial sense, it's gone. We are going to sell only a third of it to pay off at least some of the debt because that is the commercially correct thing to do. It will put us $500 million in front on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. Let us look at this situation a little further. We are told that this is blackmail because we are actually going to do something for the environment. The biggest financial problem in Australia is the environment. There is a huge debt to be paid off in respect of the environment. We incurred that debt through our mistakes. That is a matter of history. ",62
150,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEE,"Yes, both of us did. I can still see the photographs in the West Australian of two huge bulldozers towing a wide chain with a big ball on it. That was the new technology, the way to clear the countrywipe it out and then build fences. We now know that was wrong but we had to learn the lesson. There is a debt to be repaid but the money should not come from loading up our industries with more taxes, as you did with the fuel tax. That would be silly because they cannot compete if we do that. It is bad enough that we have a tax burden that adds $700 to $800 to every motor car we make in Australia while at the same time we are telling people to compete with South Africa and other places. That is pretty dumb but that is the reality. We do not want to add to that mistake so we have to do something else. In any commercial sense, you sold the asset because you borrowed the money. All you have left is Telstra and our kids. We say that the kids should have a better chance. That is the important thing. It is pretty simple: we will try to repay a small amount of the debt to the environment by paying off ten per cent of your borrowings and returning the taxpayers a net $500 million. With a 30 per cent shareholding by AMP and other institutions, there will be good advice from the directors who are appointed to look after the rights of their policy holders. Anyone would think only the Packers of this world were going to buy the shares. Even when the big institutions come in, it is the policyholders, the millions of them, who will be the beneficiaries-and that might increase the dividend to $900 million. We are not going to be worse off. There is no way we could be. Please, think about what you are doing. I wrote down a few words which I think are worth reading. They are: Hypocrisy is the well known but least acceptable aspect of the parliamentary process. The Labor Party's opposition to this legislation is one of the worse examples of that hypocrisy. You cannot rationalise and tell us there is a difference between the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, on one hand, and this particular process on the other. It is silly to argue that Telstra is somehow different and does not have competition when you are the ones who legislated for Optus and Vodafone and got the doors to the world open in two years. The reality is that all of a sudden you have changed sides in the parliament and left your brains over here. That is something you should not do when the national interest is the paramount concern. The one thing you could say about us while we sat on the opposition benches is that we stood up for privatisation. Bob Hawke called it an obscenity but we stuck with it. When you guys changed your mind we supported you. Why? Because we believed in it. You might not have believed in it when you sold the Commonwealth Bank but you sold it, and that was the sea change. From then on you had an obligation to be consistent. And you wonder why you all fit in that little area over there with about the same number of seats as a Toyota Tarago! The reality is that you are there because you are not consistent. Imagine the sort of trouble we could have caused you if we had gone out and opposed your decision to sell the Commonwealth Bank. I don't mean trouble with the people; I mean trouble within your own party. If we had arranged one of the sorts of mischievous comments that are here in the parliament today-juvenile's logicyour party would have split right down the middle over the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We did not do that to you. We said that you were right. When someone writes the history of Paul Keating and they say, 'Look at all the great initiatives he introduced,' we can say that he got them all by because we said, 'Yes. We will support you in floating the dollar. We won't go out there with a heap of scare tactics to say what that might do to business.'  it up yourselves.",63
151,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEE,"It didn't stop us supporting you when you did. We could have scared the Australian public out of that deal. We could have played scare tactics. I can still hear Keating saying that we would tum every fuel pump into a tax office. We actually got the tax up to 6c a litre and you guys added the next 30c. Hypocrisy! Nasty stuff! No good! And you shouldn't do it when you have an about-tum of the type you have had here. What about the Greens and the Democrats? We have learnt all about them. It is a fundamental fact of these sorts of minor parties. You know what we say of the Democrats, of course: you can't buy them; you can only rent them by the hour. The reality of it is that those parties start with a good intention. Don Chipp started the Democrats to sit between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. It has been taken over since by left wing interests and we all recognise that it stands to the left of the Labor Party. The Democrats actually said that they believed in the environment, that it was paramount, until somebody tested them on public ownership. Their socialist credentials came rushing out at a million miles an hour, and the Greens are no different. It is now up to the Australian people to reassess the credentials of those particular parties. I do not know what they are doing here. I do not believe-I would legislate for it if I was in a position to do so, and this far back I am not-that any political party should stand in this place if it cannot get half of a Senate quota; that is, seven per cent of the primary vote. It is about time your party and our party, in the interests of the nation, decided on that. I am fed up with people sitting up there with three per cent of the primary vote and eight per cent of our vote telling us how to run the country. It is outrageous. I have said all along-I am on the record; it is not the first time. I have said this-that it is time we set a threshold level. I think half a quota is absolutely right. Any political party would be declared defeated in the Senate count if they could not achieve half a quota in their own right. Why should they get elected by Labor and Liberal surplus quotas? They have not got a mandate for anything. In some states the Democrats got well below seven per cent of the vote-half a quota. But that is just the point. What are they doing? What is their commitment? Is it to save the Australian taxpayer money? I have just proven arithmetically that that is not the case. Why not use some money to repay the debt we owe the environment? It seems a very good idea to me. These are just fundamental issues. Why should the Labor Party do the U-turn it has done on privatisation? You can argue till you are blue in the face and you can raise the scare tactics of what someone is going to payout in the bush. The threshold for the bush now is a satellite telephone, but I was talking about that the other day and they tell me, 'We have got a low orbiting satellite coming in that you will be able to communicate on with a $100 mobile.' So there is the threshold for a connection. We are not talking about running wires all over the countryside any more. Technology will guarantee that, but we have also guaranteed it in the legislation. The only protection people have ever had in terms of community services has been legislation. It is unchanged-if anything it has tightened-and I have no concerns whatsoever for the people of my electorate. I will not be worried by the words of the member for Dobell. I think it is childish to run those sorts of lines. As I said, be charged with dishonesty but not stupidity. (Time expired)  pleased to speak in this debate. I listened with interest to the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I thought it ironic that he should be charging the opposition with hypocrisy about this issue. It is true that we faced the people of Australia with our manifesto and we were resoundingly beaten; however, I do not recall any party discussion or ministerial statement prior to the election or during the election by ministers or backbenchers ever stating that the Australian Labor Party would sell off Telstra. But we are being accused of being hypocrites because, following the election, we are maintaining the consistency of our policy. I find it ironic that the honourable member for O'Connor should charge us with being hypocritical about this issue. As far as hypocrisy is concerned, I can well recall in the old parliament the honourable member for O'Connor waltzing in here bemoaning the fact that in a lot of rural and regional areas in Australia small businessmen in particular did not have access to mobile phones. I for one sympathised with him. But he and the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) are suddenly suggesting to the people of Australia that in this new era of competition suddenly little 'telcos' are going to rush out to the people of Bendigo or rush out to the little towns in O'Connor and develop mobile phones for them because there will be a profit on it. Of course they won't. The member for O'Connor is saying that SID is the most profitable part of the business. Of course it is. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, knows that it is and he knows that SID prices have come down considerably. Having been the telecommunications ombudsman he would know that prices have come down considerably. Just remember what our deregulation provided: if Telecom were to reduce the tariff on one part of the SID network they had to reduce it for all-for the capital cities and the regional cities, for rural and provincial Australia. That was part of our pricing structure because we on this side of the House had a concern that people should have access to communications services. Two things concerned me about the government's arguments: firstly, that the government is saying that this is a better privatisation and it should be· supported for this reason; and, secondly, that part of the proceeds is going to fund worthwhile causes. Members on this side of the House and the people of Australia should approach it from the point of view of what is best for communications for all Australians, not what is a better privatisation or what the proceeds are going to be used for. I am the first one to concede that national debt and foreign ownership were issues in the recent election. They are issues that we on this side of the House are going to have to come to terms with. The real issue concerning the partial sale of Telstra is how will this measure benefit the people of Australia in terms of communications. A former shadow minister for communications and now the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, who is at the table, well knows that when we were introducing competition we did not select the most competitive model. In fact, his colleague in the Senate was all hot to trot with Mr Ergas's structural separation and contestable markets. We did not structurally separate. If we had, we would have got by far the most competitive system of communications in Australia. It would have done nothing for rural and regional Australia and it would have done nothing for industry policy. It would have been very hard to look after the small people, as far as access to communications was concerned. What we attempted to do with deregulation was to ensure that every Australian had access to affordable communications. In terms of competition, yes, we made the organisation more efficient. There are a lot of Telecom and OTC employees who have paid an awful price for these changes-30,OOO of them have lost their jobs, and there are further cuts proposed. But we wanted to build an industry. Any time you look at the communications industry, you will see that the single biggest factor, in terms of local manufacturing or exports, is the purchasing behaviour of our carriers. In overseas markets, they can pull through the big and small manufacturers. That is why there has been such a huge and dramatic increase in manufacturing in Australia, particularly in exports. We thought that was important. We thought that Australia, as a . country, should have a stake in the communications industry of the future. So we did not go for the most competitive model. While I am on the issue of costs in the communications industry, Australia has some of the cheapest costs in the world not only because of the efficiency of the industry but also because there is no sales tax or value added tax on it which so many other countries have. In my belief, we are not really disadvantaging the economy of Australia by not having those taxes. In other words, we already have a very efficient industry in Australia. Telstra is recognised worldwide as a world leader. A lot of our neighbouring countries tick the directions in which Telstra is heading. I do not think we have done so badly as far as the communications model that we have developed is concerned. The honourable member for O'Connor said that the big difference will be with the board of directors, that we will actually have some people there who will really shcupen the place up. I understood that the board of directors of Telstra already consists of some leading people from industries. Is the honourable member for O'Connor suggesting that these people are, in his words, stupid? Is that what he is saying-that these people are stupid? Perhaps I should grab a copy of the honourable member's speech and forward it on to them. We have had the benefit of having people with private enterprise experience on the board of directors of Telstra. The board has been through quite a number of strategic changes. But what will be the changes that will come as a result of privatisation? Privatisation, generally speaking, does have some impacts: usually in-house jobs are replaced with contracts; awards and conditions are eroded; and you get a cheaper labour cost. I totally reject the suggestion that the workers in Telstra are somehow disloyal, uncommitted people. They have gone through massive change. By and large, I think they have adapted pretty well. I think it is most ungenerous of the minister at the table if he will not acknowledge the dedication of the employees of Telstra and reject the arguments that are being advanced by the honourable member for O'Connor. I am concerned about two things. I have said in this House before that it has always been my belief that prior to 1987 and the deregulation of the telecommunications industry in 1991 there ought to have been independent inquiry that looked into the mental process of change and all the other issues. What was it about the massive amount of regulation we put into ensure sustainable competition that worked well? Were achieving the industry objectives that we had hoped for? Yes. Were we looking after consumers better? Yes. Were we looking after battlers? We could have had an independent scoresheet. It is a matter of regret to me that we have never had that independent inquiry. In fact, what we got was a departmental inquiry. I wanted to talk a little about universal services. In the 1990s we are still trying define a 1950s and 1960s concept of universal service as the plain, ordinary telephone service. As most honourable members know-and certainly the shadow minister for science and information technology, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), who is at the table, knows-in this day and age, communications infrastructure the method of delivering the superhighway. As I said, I agree with the honourable member for O'Connor. We cannot be satisfied that rural and small provincial businessmen, and residents for that matter, are deprived of mobile services.",64
152,Unknown,COMMITTEE,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.  the universal service obligation and making the point that it is a lot more than just planned service. Australia has very high penetration rates, that is, the number of telephones per household is still very high, but I have to say it is not 100 per cent. I think we do not fully appreciate the important role that telephones play in our society. One of the good things about having so many reach. women members of parliament in this House at this time is that nuclear families would understand how important the telephone is keeping in contact with different family members. In fact, it is the women in our society who keep the extended family tocalls gether with their telephone calls, checking or where advice is being sought with a telepoorer phone call in the opposite direction. Indeed, an the telephone performs an absolutely fundarole for the elderly, particularly as our society, I am very pleased to say, is encouraging more and more of our senior citizens to spend as much time as possible in their family we home. Otherwise, elderly people would experience isolation. This important feature is also true-even more so-for migrants. Without the telephone they are really isolated. We can be very proud of the penetration rates of the telephone that we have in Australia, but not everyone has access to the telephone. I am also very concerned about what is going to happen with people who cannot afford the telephone. In my own electorate to that number is quite large. I have quite a number of people who do not have the phone, quite a number of elderly people who do not have the phone and quite a number of migrants who do not have the phone. I am a little worried about these offers for mobile services where the cost of the mobile telephone is reduced to a very small amount but is . you actually pay for the phone by very high mobile phone charges. What I am leading up to is to ask the minister at the table whether he is prepared to refer a wider examination of this universal service obligation and exactly what that means to a parliamentary committee. I understand the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has announced this afternoon who will be chairing the committees and what they will be. I have said in the House before that I think a that for poorer people and for pensioners Telecom should be compelled to offer a monthly bill. It has done it for years in the States. Telecom certainly does offer monthly billing for recalcitrant customers in their terms and puts quite high security bonds on a lot of customers to place the telephone out of their These are often people who do not wish to in default on their obligations or avoid their obligations but have difficulty managing their money and telephone bills. If you make STD or international calls, you can certainly up, run up an extraordinary bill. Therefore, for people in our society-and for the not so poor, for that matter-having the firm option of monthly billing, for example, places a telephone call within reach. We need to redefine what we think of as the universal service for the 1990s and beyond into the next century. It is a great advantage in this country if we have a technological edge and if we define the universal service obligation in the widest possible terms. Another point I want to raise is the massive cross-subsidy that exists within the communications system. I, for one, argue that that should always be there. I argue that, whether you are in an urban electorate like mine or an electorate like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, you should not be disadvantaged in your access to communications because of where you are living. When you start privati sing or part privatising organisations like Telstra, you eventually put huge pressure on them in terms of maintaining that cross-subsidy. In fact, I suppose that was the hardest bit we had in relation to deregulation. But in this particular legislation there really is nothing that you can say, in honesty, will prevent a future erosion of that cross-subsidy. It seems to me that that ought to be a really important issue for all regional and rural members. The member for O'Connor was very critical of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) in pointing out the possible costs of connecting up services should that cross-subsidy disappear. Whether those figures are accurate or not, I think I can say to the House with total confidence that once you remove the cross-subsidy, once you start putting pressure on the crosssubsidy, then you are going to get a disequality in terms of people's' access to the service. There was one other comment by the member for O'Connor that I found very amusing, in a fairly amusing speech. He said that Optus were not rushing to cable up the local area network-they were rushing to . cable up STD. That is certainly true. But I have to say, again, that when Bell South were running the corridors, speaking to the minister at the table or to the then government, they at no time indicated that they were going to be running cable on telegraph poles to get to the local area network. They said to us that they believed that the dramatic growth in technology for digital mobile phones was such that their networks were going to be digital and digital cellular, not run off cable. So I really cannot understand the point that the honourable member for O'Connor was making. Of course they wanted to get into STD; that is the most profitable area. There seems to be a view amongst government members-particularly those from rural and regional areas, such as the member for Bendigo-that, if you privatise, those areas that to date have been lacking in services are suddenly going to be snapped up by competition. Well, I might not be as expert as members opposite in the profit motive, but I understood that companies would go to where they could make the greatest profit. The last point I want to make is that the amendment talks about the expansion of local call areas. In my own area, I have that part of the city of Penrith which is in the Sydney call zone. The honourable member for Lindsay all (Miss Jackie Kelly) has the one that is outside the zone. I would say to the honourable member for Lindsay that, by voting for this legislation, she will be ensuring that Penrith is never embraced within the Sydney local call area-and that will be very regrettable for all her constituents. I support the amendments proposed by the shadow minister. I have been consistent in opposing part or full privatisation of Telstra. It is something that we said to the electorate we would not do. We are consistent-we are opposing it in the House tonight. And I, for one, am very pleased that we are doing so.",67
153,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEE,"I am delighted to rise tonight to speak on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. I say to my colleague the honourable  afraid I am terribly disappointed in his attitude. If there is one bill that will come before this parliament in this session that he should absolutely support right down to the wire, it is this bill, and I am going to tell him why. Let us go back and do a bit of history. A journalist of whom I am not particularly normally enamoured-in fact, his views and mine very seldom correspond-wrote a piece on 18 June 1994 entitled 'National sacrifice in name of competition'. The gentleman in contest here is Mr Kenneth Davidson, who writes for the Age. In that article, Mr Davidson said this: Australia has two potential international champions around which it is possible to build an industry policy: BHP and Telecom. And until 1987, in the case of BHP, and 1991 in the case of Telecom, the managements of both organisations saw themselves as champions of the broader national interest. BHP did things for the good of the nation, as well as for the good of its shareholders. Telecom did not simply supply a telephone service throughout a continent larger than Western Europe, at an average cost that compared more than favourably with some much larger industrialised countries, but it was also responsible for the development of a world-class telecommunications equipment industry that supplied 95 per cent of the equipment for the network. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are some very substantial companies in my electorate that still supply Telstra today. Mr Davidson went on-and this part is important-to talk about competition and industry policy and to talk about new markets opening up in Asia and eastern Europe. He said this about those markets: Telecom either gets into these markets now or it loses out. The pre-condition for such a move is privatisation, so Telecom is free to take commercial risksthat is important-take commercial risksand raise capital for expansion, subject to market judgments and disciplines. Even more importantly, the existence of shareholders, who have rights to protect, gives some guarantee that the interests of Telecom (which in most cases coincide with the public interest) will be taken into account when the new local regulatory regime is established in 1997 after the present review. The alternative is to asset-strip Telecom by selling off the profitable bits and leaving the in the form of an unprofitable fixed local network. That is what the former Prime Minister of the former ALP government wanted to do---take the Yellow Pages and hive it off and sell it in order to get a bit of profit, in order to try to help the current account deficit with one shot, not a continuing attack, on the underlying deficit that we face in this nation. I think Kenneth Davidson was right. I wrote a letter to the Editor of the Age on 20 June 1994. I said: Dear Sir, It is not often that I find myself in substantive agreement with Kenneth Davidson but when (Age 18/61) he calls for Telecom to be privatised but left in tact and under Australian control I find myself applauding. Davidson correctly concludes that Australia has only two ""international champions"" of industry: BHP and Telecom. It is worth noting his comments that: ""both organisations were run by engineersand I think that is not bad, because I happen to be a proud engineer myselfwith an engineering ethos that derives satisfaction from nation building, pride from knowing that they were pre-eminent among their peers, and the security that comes from knowing that they organise the production of wealth for the rest of the community"". Those are very noble sentiments. It is unfortunate that that is no longer so because Australia needs some companies and some industries with enough critical mass to carry along with them a great range of smaller manufacturing and service organisations that supply the centre and go with them into overseas markets. The result of the equation is jobs in Australia for Australians. That is something I will always champion. I went on: Telecom must be privatised in order to allow it to gain the capital necessary for new development and to compete in Australia and perhaps most importantly, to back Telecom's potential push into the huge Asian market. But, if Telecom is privatised by being sold to overseas interests or broken up into discrete businesses and sold off a bit at a time we will lose all the strategic advantage from the engineering and technical excellence built up by Telecom over many years. There is a large and growing number of indigenous Australian telecommunications companies who have developed to supply Telecom and have the potential to reach with it into the husk developing Asian markets. If we break up Telecom we destroy the critical mass. If Telecom is sold to overseas interests, say Bell Atlantic or British Telecom, our indigenous industry will lose market and lose potential for export. With ten per cent unemploymentin 1994and a continuing deficit on the current accountand we still have that todayAustralia needs to build BHPs and Telecoms to provide jobs-not sell them off to interests with different priorities. Good on ya Kenneth Davidson-let's keep Telecom Australian! Having written those words in 1994, I want to echo them again today. I believe that those sentiments are important to this debate. Government is not well placed to manage giant corporation, particularly in the modern telecommunications or information technology sphere. This huge enterprise needs huge amounts of capital. We all know that government today is strapped for funds. If industry is going go out and borrow money or raise capital, is best done in the private investment market. Telstra. Governments really are not in this business of trying to raise capital for industrial development. We gave that away a long time ago-and so we should have. There is no question that by Telstra having· competition from Optus-and there will soon be more competition from other players in field-it has become more efficient and more productive and will continue to be from hereon. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, read to us during his second reading speech some very important statistics to show that Telstra is less efficient than should be by today's international standards. There are many other major telecommunicasell tions companies around the world that do much better than our home-grown version customer service and performance, getting awake to that. invoices to clients on time, responding to clients' problems, installing new telephones or disconnecting old telephones. Whatever the issue is that you want to discuss, Telstra does not match world best practice. In order to help it match world best practice, if we give it a commercial interest and the shareholders are driving the directors, _there is no doubt in my mind that it will perform better. It has the potential to perform at the very top of world best practice. Response to clients and consumers is important and that needs to be improved by Telstra if we, the using public, are going to get the value out of this major asset we have in this country. Another important issue is the price or cost of services to the consumer. We still pay far too much for our telecommunication services in this country, largely because we have lived with a monopoly for so very long. There are real benefits to Australians from this first tranche. The proposal in this bill to sell a a maximum of one-third of Telstra to Australia's mums and dads and Telstra employees-not to massive overseas interests, but to mums and dads of Australia-will mean that we, the consumers, the public, not the government, will own Telstra. At the moment the to public think they own Telstra. But the public it do not own Telstra; the public cannot direct Mr O'Connor-Well, who does?",68
154,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEE,"The government owns it. The government of the day-not the average mums and dads of Australia--owns, directs and manages Telstra. This bill will give the mums and dads a chance to buy part of that the action and to be part of the future development of a giant, very Australian corporation. One benefit to Australia from privatising Telstra is the chance to retain and improve a world-class telecommunications company. If the ALP, that mob on the other side which is it now reduced to a rabble, had their way, they would sell off Yellow Pages, and they would off all the good bits and pieces so that Telstra would lose its strategic strength. in Thank goodness the Australian people were Another benefit to Australia is a reduction in national debt. We have a huge problem. If you go out to the streets anywhere in Australia and talk to any Australian, they will tell you that one of Australia's biggest problems today is national debt. They want to see it down, because that debt requires us to pay interest. We are now borrowing money to pay interest on the interest. That is crazy stuff. Selling a third of Telstra is going to help us to reduce debt. When this rabble on the other side-the little bit that is left; the rump-sold off the best Commonwealth Bank, the airports, Qantas and Australian Airlines, what did they do with the money? They used it to pay for consumption, for more government self-purpose spending, didn't they? They did not use it to retire debt. This $8 billion, or whatever it comes to, will come off the bottom line. It will get rid of some of the debt so that we do not keep paying interest on debt that we cannot afford to pay. Other benefits to Australians will be more effective management from the private sector, increased competition, ownership by Australian mums and dads and-this is an important benefit-Telstra employees will be allowed to buy up to two per cent of the value of the one-third of Telstra that we propose to sell to the public. It is important that Telstra employees be allowed to own their own company. It should help give them a sense of pride in what they are doing, a sense of ownership, and a sense of belonging to the day-today decisions that are made about how they do their job in a modem industrial relations environment and how they help improve the bottom line of the company that they are part of and are part owners of. Another aspect to this debate is that the government has proposed that $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of this huge asset will go to fund an environment policy which will be one of the best things that has happened to Australia in a very long time. It is a very important initiative. I have to say to honourable members in the House and to those people in the gallery that I was delighted when the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard), came to my electorate of La Trobe in the beautiful Dandenong Ranges of Victoria to launch this policy that we are debating here today. The national media were among the huge gum trees and the mountain ash when we launched one of the most important environment initiatives that has ever been attempted in Australia's history: this $1.15 billion, that . is, $1,150 million, to fund a National Heritage Trust. That is a pretty huge statement, isn't The rabble over there, together with, as I understand it, the minor parties in the Senate, want to knock it off. They do not believe in the environment. I remember Bob Brown standing in Sherbrooke forest in 1990 asking the voters in the electorate of La Trobe to make sure that they put Bob Charles last. Do you remember Senator Graham Richardson of Marshall Islands fame? He came to Sherbrooke forest and said, 'For heaven's sake, if you are not going to put Peter Milton first, whatever you do, put Bob Charles last.' Bob Hawke came along and said the same thing. Thank goodness the voters of La Trobe have more intelligence and did not listen to all that nonsense. They did ask me to represent them. During the 1996 election campaign, the now Prime Minister launched this very important initiative in Sherbrooke forest. We intend to deliver to the Australian people an environment policy that is really world class. We need to invest in the environment as it is capital in Australia. We can no longer continue to treat the environment as a secondclass citizen. That mob opposite-the rabble I keep talking about-spent 13 years talking about the environment, making all kinds of deals with the environment lobby, with the deep dark greenies. But what did they accomplish? Unfortunately, very little. There is really not very much on the register to show for all the words and all the hype at all the election campaigns. This is intended to be real stuff$1.15 billion on top of the budgeted spending on the environment. That is a huge initiative. All those members on the other side of the House should take real account of this. What are some of the most important items? The first is the national vegetation initiative at $318 million over five years. Boy, do we need vegetation! We need to revegetate this continent. One thing is for sure: we are still cutting down trees. There is not much likelihood that we are ever going to completely stop cutting down vegetation. Old vegetation does not suck out of the air the carbon dioxide that new vegetation does. New green trees really eat up CO2That is what makes the greenhouse effect so potent. We need to it? plant more trees than we are ever going to cut down. There are many places where we would rather that no trees were cut down. Increasingly, there are regulations to ensure that old growth forests are going to be mainThere tained. In my electorate of La Trobe, Mount Dandenong is today one of the most beautiful spots in our nation. It attracts something like three million visitors a year. It is an absolute paradise. At the tum of the centul)' those hills were nude. Why were they nude? We either cut them down for paling fences and some housing or we burnt the lot. Today we have a magnificent lush forest. A lot of that is to Liberal state governments who saw the need to set aside and preserve such a beautiful area. The land and water resources audit is to $32 million. We certainly need to find out where we are in the environmental sense ment everywhere in this nation. Not least important are our water sources-ur rivers, lakes and catchments. We need to know what state we difficult are in at the moment so that we can take of the problems as they develop. The 2001 Murray-Darling basin project will get another $160 million in combined ComI monwealth-state funding. That is a critical initiative. We all know that the Murray is expired) dying. Billions of dollars of agriculture come out of that basin evel)' year, notwithstanding the amount of recreational use that Australians make of the weirs and of the Murray-Darling. We have to get rid of the toxic blooms. have to get rid of the salt infested land. have to do something about the salinisation problem. We need to make the land more ownership productive again. We need to let We need to give it a chance to go back to somewhat of its natural state. We need to plant heaps more trees. A national river care initiative will receive $85 million. That is for other rivers around Australia that are starting to demonstrate stress; action is needed to bring them back to a reasonable if not pristine state. The coast and clean seas project will receive $100 to million. We all know what we will strike when we hit the beaches in this country. We Australia. need to do an awful lot about ocean outfalls of sewage treatment plants and ocean outfalls of storm water drainage. A national reserve system for biological diversity will get million. That is only a drop in the bucket. is a huge range of ecosystems out there that we need to investigate if we want to try to preserve our unique identity and the unique flora and fauna that we inherited and that we ought to try to save for future generations. There are a couple of measures that are particularly important to constituents in my electorate. One is a national strategy to control and eliminate feral animals. We have lost most of the lyrebirds from Sherbrooke due forest, out of the Dandenong Ranges National Park. Getting rid of feral animals would help public land in us in that regard. The sum of $18 million will go towards get finalising and implementing a national weed strategy. I have been calling on this parliato attack this issue for a long time now. We have a significant weed infestation problem in the hills, in the forests. It is a very problem to solve. It is a problem that care we face in many areas of this country-not just in the broad plains and the grazing lands but also in the forests and the national parks. commend this bill to the House. I ask the opposition to consider it carefully. (Time",70
155,Mr OCONNOR,COMMITTEE,"Corio) (8.30 p.m.}--I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your elevation to the deputy speaker's chair. I rise to oppose this legislation which is now We before the House-the Telstra (Dilution of We Public Ownership) Bill 1996. It ought to be termed the Telstra destruction of public bill 1996 or even the vandalisation it recover. of Telstra bill 1996. Let none of us in this House today be under any illusions about what this debate is really about. It is not about economic efficiency. It is not about cheaper prices to individuals and business consumers. It is not about the blackmail package on the environment that accompanies this piece of legislation. It is not about improvements to telecommunication services ordinary Australians. It is vel)' much about the old Tol)' hatred of public enterprise in Over the past decade we all sadly watched as histol)' passed the Liberal and National parties by. In the 1980s in the United States $80 Ronald Reagan assumed the American presidency and the Republicans proceeded to implement their extreme right wing agenda. In New Zealand the draconian policies of the conservatives created such a paradise that over a quarter of a million New Zealanders fled to Australia to earn a decent standard of living. In the UK. the policies of Margaret Thatcher, so much admired by the leadership of the present government, wreaked so much havoc on the social fabric of Britain that the hapless Tory government, now led by John Major, stands on the brink of political extinction. Here in Australia, after history has passed them by and in the full knowledge of the failed policies of privatisation of Tory governments overseas, this government intends to flog off this great Australian public asset to private interests and overseas buyers. This is a shameful day for the National and Liberal parties of Australia. What more can you expect from the Liberal Party, whose founder, Menzies, allowed the sale of pig-iron to the Japanese before the war? Pig-iron in the late 1930s, Telstra in the mid-1990s-lock up your grandmas by the year 2000! They will sell anything off. I would like to comment on several aspects of this proposed bill as they relate to the employment of Australians and, of course, the position of ordinary battlers in rural and regional Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you would have an understanding of how this particular piece of legislation will adversely impact on ordinary people in rural and regional Australia. Telstra occupies a very important place in the Australian economy. We are not talking here tonight about a small company; it is no little rinky-dink company in rural and regional Australia. This is a large Australian public company. It employs some 75,000 people. In 1994-95 its total asset value stood at $24 billion. Its capital expenditure on goods and services in the Australian economy stood at $3.2 billion in 1994-95. The revenue raised from sales stood at $14 billion. The total payments to governments stood at $2.7 billion. Indeed, it occupies a strategic place the Australian economy. It has been estimated that Telstra occupies 90 per cent of the telecommunications market in this country. This is Australia's largest government business enterprise and it plays a vital role in the sustenance of the Australian electronics industry. It is a significant generator of demand through the wages that it pays to its workers and through the goods and services that it buys from small businesses throughout the Australian economy. I mentioned the direct impacts on employment that will flow from the partial sale of Telstra. The overseas experience-and I mentioned the United Kingdom and New Zealand-suggests that, when a government embarks on a process of privatisation of a significant public enterprise and asset such as Telstra, there are dramatic falls in the levels of employment in that particular enterprise and industry. Indeed, the experience in the United Kingdom indicates that job losses in the past three years in the privati sed British equivalent of Telstra have been in the region of 32,000. There is little wonder that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) comes to the dispatch box here in question time and categorically refuses to set a target for reductions in unemployment or to set targets for job growth. There is a good reason for that. He knows that the policies that he is pursuing in the form of the privatisation of Telstra and in the public sector cuts that have already been announced by senior ministers will create unemployment in this country. So we will have a direct impact over time on employment levels in Telstra. However, we need to also take into account Telstra's position as a purchaser of component equipment from the Australian telecommunications industry. As many members would appreciate, Telstra has been the architect of Australia's electronics industry which, through its component suppliers, now exports in excess of a billion dollars worth of product. Telstra's growth has spawned and stimulated growth of this electronics industry. There can be nothing surer when you introduce this private equity into Telstra than that there will in be a diversion of demand to overseas suppliers. Last year I sat on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of this parliament which produced the report Australian government purchasing policies: buying our future. You would not believe this but, oddly enough, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who was up here telling us all about the advantages of selling Telstra, has actually signed his name to this report. I note also that preceding me in this debate was the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who took a similar position. What did the Liberal and National Party members, as well as the !-abor Party members, on this committee conclude about Telstra? This is what they had to say about Telecom and industry development: In essence the Australian telecommunications supply industry has been built by Telecom's purchasing policies. There it is in black and white in the Bevis report, an excellent report on buying our future-that the Liberal and National Party members of that committee appreciated in 1994-95 the importance of Telecom to the Australian economy and to the Australian electronics industry. Yet they have jumped ship and betrayed what they said in this report in 1996. What does the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association say about the then Telecom's involvement in the Australian telecommunications industry in this report? They said: Telecom's policy of purchasing its major telecommunication equipment requirements locally helped establish the only integrated manufacturing sector of the Information Industries (computer and communications hardware and software) in which Australia has a significant presence. The Labor Party is not saying this. It is the small and medium sized businesses whose interests that you on the other side of the House are eternally telling us you are here to defend. We had the Prime Minister up here telling us that he has set paper reduction targets for small business in this country. He is a great one to set targets for paper, but he cannot set them for people in setting growth figures for employment or reduction figures for unemployment. What does A1catel say about Telecom's involvement in the establishment of the Australian telecommunications industry? It says: Alcatel supported Telecom's view that public sector purchasing policies are critical to the development of the telecommunications industry, claiming that support for local manufacturing industries through Government purchasing policies works well in that industry, assisting in the development of world class R&D and manufacturing facilities. Alcatel stated: ""Telecommunications equipment provides a good example of how the strength of public infrastructure demand, combined with a close developmental relationship between a GBE and industry on standards development and R&D can create an internationally competitive local supply industry."" That is what you are beginning to destroy in Australia with this bill now before the parliament. It will not be on the hands of the Labor Party; it will be on the hands of the Liberal and National parties as they walk down this road of destroying not only a great Australian enterprise but also a great telecommunications sector in this country. I mentioned the Prime Minister and how he refuses to set targets here in this place for reducing unemployment. He is quite happy to set them for reducing paper, but he cannot really manage to set a target for reducing the unemployment rate. I observed with some interest the Prime Minister eating down in the canteen after he assumed high office. He is getting down there with the battlers, getting his sandwich at the sandwich box with the battlers. I did not see him down there before he was elected. He might like to come down to the canteen of the Telecom workers in my tele- electorate and go down the row of the workers and tell them which ones will not have their jobs after this piece of legislation goes through. I cannot think of anything more obscene than the Prime Minister eating down in the dining room of this parliament when his Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) wants to hack away at the wages and the conditions of the cooks who cook his meal. He sits with the public servants he is going to sack in the House department. If that is not the ultimate in cynicism, I really do not know what is. I will accept it up here, but he should come down into my electorate, sit with the Telecom workers, go down the line and tell us the ones who will lose their jobs, because you are introducing into this parliament a piece of legislation that you know from overseas experience of privati sing these enterprises will lead to job losses in this country. It is not only the impact on employment but also the impact on training opportunities that inevitably follows the reduction in staffing levels in these enterprises. Reduced employment levels means simply fewer training opportunities for staff. In the past, the big public infrastructure enterprises in Australia have been the training ground for young technicians and young managers. They will be reduced by this downsizing. I would like to conclude by making some comments on the impact that this piece of legislation will have on rural and regional Australia. In this blatant attempt to buy the environmental vote, the coalition is ignoring the effects of its ideologically driven privatisation policies on the ordinary battlers rural and regional Australia. Through their support of this legislation, the people most culpable in this parliament are the members of the National Party. They are the great betrayers of people in rural and regional areas. I can understand the Liberal Party pursuing this particular policy but, for the life of me, I cannot understand why the National Party members have gone along with it. I say to the National Party members, to those new, fresh faces that have come into the parliament in the class of '96, you had better take a look your left and to your right because one of you will not be here in three years-one out of the three will hit the deck in a political sense the next election. If you think you are safe, come down to Victoria. I know you will tell me that the Premier of Victoria got back with his majority intact, but look at where the swings occurred. There were swings of eight to 10 per cent in rural and regional Victoria, and for two reasons. The first is the way you sunk the slipper into regional employment; the second is the way you have cut into the services provided by the government business enterprises in those localities. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have just taken the envelope out and I have had a look at the Mackerras pendulum and all those fresh young faces over there who are going to hit the deck. Forde, Grey, Hindmarsh, Petrie, even Corangamite held by myoid friend Stuart MCArthur, Richmond, Herbert, Macquarie, Gilmore, Leichhardt, MCMillan, Bendigo-they will all probably hit the deck because of this stupid legislation brought in by the ideologically driven Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The previous Labor government ensured that Telstra met its obligations to provide services to all Australians regardless of where they lived or how much they earned. We did this by including universal service obligations in the act and then by subjecting Telstra to ministerial scr.ltiny and, if necessary, ministerial direction. In other words, the minister in had the power to direct Telstra to provide services to all Australians at an equitable price no matter where they lived, no matter what the cost to Telstra. That was an important safeguard for people and businesses in rural and regional Australia, the very people the National Party wants to betray in this particular bill. This government is taking away the right of the minister to provide this very important safeguard. The minister will no longer be able to protect the interests of the ordinary battlers in rural and regional communities. The safeto guards put in place by the government are clearly inadequate for one simple and very good reason-the board members nominated at by the government will be in no position to stand up to the board members representing private investors, especially the foreign investors who will be there solely to take the profit. If the service obligations of Telstra stand in the way of profits in this deregulated environment, the service obligations will give way. Whatever interim protection the government offers, it will soon be swept away in the quest for profits-profits which, in many cases, will be lost to Australia and will go overseas to aggravate our debt. Without the safeguards provided by a publicly owned Telstra which is subject to the direction of a minister, ordinary Australians and ordinary businesses in rural and regional areas could soon be paying the full cost of installing and maintainministers ing services---compliments of the National and Liberal party members in this parliament. That would put a telephone connection beyond the reach of so many people. In my own electorate of Corio it would cost $500; in Corangamite, $700; in Bendigo, $900; in MCEwen, $500. Where will the pensioners get the money to connect? What about the farmers battling drought? We hear from the National Party members about how badly done by these farmers are-and they really are-in drought conditions. Where are they going to afford the $1,000 that is going to be required to connect their phones? I come from a rural background. We could never afford a phone in our household. The good times came in the 1970s and the 1980s-(Time expired)",72
156,Mr COBB,COMMITTEE,"If ever we have heard a blast from the past, it was from the previous speaker, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). He went so far back into Labor ideology that he made Jennie George sound like a sensitive new age girl. I was most amused listening to the member for Corio deriding Howard because he is a man with a common touch. He has been Prime Minister of this country for barely two months and is already becoming much loved. He is obviously destined to be one of the greatest prime ministers, if not the greatest, this country has ever seen--compared with the elitist, Zegna-suited person who has just gone out. Here was the member for Corio berating our Prime Minister for eating in the staff cafeteria. I have been here for 11 years and I have dined in the staff cafeteria, the members and guests dining room and the members dining room, yet I never saw the former Prime Minister grace the latter two establishments once, let alone the staff cafeteria. I welcome the fact that John Howard is mixing with the battlers-if you like, with the common, average Australian people. I hope he keeps it up. I am sure he will keep it up and it will be a very pleasant change from what has gone before. I welcome the sale of one-third of Telstra, as proposed in this bill. I congratulate the involved on the way the bill has been drawn up. I welcome it because of the benefits that will flow to the customers of Australia, especially rural customers. In that regard, I am pleased to note that the National Farmers Federation has endorsed this bill enthusiastically and hopes that it will be passed unamended by both chambers of this parliament. Why do I accept this bill? Because I do not sit in cloistered rooms with silver service all the time. I have been out there. I accept it because wherever I have gone I have observed that, as a general rule, businesses are much better run by private individuals in ownership than governments in ownership. Take something simple like a tractor. If it is owned by the community it is never as well looked after or well utilised as it is if it is owned by an individual, who will carry out a grease and oil change on a regular basis, house it under cover and nurse it when it is being driven around the paddock. It is just common sense. It does not matter whether you look at an implement or an industry. Take the freight industry. Let us compare the trucking industry, which is run by the private sector, and the rail industry, which is run by government. It is like chalk and cheese. Let us go a step further and look at countries and see how businesses are run. Look at the standard of living of the people in, say, Taiwan compared with China, or South Korea compared with North Korea, or the old East Germany compared with the old West Germany. Surely the lessons of history can be learnt by this opposition. Even with telecommunications, I think we have seen what has happened since Optos has been allowed to come on the scene. The service has improved with Telecom, and Telstra as it is called now. SID charges have plunged. Itemised billing is now becoming readily available. Getting an itemised bill was like extracting teeth from a hen prior to Optus arriving on the scene. When Optus can come in and compete with Telstra for local calls, no doubt we will see the price of local calls come down, too. Incidentally, the change of name under the previous government from Telecom to Telstra cost $4- million. That is something I just note as an aside. When you think about it, Telstra is, in effect, almost half privati sed now. Why do I say that? Optus can, or soon will be able to, compete with Telstra on an equal footing in almost every area. Telstra been part privatised with no dollar benefit to the government at all. In effect, the previous government gave away half of Telstra's monopoly when it allowed Optus and Vodafone into the field. So competition has come, and we have seen the benefits of that with mobile phones. The cost of the phones alone has plunged from several hundred dollars to $100 or so in many instances. Most of that benefit from competition has flowed through to customers. We are now proposing to go a step further. We will not just introduce more competition, which is very welcoming and which we have welcomed in the past, but we will introduce more choice. We will open up the field for an injection of further capital into Telstra. We will open up new investment possibilities and innovation-all these types of things. It is worthwhile examining in some detail what we are proposing. If you listened to the opposition you would think we were selling it all off, that most of it would be going overseas and we would never see it again and people would be ripping off profits-all these sorts of things. We are selling one-third of Telstra. If you look at the other side of the equation, we are retaining two-thirds of it in government ownership. Of the third that we are selling, we are transferring it from government ownership to direct ownership by the people, so that people can have more direct input into what Telstra does. Of that third, overseas ownership will be limited to less than 12 per centexactly 11.6667 per cent. In other words, over 88 per cent of Telstra will remain Australian owned. That is what our so-called draconian proposal is offering. As to overseas ownership, anyone individual-that is, a private individual or private company-can own no more than 1.6667 per cent. That will prevent any overseas company having a substantial position in Telstra and running dead on a contract overseas, such as in Indonesia, on which they may be in opposition with Telstra or which we may be looking at. In addition to that, we have further safehas guards. The chairperson of Telstra will be an Australian. The head office of Telstra will remain in Australia, and the majority of the directors of Telstra will be Australian. On top of that, the present universal service obligations will remain the same as they have been under the previous Labor government and previous coalition governments. They will remain exactly as is, with the exception that we will probably, in the not too distant future, enhance and extend those universal service obligations, which is something to be welcomed. We will also bring in a customer service guarantee-something that has not properly existed until now. That will apply to connections, to services, to the rectification of faults, to keeping appointments with customers and so on. If Telstra or any other carriers fall down on that, penalties will be put in place that will be paid one way or another to the customer who has been let down. I think that will make for a much better service in this country and customers will welcome this excellent innovation. Presently, Telstra probably has about $25 billion or $30 billion of assets. If we conservatively said that one-third of Telstra was worth $8 billion, what is the government going to do when it receives that money? One billion dollars, or $1,000 million, will be put into the National Heritage Trust. The remaining $7 billion, which I believe will be the least that we will receive for selling off one-third, will be used to pay off the debt that the former government ran up. It is to their everlasting shame that they lifted the overseas debt in this country from about $23 billion, when we took over, to about $185 billion or thereabouts today. Even the federal government segment of that debt, as we heard in question time today, has tripled in the last three or four years. If we can get some of that down, it can only benefit the Australian people. If, for example, we could pay off $7,000 million of that debt and we were paying 10 per cent interest on it, that would save us $700 million of interest every year that would otherwise be flowing out of Australia. Even if we were only paying, say, five per cent interest, that $350 million a year in interest payments going out of Australia that would remain in Australia and could be used for the benefit of the Australian people, not just next year but the year after and the year after that in perpetuity-in other words, forever. That is what this opposition will be denying us if they vote against this in the Senate. Again, that will be to their everlasting shame. Here is a chance to start to restore Australia's sovereignty which has slipped away from us over the last decade or so. This opposition for some strange, ideological reason wants to deny us this chance. Here we are with the opportunity to have the best of both worlds-majority Australian ownership, in excess of 88 per cent, and the ability to retire a lot of debt and cut out hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments going overseas-and this opposition for some reason wants to block it. Personally, I just cannot understand it. The Natural Heritage Trust, which is going to absorb $1,000 million of the sale proceeds, will also be blocked if this opposition votes against it. In my electorate-through which the Darling River runs, taking up several hundred kilometres in its long voyage-the farmers will be very disappointed indeed if this is blocked. If it is not blocked, we could start to rehabilitate the deterioration that is taking place in our inland river systems, not just the Darling River but other rivers that flow through my electorate like the Lachlan River, the Bogan River and so on. I will list some of the things which will be put in place if we can set up this trust. There will be $318 million set aside for a major national vegetation initiative to tackle the problems of land and water degradation in Australia. There will be $163 million set aside to implement the Murray-Darling 2001 project to rehabilitate the vital Murray-Darling Basin. There will be $32 million set aside for a national land and water resources audit to provide the first ever national appraisal of the extent of land and water degradation in Australia and its environmental and economic cost to the nation. For the first time, this could even look at is seeing whether it is viable to tum some of our coastal streams such as the Clarence back inland into the Darling. There are a lot of people in favour of that. I think we need some hard figures to see whether it is viable or not. Members on the other side laugh at these sorts of things, but I can tell you that people in the country from all political persuasions are in favour of having a look to see whether it is feasible or not. Eighty million dollars will be given for the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to preserve Australia's biodiversity. As a veterinarian in my previous profession, I welcome that entirely. Also, $100 million will be put aside for a coast and clean seas initiative to tackle the environmental problems facing our coasts and oceans. At the end of the five-year program which does all this, we will still have $300 million left that will remain in the trust in perpetuity, held on behalf of all Australians to enhance the quality of the environment in which we live. I hope that will be possible if this bill is passed. It amazes me to see the hypocrisy of the members of the ALP who say they are going to vote against this. They said they would never privatise Australian Airlines. What happened? They did. They said they would never privatise Qantas and, of course, they did-l00 per cent of it. At one stage most of it went into foreign ownership. Time and time again they said, even in writing, that they would never privatise their absolute icon, the Commonwealth Bank-and, of course, they did. They said they would never privatise other things, and they went ahead and did so, or tried to do so-the Federal Airports Corporation, AIDC, ANL. I do not think anybody doubted that if the Labor Party had won the last electionheaven forbid-it would have privatised Telstra. The previous Prime Minister, who drove the , ALP throughout the last 13 years, is on record time and time again arguing passionately not to sell a third of Telstra but to sell 100 per cent of Telstra. It has been documented by the previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, in his memoirs; it has been documented by Senator Richardson, a previous minister for communications, in his memoirs; and it has been documented by Senator Rober!: Ray in the television series LAbor in Power. The previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, argued passionately in the cabinet for the sale of Telstra, and he was defeated. At the last election the Labor Party ran a scurrilous scare campaign saying that the coalition would do all sorts of things if it won the election. They said that the cross-subsidy would be abolished and country people would suffer. This has been reflected in the words of the opposition speakers here tonight. The cross-subsidy is something that the coalition has fought hard for over the years, more so than the Australian Labor Party. The National Party, in particular, has fought hard for it. The cross-subsidy in total amounts to about one per cent of Telstra's total revenue, so it is no big deal anyway. It can be maintained without hurting Telstra in the future in whatever form it may take. We hear people, such as the Labor candidate who ran against me and Senator West, say that the phone users of Broken Hill will have to pay an extra $3,400 per phone line per year. Have you ever heard such rubbish? Broken Hill is a grand city of 24,000 people. If the cross-subsidy were $3,400 per year, it would only show how inefficient Telstra had been but, of course, no such thing will ever eventuate. They even went on to say that it is going to cost people in remote areas of my electorate $20,000 to connect a phone. For heaven's sake, a satellite phone can be bought now for about $6,500! I spoke to a fellow the other day who has half a dozen of them. Why pay $20,000 for a connection if that were the case? It was the coalition that put those subsidies in place to help people in remote areas because we were concerned about those people. Why would we be taking the crosssubsidies away? We put them in place. They were put there when we were in government, and we supported the Labor Party when it supported them in government. It is crazy to make such silly accusations. It falls into the same category as the scare campaign the Labor Party ran with its 'Selstra' bills that it sent to people, even in nursing homes. This distressed them. These were elderly people. On the back these bills had things like, 'Disconnected. The Liberals will sell off Telstra' and pictures of old people with anguished looks on their faces. One person in Dubbo, when he received this bill, went into hyperventilation and had to be revived. Those bills caused great distress. They were totally deceptive. That is the low level that the now opposition stooped to in its desperate attempt to win the last election. The rhetoric of the opposition in the debates today is not much better. Many benefits will flow through to the Australian people if the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill is allowed to go through. It will pass through the House of Representatives, but whether it gets through the Senate we can only wait and see. If it does, it will undoubtedly speed up Australia's acquisition of a world-class telecommunications industry in the areas of technology, lower pricing, quality, and those things, because it will promote competition in the provision of services. As we have said, we will preserve the universal service obligation and we will, perhaps, enhance it later on. This will make Telstra more responsive to market signals than it has been, which will mean better service for customers. Price capping will be put on and maintained, dropping, by an average of 7- per cent per year, the cost of customer services. For the first time there will be true shareholder accountability, along with that maximum competition that I have spoken of, leading to lower prices and higher quality services. Telstra is now the only telecommunications industry amongst the top 20 in the world that crossis not already privatised or listed for privatisation. If we go back to what the Labor Party now say they propose, the 'business as usual, she'll be right, leave it as it is' approach, then we will be condemning Telstra to the slow progress that it has made in recent years.

157,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEE,"We are finally here at the great Telstra debate. Dare I describe it as a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil? I must admit it has a ring to it because no matter how much the government members squawk about their mandate or about the Australian people having voiced their approval of the sale, they just cannot hide the fact that what they are offering here is evil, distasteful and that its successful passage will mean disaster for so many Australians throughout our nation. Their argument of a mandate is critically flawed. Deep down in their hearts they know that the majority of Australians do not want Telstra sold. They do not want 33 per cent of it sold; they do not even want three per cent of it sold, not to foreigners, nor to, as they want to tell us, dinky-di Aussies. 'Come over to the dark side, ' they are saying to the Australian people. We are going to do our best to stop them in this very evil scheme, not because you may think in opposition we have a lot of time on our hands but because we know it is the right thing to do. It is the honest thing to do and it is what the majority of Australians want us to do. Since the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) dropped the Telstra bombshell a few days before the election campaign began, Australians have been facing the awful prospect of what a coalition government would do to their telecommunications company. It was not a policy that the Prime Minister announced outside of the election campaign. He did not inform Australians of his plan a year ago. He dropped it and ran as fast as his legs would carry him barely a month before the election day and he kept running until 2 March. He is still running. The Prime Minister now wants to ram the Telstra legislation through this House, he wants to hammer it through the Senate and then, when he has finished doing that, he is going to roll up his sleeves and jam it down the throats of all Australians. And all the time the Prime Minister is saying how great it is going to be, how one-eighth of the money will go to his environment trust, how we will all live on honey and cream and that everything is just peachy-dory. Well, I've got news for him. Never mind the fact that he stands behind the controls, orchestrating the largest blackmailing of the Australian people ever perpetrated in this House. And he called the Labor government arrogant! The Prime Minister is saying, 'If you don't give me what I want, if you don't let me sell one-third of Telstra, then you're not going to stuff have an environmental policy.' Like some tyrant from the dark ages, the Prime Minister is willing to let Australia's environment suffer, decay, wilt and just blow away unless he and the government get their way. This is the Prime Minister who holds himself up as some sort of doyen of decency, as a Richard the Lionheart of the 1990s in Australia who is going to lead us all on a pilgrimage to the values of yesteryear, who says he holds dear to his heart the values of honesty, faithfulness and trust. Yet now he stands revealed in his true shape, like, dare I say, a bent Mafia standover man, a don of deceit, extorting the Australian people and ransoming our environment in order to get what he wants. What do we get if the Prime Minister succeeds in selling Telstra? We know he is swinging that giant environment carrot in front of all of our faces, but let us take a look at what the Australian people are really in for should the Prime Minister and his government succeed in their unholy crusade, or maybe it is best to look at what we will not get from one-third of Telstra-a share of the profits, for one thing! In 1995, Telstra paid $2.73 billion to governments in taxes and dividends-money that helps support our health, education and . environment. In 1995, Telstra made an aftertax profit of $1.75 billion-money that remained in this country to support our telecommunications industry. Our Prime Minister sits there twisting our arms. 'But I'm only going to sell one-third of Telstra,' he says. 'Only one-third of that will go to foreign ownership,' he says. That is supposed to make us all feel so much better. If you look at last year's profit of $1.75 billion and imagine one-third of Telstra already having been sold-33 per cent of that would therefore go to private shareholdersthat is over $500 million lining the pockets of private investors. One-third of that, earmarked for ownership by private foreign investors, would be a little less than $200 million. That is $200 million leaving the country by the truckload: $200 million that previously would have remained in Australia backing up our telecommunications service. That is just not acceptable. While the Prime Minister may swear until he is blue in the face that only 35 per cent of Telstra will be sold to foreign interests, the facts of the market prove that he will not be able to keep his word on this, even if he wanted to. Australian investors alone will not be able to find the finances needed. How do we know this? Take a look at the Commonwealth Bank, and that has been mentioned in the debate here tonight. Foreign institutions will need to playa major role if its remaining 54 per cent is to be sold, yet the market has only been asked to find some $4 billion for this float. Let us take a look at Qantas-something that has been rammed down our throats tonight. The share market almost choked at the prospect of swallowing the $1.5 billion required to buy Qantas, yet the privatisation of one-third of Telstra is worth over five times that much. Take a look at Optus. Our previous Labor government relaxed foreign ownership restrictions on Optus to facilitate its float, yet it looking for less than $1 billion on the stock market. Here we are through this bill looking to raise $8 billion for the sale of Telstra. This leads us to a very interesting question; that is, what is Telstra really worth? It is $30 billion, according to Senator Alston, who admitted that himself in August of last year. Yet, if my sums are right-and correct me if I am wrong-if the government plans to sell one-third of Telstra for $8 billion, then doesn't that mean that it has revalued it at only $24 billion? What happened to the other $6 billion? I can see looks of disbelief over there on the government benches. They can say, 'Yes, what has happened to the other $6 billion? It must be around here some place.' I tell them that they can stop looking behind their seats because it has just been discarded; it has been thrown away like yesterday's news. It has now become that ex-$6 billion. The Prime Minister has devalued Telstra to sweeten the deal for his big investing friends. He has just lopped $6 billion off Telstra's worth to keep his mates happy at the top end of town. He has also had it devalued in a vain attempt to reach a buying price attainable by Australian shareholders. But, as I have explained, he will not be able to make this stick. Despite the Prime Minister's repeated assurances that the presence of shareholders-in particular, foreign shareholders-would not interfere with the service Australians expect from Telstra, the reality is that their presence would have a major detrimental influence. A partial sale of Telstra involves the same consequences as a full sale. Once listed on the stock exchange, once it has private shareholders, Telstra's directors will be bound by law to look after their interests. A shareholder's main interest is, of course, and rightly so, increasing his or her profits. That is what the shareholders will demand of their company's directors, and that is what the directors are duty-bound to deliver. So, how would they go about fulfilling their obligations and maximising returns to their shareholders? Well, prices would go higher for a start. We have a wonderful example quite close to home. When Telecom New is Zealand was privati sed in 1990, public phone charges rose. A call used to cost NZ20c, now it costs 20e a minute. Since that year, residential line rental charges have risen every year. Timed local calls were introduced for business customers. A similar story is told in the United Kingdom, where British residential customers still pay more than we do for a four-minute telephone call-this is despite British Telecom being privati sed more than 10 years ago. How else would profits be maximised? You can be pretty sure that when the privatisation barbarians burst through the gate they are going to let thousands of Telstra workers in the name of greater profitability. This only will be a tragedy in itself but will to a sure-fire degradation in the standard of our telecommunications service. Let us again take a look at New Zealand. Last year the company's fault clearance rate plummeted, with less than 60 per cent of reported faults being fixed by 5 p.m. the following day. In Britain, that great flagship of privatisation, 10 per cent of households still not reached by British Telecom, compared to only four per cent in Australia. When British Telecom was privati sed, the staff cuts it introduced were massive. Its services collapsed to such an extent that telecommunications regulator in that country, Oftel, had to step in and impose financial penalties on BT for every day that it failed repair a phone. Telecom New Zealand has perceived shed nearly half of its staff since it was in 1990. Is this Australia's future after one-third Telstra is sold? Despite his grand words and his majestic assurances that Telstra's services will not suffer, the Prime Minister us this guarantee, much as he would like us to believe he can. It is not within his just as he cannot sprout wings and fly around this chamber. Yet the sale of Telstra cannot be bad news for everyone, can it? It is certainly good for the shareholders, those who are going buy into it. Let us look across the Tasman again. Since 1990, dividends per share for investors in New Zealand Telecom have risen by nearly 300 per cent. Since 1992, it handed over more than 90 per cent of its postmandate tax profit to its shareholders. It has, in fact, figures. become one of the world's most profitable companies. I am sure that we can expect similar results here for the thousands of Australian small shareholders who would like to take a slice of the Telstra pie. Or can we expect similar results? The results may be similar, but whether the profits end up in the pockets of Australia's small investors is another thing altogether. From British experience, we can see that very little of the privati sed British Telecom is actually owned by the small private investor. Sharethe go holders with 800 shares or less own 11 per not cent of the company. Those with smaller lead parcels of shares own only four per cent. I think we can read this as meaning that, however much of Telstra is sold, in the end most of the profits will go to the pockets of the big boys, whether they be Australian or otherwise. Remember that, while 90 per cent of New Zealand Telecom's post-tax profits flow on to its shareholders, 80 per cent of that are goes to shareholders overseas. Still they say that this is what the Australian people want. They say, 'We have a mandate.' What rot! Are you that simple? Are you that uncomplicated that you can imagine the your victory on 2 March was a vote for the sale of one-third of Telstra? The Australian people voted against what they perceived as to Labor's failings. They voted against what they as a government that did not listen. sold They voted for a government which they hoped would pay attention to what they had of to say. That is your mandate. That is what the Australian people have decreed, to listen to what they have to say-and they say, 'Don't cannot give sell Telstra.' The Herald AGB poll featured in the power, Sydney Morning Herald on 21 January showed that 61 per cent of Australians do not support the Prime Minister's intention to sell one-third of Telstra. If you do not want to news believe that, perhaps government members to should remember that, while Labor's primary vote fell nationally on 2 March by 6.17 per cent, the coalition's rose by only 1.92 per cent. I do not think it is unreasonable of me has to challenge the government's supposed to sell one-third of Telstra on those What we have is a giant paradox of a Prime Minister-'a riddle wrapped inside a mystery inside an enigma'. He says he wants to lead a government that attends to the people. He says he wants to listen to what Australians have to say. Yet when they open their mouths to speak, he just puts his hands over his ears and shuts off all their objections. He says he the wants to govern for all Australians, yet he seems intent on governing for only the 29 per cent who agree with, or would benefit from, partial sale of Telstra, or the high rollers who would dominate such a sale. Who could support him in such a scheme? My attention is suddenly drawn to the benches occupied by my honourable colleagues in the National Party. They are not here at the moment, but the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was previously speaking. I wonder how much they must be feeling about the whole Telstra question at the moment. They're a stoical bunch-and I use 'stoical' in the Australian Oxford Dictionary's definition of the word, meaning 'showing great self-control in adversity'. They have certainly got their brave faces on. They are saying, 'Yes, PM, we are with you all the way.' They're saying that through gritted teeth. But inside their guts are turning to water. They know, as do we, as does the Prime Minister, what the partial sale of Telstra would do to the bush. Members of the National Party have said so themselves. You've got the flighty and nervous member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who jumped into the debate in February exclaiming his concerns that selling parts of Telstra would lead to the end of cross-subsidies on telephone services for rural users and higher prices. Let me tell you what he, in his own inimitable fashion, said on ABC radio in February: 'We', meaning the National Party, 'have always objected strenuously against the sale.' Then you've got the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)--,-new to the House but still not afraid to speak out about issues have the capacity to hurt her and her constituParty ents. The honourable member said that she reserves the right to take a stand on the Telstra issue-and quite rightly too. I must encourage her in her endeavours in this regard. This is the thin end of the wedge. The rank and file of the National Party must be tearing their hair out. Certainly their natural power base-the farmers of Australia-are in the correspondence we are receiving. Take Mr .Ken Badenoch, the Victorian Farmers Federation Executive Director. Ten days after the National Farmers Federation toed the official National Party line and warned the Australian Democrats not to block the partial sale of Telstra, Mr Badenoch defied his national leadership by warning against such a move. Late last month, Mr Badenoch said that even a partially privatised Telstra would hurt farmers and country areas due to the massive job cuts that would eventuate. He went on to say that the temptation for Telstra to cut the quality of services in those remote, unprofitable areas not threatened by competition would be too strong and that 'when push comes to shove the weaker people at the end of the chain are likely to suffer'. How true his words are. The people in the bush are more than a little concerned. As the main benefactors of the Prime Minister's planned environmental policy, they like the idea of his $1 billion environmental trust. Yet with the partial sale of Telstra to finance it, they're going to get their teeth kicked out for the privilege. While the Prime Minister and his handbag for a deputy, the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), may mouth off about the importance to the government of Australia's country population, they are obviously not so important that the government is going to give them this environmental policy without them having to pay something back in return. The people in Australia's rural areas have a right to be concerned about this issue. They are the ones who are going to suffer the most. Yet their elected representatives in the National Party are about to sell them down the river because they are too busy kowtowing to their coalition partners and their pinstrlped, grand that prix mates. Those members of the National who choose not to speak out about their concerns on this issue should be ashamed of themselves. They are neglecting their responsibilities as elected representatives. They talk about Labor being governed by vested interests, yet they're letting themselves be swayed not by the law of good sense and sound government but by what makes good sense for the few businessmen who would benefit from Telstra's partial sale. The argument spewing from the government benches is so predictable. They call us hypocrites for blocking Telstra after supporting the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet they know Telstra and the effects of its sale are an entirely different ballgame. Failing to present it to the Australian people as such is deceitful in the extreme. By the time the decision was taken to privatise the Commonwealth Bank, its functions as a central bank had been taken away. It had become another first-rate trading bank in the company of other fine privately owned institutions. In contrast, Telstra is Australia's greatest business. Its role in Australian society remains as central as when the Commonwealth Bank played the role of Australia's Reserve Bank. Selling it, or even a portion of it, should be as unthinkable as it would have been to sell any part of the Commonwealth Bank when in its capacity as our central bank. Nor was the sale of the Commonwealth Bank ever held over the heads of ordinary Australians in an unconscionable act of blackmail. The Prime Minister wants Australians to pay close attention to his bottom line of $8 billion, yet I read it as being very different. read it as saying that the men and women of Australia have spent 100 years building Telstra for you and me. Now the Prime Minister wants to take their hard work, which has made it one of the world's finest telecommunications networks, and allow somebody else to profit from it. I am selfish enough to believe that, when it comes to the choice of either having a clean and healthy Australian environment or keeping lOOper cent of Telstra in Australian hands, we should be able to have our cake and eat it too. I want the government to protect our environment and protect our lands from erosion, but I want them to protect the interests of future Australians who will benefit from a publicly owned Telstra sitting on the doorstep of Asia's telecommunications boom. I want the government to save our waterways and coastlines from further degradation, yet I also want them to save Australians from the degradation of Telstra's services which will surely come when its private buyers grab the reins. I want the government to guard the environmental interests of the nation's farmers and rural Australians, but I want them to make sure that they keep it within the hands of the parliament. (Time expired)",80
158,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"Cowan) (9.31 p.m.}-I am always interested to listen to the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) speak. I was most enthralled by her comments. I had a whole pad here ready to take notes to rebut some of the points of debate. It reminded me of some of the Jeffrey Archer novels that I have been reading recently. Jeffrey, who will be touring Australia shortly, wrote a book entitled First Among Equals. In it he was talking about all this debate and grand posturing in the chamber and the House of Commons and all that sort of thing. I think we have just seen a good example of posturing in parliament. Mr Campbell interjecting Mr RICHARD EVAN8-I may do the same, but at least there will be a bit more depth in it than what we have heard from the other side of parliament. The member for Prospect spoke about arrogance and how arrogant, supposedly, the Liberal Party is on I this particular issue. I cannot believe that the member for Prospect even mentioned the word-crossing her lips-'arrogant'. How dare someone from the Labor Party, which was miserably defeated on 2 March, come into this place and talk about arrogance I Mrs Crosio-And you sell Telstra. Mr RICHARD EVAN8-Here she is now bleating something about the election and maybe even about the bill in protest. I may have to go through some of the points I noted here. The member for Prospect talked about yesteryear. The Labor Party always talks about yesteryear. I will refer to some of the things mentioned by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). He was talking about Tories. What is a Tory? I don't even know this language that these people speak. He spoke about President Reagan. He is dead, isn'the? The honourable member spoke about reforms in New Zealand. Weren't the reforms in New Zealand introduced by the Labor Party? He even spoke about Thatcher. Who is Thatcher? What is Thatcherism? This is 1980s stuff. Since Thatcherism and Reaganism there has been a breakdown of the Berlin Wall. Communism has gone away. We have suddenly discovered all these countries around Russia and they are still talking about Reaganism and Thatcherism. I say to the member for Prospect that the world moves on. She is still in yesteryear. She is still talking about these things. She is talking about shares of profit. Where are Australians sharing in the profits of Telecom right now? They are not. We are in debt in Australia-debt that your party gave us over the last 13 years. Where do the profits that Telecom make go? They go into consolidated revenue. What for? To pay off all the expenses that you bring to our country and the debt that you gave us. That is where the profits are going. Why can't we share some of those profits with some of the small Australians who might want to invest in some of our great institutions of Australia? That is the whole point. The member for Prospect talked about mates. She talked about the mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). In fact, the member for Corio talked about some of his mates in the sandwich bar downstairs. The member for Prospect never talks about the former Prime Minister's mates who went to gaol in Western Australia, for instance. spoke about the top end of town. For one thing, the former Prime Minister did not even the chair. live in his own electorate. He had a house in Red Hill. He had the Lodge. He also had house in Elizabeth Bay, or somewhere. He never even lived in his electorate and she is talking about the top end of town. How hypoof critical of her to come into this place and to talk about the values of the Labor Party withoutMrs Crosio---I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am listening with great intent to what the honourable has to say. I never mentioned anything about where the previous Prime Minister lived. My point of order is that, if he is so concerned about that, is he just as concerned about this Prime Minister operating out of Kirribilli House in Sydney instead of the Lodge in .Canberra? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs as Sullivan)-Order! Points of order are not be raised as an opportunity to re-enter debate. If there is a point of order and relates to the standing orders, raise it properly.",84
159,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"The honourable member for Prospect was talking about increasing profits and she wondered where were the benefits from this particular sale of Telstra. She suggested that the only way to increase profit is to increase price. If you look at the background of the Labor Party, it is obvious that none of them has actually been in business, none of them actually understands how to create wealth, none of them knows how to raise money-none of them knows about that at all. They do not know about productivity; they do not know about expansion of market. Mrs Crosio---Madarn Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order and it is a relevant point of order. I believe my character has been impugned. I operated a business for 27 years and I will not be party to that statement. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-You will resume your seat. You will not raise spurious points of order. If you think you have a case for misrepresentation, you will raise the issue in a proper way, and it is not in the middle of She another member's speech. The member for Prospect has been given a lot of leeway by",85
160,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"Thank you, a Madam Deputy Speaker. The member for Prospect does not like me. In fact, many times in the last parliament she had a lot of points order against me. I raised a lot of money try and I paid my taxes. She also talked about unemployment. I am given to understand that Telstra is currently owned by the public purse and is going through a de-employment program-this is called shedding staff. So Telstra is actually shedding staff at the moment member before we even privatise. You are worried about employment. Why are you not worried about this now? Why is Telstra doing it now? It has been under your management for the last 13 years. You will say: who will win? The small share market holder will not win. Well, who will win? Maybe some of the institutions will win, such the AMP Society, a good Australian to company. Maybe National Mutual will win, the a good Australian company. And who owns it National Mutual and the AMP? BattlersAustralians who are putting money away for their superannuation and their pensions. Why not share in Telstra's profits that way? all! You say we have not got a mandate. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I appreciate that feelings are running high in this debate, but would you please address your comments through the chair. When you use the term 'you', you are referring to the chair. Mrs Crosio--And read the bill. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I do not need any help from the member for Prospect. The member for Cowan has the call.",85
161,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"The member for Prospect said, 'But we haven't got a mandate.' Let me just talk. about Cowan because I know Cowan very well. The Labor Party does not know Cowan. In Cowan we raised the issue of Telstra; we worked on this particular issue of Telstra. The Labor Party said that it would·win the seat of Cowan based on Telstra. Guess what? It did not win it-it did not win it! And in the case of the Democrats, guess what? Sixty per cent of the people who voted for the Democrats in Cowan put their preferences to the Liberal Party. What does that mean? That means they support the partial privatisation of Telstra. (Quorum formed) I want to thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) for giving me an audience. My colleagues will laugh about the member for Prospect's speech, and I have a couple of other points to talk about. She spoke about polls. One of the biggest polls you can have in Australian politics is a federal election. On 2 March you guys lost, we won. We have the mandate to sell only one-third of Telstra to the Australian people and that is what we are planning to do in this legislation. You say you want this for the environment, you want this for Telstra, you want this for the Australian community, but for 13 years you did not listen once to what the Australian people had to say. You sent us into miserable debt, you gave us unemployment and you increased youth suicide-indirectly, maybe. You did all that and you did not address it. say to the three of you who are there now: Not at you just cannot cope with losing. What is this legislation doing for the Australian people? We are providing a standard telephone service to all Australians, contrary to what the member for Prospect is saying, regardless of where they live. Unlike some little by-elections in South Australia when they had an incarnation of other South Australian seats, we actually guarantee untimed local calls. We have an obligation to both private and business users if they desire to do this. We have a price cap, which means that the prices for Telstra's main services will reduce by an average of 7.5 per cent annually, contrary to anything you have said on that side of the parliament. There is also provision to ensure that Telstra will stay Australian. Do you have something against Australians? You must have because you do not even want to listen to what they have to say at the elections. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order!",86
162,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, I meant to say that they have something against Australians. Its head office will stay in Australia and its chairperson and the majority of the directors are to be Australian citizens.",86
163,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. You previously asked the member to address his remarks through the chair. He has consistently failed to do so. Could you advise him again? He is painful enough to listen to anyway. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I have actually done that and he acceded to it about 90 seconds ago.",86
164,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"We are not talking about 11 - per cent of 100 per cent; it is 11 - per cent of 30 per cent. The member for Prospect should try to understand this. Mr Lindsay-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could I ask the chair to recognise standing order 55 and refer it to the member for Prospect, please? Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The member for Prospect actually has been spoken I to this evening. She is behaving comparatively well at the moment. We will not tempt fate any further.",86
165,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"She is doing extremely well, and I do not need the protection of my colleagues. It is 11 per cent of one-third only, not of 100 per cent. Do the mathematical geniuses on the other side of the parliament really understand that they in fact lost on 2 March? It is actually 11 per cent of one-third, not 11 per cent of 100 per cent. Let me just work this out quickly. That means there is only a minutia of overseas ownership in Telstra's one-third; the rest will be owned by Australians. You must have something absolutely wrong at the base of your spine if you think there is something wrong with Australians owning Australian companies. You must have something unbelievably wrong with you. You are against competition. You do not want Telstra to be in competition. You do not want it to go offshore and earn some extra cash. You want it to stay in Australia and not earn more money. There is something wrong with you-not you, sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, not you at all. We are going to raise $8 billion from this particular sale of one-third of Telstra-only one-third, not the massive 100 per cent that those opposite would have you believe. And where is the money going? First of all, we are going to cut some of the massive debt that they gave us. Secondly,·it is going into the environment. Does the Labor Party see something wrong with looking after the environment? This money will attack the insidious problem of spreading salinity and rising water tables. Is there something wrong with that? ft is going towards battling rising water tables and unabating erosion. Is there something wrong with that? Mrs Crosio--No.",87
166,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"How are you going to pay for it? Mrs Crosio--Fund it, in the budget.",87
167,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE,"We are going to pay for it by selling one-third of Telstra. The member for Prospect must understand that noxious weeds are spreading and that we have to address those sorts of issues by selling one-third of Telstra. If we have another federal election these noxious weeds might disappear but we have to work on it. The widespread land and water degradation affecting many thousands of once productive hectares-the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr CatnpbeIl) will probably relate to this-will be addressed under this legislation. But you see, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Labor Party only wants to talk about yesteryear. The member for Corio even spoke about Pig-Iron Bob, going back to the 1930s. It is like going back to the future! This bill covers so many of the questions and concerns raised by Australians. It provides for structured reporting mechanisms and for appropriate powers of the parliament and the minister. It has costing structures for private users and business. It has shareholder accountability. The word accountability starts with an A and is in the Oxford and Macquarie dictionaries, yet it is something the Labor Party government never even recognised. It does not even understand the word. This bill talks about performance assessment and accountability. In fact, a host of queries and concerns we have gathered from around the country will be addressed by the one-third sale of Telstra proposed by this bill. The bill provides five benchmarks: a standard telephone system that is reasonably accessible to and equitable for all Australians; a system available to private residents as well as businesses; a reliable supplier of this system; a system of payphones over and above those provided in private premises; and a supplier who will provide, install and maintain payphone and other services. If the member for Prospect had read the bill she would have realised that. I commenced this address by stating my emphatic belief that in this place we should address the national interest, not party politics. But with the Labor Party's rhetoric we are always hearing about what is in the best interests of the Labor Party, never what is good for Australia. Actually, it was the Labor . Party which put this proposal to the Australian people on 2 March and, guess what, they rejected Labor's notion, its big picture, its idea of the future, and chose us, the coalition, who sit not just on this side, as Labor did, but right around to the other side of the chamber. That was an emphatic decision by the Australian people. They support this legislation. Let me quote the words of the former Treasurer, Mr Willis. He said: The decision to privatise has been endorsed by Cabinet in respect of Qantas and AIDC, the Federal airports and ANL. These are all areas which the Government is committed to privati sing and essentially the decisions to take those steps been reached in Cabinet without demur. One minute they want to privatise, the next minute they do not. Does the Labor Party really understand where it is going? Has it lost the big picture? Mr Willis went on to say: It would have some implications for budgetary outcome in subsequent years, but it's not just a budgetary thing. The former Treasurer went on to say other things about the Commonwealth Bank. He promised at one stage that the Commonwealth Bank would not be sold and then said that. The former Prime Minister, nice man that he was, said on 8 October 1995 on the Sunday program: I'm confident that the Australian public will vote for the party it believes can govern Australia in Australia's best interests. In another television interview he said: But I do believe the public expect that when they give a government a mandate, they expect it to go and do it. Well, on 2 March the Australian public gave the Liberal and National parties the mandate to go and deliver on our promises. We are looking forward to introducing our promises. We are looking forward to delivering to Australia what Australians want. And they want just a little bit of ownership of one of the best companies in Australia. You on that side of parliament are denying the average Australian a small piece of Australia. The Liberal and National parties are for all Australians. That was our slogan. I say thank you to the member for Prospect, and good night.",87
168,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,"Kalgoorlie) (9.51 p.m.}---I would say to the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) that self-deception is the greatest treason. He ought to remember how grateful he should be to Paul Keating. It was, without a doubt, Paul Keating who won the seat of Cowan-Paul Keating, coupled with the gross stupidity of the Western Australian Labor Party. But the member will be very unwise to think he won it on merit. After all, he was put on notice by the Liberal Party in Western Australia, which was very unhappy with his performance. So he knows that what I say is true. Mr Richard Evans-They always hate have all winners-and I'm a winner, buddy!",88
169,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,"I would suggest that you use more of that water you were talking about. You find that it reduces the effects. I now want to talk about mandate. It is quite clear that the Liberal Party does not have a mandate. Your election was overwhelmingly a vote against Keating. Aware that they had an alternative, the Australian electors grabbed it with both hands. That is why we are here. They voted for Independents where they got the opportunity. They voted for you because they could not cop any more of Keating. Let us look at the overseas experience. People who go overseas realise two things, I think. One is the high standard of Australian motels and their relative cheapness, and the other is the high quality of Telecom. If you go to Europe or the United States, you will not find one better than Telecom. France probably comes closest. In my view, France has one of the great communications organisations in the world, and it improved its service in the last decade. I can remember going to France when that service was appalling. A lot of the technology you see around Australia today is actually of French origin, and the French have done that without privati sing their own telecommunications network, one of the best in the world. Then look at what has happened in the United Kingdom. Prices have risen. Services to the individual have dropped dramatically. Business may be better off, but the great mass of people are much worse off. Let us look at what happened in New Zealand. I know that someone once suggested to Gough Whitlam that Australia should annexe New Zealand and Gough, in his wisdom, said, 'Who in their right mind would want two more-expletive-Tasmanias?' I can sympathise with that, but the truth about New Zealand is that it is a minuscule country. Telecommunications in New Zealand are much simpler than in a country as vast as Australia, yet Australia provides this service which is the equal of any in the world. I suggest to those who are going to talk about the United States that they get out of the major cities of the United States and try the telecommunications service because they will find it abysmal. We have to consider where this business started. I would lay the blame clearly at the door of Keating and, I might say, Beazley. The Australian Labor Party decided that they would let in a competitor and they would give away a large slice of Telecom's business. That was what they did. They gave away a large slice of the business. They said that they did it in the name of competition. The truth was, and anyone who knows anything about telecommunication knows, that we were on the crest of a technological avalanche, technological change. That is what caused the big improvement in telecommunications-not allowing in a competitor. I was the only one in the caucus who voted against that at the time. We were told about all the great benefits that was going to bestow upon us. What has Optus bestowed upon Australia? Let us look at this because this is, in a way, a small example of what is to come. Optus, for instance, is stringing unsightly wires around Sydney, something Telecom would not do but something which Telecom is going to have to do now to compete. If you go and look at these unsightly wires, you see every now and again a tin box there, which obviously holds some equipment, stamped 'Proudly made in the United States' . Optus does not think Australia can even make tin boxes. How does anyone think we are going to see the maintenance of the telecommunications manufacturing sector, which has blossomed? How is that going to be maintained? Of course it will not be. It is nonsense to say it will be. One of the problems in the previous Labor government is that very few people in their ranks ever had anything to do with running a business. Little has changed. They simply do not understand. In the name of competition you see Optus stringing optic fibres across Australia. Telecom has done the same thing. It is a duplication of cost, mainly in imported components, when Optus and Telecom could have combined. There is surplus there for well into the next century. We hear a lot about productivity and it varies considerably. I know that Telecom's productivity in Western Australia is higher than anywhere else in Australia, and in the goldfields it is higher than it is in the south of the state. There is a great variation in it, as there is in any large company. There have been enormous increases in productivity in Telecom. And what we have done is reward people by shedding their jobs. It is all very easy to shed jobs. I will give members an example of this. Members of the National Party particularly ought to think about this because they have in their electorates towns like Mullewa, which I used to have in my electorate, but which is now in the electorate of the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). There used to be a Telecom technician in Mullewa. Due to the pressure of competition he was removed to the coast and now lives in Geraldton. When they removed that person from Mullewa, there was a substantial decrease in the quality of life in that town because they took out of circulation the man who used to fix the lights at the footy club, the man who used to repair their electrical appliances, the man who was the mainstay at the dramatics society-all those things suffer. It is true that it is not Telecom's responsibility, but it is a responsibility of government to see some equalisation of services. Telecom has given some semblance of equalisation of services across Australia, as has Australia Post. One of the great problems of Canberra, and I hear people in my electorate criticising Canberra, is not Canberra itself but the multitude of politicians from Melbourne and that Sydney who come to this place with their narrow little views. Both governments know that if they can win big in Melbourne and Sydney then the rest of the country does not matter. That is the truth of the situation. I say to members of this House that if we do not stop this growing dichotomy between rural and urban Australia this country will not survive. It will not survive as a nation divided against itself. One of the things that Telecom did was to try to bring Australia together. As a privatised institution, its obligation under the Companies Act will simply be to its shareholders. No-one can gainsay that. It will be ultra vires the Companies Act if it acts to benefit rural Australia. I heard the member for Cowan in his theatrical delivery talk about back to the future and about the past. I was listening to the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who trotted out Ion Idriess' great boomerang scheme. This is part of his vision for the future. He can tum the Clarence River back and make it run through the mountains and out into the Darling. That is a great idea, except that it is hard to make water run uphill. The great boomerang scheme was thoroughly surveyed and thoroughly discredited so many years ago that I think it is disappointing to hear the member for Parkes say that. I asked him if he believed what he was saying and he confirmed that he did. I asked him because I wanted to know whether he was naive or simply being devious. I am pleased to say that he has confirmed that he is simply naive. The equality of services is a very important issue. On the cost of connections, the member for Parkes said, 'Oh, you can get a satellite phone for $6,500.' That is true. I use satellite phones quite a lot, but the reception is not very good at all. It certainly is not what most people would accept as reasonable and it costs $1 a minute-no reductions. It is a very , cumbersome system. When the French get their system of low level satellites up and running the reception may improve but right now it is not very good. In my electorate, the cost of connecting some individual phones is $35,000. No-one is going to do that in future. They are going to say, 'Go out and buy yourself a satellite phone.' Once again, there will be a reduction in the quality of services to country areas. Anyone who believes that a privatised entity is going to keep maintaining community service obligations is deluding themselves. There will always be pressure put on the bottom line of a private entity, and so there should be. That is the responsibility of the directors. This is almost as bad as giving the responsibility for community service obligations to government. Does anyone seriously believe, in this centralised nation of ours, that any government can be trusted with carrying out community service obligations? I certainly would not trust any government of any shade in this country. I have talked about the development of industry in Australia. If Australia is going to have a future there has to be industry. One of the things that appals me is a similarity between the mob over there and the mob on this side. Basically you are two sides of the same coin. Neither of you has an interesting policy which will deliver the jobs Australia needs. Without an import replacement manufacturing industry there are no jobs for this nation. The words of Access Economics will be self-fulfilling. We heard this glib talk about reducing the debt and how everyone was going to benefit. The immediate effect of reducing the debt, without putting other things in process, will be to raise the value of the Australian dollar. Perhaps the National Party would like explained how that is going to help rural producers or exporters of any sort. How is the mining industry, which produces over 45 per cent of our exports, going to benefit from a rise in the value of the Australian dollar? If you reduce the debt in isolation, you are simply fiddling at the edges. There is no indication that you have any genuine commitment to industry policy. Indeed, in this vital area of electronics you are going to scrap it. I think there is an argument that perhaps we should sell Telstra while it is still worth something. You can access the Internet and talk around the world for the cost of a local call in that country. The software is available right now and you can basically get it off the shelf. I suspect we are going to see an enormous reduction in telecommunication costs far in excess of seven per cent a year. Your seven per cent a year figure is meaningless in the face of technological change. The people who are going to buy a share in Telstra are not fools. They will, in the main part, be big business and they will know that your seven per cent figure is meaningless. They will factor that in. They know that with growth and other things that can be offered they will still make enormous sums of money. I think we are going to see that happen and you are going to see a massive reduction in costs. The government's take from Telstra is substantial. Let's face it: the centralist tion was trying to buy the greenie votedespicable greenies. You are pandering to them-people who have done so much damage, people who are in fact descendants of the Communist Party. That is what the people who run the Greens are-the ex-commosand you were pandering to them. The truth is I have some credibility when it comes to the environment. It was Jim Snow and I who put forward and pushed for the landcare program, which is probably the most important environmental program this country has ever seen. It was an initiative of the last government. Senator Peter Cook will take the credit for it, but it was the brainchild of Jim Snow and me. So I know a little about it. If you are going to do something about the Murray Valley-and you have got to-you do not do it the way you are doing it with this tawdry blackmail scheme. You do it because it needs to be done-it is a national project. Mr Randall-How would you do it?",88
170,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,"I will tell you how to do it. You would simply commit, if you were so inclined, a percentage of the profit you take every year from Telstra, on a recurring basis. What you people have forgotten-and I must tell you this-is that you can only sell things once. A lot of you have forgotten that. If you try to sell them twice, you are going to be in trouble. If you want to do something about· the Murray-Darling scheme, you have to have an economic basis for it. What you would do is look to establish a paper industry in the Murray-Darling Basin. You would plant the trees with a view to harvesting them for the production of paper, because it is growing trees that suck up water and reduce the rising watertable, not mature trees. So if you cut the trees down and keep planting new ones you really can achieve that-and do it on an economic base. To reinforce that, you can give the private sector taxation concessions, and because it is something new, which would not happen otherwise, it is not money forgone. That is much better than your solution. You could also, I suggest, use the army of coalithe unemployed to get out there and plant some trees to reduce the actual establishment cost. That is something we are going to have to look at. I have said on previous occasions that we are going to have to look at taking the CDP program that Aboriginals use today and applying that so that everybody participates and people do work for the dole under the auspices of local government. That is a way that it can be done. But, no, what you are going to do is sell a bit of Telstra. We can see your mentality. Your Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the leader of this National-Liberal centralist coalition, was in here today saying that he was going to buy back all of the automatic weapons in Australia. An average .22 costs between $400 and $2,000; an average automatic shotgun, $1,400 to $1,700. There are over a million of them out there. You will get very few of them back, but you could easily be faced with a bill of $800 million in this crazy scheme. What is he going to do-sell a bit more of Telstra? This is the mentality you have: sell off the cake. You have no vision-and I do not blame you because I have not seen much here either-about what you have to do to get this country moving. It will not happen just using your barren ideology. There are a lot of people who are Liberal voters who feel very unhappy about this. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) was quite right-if you look at your Victorian vote, you have suffered massive losses from traditional Liberal voters, those from what I would call the old Liberal Party, the Liberal Party of the Western District. I talked to those people and they were saying, 'My God, if we had only had a half decent candidate we'd have even voted Labor.' You are in for a shock, in Victoria and in New South Wales. Mr Lindsay-What about Queensland?",91
171,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,I must admit that Queensland is slightly different-which is apparent from some of the members here. But another point I will just make in passing about Queensland is that it produces half as much export earnings in total as my electorate does. That is something that Queensland should recognise. Mr Lindsay-That's not true.,92
172,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,"That is absolutely true, I am afraid, fella. IT it was not, I would not have told you so. What I am saying is that what we need in this country is a vision that is going to get Australia moving, not this barren adherence to failed ideology. We have seen examples of where it has been doneand it has failed. No matter which government it is, and no matter how badly government handles it, Telstra is like a great cow: it keeps giving you this cash every year. If you sell it, you have not got it. When the government says, 'But we are only selling one-third,' it is the thin end of the wedge. As I have said before, under the Companies Act Telstra will not be able to operate in the best interests of Australia. It will be compelled to operate in the best interests of its shareholders. The Commonwealth government is going to be constantly at war with the private sector shareholders who will expect their returns to be optimised and maximised. Mr Lindsay-What about the Commonwealth Bank?",92
173,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEE,"Let's look at the Commonwealth Bank. I am not struck by this ideology at all. I would have sold the Commonwealth Bank a long time ago, because it was just another grubby commercial bank. A government with vision would, however, hive off the Development Bankwhose charter does not work in the new context-recapitalise it and tell it to get out into Australia and do what it was supposed to do in the first place. If the Labor Party had any gumption or guts, it would have done that. John Dawkins, to his credit, would have done it, but Keating certainly would not and certainly no-one on the other side is going to do it. So let's have none of this nonsense. What you are doing is ideological nonsense. Most of you know it. You are all going to vote on this secure in the knowledge that the Senate will save you and knock it off. Thanks very much.",92
174,Ms WORTH,COMMITTEE,"An unprecedented opportunity presents itself to this parliament to simultaneously put in place responsible economic management of a public utility, begin the huge task of reducing Australia's public sector debt and transfer resources from one sector of the economy to another with the intention of funding, with propriety, an extensive environmental rescue package. This House has already heard from the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) of the potential rewards to Australia's telecommunications consumers from the Telstra (Dilution milking of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 and the extensive range of safeguards in place to ensure that standards and costs of the service remain at international standards. During the recent election campaign, the Labor candidate in Adelaide quite deliberately circulated material on the proposed sale of Telstra that intentionally misrepresented coalition policy. It threatened, for example, all South Australians with the ridiculous claim that they would pay more for telecommunication services than communities on the eastern seaboard, despite the fact that consumer protection legislation already in place would never allow such a price discrepancy in the cost of local calls in Australian urban areas. I might add that the minor parties were only too happy to go along with this campaign of lies. Last Thursday with the introduction of this bilI into this chamber, with all of its safeguards and consumer protection and, indeed, with measures such as the extension of untimed local calls guaranteed to business, the desperate and deceitful campaign put in place by the members on the other side of this House was revealed for what it was. Unfortunately, the residue of this campaign remains. This bill is not the lock, stock and barrel garage sale that the opposition parties would have Australian people believe. It is a careful and considered partial sale of a government utility to transfer funds to other sectors economy which have been neglected in the past. Chiefly, it provides for the transfer of resources to the Natural Heritage Trust and the reduction of public sector debt. I believe that, as this becomes more apparent to the Australian public and discussion over partial privatisation is tempered in this chamber and later in the other chamber with more accurate and honest debate over the next weeks and months, the sale of one-third of Telstra will receive clear and popular support to reinforce the mandate to govern already given the coalition on 2 March. Although it is my intention to discuss in detail the specific arguments put forward by the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) against this bill, I would like to add that if the arguments of the minority parties lack substance and consistency then those from the Labor Party have no credibility at all. Let me remind honourable members opposite that the precedent for selling part of Telstra was set by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when Aussat was sold to private investors. Despite labelling the coalition policy as vandalism and unconscionable during the campaign, it was Paul Keating who in 1990 stormed out of the Labor cabinet room when his colleagues refused to privatise what was then Telecom. Half of Telstra's most important new business area, cable TV in the guise of Foxtel, is already 50 per cent privatised. It therefore astounds me that members on the other side of the House can now enter this chamber and, with straight faces and with apparent conviction, dismiss this initiative without even an undertaking to reconsider their election posturing. This is despite facing an election backlash unparalleled since 1931, despite the fact that all the safeguards and protection for consumers promised by the coalition are contained in this bill, despite Labor Party's own privatisation record on Qantas and the F AC, and despite the fact that revenue raised from the one-third sale will be used in part to create a fund to protect and rejuvenate our coastlines, our waterways and our forests. May I also add before I go on that the of the broader and long-running debate about Australia's declining sovereignty with regard to increased levels of foreign ownership also misses some telling points. Firstly, appropriate enforcement provisions will restrict foreign ownership to 11.7 per cent. Secondly, and in line with the thrust of the coalition's election campaign to emphasise the critical need to reduce gross Commonwealth general government debt, which stood at $107 billion as at June 1995, the partial sale of Telstra will reduce public sector debt, which remains, I believe, a far greater threat to the financial sovereignty of Australia. Let me remind the House that the projected net increase in the Commonwealth's revenue from the partial sale of Telstra is $8 billion, of which $1 billion will be used to finance the Natural Heritage Trust fund. The proposed exemption of Telstra from the Commonwealth borrowing levy would only result in a reduction in Commonwealth revenue of approximately $5.5 million per annum. This makes good economic and ecological sense. As a by-product of this debt reduction strategy there are other benefits to be enjoyed by all Australians, such as anticipated and flow-on reductions in interest rates. Under the current regime for local calls, the price of 25c per local call will come under review in 1998. This price cap will ensure that prices cannot increase over the next 18 or so months, but a reduction below this 25c level within this time frame cannot be discounted across the board. With the entrance of Optus into the market, there is no reason why greater competition will not result in price competition for the very first time. Current competition law ensures that, if Telstra finds it necessary to reduce costs to remain competitive with the new carriers, it cannot be restricted to specific regions. The reduction would have to be across the board the and not just in those areas where Optus has services. Again, these provisions and safeguards reveal just how misleading Labor's campaign against the partial sale of Telstra was prior to the election. There is also the reaffinnation of the universal service obligations and standards already in place through the Telecommunications Act 1991, the Telecommunications Ombudsman and Austel. In direct contrast to the deception of the Labor Party on the issue of timed local calls, this legislation will extend, not dismantle, the guarantee of the option of untimed calls to business. In the future, it may be the case that private carriers will offer the option of timed local calls for business, but the option for untimed calls will rer.nain. Business will actually be given greater opportunity to choose the telecommunications system that best suits their individual needs. As I have indicated earlier, however, my particular contribution to this debate is to consider the arguments put forward by the leadership of the minority parties who have threatened the safe passage of this bill through the parliament and confined the tenns of reference of this important debate to the question of who has a mandate to decide the future of Telstra. Let me put a simple proposition to all members: if the voters of Australia wanted the sale of Telstra not to go ahead, then surely the current structure of this House would be different-radically different. Voices, particularly from the Senate, have confused the point that the upper house can only amend monetary bills. This is no mandate to block the financial prerogative of this chamber; it is a mandate to review, to enter constructive dialogue and proper process to assess monetary bills that have initiated and passed through this House. To suggest otherwise pays poor patronage to maintaining the important division of responsibilities and independence between the two chambers and is indicative of members who have little respect for the tradition and distinction of Australia's parliamentary process. The argument by minor parties that the result of the 2 March election does not represent a mandate for the partial sale of Telstra misses certain fundamentals about the structure of parliament and grossly underestimates, insults and ultimately patronises the voters of Australia. I point out that, if the Australian people truly wanted this monetary bill to be rejected out of hand without compromise or amendment, then surely the vote of parties opposed to the partial sale of Telstra would have had far greater impact on the current make-up of this chamber. But the mandate question itself has now become clouded by brinkmanship and the ego of those leading these minority voices. The opposition parties have been so dogmatic and so uncompromising despite the 2 March result and the safeguards contained within this bill that to now enter even a rational dialogue with the government on the issue would be a loss of face for their leadership. I would challenge all those involved with this debate to now consider whether the issue has become one of ego or of genuine commitment to issues like the environment, which these minor parties claim to make a priority. The Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) has attempted to open the lines of communication with the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA) on the issue and enter, in true democratic tradition, a rational and considered discussion. But even this has been rejected out of hand. This attitude is not only inappropriate, given the importance of telecommunications and the environment, but also contrary to the parliamentary and democratic tradition in this country. Senator Hill has said in the past that, if the policy goals of the minor parties were not inconsistent with our fundamental commitments, he would be prepared to talk to them. I would suggest that this is a constructive and intelligent approach. Unfortunately, this considered position has not been matched as yet by any of the opposition parties. As Senator Hill has also suggested, this issue requires common sense and goodwill. The issues are all too important to do otherwise. There is no room for the pigheadedness that has up to now been displayed by those who oppose this bill. The function of the Senate to review and amend is consistent with this approach of constructive dialogue when make-up of each house is such that from time to time there arises disagreement over the passage of a bill through the other chamber. The arrogance and monopoly of the moral high ground by the Democrats leadership on this matter and in their relationship with Green candidates throughout the campaign indicative of the sort of ego-driven politics that we now see coming from the Senator Kernot has seized the opportunity for self-aggrandisement and self-importance by taking such a dogmatic stand on this issue, which has thrust her into the media limelight. She is doing so, I would suggest, at the peril of her own credibility, the future of her own party and the financial management of Auscampaign tralia. I would advise others against taking similar stand. The Western Australian Greens have dempublic onstrated a common sense approach to many issues in the past, and this understanding of the necessity of negotiation and the Greens' commitment to the environment should, I trust, result in far more constructive discussion in the future. Yet it appears to many that the opposition parties have clearly backed themselves into a comer. If they are now seen to compromise, they believe they will risk losing credibility among their voters. If they continue their strategy of obstruction, then they will be seen as destabilising and jeoparwho dising democratic process in this country. This unwinnable position has resulted directly from the stand currently being taken by their leadership. The Director of the Queensland Wildlife  utive Director of the Surfrider Foundation, Matt Keys; and the Executive Director of the World Wide Fund for Nature, Dr David cannot, Butcher, have all urged the Democrats to reconsider and to enter a more constructive dialogue with the government. But their pleas have fallen, so far, on deaf ears. In fairness, Senator Kernot has indicated that she would support. the funding of the environment package-I have noted this from the Age of 25 April-with Telstra dividends, a diesel fuel rebate, taxation from foreign residents or defence cuts. But where the mandate to make such proposals? What she fails to realise is that her party has no representation in this chamber, which initiates monetary bills. The coalition went to the 2 March election with a well thought out strategy to partially privatise Telstra and, in doing so, fund its ambitious environmental are package. It was this arrangement which was voted for on 2 March and decided the current Democrats. make-up of this House. But Senator Kernot has suggested that the victory of the coalition at this election was not won solely on the Telstra issue. I would suggest that this grossly underestimates the extent to which this issue was central to the of fear and loathing that the Labor a Party waged in my own electorate and across this country. The issue dominated radio interviews between candidates. It dominated forums, election material, handouts and mail-outs, as I have already mentioned. Senator Kernot may also refer to the fact that the swing to the Democrats from disgruntled Labor voters exceeded the swing to the coalition. This argument ignores the reality that, with hardline Labor voters deserting their traditional voting behaviour in droves, the logical alternative for a protest vote was always going to be minority parties. I would suggest that not every disgruntled Labor voter diverted their vote to the Democrats did so simply to block the sale of Telstra. In my electorate the primary vote of the Democrats has declined from 13.3 per cent in 1990 to 8.2 per cent in 1996, with the largest away from the minor parties recorded Mr in many booths that could be described as being traditionally blue collar. Senator Kernot on the one hand, say that the vote for the coalition does not represent a mandate to sell Telstra and, on the other hand, say that the combined vote for parties opposed to the sale is a mandate to pig-headedly block this legislation. With only a 3.01 per cent increase in the Democrat vote in this chamber, we now have Senator Kernot parading as the selfappointed decider of the financial management of this country, despite a 46-seat majoriis her ty to the coalition in this chamber. In stark contrast is the more considered opinion of former Democrat leader Don Chipp, who wrote recently in the Sunday Telegraph that 'the Telstra sale should not be a 'barricades' time for Democrats'. My coalition colleagues and I agree with him. Let me also raise another carefully considered opinion on this issue. I quote from the editorial of the Financial Review on' 22 March: The Democrats, by campaigning on a commitment to 'keep the bastards honest', have an obligation to ensure that the Coalition's promises are implemented, not to do their best to prevent their implementation ... Government which has won such a large victory should be free to implement its specific policy promises. That, surely, is what keeping a government honest is all about. In contrast to the interpretations of the 2 March election results by the leadership of the Democrats is the opinion of Malcolm Mackerras. In a recent article he stated: The Coalition won 20 seats, Labor 14, Democrats five and the Tasmanian Green, Bob Brown, the last seat. Surely your animusreferring to the comments of Senator Kernotagainst John Howard cannot be so great that you deny him a mandate. Mr Mackerras goes on to say: I contend that the number of votes represented by the 20 Coalition senators is greater than the number of votes represented by all of the 20 Labor, Democrat and Green senators . . . theythe Democratswould admit to a mandate to the Howard government only if the Coalition Senate winnings had been 21. So mean minded are they that 20 is not a majority in their eyes. Yet everyone knows that the Coalition could only ever get that vital 21st seat by winning 57 per cent of the vote in anyone State. It is true that the Democrats have won the same number (five) of Senate places in 1996 as they won in 1990. However they have won five seats with a lower percentage of the vote. I would hardly call this a mandate for the Democrats to block the sale of Telstra. . In my own state of South Australia it is true to say that the Democrats did receive a 4.67 per cent swing in the Senate, but this was only after experiencing a negative 6.55 per cent swing in 1993. In 1990 the Democrats commanded 16.4 per cent of the Senate vote in South Australia. But in 1996 it hl,ls decreased to 14.5 per cent. Again, this is hardly a concise mandate to dismiss out of hand one of the government's key initiatives that it went to the 2 March polls with. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 encapsulates the determination of the coalition to deliver on its promises to the Australian people-the promises which were outlined before the 2 March election, the promises which our political opposition campaigned against and misrepresented, but promises which the Australian people havethrough the ballot paper-decided were genuine and legitimate. The potential opposition to this bill in this and the other chamber will not only jeopardise the coalition's environmental package; it will also put pressure on the government's cost cutting responsibilities and ignore the ongoing problem of public sector debt. This is both irresponsible and irrelevant to the acute financial crisis that 13 years of Labor government has created. It is simply not the case that the means do not justify the ends in this instance, as the opposition parties would have the Australian people believe. The partial sale of Telstra on its own is a financially responsible initiative and one which is likely to result in better and cheaper services to all Australians. Even on total its own, this bill has merits which warrant its safe passage. The revenue raised by its sale for the end result of funding the coalition's unprecedented commitment to our environment and to reduce public sector debt makes this bill even more significant and more justified. In this case I am convinced that both the means, the sale of Telstra, and the end, the security of our environmental future, are justified. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.

177,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the notice of the House tonight a concern I have with an industry in my electorate. Cryofab Industries Ltd is a very small company in my electorate involved in some very big business. It is big business not just because Cryofab leads the Asia Pacific region in its very specialised field but because its product-large cryogenic storage vessels for carrying liquid gas-gives new meaning to the term 'through their tremendous size'. With 70 per cent of its business done through export, Cryofab is required to transport its large vessels on trucks and with police escort to Darling Harbour, where they are placed on container vessels and shipped out to the export markets of Asia. If a vessel is extremely large-they can hold over 300,000 litres of gas-a journey from the company's factory in St Marys, for example, to Sydney Harbour can take up to eight hours. I am sure you can all picture the gigantic size of these tanks and the mammoth strategic planning Cryofab must undertake to get through the city streets in the dead of night. The problem Cryofab has is that between its base in Sydney's western suburbs and the harbour there now hangs hundreds of metres of thick Optus cables which threaten the company's ability to carry out its business. It is not the aesthetics of Optus's actions that so challenge Cryofab; it is the fact that when its vessels are mounted on the trucks specially designed for their transportation the drums reach six metres from the ground. Optus cables hang only five metres above the earth. Suddenly we are faced with Cryofab's pressing problem. How is Cryofab to export its specialised product to the tiger economies of Asia and bring export dollars back into the country when there are hundreds of Optus cables lining their route from St Marys to Darling Harbour? The answer is, of course, with great difficulty. The problem arose late last year when Optus first started its campaign of rolling cables across Sydney's skyline and I was approached by Cryofab, whose head office is situated in my electorate at Smithfield. Its representatives explained to me then that, if the federal government continued to let Optus pursue its present installation program, it would soon create great problems for them. I immediately made representations on their behalf but, needless to say, within a matter of months the problems Cryofab. had foreseen had become an ugly reality. Unfortunately, to the chagrin of Cryofab and myself, despite soothing talk from government at all levels, very little action was taken. In fact, it is still unclear to my mind which level of government I will find someone willing enough to accept responsibility for finding an answer to Cryofab's problems. I am sorry to say that, despite a great deal of letter writing and numerous phone calls, Cryofab's plight seems to make great entertainment for those who enjoy passing the buck. Cryofab was told by Optus in November last year that it would be charged $22,000 per pole, which is completely beyond the company's financial means, to pennanently lift the cables to enable its vessels easy access to Sydney's port facilities. This must have been a very bitter pill for the company to swallow as weeks before Optus had begun its cable roll-out and Cryofab had hired Blueline Transport to survey a route from their St Marys factory to Darling Harbour. Blueline found that, apart from a few minor interferences which could be overcome, a clear route was possible. What an unmitigated disaster! Here we have the winner of the 1992 Australian export award in danger of not being able to meet its ever-increasing demand for its product overseas, not through any fault of its own but through poor planning and bureaucratic bungling. How must Cryofab's Asian clients see its predicament? How poorly does this episode reflect on the ability of all governments and private business to work together? Cryofab's situation finds us hamstrung by inefficiencies in our own bureaucracy and with a private company thwarting the survival of other businesses. Who decided that Optus's cable roll-out was more imperative than the needs of Cryofab? Where was the planning? Unfortunately for Cryofab, the planning was not there. So now we require quick action. Melbourne and Brisbane already have pennanent designated routes set aside for the transportation of large loads. It is scandalous that Sydney, the commercial and business capital of the country, still lacks such routes. They must be established as soon as possible, both in an east-west direction and in a north-south direction. Both Blueline Transport and Brambles Transport have provided Optus with proposed designated route maps. I believe time is of the essence. Prior to the at hanging of the cables, Cryofab's transport options were varied. It could rely on at least four companies to do the job of getting their vessels to port. Now, due to the low-hanging wires, there is only one company in New South Wales with an ultra low-loader vehicle capable of moving the company's largest products. Unfortunately for Cryofab, this single loader has to be booked months in advance. We now have a government with an excellent opportunity to move swiftly and solve a very pressing problem, not only for Cryofab's sake but also for Australia's business reputation in Asia. Through you, Mr Speaker, I call on Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, and on Mr Sharp, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, to come to the party and put an end to Cryofab's plight as soon as possible, the same as I calIon the New South Wales Minister for Roads, the Hon. Michael Knight, to find a designated route for these companies. Compact Discs  Warner Music's decision to again hike up wholesale prices for their compact discs, it should now be twilight time for the CD cartel and the policy that allows it to flourish. The current restrictive policy on copyright hurts all Australian consumers and should be scrapped. I am not alone in my thinking. Yesterday morning, Ian Henderson writing in the Australian quoted Treasury as saying 'there is no justification for the ban on paralbuying lel imports'. The current policy gives copyright to Australian subsidies for the entire catalogue of titles released by their parent companies overseas. No other individual or company can import for sale any part of a catalogue without the permission of the Australian company. That remains the case, even if the Australian subsidiary chooses not to release certain here or if copies of titles released are made available at a cheaper rate. Mr Rocher-Have a look at books while you are at it.  as well because that is another scandal. The ban on parallel imports thus both reduces choice and increases cost to the consumer. The industry claims that the existing situation benefits Australian music and artists. That argument is refuted by both the Prices Surveillance Authority and Treasury. The Prices Surveillance Authority recommended reconsideration of CD prices in 1990. I remind the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the shadow minister at the table, of that. He is busy calling us to do something about it, yet for six years his party was in government and did absolutely nothing about it. The Prices Surveillance Authority argued for systemic change. The Labor government took two years before assenting to some parallel importing, but a year ago reneged entirely. At that time, the opposition spokesman on communications and the arts, Senator Alston, described the move as a 'disgraceful backflip' and 'a slap in the face for consumers, particularly young people'. I trust that now he is the minister in a new government he will act quickly to end the ban on the parallel importation of CDs. Australians are paying far too much for CDs. Some estimates have placed Australian prices at 38 per cent above those in the US and European markets. That works out to around $9 per CD at the retail level. Increasingly, however, buyers have begun avoiding the Australian retailers to purchase their music via the Internet. Once online, music lovers are from stores in the United States and paying about $5 or $6 less than they would by shopping at their local store. There have been instances of Australian CDs selling in North America for half their Australian retail. This fact provides little discomfort to the Australian record companies as five of the big six are foreign owned. It makes little difference to them whether it is the parent or the titles subsidiary who collects the money but it makes a big difference to our retailers, many of whom are small businesses providing jobs for young Australians. This trend to bypass Australian retailers will increase at an exponential rate as more people switch onto the Internet. Young people are the major purchasers of recorded music. They are also the major customers on the Internet. The Australian marketplace has undergone a huge transformation since 1980-the currency has been floated, the banking system deregulated, the car industry rationalised and the telecommunications industry opened to competition. None of these has been without cost, but the public has worn the short-term pain and been the beneficiaries of the change in the longer term. The national competition policy, known widely as the Hilmer report, recommends a still more competitive marketplace. The former Labor government began implementing many of Professor Hilmer's findings, yet it exempted the cultural sector from much needed reform. The outrageous CD prices charged to consumers are a legacy of a Labor government that failed to achieve microeconomic reform in so many areas, particularly when confronted with pressure from special interest groups such as those in the music industry cartel. By allowing parallel importing of CDs, this government will achieve early micro-economic reform. In more human terms, it will allow consumers a greater choice for CDs at fairer prices. In doing so we will keep the faith with Australia's young, so many of whom voted on 2 March for a coalition which promised to govern for all of us. Parliament",98
178,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"The commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to improve the relevance of the parliament and to restore balance between the parliament and the executive government is looking a bit shaky. Already, major decisions have been made before the issues were discussed in this parliament--even the coalition party room was not consulted before the government's proposals to limit and control gun ownership were proclaimed. Government members-Oh!",101
179,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"True. We WHO comprise planted the membership of the 38th Parliament can do much better than our predecessors over recent years. For far too long the Australian parliaparliament ment has been a mere servant of the cabinet. Recent parliaments can fairly be described have failed to exercise their supervisory controlling duties, which. ideally should be discharged particularly over the executive. The government has promised to restore parliament to its rightful role in the scheme things. The signs are not promising. If were a commitment to the parliament, it would have been symbolic of that commitment if more than the duty minister or the duty parliamentary secretary were in the House when a swathe of new coalition members made their collectively admirable first speeches in this House. ",101
180,Mr ROCHER,ADJOURNMENT,"They were not. It was bare. The frontbenchers of both sides were noticeably absent, with only a couple of exceptions and then only on a couple of occasions. So those new members who buy a video of what was for them a memorable occasion might ask when viewing it at their leisure, and perhaps in their dotage, 'Where were they? Where were my leaders?' They, like the rest of us, might go on to wonder how highly the executive values their arrival. They might query any professed notions about the supremacy of the parliament and their respective roles in it. So too might members reflect on the way the coalition backbench is required to conduct itself during question time. The government has adopted the lamentable practice of its Labor predecessor in having contrived questions asked by its backbenchers. It borders on the pathetic that members cannot break the shackles imposed on them by the ministry. It is probably a condition that only a healthy sense of selfrespect will remedy. In the previous coalition government-the Fraser government-backbenchers were not just prone to go along with the executive by asking unduly friendly dorothy dixers and questions. It is a matter of profound regret that members of this coalition have so far not shown a willingness in this new to use question time to seek information in the interests of all Australians, to all their constituents, but have instead foland lowed the regrettable example of their counterparts in the previous Labor administration. It does not augur well for greater equality between the parliament and the executive, of let alone for any prospect of ascendancy of there the parliament over the executive. Townsville City Council",101
181,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"In relation to the comments of the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), it was only today-and this is prophetic-that, as a backbencher, I was invited to present whatever question I liked during question time. I rise to tell the parliament of a very great concern that I have in my electorate. For the last 11 years I have been a Liberal councillor on the Townsville City Council. When I was elected to this parliament, I was required, under the Queensland Local Government Act, to resign. My council, which is a Labor dominated council, then had to make a choice about how to replace me on the council. Instead of replacing me as I would be replaced in this parliament if I had to resign, they decided not to replace me with a Liberal, but to replace me with an Independent. For the last 11 years, and for the last four elections, I have been to the people of my division-division 9 in Townsville, which includes the famous Mundingburra-and I have been elected four times as a Liberal. I have been elected as a Liberal councillor, as part of a Liberal team, on four occasions. But when I came to be replaced on the council, suddenly I was an Independent after 11 years of being a Liberal! This came about because a new local government act was introduced in Queensland just prior to the last council elections. It was a massive act comprising some 600 or 700 pages. A small technicality occurred whereby the nomination that occurred was not quite what it should have been. That does not normally invalidate the fact that I am a Liberal, because I have always been a Liberal. The problem I have is that when the Liberal team nominated, I understand that the CEO of the city, who was the returning officer, accepted our nominations as they were presented. However, when the Labor Party nominated its team in the same format that the Liberal Party nominated its team, I am advised that the CEO of the city then said to the Labor Party, 'This is out of order. If you nominate in this way, these will be the consequences.' The Labor Party then took back its nominations-this is what I am advised-and resubmitted the nominations in a fresh form which allowed the symbol 'ALP' to appear on the ballot paper. That has caused unfair treatment of the two parties on the Townsville City Council. That is disgraceful. Now I find that, in coming to this place, I am being replaced by an Independent and not by a Liberal. The people of division 9 in the Townsville city area expected that I would be replaced by a Liberal on the Townsville City Council. That is what they voted for. But what do they get? Some sort of pseudo Independent with who knows what links to the Labor Party. I understand that the Labor mayor did not want to go down this track. I understand that he understood there would be an enormous backlash in the community if he did not do the right thing, if he did not do the fair and decent thing. He has not done that, and that has caused an Independent to go in my place on the council. At the next election, which is some nine months away now, the Labor Party will suffer at the ballot box from having not done the fair and decent thing. Not only do they do it to the nation, they do it at local authority level as well. I calion the Townsville City Council to express its regret over the actions it has taken and to do the fair and decent thing and make sure that in the future a Liberal is appointed to replace a Liberal. Small Business",102
182,Mr SERCOMBE,ADJOURNMENT,"Maribyrnong) (10.51 p.m.}--If I were the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) I would not own up to such things. Someone might offer to sell him the Commonwealth Avenue bridge before he leaves Canberra. Mr Speaker, I want to raise something which I believe is a threshold issue for this government in its responsiveness to small and medium enterprises, particularly those which are exporters. This government is strong on political rhetoric when it comes to the need of small business but many people, including me, believe that, while it is strong on rhetoric, it will be pretty weak on substance. I am led to make those comments by an article that recently appeared in the Financial Review small business section. It started off: AUSINDUSTRY'S Business Networks program is awaiting its fate under expected Coalition spending cuts. The BNP, launched by the Keating government in June 1995, is a favourite of small business. But its future is not assured, as Auslndustry's budget is expected to be cut by $34 million over three years. That particular program came to my attention because there are at least four business networks under that program in the north-west of Melbourne, the area I represent, out of 143 nationally. There is a network of three companies involved in multimedia education aimed at converting DOS products to Windows. There is a network of three companies that intends to produce products using recycled rubber tyres and which has, it believes, export markets in Malaysia. Another three companies are cooperating in the development of high quality woollen garments for overseas markets. There are seven companies involved with the export of woollen jumpers. But it is not just companies in my particular part of the world that are achieving remarkable results through this particular example of cooperation between business and government. In Queensland there is a very successful network of 12 consultancy firms, called the Asia-Pacific Design"" Group, which is getting a slice of the action through projects in Asia-one in China being a mixed hotelcommercial office-residential development worth $1.5 billion. That network of consultancies also has a slice of the action in a $700 million airport project in China. These are very significant programs for small business because it enables them to pool resources and take advantage of opportunities that, individually, they would not be able to. Mr Speaker, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) today talked quite correctly about the significance and importance of APEC. Again, under the Labor government we had a three-year pilot program to encourage small businesses to network with similar small businesses within the APEC area. All these projects are now very much under question from this government. This is an area which the coalition, if it were true to its rhetoric, should be seizing upon and expanding rather than putting under threat. The executive general manager of AusIndustry, Mr Alan Evans, is quoted in the article as saying: Most firms in the networks have 10 employees or less, which are right in the Coalition heartland market. I suspect that that particular aspect of the coalition's heartland will not last very long if they continue to threaten these sorts of programs. The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry is also quoted in this story in the Financial Review as being involved in promoting these networks amongst their 7,500 member companies. The director of that organisation, Mr Don Larkin, who I think is probably a fairly active member of the Liberal Party-perhaps I am defaming him by associating him with undesirables, but I think he is a Lib-says that he would be particularly disappointed if that program were abandoned. I would suggest that we have a threshold issue here. Will this government support programs that are concrete examples of getting government and small business into cooperative supportive relationships for the benefit of us all in terms of jobs and export opportunities or will this government just be on about political rhetoric and have no substance in relation to these matters which are important to us all? Australian Democrats",102
183,Mr HARDGRAVE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to tell the House of the duplicity of the Australian Democrats during the recent election campaign, particularly in my electorate. This is of great importance to me and a lot of the members of my electorate. It goes to the lack of integrity of the Australian Democrats in the current political debate as well. A few thousand of my electors have certainly been betrayed by the Australian Democrats. About nine per cent more people in Moreton voted Democrat for the Senate than they did for the House of Representatives. The extent of the Democrats' duplicity is very significant then. In all, about 15Y2 per cent of people voted Democrat for the Senate. That compared with about 6.5 percent for the House of Representatives. I am grateful that over 50 per cent of the voters of Moreton supported me for the House of Representatives-and I thank. them for that-but a number of those good people also decided to vote Democrat for the Senate. The reason they did that I have spoken to quite a number of them-is simple. They believed what they had been told: that the Democrats would keep the new government to its word, that the policies we offered the Australian people and that were accepted by the Australian people would be introduced and passed by both houses of this parliament. So many people in the Moreton electorate are now really wondering just what has occurred-wondering whether they have been sold a pup by the Democrats. Even Don Chipp is now saying that they have misrepresented his famous catch cry about 'keeping the bastards honest'. That is certainly true. The Democrats said one thing before the election and they are certainly doing several others after the election. The question I raise is: how can anyone trust the Democrats? The example I give is a real one. This occurred on election day in the Moreton electorate. Before election day I was told that the Democrats would issue a voters choice how-to-vote card; that is, they would offer two alternatives. 'Vote 1 for the Democrats', then the No.2 spot would go to either the Labor incumbent or to me. But on election day, 10 and behold, the Democrats produced a how-to-vote card with preferences going wholly to the Australian Labor Party. The penny dropped further when on election day we realised that the Democrats were simply Labor Party people in drag. That is not a lie; it is true. In the morning, the election material arrived in the backs of the Labor Party workers' cars and out came the Paul Keating signs, the bunting and the how-tovote cards. What was the last thing that came out of the boots of all these Labor Party workers' cars? The Cheryl Kernot signs, the 'keep the bastards honest' signs. Then throughout the course of the day in the Moreton electorate Labor Party workers were swapping badges with each other. There was a great giggle amongst the Labor Party workers as they decided to play Democrat for an hour or so. I think it is disgraceful that they seemed to laugh the loudest when they knew they were tricking so many good voters in the electorate of Moreton. The Democrats happily went along for the ride on this. They were like rats swimming towards a sinking ship. They got their way, though. They were a long way short of a quota in Queensland for the Senate. Their candidate there, who is the Leader of the Democrats in the other place, Senator Kernot, got home on Labor Party preferences. That was the deal that was done and that was the deal that was delivered. It was said many years ago that you can't buy the Democrats, you can only rent them by the hour. The Democrats these days say that they provide third party insurance. It is now very obvious to me, as well as to honourable members here and to so many people in the electorate of Moreton, that if they are third party insurance we know who paid the premiums. For those people in my electorate who have had their trust betrayed so badly by the Australian Democrats, I calIon that party and its leader to apologise to them.",103
