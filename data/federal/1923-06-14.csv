7,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice- 1. Whether it is a fact that, in December, 1922, the Customs Department in Western Australia demanded a duty of, approximsiely, £45 on a consignment, of ware netting. British ) manufacture, valued at, approximately, £115, this item is free of duty in the Tariff schedule'? 2. Was a duty also demanded in Western on fencing wire, British manufacture, also free under the schedule 1 3. Were duties demanded in April, 11)23, nn consignments, notwithstanding the deof the previous Minister that th '-' to cope duties would not he imposed? 4. Hnve wire and wire netting been brought the operations of the Austrnl'nn T""rtii--. tries Preservation Act, which enables dumping duties lo be imposed; if so, when? 0. If not brought under the operations of this Act, was an attempt made to impose duties on goods which the Parliament declared should be free of duty; if so, under what authority?",13
8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes. Owing to the fact that the invoice showed the export price to be substantially lower than the domestic price in the United Kingdom, tliere was a prima facie case for investigation under sections 4 and 5 of the In dustries Preservation Act, and the Collector of Customs, Western Australia, required security in a sum of £46 5s. Od., representing the difference between the export and domestic prices, pending inquiry and report by the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board recommended, and the Minister approved, that dumping duty should not be imposed. Refund of the amount required as security was made. 2. Yes. The facts are identical with those stated in regard to 1. 3. A local manufacturer lodged a complaint that wire netting and fencing wire were being dumped at prices detrimental to the Australian industry. The State Collectors were instructed by the Department, on 3rd April. 1023, to investigate importations and report full particulars, and pending a definite decision, to require security in a sum equal to the difference between the export and domestic prices. In some instances this security was required. On 1st May, 1023. this matter came under the notice of the Tariff Board, when immediate report was made, and, acting on the report of the Tariff Board, the Minister directed State Collectors to be instructed to take no action to apply the provisions of the Industries Preservation Aet until otherwise advised. 4. The condition prescribed by the Act for the imposition of dumping duties is a notification by the Minister in the Commonwealth Government ^Gazette. Fencing wire and wire netting have never been gazetted. The securities taken were in the nature of a precaution if the facts of the case eventually justified gazettal. The imposition of a dumping duty on fencing wire and wire netting has not, at any time, been recommended by the Tariff Board or approved by the Minister. 5. The provisions of the Industries Preservation Act impose the responsibility of levying dumping duty in those cases where the prescribed conditions exist. Unless the question is raised, and the matter investigated at the time of actual importation, goods on which dumping duty is rightly payable would evade the duty. It is necessary, therefore, either to detain the goods until the question has been decided or tn give delivery subject to security pending decision - The latter course has been adopted as causing less inconvenience to importers. Although fencing wire and wire netting are admitted free of duty under the British Preferential Tariff, there is a local industry, protected by bounty, which may suffer detriment by dumping from overseas, and if proof of such dumping is established, the fact of f r e j admission under the Tariff does not debar the industry from the protection of the Industries Preservation Act. The Industries Preservation Act is the authority for the imposition of dumping duty, and the authority implies the power to take any preliminary action necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act.",14
9,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, - upon notice In view of the extended powers granted to the Minister under the Tariff schedule to remit duties, aud, subject to the recommendation of the Tariff Board, to bring imports under the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and, if approved, to considerably increase duties-Will he favourably consider an early amendment of the above-mentioned Act making it compulsory to hear in public all applications for remission or increase of duties, take evidence on oath, and make all recommendations public?",14

Is any such restriction imposed upon the on jam manufacturers of the Commonwealth by the Department?",17
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1.

This regulation was onacted so as to raise the standards of Australian jams sent overseas, and is in line with the duties of the British standard. To enable 'stocks manufactured before the regulation was issued to be exported, the regulation was not rigidly enforced until 1st June last. On the 7th March. 1923, each jam manufacturer was notified of the Department's intention to enforce the regulation on the 1st June, unless satisfactory evidence could be furnished showing that the regulation was impracticable, or was contrary to"" the interests of the jam export trade.

Debate resumed from 13th June (vide page 47), on motion by Mr J. FRANCIS- . Tliat the following Address-in-Reply to the Speecli of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed toMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLEDI'Y: We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to Our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.",19
57,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Hunter) [2.59] - I desire to congratulate the,honourable member for Moreton (Mr J . ,Francis), and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson), on their very able initia l addresses in this House. If I may, I also desire-althoug h this may, perhaps, seem something new as coming fro m the Opposition-to congratulate the Government on having established record-the record of having two sessions of Parliament opened with all the attendant pomp, without item of legislation being We may search the annals of responsible government in vain for a similar set of circumstances. At the end of the last session my honourable friend, the Assistant Leader of the Opposition (Mr Anstey), in a very able speech, criticised the Government for having failed to submit their policy to honourable members. On that occasion the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) excused himself on the ground that he was new to office, and had not had sufficient time to formulate a programme. Accordingly, Parliament was adjourned to enable the Government to prepare their measures. In such circumstances one would naturally expect the Government to set about the business of formulating a policy; but instead of doing that, members of the. Ministry, and the PAPERS. Prime Minister in particular, visited the several States, not for information to guide them in the preparation of their legislative programme, but actually for the purpose cf killing time, and performing certain administrative acts behind the back of this Parliament. During the past few months many things have happened. Though honourable members on this side take strong exception to certain administrative acts of the Government, their mouths have been closed. The Prime Minister has mentioned the Premiers' Conference as one of his reasons for delaying the opening of this session. He said he wanted to consult with the Premiers. 1 should like to know what they have to do with the legislative measures mentioned in the Governor General's Speech. Many of them, certainly, did not emanate from the Premiers in Conference. Why did not the Prime Minister convene Parliament earlier 1 Tbere was nothing to prevent him meeting Parliament, and at the same time consulting the Premiers. We have had numberless conferences of State Premiers, and, so far as I have been able to learn, nothing has emanated from those gatherings. Had Parliament been summoned earlier honourable members would have had time to deal with the proposals mentioned in the Governor General's Speech. But now we are told that the session is to be limite'd to a certain time. It is of the utmost importance, declares a the Prime Minister, that he should attend the Imperial Conference. Apparently' it is more important that he one should go to London than that Parliapassed. ment should continue in session doing the business of this country. In order to create the right atmosphere in the public mind he has, as I have said, been travelling from State to State addressing select audiences such as the Chambers of Commerce and the Millions Club, and impressing upou them how essential it is that he should attend the Imperial Conference in order to deal with the problems that confront Australia. Apparently he has no confidence in his colleagues. What is to be said for the Treasurer (Dr Page) ? Is he deficient in mentality ? Is he incapable of managing the affairs of Australia in the absence of the Prime M in ister? And what is to be said for his other Ministerial colleagues ? Some of them have been in this House for a considerable number of years, and should know something about administrative mutters. Can the Prime Minister repose no confidence in them ? Is future welfare of the country wrapped up entirely in the wisdom of the Prime Minister himself? It was charged against the ex-Prime Minister (the Right Hon. W. M . Hughes) that he was a dictator, but I will-say this for him, that be went abroad to represent Australia at Imperial Conferences he at least allowed Parliament to sit during his absence. He was not afraid to trust his colleagues. The Prime Minister is in exactly the same position as his predecessor in office, fie knows that if he desires to go abroad on public business there will always be a pair for him in our division lists. The Ministry would suffer nothing in this respect. But perhaps he believes that unless he is at the wheel himself the Goverument ship will go on the rocks of disaster, - Mr MATHEWS - He ought to know.",20
58,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes . We all know that divergent views are held by certain members of the Ministerial following. They do not all speak with one voice. They cannot see eye to eye on all matters, and there is no common agreement in regard to their political ideals - But there is one thing upon which they are agreed, and that is that if the present Government fail to retain place and power the consequences, from their point of view, may be disastrous, because the Labour party will then gain office. This statement, has been made by the late Prime Minister and also by the present Leader of the Government, as well as other Ministers on the Treasury bench. But they know quite well that we will never seek office unless we have the voice of the people behind us, and are returned in sufficient numbers to insure stable government. This cannot be said for our honourable friends opposite. The Prime Minister and his Lieutenant represent minority parties in this House. they were before the people the Leader of the Government declared that he wanted to remain loyal to. his late chief, who, he said, was the only man capable of controlling the destinies of this country. It must be noted, however, that the Treasurer on that occasion, as the Leader of the Country party, held quite the opposite view. He maintained that the late Prime Minister was the worse man possible to hold office. But after the election, and when it was found that the the Nationalist party could no longer continue in power, the Prime Minister deserted his old chief, and in order to retain office he came to the conclusion that he himself was destined to rule Australia, l i e has set a very bad example. when He appears to think that, although we on this side represent the majorit y party in this House, our mouths are to be closed; that we have no right to deal with the problems confronting this country except in the time which he has allotted to us;. and that during his absence from Australia we are to be denied the privilege of meeting for the purpose of dealing with affairs affecting the Commonwealth. By the grace of the Prime Minister this House will last for only twelve weeks in the year. 'We did nothing for two weeks, and during the next ten weeks we shall be expected to get through the business which he places before us. It matters not to him how important some of it may be. It must, he says, be disposed of within the time limit , failing which, like a sulky school boy, he will not go to London. The Prime Minister has said that he will not represent Australia at the Imperial Conference unless Parliament goes into recess.",21
59,Mr BRENNAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Did he make such a dreadful threat?,21
60,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes . It practically means that if the Estimates are passed Parliament will adjourn and may not be summoned until this time next year. If honourable members supporting the Government 'consent to such a procedure,, they will be digging their political graves.",21
61,Mr LISTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That ought to please the honourable member and his supporters.,21
62,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I would be pleased from a political point of view; but we have a duty to perform to our constituents. The Prime Minister informs us When that it is necessary for him to attend the Imperial Conference, where important problems confronting the Empire are to be considered.' One of the .chief topics to be discussed will be that of Empire defence. The members of this party believe that the time has arrived when the energy of such men as the Prime Minister and other leading Ministers of the British Empire should be devoted to securing peace and not in the direction of war. When the last great international conflict was in progress, we were told by those who are now supporting the Government that it was to be a war to end war, and afterwards that the League of Nations had been brought into existence for devising means of preventing further conflicts between nations. Notwithstanding this promise, the leading men in the Empire, with the exception perhaps of one or two, are refraining from galvanizing the League into activity. Many of them are more concerned in framing defence proposals with a view to preparing for future wars. We 7 are told that Australia will be full y represented at the next gathering of the League of Nations, but it is more thanprobable that the delegates sent from Australia will be men who are hardly known to the publio of the Commonwealth. If the meeting of the League is not considered to be of sufficient importance to justify the attendance of the Prime M in ister or some other Minister, the Government will send a representative from Australia who is probably unknown in his own land. If a woman delegate also attends, probably one associated with some women's organization in the city of Melbourne will be sent. If the League of Nations is to be a success, we must popularize it ; but no attempt is being made in that direction by the Government. I have seen the danger confronting us for a considerable time. Prior to the last general elections, a cablegram was despatched by the then British Prime Minister (Mr Lloyd George) to the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) asking if Australia would be prepared to send troops overseas to assist, if the Greeks and the Turks became further engaged in war. Before the message was submitted to Parliament, the ex-Prime Minister and those supporting him agreed to' render what assistance was necessary without ascertaining any reason for the impending war. At that particular time, the members of the Opposition were strongly opposed to Australia being pledged in any way before the people were consulted. The present Prime Minister, as reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, said in effect that Australia should have a greater voice in Empire affairs, and that a Government had, without knowing anything of the circumstances, been asked to participate in what might have been a disastrous European conflict. - The Prime Minister, when in Queensland a week or two ago, said that it was necessary that he should attend the Imperial Conference in order that the voice of Australia should be heard in connection with international problems, and that we should not be embroiled in a war without knowing the reasons which caused it . When we put a similar position before this House those who are now supporting the Government opposed us. The members of the Labour party are opposed fo war; we believe in peace.",21
63,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,And so do we.,22
64,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Then the proper way to insure peace is for the representatives of the different nations to endeavour to secure it , instead of discussing problems of defence. There are means of settling international disputes without recourse to war, but action is not being taken in that direction. I am sure that every honourable member is pleased to learn that the Government intend to increase the old-age pensions, and my only regret is that the matter has been so long delayed. Had this party been in power the rate would have been increased long ago. During the war, and since, the cost of livin g has been so high that the old people find it impossible to manage on the small pensions they receive.",22
65,Mr JACKSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,It was increased from 10s. to 15s. per week.,22
66,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,E v e n then it was quite insufficient. Does the honourable member for Bass think that 15s. a week is adequate?,22
67,Mr JACKSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,I did not say so.,22
68,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I trust the Government, when dealing with this question, will be as generous as they can, and thus assist the aged and infir m in our midst, to live in a reasonable degree »f comfort. It is also hoped that many of the existing anomalies will be removed, especially in regard to the small incomes from property. I know of an instance where two old people who were unable to work were receiving 20s. per week in rent from two small cottages, and who were later compelled to reside in one. Their pension has now been stopped. If they had not been receiving 20s. in rent they would bave been entitled to 30s. per week in pensions. They have also been in formed that an amount has been overpaid, but the Department are not bothering about it for the moment. in dealing with the proposal of the Government to appoint a Board to control the Commonwealth Bank, I desire to express my sincere regret at ihe death ;>f Sir Denison Miller, who was for some years Governor of that institution. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear ,",22
69,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The late Denison Miller was selected by the Labour Government to undertake control of the - Commonwealth Bank when it was first established, and I think he rendered good service. ' The operations of the Bank, however, were not extended as rapidly as one might have expected, be1 cause there are a number of large and important towns in Australia in which the res'dents are anxious to have a branch of the Bank established. if the Government appoint a Board to control this institution it will not consist of men directly interested in other bankadditional ing institutions or of those who are closely associated with private enterprises. I hope that this will not be done, because I can conceive of the Bank in this way being hamstrung, and not permitted to fulfil the functions for which i created. During the war it proved to the financial bulwark of the Commonproposal. wealth. It should be placed in an even stronger position than it occupied in that period. Therefore, I hope that the Government have no evil intentions in regard to its future, that the Bank w i not be crippled in any respect, and that the more vigorous policy, will be adopted statement. of extending its operations in many i m portant towns desirous of having branches established. The proposals emanating from the cent Premiers' Conference are the most important feature of the Governorhas General's Speech. I admit that nothing definite was achieved at the Conference except in regard to the matter of taxation, which the Prime Minister evidently intends to push through to completion notwithstanding the fact that the State of New South Wales has not yet come into agreement with the Commonwealth. In penditure this connection I contend that the Govern the ment have no justification for entering into an agreement with State Governwill ments to whittle away the powers of the it? Commonwealth, by permitting the States to have the sole power to tax the incomes of individuals while the Commonwealth reserves to itself the right to tax companies - The Prime Minister justifies his proposal on the grounds that it will effect a saving of about £400,000 in administration, and will obviate the necessity of taxpayers furnishing two income-tax returns. It is questionable whether the saving will amount to £400,000. I am hear! afraid that the estimate will prove to Sir be a long way out if it is no nearer the mark than was the estimate made by the Treasurer when delivering his last financial statement. He then anticipated a deficit pf £2,800,000, but now finds that he has a surplus of £5,000,000 to play with . The £400.000 represents only an anticipated saving so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, but how much increased expenditure will be imposed upon the different States ? I trust that - Mr B^UCE - Practicall y nothing.",23
70,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Will there not be clerical work imposed upon the States when they take over the whole of individual income taxation.,23
71,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Ver y little.,23
72,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I am not surprised that Sir A r t h ur Cocks, the Treasurer of t was New South Wales, should urge his Gobe vernment to oppose the Commonwealth's The State Government does not "" rope in "" as many income taxpayers as does the Commonwealth.",23
73,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Of course it does.,23
74,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Prime Minisl l ter shows that he does not know much ahout the subject when he makes-.that The great majorit y of the - workers in the Hunter electorate pay in come tax to the Commonwealth, but the State does not tax them. A considerable portion of the expense incurred by the reCommonwealth Taxation Department is due to the fact that an army of clerks to be employed scrutinizing returns furnished by employers, in order to ascertain whether certain men included in those lists should not be called upon to furnish income tax returns. As the State does not tax these men, the State Taxation Department does not now incur exin this direction. If , in future, State is obliged to carry out this class of work, can it be contended that there be no additional expense imposed on Therefore, it is extremely doubtful whether the additional cost to the States of collecting income tax will not be siderably in> excess of what the Commonin wealth expects to save by this arrangeshoulders ment. I have urged, inside and outside the Chamber, that the necessity for furnishing two income tax returns could be overcome without the Commonwealth giving up the right, to impose direct taxation the incomes of individuals. It is simply a question of getting uniformit y between the States and the Commonwealth, by which one return may be furnished by individual, and upon which the States and war. the Commonwealth could assess him. I going am supported in this view by the Taxation Commission, which, having investigated this particular matter, made the following recommendation: The provisional scheme we recommend immediate adoption provides, amongst other things, for the passing, as soon as possible, of uniform machinery Acts in respect of income tax hy the Commonwealth and the States, authority also passing its own Rates Acts at present. The ideal is one singular Assesswill ment or Machinery Aets governing the collecbecause tion of income tax throughout the Commonwealth. The Commission also names the Comcome monwealth as the authority which should collect income tax throughout Ausor 8s. tralia. But our Government, ignorhanded ing this recommendation, have cided to hand over to the States, for period of five years, the power of the Commonwealth to impose direct taxation on the incomes of individuals. They have no mandate fro m the country to enter into such an agreement for a period of five years. The power which enables the present Government to make this agreement with the States may, in the near future, enable another Government to invite Parliament to repeal what is now being Hone - I talking of repudiation. The lies in the hands of this House, and the Labour party should at auy timewhich may not be far off-hav e a j o r it y in this House, we shall take ever action we deem necessary in this direction. Strange to say, the newspapers, commerical people, and exploiters are all hailing with delight the proposed alterawould tion. Is it because they are going avoid in future the furnishing of two come tax returns ? No ; the real object the proposal is to place the taxation that conthe wealthy section has been contributing, consequence of the war, on the of the great masses of the people, .including the returned soldiers to whom so much was promised.",23
75,Mr COLEMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,They are the worse friends the returned soldiers ever had.,24
76,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes . It was a on Labour Government who proposed the Federal income tax. It was made very clear by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) that the tax was brought in for the the purpose of meeting the cost of the He declared that Australia was to fight for the rights and liberties of the people, and if the poorer classes were going to do the fighting, the wealthy, whose property was to be protected, should bear the cost of the war. It was for that purpose, and that only, that the forincome tax was imposed. Why is it now suggested that this taxation should be handed over to the States? Many honeach orable members opposite are wealthy as men, and they know that the proposal enable them to pay less income tax. a greater burden would be placed on the shoulders of the poorer people. I suppose that the Federal and State intax today would amount, in the case of some wealthy individuals, to 7s. in the £ 1 . If income - taxation were over to the States, there would be deno graduated scale, because the States a chiefly work on the basis of a flat rate. If the people with big incomes were taxed on a flat rate, it would mean that considerably more money would have to be collected by the States to keep them in the same financial position as when they were in receipt of the per enpitn grant of 25s. Therefore, the States would find it necessary to raise additional revenue from somewhere, and they would be forced to increase the rate of income am not taxation. The Treasurer of New South power Wales made it clear that the exemption if of £250 in his State would have to be reduced to £150. It is evident, therefore, mathat many poor people in New South whatWales w.ho escape income taxation today would be roped in . Individuals who are now free from the Commonwealth tax, and pay only about 6d. in the JL'l. then be required to contribute to about Is. 3d. Consequently the working inman would probably have to pay about of three times as much as at present to make good the amount lost through relieving the rich man of taxation. In that way, the poorer people would indirectly help to pay for the war. No doubt it seems to the Government to be a very convenient way to take the burden off the shoulders of the wealthy and place it on the backs of the great body of the people. Under the Government's proposal, the per capita grant would disappear. The States have now no legal claim to that grant. Recognising the nnancial needs of the Commonwealth, the States are ready to give up the 25s. per head of the population which emanated from the expiry of the Braddon blot. I admit that the grant has been paid out of the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth, but immediately incom"" taxation is handed over to the States there will still be the National debt to be met, and what channels of taxation are left to the Commonwealth with which to discharge that obligation? Taking the year 1921-22 as a guide, we find that the total revenue of the Commonwealth was £64,897,046, including the following amounts : Customs ancl Excise ... £27,630,359 Post Office ... ... £9,320,054 Land Tax Income Tax ... ... £16,790,082 Succession Duties ... War-time Profits Tax ... £1,306,708 Entertainments Tax ... The expenditure on war services of revenue for that was £31,337^164, and deducting amount from the total of we have a balance of £33,559,882. the income tax amounting to £16,790,682 were handed over to the States with the exception of the companies tax, amounts to about £5,000,000, mean that the Commonwealth would be further depleted to the extent of £11,790,682. That would then the balance to £21,769,200. from the Post Office in 1921-22 was £9,320,654, but I take it from sions of opinion in this Chamber time to time-especially by members of the Country party-that the Post Office must be treated as a business standing practically on its own basis, and that the revenue derived from it should be utilized for the purpose of extending telegraphic and telephonic vices throughout the country districts. is therefore necessary to reduce revenue balance of £21,769,200 ilr. Charlton. £9,320,654, - which leaves only £12,448,546. The war-time profits tax and the entertainments tax will be much less in future years. The gross debt of the Commonwealth at 30th June, 1922, was as follows: War Debt £367,574,753 Other Debt ... ... 48,495,756 Total ... £416,070,509 That is the financial position. Leaving the Post Office out of the calculation, there will be £12,448,000 left with which to carry on the affairs of the Commonwealth. How can the Government proposals do it without removing taxation from the wealthy people and loading it on to the masses? It cannot be done. Everybody knows that the Government today is astonished at the - amount of revenue which is being received from Customs duties. ""When we framed the Customs Tariff our object was to make Australia, as far as was humanly possible, self-contained. We did not expect to receive a large revenue from that source. What we aimed at was to provide employment for our own people. It <£2,284,040 now appears that there is a screw loose somewhere, for we are receiving millions £991.378 of pounds more than we expected to derive from Customs duties. Whether this £675,675 is because the deflated currencies abroad out enable speculators to buy goods cheaply, year alone and import them into Australia in spire that of the Tariff, or is due to some other £64,897,046, cause, I am not in a position to say; but If the result is obvious to anybody, if the Tariff is to be effective, it must produce a diminishing revenue. As we establish which our own factories, and manufacture init would creasing quantities of our own goods, so revenue shall we receive less revenue from duties imposed upon goods imported from reduce abroad. If the Customs revenue falls The revenue very considerably, as it should, how shall we be able to manage the affairs of the expres- Commonwealth, and meet our war infrom debtedness, which, when the war was in progress, it was stated would be paid by the rich people of this country ? The Goconcern, vernment proposes to relinquish the right to impose income tax on individuals. Nothing will then remain for it to do but to impose a revenue tax upon goods imser- ported. Then the poor people, who have It suffered all the horrors of the war, - will be the made to pay for it . The burden of the by cost of it will be removed from the shoulders of the wealthy classes and placed upon those who are least able to bear it . Revenue from Customs duties, whether they are imposed for protective or revenue purposes, is supplied mostly by the man with the small income.",24
77,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The small man with the large family pays most.,26
78,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The man with the small income who has to rear a large family pays disproportionately as compared with the rich man who rears a small family.,26
79,Mr GBEGORY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The honourable gentleman fought very strenuously for increased Customs duties when the Tariff schedule was before the House.,26
80,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I did, and I still believe that Protection is the best policy for Australia. I now say that there is a screw loose somewhere. That is evident by the fact that, our'Tariff is providing such a large revenue. My object is to show the effect upon the Commonwealth of the ridiculous proposals emanating from the Government-proposal s which the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) will support. Members of the Opposition will fight those proposals to the death. It will be impossible, when we next appeal to the electors, after the Government has got into a financial muddle, to allege that Labour members acquiesced in the proposals. Supporters of the Government may think that the proposals are sound, but they will find if they sift them that there is nothing in them. Certain reasons have been adduced to camouflage what is in the minds of some people. Their object is to avoid their share'of the taxation which has to be paid as the result of the war. What right has any Government, by entering into an agreement with the States, to give away the powers contained in the Constitution ? There has been a struggle in this country for the past few years to get enlarged powers under the Constitution, and to give to the Commonwealth of Australia the status of a nation. We are crippled because of the State jealousy that existed when the Constitution was framed. Now we have in power a Government which proposes to whittle away the rights of the Commonwealth Government under the Constitution. I wonder what men like Mr Alfre d Deakin,. Mr Kingston, [3] Sir Edmund Barton, and other stalwarts, who took part in building up Australia, and making her Constitution what it should be, would say if they heard of these proposals. They would turn in their graves if they knew that, after all their efforts, after all they had done to make Australia a nation, this Government, without any mandate from the people, without even a majority of the House, in either of the parties composing it, was proposing to give away deliberately the powers that we enjoy under the Constitution. It has been painfully evident in Australia for a long time past' that the Governments of the States have been endeavouring to interfere with the right of the industrial workers to go to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. They do that on the grounds that there are overlapping awards and competition between State and Commonwealth tribunals. There is only one v/ay to remedy the overlapping of awards, an'd that is by allowing the Commonwealth to make awards which will have currency throughout Australia. There would then be no overlapping; every industry would be placed on the same footing, and each would have a fair opportunity td compete with others. If one industry is better equipped than another, that is so much to its credit and advantage. There, however, the overlap-; ping would end.",26
81,Mr GREGORY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Does the honourable gentleman suggest that although the cost of living is lower in Tasmania, employers there should pay the same rates of wages as are paid in New South Wales?",26
82,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes . I think the workers' wages should be regulated on a uniform basis. The differentiation referred to by the honourable gentleman is the essence of the competitive system which has created so much controversy, and' which the honourable member himself as a member of the Country party, is trying to avoid by pools and similar devices. He desires to prevent any distinction being made in the returns secured by the primary producers in the different States, and for that purpose he desires to create pools. The wages of the worKing man, however, he regards as a different proposition, one which he looks at through different glasses. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court could take into consideration whatever facts were placed before it , and it does, in fact, exercise that power today. It can do what it likes with regard to claims submitted to it. The trouble today is that the State Governments want to abolish not only the Commonwealth Court but also the Commonwealth Parliament; they would like to have supreme power. They have been working to that end for a considerable time'; and - when they came to the Prime Minister he apparently agreed with them, because it had been represented to him that differing awards were operating in certain callings. How will it be possible to compile a list of Commonwealth industries, such as is proposed ? How can the "" composite tribunal "" state which is a Federal and which a State industry ? I submit that it is almost impossible. The result will be confusion worse confounded, and the' scheme, if adopted, will not work satisfactorily. Fortunately, the proposal will have to he submitted to the people for their assent to an amendment of the Constitution. Since the Commonwealth and State Governments are so very anxious to deprive the Commonwealth of its power, I ask them to accept the decision of the people, if it is against their proposal, as a vote of want of confidence. I venture to say that they will not do this, but will stick to the Treasury benches as long as they possibly can. The unions have advocated Federal control in regard to arbiti'.ation, and this Parliament has, at different times, appealed to the people for an amendment of the Constitution in the direction of giving the Commonwealth greater industrial power. Those appeals have been unsuccessful: but that is no justification for the Government now agreeing to reduce the power which the Commonwealth already has. ""We asked the people to give power to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to deal with State instrumentalities, and the people refused. Subsequently, the High Court, with a new - personnel, gave a broader interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution than that given by the late Sir Samuel Griffith and those who were then associated with him . The High Court recently decided that there was ample power, under the Constitution, to enable the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to deal with State instrumentalities. ilr. Charlton.",26
83,Mr GEEGOEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"If you will look at the proceedings of past Conferences, you will find that that was never intended.",27
84,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Government of Victoria, who have continuously fought to prevent effect being given to-the decision of the High Court, unsuccessfully appealed to the Privy Oouncil. Now, still persisting in the endeavour to defeat the decision of the High Court, they have approached the Commonwealth Government, who have agreed that the Commonwealth Court shall not be allowed to have jurisdiction in regard to State instrumentalities. That is a startling state of affairs, of which not many people outside will approve.",27
85,Mr MAHONY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Except , of course, the employers.",27
86,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"On l y the employers. It has now 'been agreed by the Commonwealth and State Governments that those persons who are employed in connection with State instrumentalities shall be deprived of the right to approach the Commonwealth Court - for an award. The argument that it interferes with the management of the State railways carries no weight. When an award of the Court is made, the Railways Commissioners regulate freights, fares, and other details of management accordingly. They have to make the railways pay, 'but that is no reason why the Commonwealth Court should not have power to make an award prescribing u n i for m conditions throughout Australia. ' The High Court, which is the interpreter of the Constitution, says that the Commonwealth Court has power over State instrumentalities, and now the Commonwealth Government - are surrendering that power without any mandate from the people. Mr SquLiix - They have bartered it 1 away.",27
87,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"They are bartering away the Commonwealth rights under the Constitutions. The working classes will not tolerate such a policy. The question of immigration is in the forefront of the Government's policy. An y one with a glib tongue can talk about our large empty spaces and the need for more population; but the first duty of any Government is to see that ample provision is made for our own people. In Australia today there are thousands of able'bodied men out of employment. Every one of those men should be a reproductive usset, and the country is losing when one of them is not employed. But they are to be left to the tender mercies of cold charity. There is no proposal in the Govern or General's Speech .to provide an : allowance for men who are unable to find employment. The policy of the Government is to take no notice of our own people and to allow them to starve if they cannot obtain employment; yet they are prepared to spend £1,000 upon every immigrant brought to this country. It is claimed that most of these immigrants will settle upon' the land; but thousands of men in Australia, including sons of farmers, are endeavouring, without success, to procure land. 2V recent applicant for land in a drought-stricken district statesSevere frosts are being experienced in the Armidale district, and as grass is very scarce the outlook for the winter is not bright. In spite of this, however, tliere were ninety applications for a homestead farm which was made available for selection a few days ago. Despite the fact that there were ninety applicants for one far m in a droughtstricken area, the Government, before making provision for our own people who are land-hungry, are introducing immigrant settlers. Here is the testimony of Senator Guthrie-wh o is not a Labour man-at a meeting of the New Settlers' League on the 16th MayFrom the evidence which has been gathered, the land which the Government had made available was totally unsuitable for the purpose. It had been abandoned by the original settlers on this account, and today not - one of them remains on the holdings; it was useless settling' Banish dairy farmers on land which Australians had already found utterly unsuitable for dairying.",27
88,Mr COKSEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That applies to other States besides Victoria. Mr CHAELTON. - Yes ; what I have read applies to New South Wales also. The Labour Government of Queensland is doing more to settle people on the land and increase the population than is any other Government in Australia.,28
89,Mr CORSER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,They have not started yet.,28
90,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Prime M in ister (Mr Bruce) stated that provision will he made to insure that only suitable j>eople are brought .to Australia. A very different statement was made 'by Mr . Garden, who returned recently from Europe.",28
91,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Where had he been?,28
92,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"His travels do not detract from the value of his statement. Mr Garden declaredThe majority of the boy immigrants on the Hobson's Bay were mentally and physically unfit. The agents in England were paid on a commission basis and did not care whom they picked. The fault was not with Australia House, which saw that all immigrants coming here from that institution were of a good type. Whilst the Government contend that they have a proper system of - dealing with immigration, there is evidence that men are paid a commission in order to obtain people to be sent to Australia. In Syd-. ney last week I ascertained that quite a number of recent arrivals from overseas, under the immigration scheme, were in mates of a mental institution in New South Wales.",28
93,Mr MAHONY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That is correct.,28
94,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"It is only fair to add that Mr Garden's statement was denied by the Eev. T. Menzies Miller, who said, "" It is unfair to say that the majority of the boys are unfit, as only a few of them are not of the right type."" He, no doubt, is personally favourable to immigration, and yet he admits that some of the boys were unfit. That is evidence that the immigration system is not operated on satisfactory lines, and that Australia is being loaded with "" derelicts, ' 1 men who cannot hope to make good in this country. Here is the newspaper report of a Hobart ca.seA pathetic ease was before the Police Court when an assisted immigrant, Frederick Porter, was charged with vagrancy. Porter said he had been induced to come to Australia by advertisements he saw in London, saying"" there were ""bags of work ' in Australia. 1 He had a wife and six children, and they were living on charity because he could not get a job of any kind. The case against him was dropped wheu the Bench was told that the Charitable Grants Department was taking steps to send Porter and his family back to England. Whilst talking about the necessity for exercising economy, we are spending the money of the taxpayer in bringing families out to Australia when there is no employment available for 'the - breadwinner, with the result that the wives and little ones have to depend on public charity. When these cases come before the Court, and it is seen what position the people are in , provision is made to send them back to the Old Country. What a travesty .that .is on the settlement of Australia ! MT . MAXWELL - Does the honorablo member say that that ' is not an exceptional case?",28
95,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,I say that there are many such cases.,29
96,Mr MAXWEL L,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Does the honourable member characterize our immigrants as ""derelicts ""?",29
97,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Q u it e a f a i ber are.,29
98,Mr MAXWELL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Is that a fair way in which to characterize them?,29
99,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The honourable member must not try to catch me in that way. I have said that a lot of those who have come out here are derelicts, because there has not been on the other side a proper system of supervision. We are paying commission agents to secure emigrants who, somehow or other, succeed in passing the doctor; and in a number of cases, after they land in Australia, they become inmates of asylums.",29
100,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,We are not paying one penny by way c f commission to anybody.,29
101,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The shipping companies are doing so. Y o u are supposed to have control, and to exercise supervision over those who are given permission to emigrate. """,29
102,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Every man is subject to our confirmation 'before being sent. do not pay anybody to secure emigrants.,29
103,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The Government must approve of these. people.,29
104,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,We do.,29
105,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Prime M in ister admits that he approves of these people who are derelicts, who have come out to Australia.",29
106,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"That is quite absurd; all that I have said is that we have to pass everybody. Later I will deal with those cases to which you have referred. I , like you, do not approve of the entry into Australia of any person who is not a fit immigrant.",29
107,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I have here the case of a Welsh miner, the newspaper paragraph statingA Welsh miner, an ex-service man, and an emigrant under the Government scheme, has written home, alleging that he and his companions worked thirteen hours daily on a Victorian farm, and later went West, whence they were sent to the bush and employed in clearing at l is . an acre. They gave up the job, and are now in Perth. "" As soon as you land,"" he says, "" they send you to the bush.. It is harder work than in a coal mine, with hardly any comfort. We live like blacks. Two hundred have gone to England in the «-last two months, and the remainder would go if they had the money."" So we are spending money in bringing out here people who go back ""to the Old Country and give a bad account of the r numconditions that exist in Australia.",29
108,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Whose statement is that !,29
109,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,It is the statement of an immigrant; I have quite i number of them here. I understand the Prime Minister to say that the scheme is not entirely under Government supervision. It should be entirely under Government supervision. I find that the Prime Minister himself believes that there should exist other channels through which immigrants might be brought out here. In proposals emanating from his Department it has been statedThere seems to be no good reason why the work of immigration should be limited to the Government or to Government schemes.,29
110,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Hear , hear!",29
111,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"It is further statedEncouragement should be given to private schemes and to private organizations who are prepared to expend their own capital in works of development or establishment which will create industries, provide employment, and We bring in new p'eople. So the Prime Minister is quite will in g to allow private individuals to arrange to bring people here. How can the Government provide for the employment of our own people if private individuals are' to be allowed to bring people into Australia as they please? The Prime Minister says that the Government exercise supervision. It appears to me that their policy is to get as many people as they possibly can to come to Australia, and to dump them down, no matter where. These immigrants may be taking the jobs of other men, but so long as it appears that Australia is in creasing her population that is all that concerns the Government. Immigration is a big problem. We all know that Great B r it a in today, notwithstanding the fact that she lost such a large proportion of her best manhood during the recent war, has between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 of her people unemployed. She is anxious to find employment for them, and, consequently, turns her eyes towards this countiy. We are constantly telling the people of England, through the press and tlirough the Government agencies, that openings exist in Australia for thousands of men. We forget to tel l them that thousands of our own people are unemployed, and the result is that we get a stream of immigrants. If the Government desire to deal with this question in a proper manner, let them realise that the starting point is to make the land available for those people who want to settle on it . Land is now being held in very large areas, and is not 'being put to its full productive use. The land heritage of the people, and in the interests of this country it should be producing up to its full value."" If people insist on using for grazing purposes land which is in close proximity to cities, and which has easy access to market, the Government should' take steps to see that those people use that land to its fullest productivity, thus absorbing the labour of this country: or the Government should take the land from them and see that it is used in the development of this country. This Government, and the Governments of the States with the exception of Queensland, are not prepared to adopt a policy of that nature. They talk about the land they are going to settle! Much of that land is away back in the Never-Never, and our own peo]jle will not select it . It is proposed to dump immigrants on to such land, which requires at least a year's work even to put into proper order. It will cost this country £1,000 to bring each of those men out. At the expiration of one or two years they will find that they cannot make a success of land settlement, and they will come on the labour market to compete for work with the other men who are unemployed. The Labour party - believes that employment should be found first for our own people. We believe that legislation should be introduced to make land available for those who desire to settle on it . We believe that, if you make the conditions in Australia such that there will be plenty of work for everybody, with provision against unemployment, so that a man, his wife, and little ones, will not be brought to starvation at any time by reason of unemployment, you will secure the best class of immigrant without spending any public money in bringing them out.",29
112,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The conditions are very much better here than they are anywhere else.,30
113,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Government would be justified in adopting such a policy. We are not, by any word or deed, going to support a policy of immigration whilst so many of our own people are unemployed.",30
114,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Do you believe there ever will come a time when there will be no unemployment?,30
115,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"There may be times is the when some men will be unemployed; but provision should be made insuring such unfortunate men at least sufficient to keep their wives and children in decent comfort. Do we ever look at that side of the question? I venture to say that we do not. We are constantly harping on some the necessity for populating the country, yet every day we are doing our best to prevent the best immigrant coming along - becaus e working men cannot maintain big families. If we held out encouragement to them we would he in a very much better position in regard to population . I have referred to what I consider to be the three most important matters that appear in this speech. I shall not take up the time of the House by discussing today many other proposals that are set out. We shall have other opportunities to deal with them during the session, unless the Prime Minister, in order that he may attend the Imperial Conference, resorts to measures to stifle debate. The responsibility for any such action will be upon him and those who support him. They may not appreciate that fact now, but they will do so when they come once more face to face with the electors. It was the resort to similar tactics in the last Parliament that led to a great deal of muddling. We pointed out the danger, but the Nationalist Government disregarded it with the result that when they went before the people",30
116,Mr SCULLIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"They were "" f i r e d . """,30
117,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Exactly so. The people at the last general election showed by their votes what they thought of the late Administration . The present Government is following even worse lines than those chosen by their predecessors. The proposal to close down the Parliament at the end of a ten weeks' session is an illustration, and yet another example is to be found in the action taken with regard to Major Oakley, the Chairman of the Tariff Board. Never before in the history of this Parliament, so far as I am aware, has the chairman of an important Board been summoned before a political party to be castigated or, at all events, criticised. The Prime Minister, in reply to a question put to him by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), said that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) asked that Major Oakley should be sent to Sydney to have a chat with him in regard to certain matters. May I ask the Treasurer how many members of his party were present when he interrogated Major Oakley? Was he alone, or was Major Oakley interrogated at a meeting of the Country party, over which the Treasurer presided? The honourable gentleman will not reply to my inquiry; but it is well known that Major Oakley was called on to appear before a meeting of the Country party. Had the Labour party, when in - office, required heads of Departments to attend their meetings from time to time because they did not approve of action taken by them in their administrative or judicial capacity, we should have been condemned, and rightly so, throughout the length and breadth of the country. The action of which I complain was most pernicious.",30
118,Mr BKENNAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"They will be summoning the Judiciary before them later on.,",31
119,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Perhaps so. The Tariff Board has judicial powers. It was appointed to carry out certain important functions; but we find that in the discharge of its duties it is to be interfered with because the party led by the Prime Minister and that led by the Treasurer cannot see eye to eye with it. What happens? The two parties from which the Government is drawn have a difference of opinion. Cabinet having formulated a certain policy, we have the spectacle of the Prime 'Minister explaining to a meeting of the Nationalist party what the Government have decided to do, and inquiring whether any exception is taken to it, while the Treasurer, his right-hand man, makes a similar explanation to a meeting of the Country party. The Country party thereupon proceeds to find fault with the Government, and, in order to reconcile the two factions, the Country party-the - smallest in this House-is allowed to arrogate to itself the right to call before it the Chairman of the Tariff Board and to question him as to his official acts. The Country party, although, it comprises only some fifteen members of the Parliament, has been allowed to "" run the show."" The Prime Minister fears, apparently, that it would do so completely if Parliament remained in session during his absence in Great Britain. He proposes, therefore, that we shall close down after a ten weeks' session. He is afraid of what might otherwise happen.",31
120,Dr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Does the honourable member blame him?,31
121,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Havin g regard to what happened to Major Oakley, there would appear to he some reason for the honourable gentleman's fears. The Country party may believe that it can unite' with the Nationalist party and yet preserve its separate entity, but it is quite impossible for it to do so. The people of Australia will judge it by its actions. Members of the party may claim that this is a composite Government; but, whether they like it or not, it is known throughout the country as a Nationalist Administration. There is no escape from that position. The two parties represented in the Government cannot remain separate entities, and in the effort to do so they will probably bring upon themselves serious trouble. I can well appreciate the reluctance of the Prime Minister to go abroadwhile this state of affairs exists; but it is a bad thing-for the country that because of it Parliament should close down for months. By the grace of the honourable gentleman we are to be allowed ten weeks within which to deal with the many proposals set out in the Governor General's Speech. What have we to do? We have first of all to deal with the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, which in ordinary circumstances would occupy our attention for at least three weeks. We have then to pass a Supply Bill. Having regard to the time that we have been in recess, the grant of Supply should take a week. That having heen disposed of, we shall have to deal with the Budget and the Estimates. The Estimates must be passed before the Prime Minister leaves for the Imperial Conference.",31
122,Mr BRENNAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The Government will probably rush them through during an all-night sitting.,32
123,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Estimates, covering an expenditure of £50,000,000 or £60,000,000, will probably be rushed' through the House during a twenty-four hours' sitting.",32
124,Mr WHITSITT,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,What are we doing? Are we doing aivything?,32
125,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes . Honourable members on this side of the House are putting before the country the actual position. When the honourable member has been a member of this Parliament for a. little while longer he will appreciate the importance of such a step as we are now taking. The business which I have just detailed-the ordinary business of the Parliament-canno t reasonably be dealt with in less than ten weeks, to say nothing of the consideration of the agenda for the Imperial Conference, and the numerous Bills foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech which we are to be asked to pass this session. The Prime Minister tells us that the Government will meet the Parliament as soon as possible after his return from England. He expects to be back about February next, but he may not return until A p r i l or May cf next year. No one can foresee what may hapjJen in connection with the Conference. No one can say that the Prime Minister may not be compelled to remain in England for a very considerable jDeriod - The Parliament may remain in recess u n t i l this time next year. I would particularly impress upon new members the fact that once the Appropriation Bill is passed the Ministry will be free to govern this country by administrative acts-the y will be able to do as they please, behind the back of ' Parliament, just as they have been doing during the last three months. We have imposed ujson us a great responsibility, and I appeal to honourable members opposite not to permit the Government to close the session, as proposed, in August next. If that is done we' may not meet again until May or June of next year. It is our duty to see that the business of the Commonwealth is properly carried out. The well-being of the community is in our hands. It is expected of us that we shall, amongst other things, carefully look into the national finances and the general administration of the Commonwealth. Why should we, merely for the sake of getting into recess, give the Government freedom to act as they please for seven or eight months? But for the fact that the Supply already granted will run out by the middle of next month, I do not believe that the Government would have met the Parliament as soon as they did. It was a matter of compulsion. now This is proved by a statement made by the Prime Minister. He has said on many occasions outside this Chamber that. Australia requires a complete rest fromlegislation. He would prefer apparently that there should be no Parliament sitting.",32
126,Mr WHITSITT,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Hear , hear!",32
127,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Then what does my honourable friend come here for? Is it to do nothing ? Judging by the honourable member's interjection he comes here to do nothing, and he is doing it well. I have shown what the position is. The Government intend to shut up this Parliament. They intend to obtain Supply which will enable them to carry on u n t i l July of next year. The Parliament may or may not meet before then, but in the meantime the business of the country is to be carried on by administrative acts such as we have had during the last few months. The Government have been giving away the assets of this country at less than their value, and giving away the powers conferred upon this Parliament under the Constitution, which they have no right to do. May I assert again that the time is not far distant when the people of this country will put an end to this sort of thing. They-desire larger not smaller powers for the Commonwealth Parliament. They realise the necessity for true economy, and believe that . the existing State Parliaments should be practically wiped out. There should he a Commonwealth Parliament, and, in addition, provincial councils or bodies, to be called by what name honourable members please, endowed with power to deal only with matters referred to them. In this way only shall we secure true economy in this country. In stead of following the trend of public opinion, the present Federal Government are endeavouring to set the clock back. Though the powers which we now enjoy are insufficient aiid inadequate, the Government are prepared to surrender them in order to appease the different State Governments. They would give these powers to the State Parliaments and allow the Commonwealth to flounder along as best it can. So far as honourable members opposite are concerned, there is no necessity for legislation by this Parliament. Everything is safe in the hands of the Prime Minister and his colleagues, and we should leave to them entirely the free administration of the affairs of this country. The Government is composed chiefly of men of very little parliamentary experience.",32
128,Mr MARR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,But a great deal of honesty.,33
129,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I say nothing about their honesty. We are all honest, I hope. I do say, however, that a few months ago the Prime Minister himself never expected to be in the position which he now occupies.",33
130,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Hear , hear!",33
131,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,He has never done much tojustify his appointment to such a position.,33
132,Mr MAXWELL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That is nob like honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton).,33
133,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I speak of things as I find them. In my opinion the Prime Minister acted wisely in giving up the position of Treasurer. This is supposed to he a business Government, and the Prime Minister is assumed to be a business man. If we are to be guided by the statements put before the House before we went to the country at the last elections, they show how many errors business men can make in connection with the administration of public affairs. I repeat that the present Government is composed chiefly of inexperienced men. quite understand that they have not had sufficient experience to enable them to take more than a parochial view of great 'national affairs. As a consequence, they are prepared to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth as they are tryin g to do. 'So far as honourable members ou this side are concerned, when we are called upon to face the country, we will fight the Government on their proposals for the amendment of the Constitution if the agreements at the Conference with the State Premiers are taken so far. Hitherto, I have known nothing to come out of a Premiers' Conference, and I have yet to learn that anything will come out of the Conference that has just heen held. If any action is taken on the proceedings of that Conference to secure the consent of the people to the proposals which have been made, we shall see whether they are prepared to permit a Government like the. present to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament without a mandate from them. I move That the following words be added to the proposed Address :"" but we consider that your Advisers no longer retain the confidence of this House owing to their attempt, to limit the rights of the Commonwealth with regard to constitutional powers, with special reference to financial and industrial matters, also for the unsatisfactory arrangements made in connection with immigration.""",33
134,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Flinders-Prime Minister) [4.25] - The present Commonwealth Government have been in office and have been carrying on for some f o ur months. I expected, and almost hoped, that today we would hear some of our sins exposed, because that might have the served tc indicate for us the path which, we should follow in the future. I have not heard anything at all of that nature. We have listened for some time to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), who undoubtedly occupies an embarrassing position. I am very sorry for him. He had to r is e - a nd attack the Government, and we have listened to his attempt. I do not think that any impartial person could come to any other conclusion than that he had a very poor case, and that there was very little that he could say. I believe that honourable members on his own side are full y aware that that is the position. Apparently We can most of them were a little reluctant to hear the honourable gentleman's very poor case put forward, and they consequently stayed away. I think that, on the whole, it was wise that they did so. Another thing which I think was demonstrated by the honourable gentleman's remarks is the fact that the first part of his speech must have been prepared some considerable time ago, and would have been delivered on a previous occasion but for the unfortunate circumstance that the honourable gentleman was unable to be present in this Chamber. I am suire that the whole of the members of this House are very glad to see him here today. Honorable MEMBERS -'Hear , hear I",33
135,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"We congratulate the honourable gentleman upon his restoration to health, and sincerely hope that he will continue to enjoy it . The first part of speech he has made today is, as I have said, obviously a speech which he should have made on a previous occasion. Tbere was nothing in it but an attempt to criticise the coining together of two parties on this side that had taken place. ,The honourable gentleman must be regretting now that he did not have an opportunity to deal with that matter very much earlier, when he might have had some chance of making a little headway. Eour months have gone by since the members of those parties came together, and they are now working harmoniously and in the most admirable spirit, and are doing very useful work for Australia. Tho Leader of the Opposition is too late now in his attempt to interfere with what has been done. He might have had a chance before the parties had really got together and settled down to work, but I assure him that he is too late now. I sympathize with him upon having to return to that subject at a time when he cannot hope. to achieve' anything by his references. The next matter to which the honourable gentleman had to return was a criticism which I thought he would have the discretion not to make in view of the parliamentary experience he claimed for himself, when referring to our lack of it. He made this criticism some time ago when searching for something to say about the Government. He has referred to the appalling spectacle of Ministers rushing from one State to another, visiting different parts of the Commonwealth when they ought to have been sitting down in the Capital formulating their policy. I imagined that he would have grasped by this time that that criticism of the vernment is one with which 99 per cent, of the people of Australia totally disagree. The people of Australia entirely endorse what the Government have done, and appreciate our efforts to obtain, at first hand, a little knowledge of the problems which affect different parts of this great continent. This criticism by the Leader of the Opposition seemed to me amazingly stupid, even from his own point of view, when it was first used, and it is extraordinary that he should repeat it now.",34
136,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"You will do me the justice to admit that I raised no objection to public men going about the country-- the I think they should do so-bu t in your case, when you asked for an adjournment to formulate a policy, you should have formulated one.",34
137,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I fully appreciate the difficulty that confronts the Leader of the Opposition. I quite realise that he had to try to have something reported in Hansard at that stage; but, with the utmost respect, I must say that I do not think he helped his case in the very least, but rather made it a little worse.",34
138,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"What I said would not go into. Hansard, because it was not said here.",34
139,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I suggest that the interjection went into Ilatisard as, I say again, it was designed to do, and I repeat that the honourable gentleman only makes his case considerably worse when he now states that Ministers should ordinarily travel about, but that this being a new Government, we should - have framed our policy first. That is only to say that he has no desire that members of a new Government, - with' all the responsibility on their shoulders, shali know the Commonwealth as a whole. I welcome this criticism, though I do not agree with the honourable gentleman; and I .may say that the members of the Government are entirely unrepentant, and in the future propose to do exactly as in the past, and see' Australia for themselves. Another point raised by the honorablo gentleman was that the Premiers' Conference need not have delayed the meeting of Parliament-that the Conference could have been held while we were in Go- session. But he seems to completely overlook the importance of the questions that had to be dealt with; he does not appear to see that those questions had to be considered before the Government could pur, its policy before the countryThe first problem that Australia is concerned with, and one in which the people are more interested in than, I think, any other, is how to get rid of the present overlapping and duplication that exists between the Commonwealth and the States. At that Conference the main object of nearly every proposal put forward was to achieve that result, and substantial advance Avas made with regard to a great number of questions. I shall have to deal with the Premiers' Conference at some little length, but as the points that were raised by the honourable gentleman in his direct motion of no confidence cover questions handled at that Conference, I shall turn to them when I - am replying to what he has actually said. There are, however, a few other matters which I should like to bring before honourable members before coming to those three specific points. The honourable gentleman referred to the statement made that this is to be a session of ten weeks, and he drew'pictures of legislation being rushed through without proper consideration, suggesting that f h at would have to be done, or no business would he effected. I wish at once to clear the honourable gentleman's mind by pointing out that there is a programme laid down which we are going to carry out, and that we propose to give ample time for proper consideration and discussion of every measure.",34
140,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,What you think is proper time!,35
141,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I assure the honourable member that the Government have no in tention to prevent discussion, or to rush measures through without opportunities for thorough consideration, but, at the same time, we refuse to have the whole programme held up by opposition and obstruction to every proposal made. The honourable gentleman also said that there is much business to justify this House in continuing to sit on beyond the time proposed. The Government have outlined in the Governor General's Speech what it thinks should be done, and what this country desires shall be done at this moment. That programme the Government will carry out, and when that had heen done, there would be no advantage in the House sitting and trying to find something further to do. I have on occasion said, and it has been quoted by the honourable gentleman, that what this country desires now is not a mass of new measures placed on the statute-book. That statement. I repeat how, for I believe that it represents the opinion of the people of this country. They desire that certain measures shall be passed, and we have indicated what measures, in the opinion of the Government, should be passed and put into operation. All this the Government propose to do; but we are not going to try to gain a reputation for ourselves as a Government which has passed innumerable measures. That has too often been the basis on which Governments have claimed credit for themselves-Government s which have passed many measures, and have not paid quite sufficient attention to the quality and merit of the work done. Our desire is to concentrate on what is important to Australia in her development and progress, and we desire only to pass those measures, and no more, which will truly advantage the country today. I can assure honourable members that in thisten-weeks' session we shall put our programme through, and that we shall afford' reasonable time for the discussion of all measures. We shall introduce our financial proposals at the earliest possible date in the new financial year, and time for the full consideration of those proposals and the Estimates w i ll be given. The Government are determined to put this programme through, and in coming to that decision, we are certain that we are carrying out the wishes of the people of Australia today. I have now to refer to the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition on the question of defence. He said, as he has said so often, that the object of his party is peace-peace , apparently, at any price. That seems to be what is at the back of the honourable gentleman's m in d ; he gives no consideration to facts as they are, but utters platitudes about the League of Nations, and the attitude of men throughout the Empire. He talks stuff about war, and the desire for war on the part of certain individuals; in fact, he is turning Australia's defence and safety into a question purely of party tactics and party politics. That, I think, is an extraordinarily unworthy attitude for the Leader of a great party in Australia to take up at the present time.",35
142,Mr MAHONY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Why are you always yelling for war? The party of war!. War mongers !,35
143,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"There is ever this cry that the party on this side is a war party; and that cry is designed to deceive the people. Not the slightest interest is taken by the party opposite in Australia's safety, and, in their attitude, they are only misleading the people. They tell the people that we need do nothing, that we are safe, and they are ever trying to make political capital in this way. I say, without hesitation, that this is a most unworthy attitude for honourable members opposite to assume. It is a matter for which the people would never forgive them if , unhappily, this .country should be plunged into some great crisis such as occurred in 1914. The Leader of the Opposition, in an attempt to make it appear that he had given some thought to this subject, talked about the League of Nations. I know just as much about the League of Nations as does the honourable gentleman. Possibly, I know more; hecause I attended one of its sessions, and I have seen it at work. No one in Australia has a greater belief in the League than I have, and no one is more certain than I .that, some day, it will function as it was intended to. I wouldlike to remind the honourable gentleman that upon my return to Australia, after attending an assembly of the League, I told the House what I thought on the subject. Since then I have travelled up and down Australia giving the people my views of the League and stating my belief in its future greatness and possibilities. But while I believe all that I have said about the League, I would be recreant to my duty to Australia if I expressed the opinion that at the present time the League of Nations can insure the safety"" of Australia and the peace of the world. It cannot do anything of the sort. With three great nations like the United States of America, Germany, and Russia outside, the power of the League must inevitably be somewhat limited. I hope that, in the not distant future, these three nations will be members of the League, which will then become the power for peace it was expected to be. It is regrettable that responsible men should endeavour to bring the whole question of Australia's defence into the realm of party politics. The people of Australia must clearly understand the position, and know where they stand. I do not propose at this stage to deal with the Imperial Conference, as it is linked up with the question of Australiau defence and the naval defence of the Empire. Another opportunity will be given to debate this subject when the agenda of the Imperial Conference is before the House. I have given honorablo members opposite an assurance that the agenda will be submitted in time to permit of adequate discussion. I repeat that promise now. The agenda of the Economic Conference will also be placed before honourable-members at the proper time, and, therefore, there is no necessity to discuss it now. But I do want to impress upon the people the paramount importance of these Conferences to Australia. I also;want to stress the fact that the Government believe it is imperative that Australia should be represented at those gatherings: The Leader of the Opposition is entirely wrong when he suggests that Parliament must go into recess at the end of ten weeks merely because I am going to attend the Imperial Conference. Parliament is going to close at the time-fixed because we believe the legislative work outlined can be done in the time allotted, and there is no reason why we should sit longer. Obviously, it is very undesirable that Parliament should be in session when the head of the Government is away. My honourable friend pointed out that Parliament had remained in session on other occasions when the Prime Minister had been absent from Australia. That was perfectly true during the war period. It was necessary then. To-day it is not. It is the custom in all the States, when Premiers are absent, for Parliament to remain in recess. Two of our State Premiers have been visiting Great Britain on important public business, and are still absent. Naturally, they left when their Parliaments were not in session. If ithad - been possible to hold the Imperial Conference later I would have been only too glad. I did my very best to have the opening date fixed for 1st November. South Africa desired the Conference sittings to commence on the 1st September, and eventually, after considerable discussion by cable, the 1st October was fixed as a compromise between the two dates. That is the position. The Conference must open on that date, and members of the Ministry are quite definite that it is desirable that Parliament shall rise prior to the departure of those who are going to represent Australia at that gathering. We have submitted our programme, which embraces those measures which we believe ought to be passed. It is intended to translate them into legislation within the limits of the session, as I have suggested. We also propose to give ample opportunity for reasonable discussion of all measures to be introduced. My honourable friend touched on the question iof old-age pensions, but naturally had very little to say on that matter, as the Government have made certain provision in iihat direction. He touched also on 'the Commonwealth Bank, and again had little to say, so there is no necessity for me to follow him in a discussion on that subject. But when he came to the particular matters on which he based his motion of censure he had a good deal to say. On the question of double taxation, for instance, he told the House that the Government had no right to whittle away the powers of the Commonwealth. In reply, I would point out that we have whittled nothing away. We are retaining for the Commonwealth every power that we ever possessed; but for a period of five years, in order to viate duplication, we undertake not to collect taxation in a certain field. We are not giving up any rights at all. That is the first point which I want to get cleai'ly into the minds of honourable members and the people. But knowing that the people want to get rid of this duplication, the honourable gentleman felt that he would be in a somewhat embarrassing position if he advocated any course of action that would perpetuate it, so he suggested that the ohject sought for could he attained in some other way. He proceeded to show that it was quite a simple matter, and Ifhat there need he no difficulty at all. He 'brought into the argument the suggestion made hy the Royal Commission that if the Commonwealth and the States would pass uniform income tax assessment laws the whole difficulty would be solved. of course, is most desirable. If we cordd have such . a uniform law all duplication would be done away with; but, apparently, the honourable gentleman forgot .to tell the House that we have been trying, steadily and consistently since 1916, to do this. We have had conference after conference of Premiers and income-tax officials, but up to the present not the slightest headway has been made. The real fact is that it is an absolute impossibility to get a uniform taxation law with the States 'and the Mr Bruce. Commonwealth both functioning in ihe field. Even if the Commonwealth gave up this field of taxation, the States themselves would never be able to agree,to a uniform taxation covering the Commonwealth. The only way in which the difficulty could be overcome would be for the whole of the income taxation to be taken over iby the Commonwealth, and levied by the Commonwealth.",35
144,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That is what the Royal Commission recommended.,37
145,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Not that it should be taken over. The position in regard to this matter has to be considered very closely. There are a number of ways in which we could achieve what we are attempting, and the simplest is that the Commonwealth should take over the whole work of collecting income taxation, and that the Commonwealth Act should be the only Taxation Act. The objection obto that proposal is that we cannot do it under the Constitution, and the States would never agree to it in any circumstances. Another proposal is that the Commonwealth should completely discontinue collecting income taxation and hand over the 'responsibility to the States. We are not going to do that, and we could not consider it for a moment from a .financial point of . view. Another is that both the Commonwealth and States should continue, to function in the field in which we are operating today, but 'that the Commonwealth should 'be the only collecting authority. That would mean a certain advance; but .we have to rememher that if we had only one collecting authority the problem would not be solved unless we had uniform taxation laws for the Commonwealth and the States. Mr Speaker, That, when acting Prime Minister and Treasurer, made an offer to collect taxation for the States at one-third of the cost then incurred, but the States would not agree. A. similar offer has been repeated at other Conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, .but the States' representatives have been opposed to the scheme. When Treasurer, I went into the matter full of confidence, and said that, although others had tried and failed, I was sureit could be done. ' I ' conferred with State Treasurers, to whom I made proposals, and met every objection they brought forward. I said an agreement could be drawn up which would safeguard every right of the States at that time, and I proceeded so far with one State that I felt sure my proposal would be adopted. At the last moment, however, the representatives of that State declined to go on, but had they accepted the scheme I believe all the other States would have come into line. 1 did everything in my power to provide an agreement suitable to all.",37
146,Mr SCULLIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,But you did not use the capita payments. big hammer.,38
147,Mr BEUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I could not, because have not the power. Another method should would be for the States to collect for the Commonwealth. That has been gested; but, unfortunately, even if the Commonwealth agreed, there would be insuperable difficulties in the way, and economy could be effected even if the pro-, posal were adopted. The Commonwealth Government have to levy taxation on dividuals in Australia, a great number of whom are deriving incomes in more than one State, which means that we have to aggregate such incomes in the central office. The States could collect for Commonwealth only on taxable incomes derived in one 'State; and could not help to collect taxes from those whose incomes are derived in more than one State. A these schemes have 'been tried, and have failed. The duplication of taxation is, of course, costing a very large sum administration, and is also causing a great deal of difficulty and embarrassment taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth.",38
148,Mr GREGORY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"And also expense. Mr..BEUCE - Yes ; .particularly to the taxpayers who have to secure paid assistposal, ance in preparing their returns. We were faced with the problem of ascertaining some way out of the difficulty. We tried all the methods I have mentioned, and saw that it was impossible to get results from any. We also realized that the Comtaxpayers monwealth Government are today collectscheme ing a large 'amount of revenue by direct taxation,'which is being paid over to the States, which are also levying direct tion; and in this direction there appeared a possible solution of the difficulty. honourable members will refer to the Budwhole get, they will see that on one side an amount of £7,000,000 odd is paid oyer the Commonwealth to the States in the form of per capita payments, and other is an amount for taxation we are levying, and which we have to pay out. That seemed to present the possibility of a solution. We, therefore, submitted certain proposals to the Conference, which I will briefly indicate, but which need not be stressed. We suggested that the Commonwealth should discontinue taxing incomes under £2,000, and, having allowed the States a larger arena in which to collect taxation, should discontinue the per That proposal the States would not entertain. The States' we representatives then suggested that we relinquish taxation on incomes altogether; but they realized that, in such sugcircumstances, we would not be able to raise sufficient revenue to meet our obligations. They were, however, prepared no to enter into an arrangement under which the States would subsidize the Commonwealth. As soon as that proposal was put inforward-notwithstandin g that we met to come to an amicable arrangement in conference if possible- I clearly stated that it was useless for us to go further with it. The Commonwealth could not entertain the such a proposal, because, had it been adopted, the whole Federal spirit would us - have been completely destroyed. There are times, too, when some of the States l l would not be in a position to make an annual contribution to the Commonwealth in consequence of drought and general dein pression. There are many reasons which might make it difficult for certain States to to pay a subsidy to the Cominorewealth, particularly when there might be direct antagonism between the Commonwealth and an individual State. Such a proI am sure, the Commonwealth Parliament would not consider for a moment. Eventually, another proposition was submitted by the Commonwealth, which has the advantage that it completely disposes of any duplication as far as individual are concerned. .. The original was that we should not collect on incomes under £2,000, wihich would dispense with the duplication of taxation on taxaindividuals receiving less than that amount; but it was subsequently proposed If that the Commonwealth should vacate.the field of individual income taxation, and should levy income taxation only upon by companies, allowing the widest possible interpretation of the word ""companies."" on the In exchange for the Commonwealth vacating that field of taxation we 'pointed out that the States would no longer receive the per capita payment, and must forego the interest payments on transferred properties. The figures which the ""Leader of the Opposition has given are not of much assistance. He has quoted the year when the income tax collected by the Commonwealth amounted to £16,000,000, and his figures related to collections, and not to the assessments the year, which is a very different thing. According to .the best statistics we can get for the present year, the probable assessments amount to £13,100,000. The honourable member also forgot that he was dealing with the collections for the year before the Commonwealth had reduced its income tax by 10 per cent., increased the exemption to £200, and increased the deduction for children from £26 to £ 4 0 . Comparing the field we are vacating with the payments to the States, of v/hich we shall be relieved, the approximate loss to the Commonwealth will be £1,500,000, against which a saving of £400,000 in administrative costs must be set off. But all these figures will be given to the House in greater detail at a later stage, when the financial effect of the agreement will have, to be reviewed by honourable members. For the moment, I am merely giving a broad outline of what is likely to happen. There is no need for the Leader of the Opposition to fear (bhat the. Commonwealth's finances will be hopelessly embarrassed. The figures have been considered very carefully, and the Commonwealth's requirements for the next five years have also been full y weighed. The proposals are for five years only, and one can easily see how the Commonwealth's financial requirements may be met over that j^eriod. The honourable member also appeared to be very anxious as to whether the jiroposals had been acceptable to the people. I think they have been found acceptable. The only persons who have shown any grave distaste for them are those whom the honourable member suggests are delighted with them, the people who have very large incomes. From this source there have been strong representations that they do not like the arrangement, and would prefer not to have it put into force. . The honourable member suggests the effect of the agreement with States would he to take the burden of Mr Bruce. income taxation off the big man and place it on the small man. He has produced no evidence to show that this is likely to happen. As . a matter of fact, there is no possibility of such a position arising unless a State Treasurer of .his own volition deliberately brings it about. There is no intention, at this moment, of altering the revenue from taxation. It is no.t intended to raise more or less for money than is already collected from the people of Australia. The present position will remain except that duplication will be avoided and administration costs will be considerably reduced. It rests with the Treasurers of the States to levy their taxation in a manner which is just to all the people. There is nothing in the proposals that will shift the burden fro m the big man and place it on the small man, or will place any taxpayer in a different position from that which he has occupied in the past. Federal Ministers, who. already have a great number of responsibilities, cannot be held accountable for what may be done by State Treasurers. The Leader of the Opposition talked about this question as if he knew all about it . He said, "" Look at New South Wales with its flat rate of Is. 3d. in the £ 1 on the big man and on the small man. What will happen there?"" New South Wales has a graduated scale of tax which runs from Is. 3d. to 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 , and there is no reason why the State Treasurer should not alter his graduations by increasing them.",38
149,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"He could also lower the exemption. ' In fact, he says he must do so.",39
150,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I will deal with that aspect a little later. The State Treasurer can alter his graduations and deal with the position in any way he likes in order to bring about the same measure of justice that has been achieved while the Commonwealth has been imposing this form of taxation. Indeed, if he is a v/ise and able Treasurer, it is quite possible he may bring about an even greater measure of justice than the Commonwealth has afforded. The honourable member says that Sir A r t h u r Cocks, the Treasurer of New South Wales, declares that the income tax exemption will need to be lowered to £ 1 5 0 ; but Sir A r t h u r Cocks that has made quite a number of other statethe ments. He declared at the Premiers' Conference that the Commonwealth's proposal would throw on the States a burden which they could not bear, because in the area which the Commonwealth was vacating the States could not collect the amount which the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation was able to collect. For instance, he pointed out that the Commonwealth aggregated the incomes of individuals earned in several States; and as the State Governments would not be able to do this, he said it would mean that the difference between what could be gathered by the State, collecting only from the individuals on their earnings in that State, and what the Commonwealth could collect, when those individuals' incomes earned in several States were aggregated, would amount to £2,000,000. In the peak year mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, the total amount collected by the Commonwealth from aggregated incomes of individuals and partnerships, was £2,176,000. As Sir A r t h u r Cocks, declares that £2,000,000 of that amount will disappear, the States will, apparently, only be able to collect £176,000 from the individuals contributing this £2,176,000. Incidentally the Treasurer of New South Wales went f u r ther, and said that this loss which he spoke of would occur in New South Wales only. If we take the figures for the whole of the States, the difference, at a very outside estimate, should not exceed £300,000, and if it amounted to £400,000 it would be perfectly amazing. In face of these facts, I do not think we can attach much credence to the assertion that the income tax exemption will have to be reduced in New South Wales to £ 1 5 0 .",39
151,Mr MAXWELL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Would not the rich man. escape under a lower rate? ,40
152,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes ; but each State can alter the incidence of its taxation in order to bring its revenue into line. There is not the slightest need to throw an extra burden on the people With lower incomes. It is only a matter of altering the incidence of taxation, and the necessary adjustment can be made. The Commonwealth has taken this fact into account in determining the field that it is prepared to evacuate. In the calculations at the Central Office we have gone on the basis that the States cannot collect as much tax as the Commonwealth has done, because the States cannot aggregate incomes, and we are, therefore, prepared to make a payment to bring into line any States that may be at a disadvantage on that account. The whole idea that there is any intention to remove the burden of taxation from the rich classes, and place it upon the poor, is perfectly ludicrous. It is not proposed to raise more taxation, and it is merely for the State Treasurers to adjust the incidence of their taxation so that it will f all fairly and equitably on individual citizens.",40
153,Mr CHAELTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Was the Federal in come tax not imposed for war purposes ?,40
154,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"It will be necessary for me to deal with another phase of the question in order to answer the honourable member. Prior to Federation, the States were collecting their own Tariff revenue, but when the Commonwealth was established we gathered in the whole of the Customs revenue. At that time the Commonwealth did not require for its own purposes the whole of the money collected. Its own expenditure was then very small, and an arrangement waa arrived at by which three-fourths of the Customs revenue was handed back to the States. That arrangement was observed for ten years. In 1910 the position was reviewed, and the payment to the States of three-fourths of the Customs revenue terminated. The States were given 25s. per capita in substitution for the old arrangement. The States wished that the paiyment of the 25s. should be maintained, not merely for a period of ten years, but for all time; and the question was submitted to the people of Australia afc a referendum. The people refused to endorse the arrangement desired by the States, and declared that the payment should be for ten years, or u n t i l the Commonwealth Parliament otherwise determined. Prom 1910 to 1920 the payment of 25s. was made to the States, but three years ago the arrangement expired, and the Commonwealth is now no longer under a legal obligation to pay the per capita grant. Another aspect of the question is the moral one, and we have to consider whether the Commonwealth is under any moral obligation to continue the grant. The basis of the payment in the first place was the fact that the Commonwealth had no obligations of a national character to meet, but since then the war has been fought, and the Commonwealth has borne the whole of the war expenditure. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) pointed out, the Commonwealth expenditure last year to meet direct war obligations was £31,000,000. That figure will be reduced in future, but it will not be curtailed as much as most people seem to think. Por many years it cannot be lessened to any substantial extent. There is a sum of £20,000,000 required annually to meet interest and sinking fund upon our war indebtedness. Loans have been incurred for no other purpose than Australia's direct war efforts, and this expenditure must go on for many years. We also have a payment of £7,000,000 for soldiers' pensions. This liability will continue for a long time, and cannot be materially reduced. At present it is actually increasing, because Australia has the most generous system of soldiers' pensions of any country that was engaged in the late war. Even the children of disabled soldiers are' entitled to pensions when they come into the world. The provision for pensions for soldiers and their dependants involves an expenditure of something like £27,500,000. It has also to be remembered that there was an expenditure last year of some £2,000,000 for repatriation. This amount will obviously be reduced as the soldiers are re-established in civil life, but there are certain payments-of a diminishing character, certainly-whic h will continue for some time under the obligations we have shouldered. The amount under the heading "" Other war expenditure "" will eventually disappear, but for many years the Commonwealth's liability in respect of direct war obligations cannot be less than £27,500,000, and it will probably' be between £28,000,000 and £29,000,000. Our war obligations have come upon us since the days when the Customs duties not required by the Commonwealth were paid to the States, and the Customs revenue for the last five years has not been sufficient to balance our direct war obligations. For the next five years our war obligations will be as great as, if not greater than, at present, and therefore we are under neither a legal nor a moral obligation to pay the per capita grant to the States out of the Customs revenue. Such payments have been made out of the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth.",40
155,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"-Do you say .that the' money was not paid from the Customs, but, from, the Consolidated Revenue? Mr Bruoe.",41
156,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"That is the position, and undoubtedly the Commonwealth is entitled to cut ofi the per capita payments. It cannot be claimed that these payments have been made from Customs revenue. The fact is that the Customs revenue is needed to meet our war obligations, that being our primary source of revenue under the Constitution, and that the Commonwealth is making the per capita payments to the States from income taxation raised from the same taxpayers as those upon whom the States are levying income tax. It seems that the Commonwealth is raising money and handing it over to the States, thereby creating a duplication by occupying the same field and taxing the same taxpayers. The scheme under discussion will get rid of that. We are not giving away more than we can afford, or any money that the Commonwealth needs for its own requirements. We are not relinquishing the right of the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, to levy direct taxation in the form of income tax. We are adopting merely a temporary arrangement, for a period of five years, in order to evolve something which the people of Australia greatly desire. It is certainly the first time that there has heen any prospect of abolishing the duplication, or that a practical plan to that end has been before us. The proposal has not the characteristic, which the Leader of the Opposition tried to allege, of shifting the burden from the rich to the poor man. That statement was made purely and simply for political purposes. There is no truth in it, and if such a result came about, it ""could only be hy the deliberate act of the State Treasurers in not properly apportioning the incidence and burden of taxation. The next question with which my honourable friend dealt was the efforts that were made at the recent Conference to bring about an improvement in the industrial position. The honourable gentleman did not devote himself in the least to the industrial question itself, or to the troubles from which Australia is suffering owing to the duplication and overlapping of authority in the industrial field, hut he merely offered a few remarks with regard to State instrumentalities, and contended that the trouble could be overcome by the Commonwealth acquiring full industrial powers. That what some people are always saying, we have to try to realise that our job is possesses. to do something constructive, and to attempt what can be actually accomplished. Three attempts have been made to induce the people of Australia to make this change, but they have not made it , and will not make it . Because the honourable gentleman cannot get what he wants, he proposes, as a constructive statesman, sit down and do nothing, while the duplioperate, cation and confusion continue interminobtain ably. That mayj if he please, his attitude, hut it is not the Governmeans ment's. We have been instructed by the people to do something to have solve this problem, and we are certainly going to try to do it . I venture to that the effort made at the Premiers' Commonwealth and the States. Conference was a sincere and earnest tempt to overcome the difficulties, and very much regret that we were not able to hring the States into line and achieve what was in our minds. A most difficult and unfortunate position exists. We have the most appalling overlapping of jurisCommonwealth diction in the whole of our industrial legislation, and no man knows where he nary is. We have the Commonwealth Court and the State Courts functioning over same field, and even over the same i dustry. When an award is given by tain Court, one of the parties to it think that there is a chance of getting from another Court, and immediately takes steps to appeal to it . W it ployer, ,as with the employee, there hopeless uncertainty, and nobody knows where and when finality can be reached. Such a condition of affairs is certainly bad for Australia. The honourable gentlethey - man says that our proposals are "" w h i tling away the Commonwealth powers."" As a matter of fact,' the Commonwealth has very limited powers in the industrial field. It is hamstrung under the stitution, and has no real power. have no effective industrial powers in the sphere in which we operate. Our controlled by the Commonwealth position is almost a hopeless one. "" whittling away,"" in which we are said to be indulging, provides that we shall have full industrial power in _ our own sphere. That is the basis our proposals. We do not want to ceed with any scheme unless we .can tain for the Commonwealth full industrial power in the sphere in which we operate.",41
157,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The honourable gentleis man is proposing to give away some of but the powers that the Commonwealth now Honourable members interjecting,",42
158,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I am inclined to think that I am not getting much opportunity to say anything. I have only started to speak on the subject, and ought to be given a chance to say what I wish to say. We are demanding full industrial to power in the sphere over which we are to and unless the Commonwealth can that, it will be useless to attempt be anything. We could have obtained it by of a reference from the States. They have the power to do it , and could given the power to us. The greatest difficulty was experienced - in defining the say respective spheres of operation of the The atCommonwealth Government maintained I that there were many spheres in which the Commonwealth should function, and in which its industrial legislation should prevail; the contention of the States was that the only industries over which the shotild have control were those in which the employees, in the ordicourse of their employment, migrated from one State to another. the That would have limited our jurisdiction n - to the shearing and shipping industries. a cerThere are obviously other industries may which, .owing to their basic character, more have to be considered. There is, for example, the coal-mining industry, which h the emshould be controlled by the Commonis wealth. Rather than achieve nothing, and come back to the position in which we have been for many years, of asking the people to sanction a change, to which would not agree, we made an attempt t - to come to an arrangement with the States by which we could define areas within which the Commonwealth and the States would each have full industrial powers. ConWe did not get as far as we hoped, but We we have made a start in trying to define even which industries should legitimately be and This which by the States. We are still continuing negotiations with the States, and if we can arrive at a basis of agreement, I think, for the first time in our history, of there will be a prospect of getting the propeople, at a referendum, to agree to a obproposal to so alter the Constitution as to remove the confusion which has been created in our great arbitration system.",42
159,Mr BRENNAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,There is no need to alter the Constitution; the Commonwealth already has power to deal with Inter-State disputes. You want to restrict the Commonwealth Arbitration Court's jurisdiction to a certain class of dispute.,43
160,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"No ; what about a common rule? What can we do with the present Commonwealth power of industrial legislation, by which we are limited and hampered at every point? That is the difficulty we were endeavouring to overcome at the Conference. The only suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition was in regard to State instrumentalities. The sum total of his remarks was "" Do not remove State instrumentalities from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court."" There is a great difference of opinion in Australia on that subject. The problem has to be solved, or confusion will continue indefinitely. The honourable gentleman knows that a great number of State servants are supporting him because he has stated that he will not allow them to be removed from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. When the leader of a great party-particularl y one which claims that' it stands primarily for the interests of the working men-ha s no more constructive suggestion to offer",43
161,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Where is the structive policy of the Leader"" of the Government? We ask that the public servants be allowed to retain the rights they enjoy under the Constitution.",43
162,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That is a very poor attitude to take up.,43
163,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,It compares favourably with the ridiculous attitude of the Leader of the Government. The honourable member will become the most unpopular Prime Minister that Australia has had.,43
164,Mr SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Order !,43
165,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,You are a bumptious man.,43
166,Mr SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Thes e interjections must cease. The honourable member for Hunter is out of order.,43
167,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The attitude of my orable friend does him very little credit.,43
168,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The Prime Minister's attitude does him very l it t l e credit. is the most bumptious man who has ever sat in this House. He wants an Imperial title and then he w i ll be satisfied.,43
169,Mr SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The honourable member must cease interjecting; otherwise I shall name him.,43
170,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I am sorry that a Httle heat has been introduced into the proceedings. Some things have to be said, and the annoyance caused by the statements I have made is due to the fact that they are infinitely true. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) had a great deal to say about immigration. Summed up, his remarks amounted to this- "" We as a party are against immigration.""",43
171,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,You know that I never said that. You will say anything.,43
172,Mr YATES,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,You know that you are not quite fair.,43
173,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The statements of the Leader of the Opposition mean that he is against immigration. He says that if certain conditions are complied with, he will favour immigration, but upon analysis his remarks mean nothing except that the Labour party are against immigration.",43
174,Mr YATES,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,It is tha duty of the Prime Minister to analyze the statements of the Leader of the Opposition.,43
175,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The honourable member need not fear that I shall not do that. The honourable gentleman states that we should not introduce any more people until every man now in the Commoncon- wealth is employed. He knows perfectly well that ithat ideal condition has never been reached by. any country.,43
176,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Will you make provision for those who are unemployed?,43
177,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Unfortunately, there will always be unemployment, and the best corrective is the development of our vast areas by bringing more people to Australia. Immigration is the most i m portant problem with which we are faced' today, and my honourable friend is dragging this great Australian question into the gutter of party politics, and misleading the people. If the honourable member's policy of hostility to immigration were adopted, development would be retarded aral disaster would result. The leaders of the Labour party in Australia today should emulate the courage shown honby the Labour leaders in other parts of the world, and make the people realise how imperative it is that we should He settle the land and develop its resources. The problem of filling our empty spaces and providing employment for all would then be solved. It has to be solved, and it will be solved much more easily with co-operation of the whole of the people Australia than when immigration is being resisted tooth and nail by one great party. The honourable member has stated that the unemployment difficulty should bo solved before any further money is expended in bringing immigrants to Commonwealth, and he has endeavoured to show that the policy now being pursued is having disastrous effects. He that we were populating Australia with "" derelicts,"" and he quoted statements Mr Garden, a newspaper report-of a in Hobart, and an unconfirmed stateevery ment by a Welsh immigrant. The honornot able member has merely a newspaper not report, as the foundation for his statewill ments. He does not seem to mind what he says. He adopts the story of Welshman, and assumes it to be true.",43
178,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Does the Prime Minister say that it is not true?,44
179,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"It is not for me to that it is not true; it is for the honourable member to prove that it is true. Unsubbe stantiated newspaper statements of this kind should not be quoted in the House; if they cannot be confirmed, the honourable member is doing Australia the greatest dis-service in quoting them. In regard to the persons whom the honourable member described as "" derelicts,"" and inmates of mental asylums, every precaution is taken at Home by the Australian authorities to insure that no mentally or cally incapacitated or otherwise undesirit. able person emigrates to Australia.",44
180,Mr BLAKELEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,You are making rotten job of it.,44
181,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"We are doing everyof thing in our power to prevent such'hapbered penings. When, the other day, I met the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) at Newcastle, I suggested to him the action which the Government proposed to take, in order that he and his party might satisfy themselves the country that everything possible"" being done to prevent undesirable people coming here. The honourable gentleman will agree that he did not display very much sympathy with the proposal.",44
182,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,No . I shall show no sympathy with immigration until we have found employment for our own people.,44
183,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"That is exactly the the attitude which the honourable gentleman of took up- a very improper attitude, I suggest. He does not believe in immigration until we have found employment for our people. He says that we are bringing out here undesirable immigrants. Surely, if he cannot get the whole of his the own way, it would be better that he should fall into line with us, and assist in making certain that only the best class stated of immigrant is brought out. Let me deal with the contention that by we ought not to bring people out here case until we have found employment for one' of our own citizens. We canproceed in that fashion. If we do 'bring people here, Australia's future 'be a very doubtful one. There are no doubts in my mind regarding what a pur position will be. To-day.we are living in a world which has not reached the stage that wars have ceased and when a strong nation will no longer prey upon its weaker brother. Undoubtedly, if my say friend's policy were adopted, and wars continued in"" the world, we should left absolutely defenceless. That being the case, somebody would the sure to dispossess us of Australia. Perhaps the honourable gentleman is right; perhaps we need not continue to defend ourselves; perhaps the League of Nations is as Strong as he claims that it is.",44
184,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,I said.''that it wasweak because men like you were not physidoing your work properly in regard to,44
185,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"There may be some things with which the honourable mema ber can charge me, but a lack of enthusiasm for the League and a charge not doing my best cannot 'be numamongst them. Supposing that I am - wrong and that the honourable gentleman is right;- supposing the League of Nations is as powerful as he says it is, and that-the days of wars are over; that the world will be governed by justice and and right. The League of Nations would be was the very first people to interfere with Australia. Does my honoraible friend know that the League of Nations already has considered the question of the distribution of the raw materials of the world ? Does he know - that it has discussed the question of how Australia's wool should be distributed amongst all the countries of the world; does he realise that under such an arrangement Australia would have no say in regard to its destination? That would be the position if the League of Nations were the guiding and governing force in the world; and from the stand-point of keeping this country for .the few people who are in it, our positionin would be worse than it is today. If it became the predominant factor in the world, the first thing for which the League of Nations would ask us would be an account of what we were doing to develop this country. Conceivably by that time there might be 6,000,000 people in this, a country greater in extent than America, which is carrying a population of 110,000,000 people. The League of Nations would tell us that we must throw our doors open to the members of every race and every nationality, and there would be no possibility of our resisting such a decree. If the League of Nations came to us and said that we could not keep this wonderful undeveloped country for the exclusive enjoyment of a few people, that it had to be used for the benefit of the whole of civilization, and we^protested against such a decision, we could be silenced by the question, "" How did you get this country in the beginning?"" We would be told that we took it from the black man because he could not develop it properly; and, as we ourselves could not develop it must be made available for the whole of civilization.",44
186,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,If you make the conthe ditions good the people will come here and you will soon have your necessary population.,45
187,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The honourable gentleman ought to know, if he does not, that the conditions in Australia are incomOne parably better than they are in any part of the world. The only other point to which I want to refer is the statement of the honourable gentleman that we ought to make the that land available. I remind the honourable gentleman that that is a matter for the States and not for the Commonwealth.",45
188,Mr CHARLTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,You could put on tax and break up the large holdings.,45
189,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"-The States control land. Very great efforts are being made by all the States today to do that which the honourable gentleman suggests should be done. It is doubtful whether some of the States are not proceeding so vapidly as to endanger their chances of achieving that which they desire. Quite apart from those lands which, we are told, should be split up and converted into smaller holdings, a .policy with which I am entire sympathy, we have a very great undeveloped area in Australia. I think that we would be well advised to concentrate on that side of the question, with the object of seeing whether we cannot open up those areas and give the opportunity to settlers to go there. I remind the honourable gentleman that, notwithstanding the fact that a Labour Government was in power in New South Wales for a considerable time, and that in Queensland there has been a Labour Government in power for ;a considerably longer period, the millennium has not been brought about in those States. The sovereign, simple remedy which the honourable gentleman suggests does not really exist; it is a difficult question, and it is one that requires the greatest amount of careful thought. Save for a few general observations, those three were the only points on which the honourable gentleman touched in his attempt to find something with which he could attack the Government. I venture to suggest that he did not make out a it , case at all. In regard to taxation, he did not bring forward anything to support the contention he put forward. He has not - been able to bring home to Government any misdeed or neglect. For that reason alone his effort has been such a feeble one that I really do. not think anybody will seriously regard it.",45
190,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Maribyrnong) [5.50] is somewhat surprised to find the other Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) assuming the attitude of a supercilious nabob, and couching his reply to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) in language is not likely to promote good feeling. If - the honourable gentleman wishes to carry through his ten weeks' programme, he will have to mend his ways. Througha out his speech he assumed the role of a schoolmaster, speaking in a way that sugthe gested that he was familiar with all things and that the Leader of the Opposition, on the other hand, knew little or nothing. At the outset, he declared that the Leader of the Opposition had had nothing to say, bnt later on he admitted that the honourable member had had a good deal to put before the House. As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister occupied more time in replying to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition than was taken up in giving utterance to them. It is obvious that - during this session we are going to . f i g ht with bare knuckles. The gloves are off. The Prime Minister has thrown down the gauntlet iand has today taken up a stand that is calculated to give rise to the very keenest opposition. It is all very well for him tolay the flattering unction to his soul that the time has passed for the Leader of the Opposition to stress the point that two differing sections of the House have fallen into line behind the Government, but I am convinced that before he boards the steamer that is to take him to England he will have had from some of his professed followers exceptionally rude reminders of the t r u th of my Leader's contention. no complaint of the fact that the two parties have come together; their performances so far have been in actual keeping with our predictions. and others of the Opposition have spoken of the Country party as an unimportant joint in the tail of the Nationalist party. They may think that they are preserving their separate entity, but if they do they never made a greater mistake. As Comrade Dunstan said at the recent Farmers' Conference, they will be laughed at if , when they again face the electors, they declare that notwithstanding that they have joined with another party to carry on the government of the country, they are still a separate entity. Some of the very members of the Country party who denounced the Nationalist Government because of the support it received from Flinders-lane and various fiduciary institutions, jumped at the first opportunity offered them to join with the Nationalists in the formation of a composite Government. I imderstand that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr . Killen), drew himself up to his full height of almost 7 feet and used exceptionally vigorous language in his opposition to the proposal that they should join with the Nationalists in forming a new Administration, yet we see him today eating like a lamb out of the hands of the Prime Minister. The lions of the Country party have now become as little lambs in the Nationalist fold. I am glad that this is so, and I compliment the managers of the Nationalist party on the result of their conference with the representatives of the Country party in regard to the formation of the present Government. One of them, who is present this afternoon, emerged from the conference with a smile on his face more expansive than that of the tiger in the well-known linesThere was a young lady of Eigi, Who went for a ride on a tiger; They returned from the ride with the lady inside, And a smile on the face of the tiger. The Nationalist party may well smile, as they do today, knowing that they have politically swallowed what was known as the Country party. The people have reason to be alarmed at the - existence of an Administration which is so inept as to play into the hands of the big financiers of this counI make try by placing on the market a conversion loan of £38,000,000 with a currency of twenty-five years. This, in itself, apart from anything else that the GoI vernment have done during the recess, should be sufficient to arouse the suspicions of all sections of the community. There has been no public condemnation of its action in this regard, but there is much yet to be said, and the Prime M in ister will come out of some of the political conflicts in this House in a far more bedraggled state than that in which he is likely to emerge from this debate. The loan closes today, I understand, so that I shall iiot prejudice its chances of success by any statement. I may make. I do not hesitate to say that it is one of the worse financial proposals ever submitted by a Government claiming to be out to secure economy. It hands over to our large nnancial . institutions for twenty-five years a big interest proposition. The Treasurer-par t of the t a i l of the Nationalist party-ha s expressed pleasure at the interest displayed in the loan by the stock exchanges and the banking and insurance companies of Australia. It is only natural that they should be keenly interested. Complaint is made that the smaller investors are not coming forward, but the fact is that, whereas they cannot afford to do so, the big financiers can. The small farmers, the workers, and the middle-class people of Australia fear that the Government are jeopardizing their rights and privileges. Undoubtedly with such an Administration in power their liberties are in danger. Is it reasonable to expect from such a Government either a progressive policy or sound administration? In season and out of season we have advocated the amendment of the Constitution, and it is somewhat amusing to hear the Prime Minister inquiring, in reply to our demands, "" What am I to do in the face of the opposition of the State Premiers?"" What have other Prime Ministers done when confronted with like opposition? F r o m the very inception of Federation, fighting, more or les3, has been going on - between the Commonwealth and States' Governments, but hitherto every Prime Minister has been able to resist the attempts of the State Premiers to encroach upon the powers of the Commonwealth. The present Prime ister alone has failed to do so. present Government have bowed down before the image of State rights. Honourable members will remember that the State Premiers met before the Conference with Federal Ministers took place. I can. quite imagine those knowing men, some of whom have held office for a number of years, saying, "" There are a number of ' greenhorns' - in office in the Federal Government now. This is the chance for which we have waited for twenty-three years. We must stick out now u n t i l we get what we want."" The State Ministers fought other Commonwealth Governments and Prime M in isters for twenty-two years in vain, but the present weak-kneed Federal Government at once gave way and bowed to the image of State rights. They have given way to the State Governments not only in connection with taxation and high finance, but are prepared to hand over to them the very limited industrial powers we have at the present.time, and to do so if they can by secret negotiation's. We can never look for true economy in Australia u n t i l the Federal Parliament occupies the supreme position, and delegates powers to State provincial councils taking the place of the existing State Parliaments.",45
191,Mr BAMFORD,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Unification .,47
192,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"What I suggest is Unification, and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) must know that it is not. I suggest what the honourable member has himself advocated when on this side of the House. I have heard the honourable member advocate the same thing from public platforms. That is the only method by which we can secure full financial and industrial control. The Prime Minister made a great deal out of the' fact that State Ministers were prepared to allow the Commonwealth a free course in regard to industrial arbitration, but I will remind the honourable gentleman of what was said. by one of the keenest men who has occupied a position in State politics in recent years. I refer to Mr Holman. Whilst he was Premier of New South Wales he showed a jealous regard for State rights, although he was a Labour man part of the time and part of it a sort of composite individual. He was prepared to fight for State rights in many cases, but in connection with industrial matters he said that to bring about Minthe peace that is essential for industrial The concerns in Australia, the Federal Parliament should have complete industrial power. That was the utterance of a statesman. Mr Justice Higgins has expressed the same view. Sir William Irvine, the present Chief Justice of Victoria, whilst occupying a position in this House in opposition to the Fisher Government, agreed that if there was to be industrial peace throughout Australia"", it was essential that there should be one power controlling industrial affairs. The Prime Minister has come into Federal politics only recently. I am not going to say that he will not achieve distinction. It is not my business to hand out bouquets to the honourable gentleman this afternoon, or, indeed, at any time in the future, in view of the speech he has made. It seems to me that he would do well to learn something of the history of the struggles that have taken place between the States and the Commonwealth in the past. He is the head of the first Government of the . Commonwealth that has bowed to the claims made by the State Governments. Just as the honourable gentleman and his fellow Nationalists must have smiled when they swallowed the Country party, so the State Ministers, with the exception, perhaps, of Sir A r t h ur Cocks, of New South Wales, must have smiled at what they got from the not Commonwealth Government at the recentConference. It was a splendid State Rights Conference. What right had a Premiers' Conference to assemble in Melbourne or any other city in Australia to confer with the Prime Minister of Australia in any but the ordinary business way? What right had they to create a super-Parliament, at which they were able to say to the Prime Minister, ' ' Here is your programme, bring it before your Parliament, ancl as you have a majoritycarry it into effect."" The holding of the Conference was an acknowledgment that the Prime Minister and his Government could not meet this Par-' liament until they, heard what the State Premiers had to say in regard to certain matters. It was one of the weakest positions ever assumed by any Prime Minister of Australia. I have stated Mr H o l fflau's opinion in regard to the control of industrial matters, and that Sir Will i Irvine agreed with that opinion. They had both appeared in the Courts in connection with industrial legislation, and they knew what they were talking about. They contend that the Federal Parliament should be supreme in industrial legislation. I can quote from memory, though perhaps not the exact words, what Mr Justice Higgins said on the subject When I mention the name of Mr Justice Higgins it will be admitted that, whether in the industrial or other Courts, he has always held the balance as fairly as it was possible to hold it , and has shown himself to be one of the most just Judges who has ever occupied a seat on the judicial Bench. He expressed the opinion that there is nothing that creates so much dislocation, or gives rise to so much dissatisfaction, as that men performing exactly the same work in different States should receive different rates of wages. The conflicting decisions given by State and Federal. Courts have been the cause of much industrial irritation. The Prime Minister's proposal has not solved this question. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has read the criticism of his proposal by the Victorian Attorney General. One of the most severe criticisms of any proposal put forward by a Government was that made by Sir A r t h u r Robinson in referring to the industrial proposals of the Commonwealth Government... No one will say that Sir Arthu r Robinson does not understand the subject, and yet he actually ridiculed the Commonwealth proposals. In a few words his verdict was that they were absolutely umvorkable._ Yet the Prime Minister would have us believe that the proposals in connection with industrial matters which he laid before the Premiers' Gonference will solve all the difficulties that have confronted us in the past. Instead of that being so, one of the gentlemen who conferred with him , and one amongst those most ready to grasp additional power for the States, ridicules those proposals. I put the opinions I have quoted before the Prime Minister. He claims to know everything in regard to arbitration, as well as other matters with which the Commonwealth is concerned; but, as one comparatively new to politics in Australia, he might defer to the opinions of men who, in my judgment, know a great deal more of this subject than he does. Honourable members a m on this side are against any limitation of the powers of the Federation. I have said here before, as well as on the platforms of the country, and I will say again, that the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament must continually in crease, while the powers of the State Parliaments must continue to decrease. Otherwise, how is the government of Australia to be carried on? What did General Smuts say in regard to the South African Constitution ? In an interview with a newspaper representative as long ago as 1910, he said, "" We have avoided the mistakes of the Australian Constitution : Ave have assumed powers which make the National Parliament supreme, whilst Ave have delegated: certain powers to provincial councils."" It is true that he Avas dealing Will a comparatively small population, but with a countiy comprising a very large area. The Union, of course, covers an immense territory, and, Avhile Ave need not copy the Soutb. African Constitution in every detail, no doubt something like it is needed in Australia if Ave are to have a true National Parliament, Will true local government in the States. That end is to be attained by a vote of the people, but the Prime Minister woiild have us believe that Ave have reached our limits in this direction, and should make no further effort to amend the Constitution. Four or five years ago Sir William Irvine, in this House, said that the Constitution fitted Australia as a coat clothed a man for whom it had been made years beforefchat it fitted so tightly as to split at every seam.",47
193,Mr MATHEWS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Does the Prime Minister say that the Constitution is good enough as it is?,49
194,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Prime Minister said that he had exhausted every possible method of securing other means than those now proposed of dealing with industrial matters. I shall not say that the honourable gentleman has the ability but not the courage to do .what is required, b.ut I may put it in another, and, perhaps, a ruder way, though still within the Standing Orders, by suggesting that he knows what ought to be done, whereas his masters outside order him not to do it . Looking at the long li3t of their administrative acts, the one prominent feature is the fact that this Government are the absolute tools of the moneyed classes of the country. being my conviction, and the conviction of my party, how can we accept from the. Government a statement such as that made this afternoon? However, we do not intend to accept the statement. As to the overlapping and duplication as between the Commonwealth and the States, I do not say that the best possible arrangement has been made in Western Australia, where there has been an attempt to simplify taxation and other returns; but if one step can be taken towards simplification in a State with a certain measure of success, why should not the Commonwealth try it on a more extended scale? I am sure that no one on this side of the House is in favour of the multiplication of returns, or the duplication of electoral rolls, and so for t h ; but it seems to me that it would be an easy matter for an arrangement in this regard to be made. The Prime M in ister has recently vacated the position of Treasurer, and, notwithstanding the rosy picture he painted today, I ask him and his supporters how they propose to "" pay the piper "" in ' the coming years if , by diminishing our means of taxation, we have diminished opportunities to raise revenue.",49
195,Mr JACKSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,B y a little economy.,49
196,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,I suppose the honourable member means the stoppage of public works and the throwing of people out 'of employment ?,49
197,Mr JACKSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,That is not economy.,49
198,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"I quite took it that that was the kind of economy suggested at any rate, if public works are stopped, and unemployment is caused, honourable members opposite will have achieved what their masters told them to achieve. The Commonwealth has spent £400,000,000 or over; and on what ? Was it used to build railways, construct - water conservation works, or lent to the States to be used in revenue-producing developments? No ; for the most part the money has been thrown away in powder. It was a large insurance for our safety, but the money is gone, and we have hardly an asset to show. The only asset we hold in respect of money advanced to the States is - the transferred properties, representing £9,000,000 or £10,000,000. How different is the position of the States. I do not say that all the money borrowed by the States has been spent upon, reThat productive works. There are some people who would have us believe that our education systems are not reproductive; but really they represent tl.e finest and most reproductive expenditure we can undertake. Beyond that, however, the States have their railways,, water conservation schemes, and quite a number of other State instrumentalities that yield constant revenue. There are men of the same political opinions as mine who sit in - the State Parliaments, but, unfortunately, they have been attacked by the microbe of State rights, and it is those men we have to convert to our view. No man or woman, having regard to the present position, can view with equanimity the proposition laid down by the Prime M in ister at the Conference with State Premiers. The Commonwealth needs all the revenue that it can raise, because it has now a great deal more to do than in the past. The Commonwealth, for example, must carry out certain public works, and help to develop the country. We have lent the States £500,000 for road construction,, and there are great schemes for which it is essential that the Commonwealth should find, the funds, since they will never be carried out by the States, notwithstanding that the people are clamouring for them. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has pointed out-and this is the kernel of the question-w e have allowed the Stite Rights crowd to filch from us certain of our, rights' of taxation. I cannot conceive of any man, who, seeking election ; to this Parliament, would be prepared to endorse the proposition laid down hy the Prime Minister at the Conference, ^ and again this afternoon. Such a proposition is against the very Constitution that we are sent here by the people to administer to the best of our ability; to act as the Prime Minister suggests would be to practically tear leaves out of our charter. If the people thought there was a danger of a majority in this Parliament limiting in any way its powers, or interfering with our constitutional rights-, candidates who supported such limitation or interference would have very little chance of success. Such Federal candidates would be told that if they were prepared to hand over further powers to the States, and thus belittle the National Parliament, they had no right to seek seats in the latter; they would be told that they must rid themselves of local jealousies, and enter the Federal sphere in a true Federal spirit, and do their full Federal duty. States have been successful in this regard, simply because there is a weak Government in. power. Ever since Federation became a fact there have been these attempts to aggrandize the States at the expense of the Commonwealth. For over twenty-two years successive Governments have withstood the pressure of State requests, and it has remained for the present Government, in 1923, to accede to them, and to hand over to the States - privileges which up to the present have been enjoyed by the Federal Parliament under the Constitution. The Government, of course, have their majority, and they say that what is proposed is all right. But I remind them of what happened as a result of legislation passed in 1909. In that year, notwithstanding a choriis of protest from this side of the House, £he Government of the day put certain measures on the statute-book. Parliament went to the country in the following year. During that election campaign members of the Labour party explained to the people what had been done, and declared that, if returned to power, they would immediately take steps to repeal certain of the measures that had been passed. The people responded. They gave Labour a majority in both Houses, and, as a result, the legislation passed in 1909 was repealed. Let me quote for the information of honourable members what the Leader of our party (Mr Charlton) had to say in respect of the industrial situation during the election campaign last yearVested interests believe that, aided by unemployment, and by the Governments, they can break the working-class organizations and reduce wages below the standard. They desire the abolition of the - Court, and their Governments move to the desired end. Federal servants have been removed from the general Court to a special Court, and from this special Court more and more are being eliminated. The effort to remove State employees from the shelter of the Arbitration Court has been defeated by the High Court. The Victorian State Government, on behalf of itself and other National and State Governments, is sending Mr Owen Dixon to the Privy Council. If he loses, the Commonwealth National Government will come into the open - with an amending Bill to exclude all State employees from the Arbitration Court. The Bill is already drafted.",49
199,Mr MCGRATH,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,And Mr Owen Dixon lost his case.,50
200,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Yes . The Privy The Oouncil practically told him that he had no standing.,50
201,Mr WEST,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"He was informed that Australia was governed by its own Parliaments, notby the British Parliament.",50
202,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Lt . was tantamount U that. The Privy Council told Mr Dixon' that he had no standing, and, in effect, that he should mind his own business. It was upon the strength of the declaration made by our Leader that Labour candidates were returned in such strength at the last election. What followed in 1910 will happen again. Much of the legislation that will be placed upon the statute book this session and, perhaps, in succeeding sessions, if the Government live so long, will certainly be repealed when the Labour party return to power, because we shall then have a mandate from the people to repeal it. We shall not go behind the backs of the people, but, as in 1910, we shall restore constitutional government. On the occasion to which I refer, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) was most emphatic in his declaration that, as soon as the Labour party were returned to power, they would take steps to repeal the legislation that had heen placed upon the statute-book in the preceding year by the Fusion Government. But we shall do nothing without the approval of the people. If , as a result of a division in this House we were able to displace the Government, we should not expect to carry on except after an appeal to the people, and receiving from them in no uncertain terms a mandate to do so. I could, if I wished, refer to a long list of acts of maladministration committed by this Governmeut, but perhaps that would not come within the compass of this amendment. Some honourable members may not attach much value to an expression of opinion from this side of the House, but I can assure them that some weight, will the attached to it in other parts of the world, and that possibly it will influence some of the decisions to be recorded elsewhere. The Prime Minister this emphasized that Australia presented fit the Imperial and Economic Conferences. The object of the latter, as' we are all aware, will be to bring about a system of preferential trading the component parts of the Empire",50
203,Mr WEST,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,It will be a waste of time.,51
204,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Of course it will. Prime Minister might just as well think he could shift the Rock of Gibraltar by dancing a highland fling on the steamer as it passed through the strait as that he will be able to induce the British ment to reverse their traditional policy, because the Government of Britain, like the present Government, are under the infltience of the financial interests. It is not at all likely that they will give heed to the Prime Minister's plea for preference for Australian commodities when so many millions of British capital are invested in the Argentine. There was a golden opportunity of giving effect to this j>rinciple quite recently in connection with the contract for meat supplies for the Army. I shall interrogate Minister as tp his own action in regard to that matter, and, if possible, wihat he did to advance the principle of preference for the Australian",51
205,Unknown,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Sitting suspended from 6 SO to 8 p.m.,51
206,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"It is rather amusing to read some of the statements made by members of the British Cabinet on reciprocal trade or the development of the resources of the Empire. I shall quote a few lines from a speeoh delivered by Mr Amery, Secretary to the Britisli Admiralty, who occupies an official position in which he is able fo exercise influence in the direction of giving trade to overseas Dominions. I do not think I am incorrect in saying that Mr Amery was one of a British parliamentary delegation which visited Australia a few years ago, and that he possesses the advantage of being somewhat conversant with Australian conditions. Several of the members of that delegation have since been Cabinet Ministers in British Governments, and I can readily recall some of the speeches they delivered hv Australia, in which they indicated in unequivocal terms that when they returned to Great Britain they would do their utmost to advertise Australian goods, and see that Britishers, at any rate, made afternoon reciprocal arrangements in the matter of must be re- trade. Mr Amery, a few weeks ago, gave expression .to sentiments such as these, "" Our certain hope of recovery from the effects of the war lies in devebetween loping the resources within the Empire."" To be logical, one could not express such an opinion and fail when the opportunity arose to give Australia as well as the The other Dominions her share of trade. But what is it that has followed ? It is amusing to read in recently published statements that the Imperial meat contracts have been placed with Argentine proGovern- ducers. Such actions lead one to believe that the British Ministers do not in tend to give much consideration to Australian producers. It would require the wisdom of Solomon and the eloquence of Demosthenes to make them alter their methods of dealing with trade within the Empire. I do not wish to depreciate the actions of those who live in the Old Land, but it is well known that although the Armistice, was signed as late as November, 1918, German Christmas toys were being British sold in the West End of London immethe Prime diately after. Ever since that time the British people have been trading with ascertain foreigners in preference to their own people. Ifc therefore seems futile for the product. Prime' Minister to endeavour to induce the British people to enter into reciprocal trade arrangements with Australia or any of the other Dominions. I believe the time of the Prime Minister would be better utilized in other efforts. He referred to the League of Nations, and claims to be one of its champions. He is a believer in its principles and the rules laid down j o r negotiations between the nations. The honourable gentleman, however, endeavoured to belifctle the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), and asked if this side of the House would agree to the wool produced in Australia being disbributedi according to the wisdom of the delegates to the. League. That was the bogy he raised in answer to the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. I do not think the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) would endorse the opinion of the Prime Minister concerning the League of Nations. It is the attitude of certain statesmen in Britain , in Australia, and countries, toward the League that the Leader of the Opposition deprecates. The League may not be able to achieve its highest ideals at the outset; but there is no reason why its operations should not be encouraged, and an endeavour made to reduce armaments in order to secure the peace of the world.",51
207,Mr BOWDEN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Grea t B r it a in has given evidence of her intention to reduce armaments. "" Mr Fenton - That is true; and, as Great Britain, has done so, there was little necessity for the Prime Minister to speak as he did today. It is very strange that other nations who are in a less perilous position than Great B r it a in are not prepared to do as she has done. B r it a in has given a good lead to Australia, and one which, I hope, will be followed by others. The nation in the East which is so frequently referred to has also made reductions in armaments, and to a greater extent than some of those who wish to foster the war spirit are inclined to give her credit for. The Prime Minister has also complained because a protest has been uttered against Parliament going into recess within ten weeks, and, in justification of the intended action of the Government, he mentioned the fact that the Premier of New South Wales (Sir George Fuller) and the Premier of Victoria (Mr Lawson) are at present abroad because the Parliaments of their States are in recess. gentlemen selected a suitable occasion to go away, and expect to return to Australia and meet Parliament at the accustomed time. We have been awaiting an opportunity, which up to the present . has been denied us, of discussing the financial of Australia. Even in a session of six months, we would hardly have sufficient time to deal with the whole of the financial problems confronting us. We could not have that privilege during the war because important measures had to be rushed through. The war spirit prevailed, fabulous sums were spent, and we were prepared, in a sense, to allow important matters to pass with very little discussion. But now the Parliaments of all countries are looking closely into financial questions and studying keenly every item of expenditure. Surely the Commonwealth Parliament is not other exempt from this responsibility. It is, therefore, our duty to remain sitting sufficiently long to investigate thoroughly all financial proposals put forward for the benefit of Australia. Those honourable members who are prepared to allow the discussion of the financial position of the Commonwealth to go by the board, simply because one .member of this Parliament is anxious to get away to Europe, are not m in d f u l of their duty, and are recreant fco the trust reposed in them by the people. The British House of Commons will be sitting when the Imperial Conference and the Economic Conference are held, yet the Commonwealth Parliament is expected to go into recess. In any case, the British Government will not dare to hand over to Australia the contracts it has given to foreign countries in whose finances the people of Great Britain are so deeply involved.",52
208,Mr BOWDEN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Giv e him, afc least, the chance.",52
209,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"What is said here will be known on the other side of the world. For the first time in the history of the British Parliament the Opposition proper in the House of Commons is"" composed wholly and solely of Labour representatives, led by Mr Bamsay Macdonald; but the Labour party in this Parliamentis in an even stronger position. Australian factories which a little time past were going full steam ahead are now Those working only for a limited time, because unpatriotic Australians prefer to buy the goods manufactured by other than Australian workmen. Lady Northcote, wife of a former Governor General, being an American by birth , knew what it meant to "" barrack "" for one's own country position and buy goods produced in one's own country. When she was in Australia, she set a splendid example to the women here by urging them to do as she was doing and buy goods made of Australian material. It is to our lasting disgrace that we have not followed her advice. We are told that our Tariff revenue is bounding. That simply means that the Tariff is no longer protective. The Treasurer would not be enjoying this huge revenue were it not for the fact that so many Australians prefer to buy foreign goods made most likely under miserable sweating conditions instead of providing employment for'Australian workmen under decent labour conditions. If we could only create an Australian sentiment in this respect, we need not care a snap of the fingers for our Tariff; even our farmers would be found purchasing goods made in Australia in preference to those made in other parts of the world. If I had the opportunity I would make our Tariff truly protective. I would prevent any goods from coming here. One is not more than twenty-four hours in the United States of America before he realizes that the people there are prepared to stick up for their own country and to purchase goods made by their own workmen to a far greater extent than we do in Australia. If we copied their example there would soon be more employment in Australia and more contentment in industrial circles than is evident today. Obeying the dictates of the State Premiers, the Government are seeking to paddock off at least 150,000 or possibly 170,000 persons employed in State instrumentalities by preventing them from approaching the Eederal Arbitration Court. Why should these men be shut out of the Federal Arbitration 'Court? great cry of those who fought for a universal franchise and democracy was "" greater privileges for the people."" Yet here, in this supposed enlightened country, we have a Government which is prepared to take a retrograde step, and say that tens of thousands of men and women have no right to approach the Federal Arbitration Court. The position is anomalous, to say the least of it. If action is tffken to deprive these employees of their rights, there will be great trouble. down. Were any honourable member opposite prevented from exercising his privilege of going into one of the Courts of justice in order to 'have a wrong redressed, he would be the first to protest against such ill-treatment; but the present Government are prepared to so tinker with the industrial situation as to play into the hands of private employers, and take away a right which the employees of Mr Fenton. State instrumentalities have been declared by the High Court to possess. Among these employees aTe the railway men, and no body of men is doing a finer work - than they in assisting to develop Australia. Their employment takes many of them far from the centres of population. They are required to live in isolated spots, where the facilities for the education of their children are of the most meagre character. Australia is developing on quite socialistic lines, and there is an increasing army of employees of State instrumentalities, such as - railways and tramways, municipal councils, water and sewerage Boards, fire brigades, and harbour trusts. There will soon be quite an army of men employed in Victoria in connection with the Morwell electricity scheme, and this State, which has been described as a cabbage garden, will be the home of .one of the finest socialistic ventures yet undertaken in Australia. Day by day the employees in State instrumentalities are increasing in number, and the total is bound to grow. The demands of these men must increase, and any Government which tampers with their rights and privileges will suffer for it at the ballot box. I join in the expression of regret at the death of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank (Sir Denison Miller). The people may not have obtained from The the Bank all that they desired. Had the war not intervened, and had the Labour party remained in power, a system of rural credits would have been in full operation ere now. One of the principal proposals of Mr King O'Malley, who took a foremost part in the inauguration of the Commonwealth Bank, was the introduction of rural credits, and the Labour party believed in the scheme.",52
210,Mr BAMFORD,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Hi s party turned it,53
211,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,Not at all. The honourable member has been so long out of the Labour party that he forgets the good things it has done.,53
212,Mr BAMFOED,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,The party turned the Board down.,53
213,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The Board was intended to be so constituted as to take over all the State Savings Banks in Australia. Notwithstanding the assurance contained in the Governor General's Speech, I am inclined to think that the Board to the appointed to control the Commonwealth Bank will be of a political complexion. There may be one or two exceptions, but most of the Boards appointed in recent years have had a strong political bias, and I fear a continuance of the evil. The wires are already heing - pulled in connection with the appointment of the Commonwealth Bank Board, and Ministers know it. Honourable members are being communicated with on the matter,, and. influence is being brought to bear to place on the Board a set ofmen who will do their level 'best to give the Bank a-setback, and allow the private banks.to regain the sway they have enjoyed in the past. There have been attempts to belittle the services of the Commonwealth Bank.",53
214,Mr MCGRATH,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,B y those who fear,54
215,Mr FENTON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"There are some who do, The latest figures issued show that since 1912 the Bank has made a profit over £4,000,000, of which amount £2,000,000 has been placed to the reserve fund, and £2,000,000 to the redemption fund, which can be used either to redeem should debentures issued by the Bank or to rewealth. deem Commonwealth loans. A considerable portion of Australia's debt of £400,000,000 was built up during the period, and the Commonwealth Bank and had control of the flotation of the bulk the loans raised, thereby effecting a saving to the taxpayers of £6,000,000 compared with the charges that would have been incurred if the private banks had floated the loans. That makes a total gain £10,000,000-£4,000,00 0 in profits, and today? £6,000,000 that has been saved. Those industrial issue. are oniy two of the main items; more could be enumerated to show the benefit that the Bank has been to Australia. Mr Anderson, a member of the'' Board of Directors of the London Branch of the Bank of Australasia, speaking when the Bank was established, saidX speak as the member of the Board of a private bank. J am going to say this: the Commonwealth Bank is properly managed, it should obtain a position in Australia to the Bank of England in the British Islands. The Bank, assisted, no doubt, by the effects of the War, has become the bank of bank3 in Australia. It has fulfilled Mr Anderson's prediction in a remarkably short space of time, and, because of that fact, there is not the same danger of financial collapse and disaster in this country as there wasin days gone by. The Prime Minister spoke today of "" varying and conflicting Arbitration Court decisions."" In order to remedy that condition of affairs, he proposes to make the decisions even more varying and conflicting. I have cited Sir Arthur Robinson's view that the arbitration proposals of the Prime Minister would produce ""confusion worse confounded."" The States will not accept the Prime Minister's proposals, or, if they accept them, will so emasculate them that their sponsor will not recognise them when he sees them. ' The two men who know more about industrial conditions and arbitration' in Australia than any one else are the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and a former Premier of New South Wales it. (Mr Holman), both of whom once belonged to the Labour party. While Mr. Hughes did not go so far as to say that of all industries should be under the sole control of the Commonwealth, Mr Holman, although a strong advocate of'State rights, has said that all industrial powers be handed over to the CommonThese two men stand out as knowing mountains more about the - sub' ject than is known by those who are dabbling with the arbitration problem towar day. Members of the Labour party know, the Australian trade unions know, that of the Federal Arbitration Court has promoted industrial peace and contentment, and has been more successful than any other institution in the attempt to regulate industrial affairs. That being so, of why should men try to tamper with it They are only confusing the They are sowing seeds which will produce an abundant harvest great ) of trouble in the future. The Bank of New South Wales is another example of a successful bank. It has been in operation for seventy years, and has come through good and bad times. It is one of the oldest banks in if Australia. During the last six months for which figures have been published it similar made a net profit of £432,000, which is the largest profit it has ever made in its seventy years' existence. The total profits from 1914 to March, 1923, amounted to £5,433,000. This is another important institution with which .the Government intends to tamper, although it stands out conspicuously as a monument of splendid nnancial achievement. The Prime Minister was most deliberate in his remarks about immigration. spoke in terms that have not been in dulged in by the most desperate Prime Minister that has ever preceded him. He had no warrant for the language he used. He said emphatically, "" The Labour party of Australia is absolutely against immigration."" It is not, nor is the British 1 Labour party, from whose ranks immigrants will to a large extent be drawn. But the British Labour party has saidWhen oversea Dominions have provided for their own people, and' found them ; employment, we realise that some of our surplus population must go. Mr Robb, Minister for Customs in Canada, said in the course of an interviewWe will first of all supply land and give employment to our own returned soldiers and our own Canadian people, and when that has been done, and they are fully supplied, we will then open up with a vigorous immigration policy. That is the proper way. The - Governments today, with one exception, are prepared to do their best to flood this country type of immigrant, because, like Commonwealth Government, - they under the thumb of the great financial institutions. Is it contended that what the Leader of the Opposition has said is not true ? Is it not known that in scores of cases young fellows have been sent into the back country to slave for a mere pittance? This ""land of gold and glory,"" as it was painted to them by emigration agents and the representatives tralian Governments, has proved to them a land of disappointment. When find the picture much more drab than it was represented to be, they naturally feel dissatisfied. What is doing most harm to the immigration policy of the Government ? It is not the Labour party's opposition, but the letters which immigrants are sending home, and' the accounts which are being given by others who have returned to their native country. Is it any wonder that the Labour party is saying that until tralia is prepared to provide for its own people, and make room for those who wish to come across the seas, it is averse Mr Fenton. to indiscriminate immigration ? The State Governments, at the behest of employers, are obtaining immigrants, and as a result of the influx of the new arrivals they hope to see a reduction of He wages, a lowering of the standard of living, and the creation of chaos in the industrial world. Among the Britishers who arrived five or six years ago are many who are sadly disappointed. In some cases three families are living in one small house. These men know the facts, and they tell their friends in England that so far as land, houses, and employment are concerned, there are not opportunities for the numbers of people who are coming here. It is of no"" use our blinking the facts. We on this side' of the House state the true position merely to warn the Commonwealth and the State Governments of the consequences of what they are doing. What would happen if , in the financial year ending on 30th June, 1924, we bring in 20,000 or 30,000 people, and 10,000 of them cannot find employment? It would result in a great slump in the very scheme which the Government and its supporters heartily applaud. We are merely saying what Mr Robb, the Canadian Minister for Customs, who is State not a Labour man, said. Houses, land, and employment should be provided for level our own people first, and when that has with any been done we may launch a vigorthe ous. immigration policy. I have letters are from young men, some of them returned soldiers, who are trying to obtain laud. . They have to enlist the sympathy and support of a Federal member to approach the State Lands Department for land, and even then they cannot all get it . Tbese men are suitable settlers and do not need any special training. Some of them are sons of farmers, and they know of Aus- the work thoroughly. It is very unfair fco bring competitors from Great Britain they ""to this sphere of activity when our own farmers and returned soldiers are not receiving their just dues. Depend upon it, if the Government carry out their present intention in regard to immigration, there will be a big row, not only in this dissatisfied House, but outside.",54

The men who took part in the great World War, and witnessed the bloodshed and carnage which resulted, should be amongst rthe first to give effect to the Gospel of Peace, notonly in Australia, but in every part of the world. That will be the attitude adopted by the Prime Ministers at the Imperial Conference, with the one exception of Australia's bellicose Prime Minister. If the Leader of the Government persists in his views, he will meet with a snub at the Conference. A cartoon published today depicts two or three very stout gentlemen seated before a hamper, representing the Commonwealth's taxation proposals, and remarking appreciatively, "" This is the best hamper Bruce has yet given us."" I agree with the remark. This session should be devoted to a discussion of the financial position of Australia, and if the Prime Minister persists in his intention to l i m it the session to ten weeks, it will be a slur upon the Ministry and upon the party that accedes to such a demand.

222,Mr WEST,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"There are better men this side of the House, and I would be quite content to give the Leader of Opposition an opportunity of leading the Government. The financial position of Australia should be the foremost question in the.minds of members of this Parliament and those who are desirous of placing Australia in the position it should occupy. Ifc is impossible for Australia to realise its destiny while the present M in istry remain in power, controlled by in fluences represented by the Melbourne Club and other like institutions. The Government of today are dominated in exactly the same way as the Victorian Parliament was dominated some years, ago by the Melbourne Age. Mr Deakin, when writing the biography of the late Mr David Syme, said that no Government was formed nor Minister appointed without previous consultation with Mr . Syme. To-day the Government of the Commonwealth are similarly governed by certain influences in Melbourne and thefriends of the Prime Minister. During the last few months I have asked several questions in this House with a view to awakening the Ministry to a sense of their responsibilities. I asked the Treasurer whether the Government would give-honourable members an opportunity of dealing with the war loan obligations, and the only reply I received from the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) was that he would be very pleased to look into the whole matter. I - asked the Treasurer, also1. Will he inform the House what was the Commonwealth indebtedness to the Government of the TJnited Kingdom in September, 1922, on account of war loans amounting to £91,433,281 ? 2. Is the amount owing represented by scrip or debentures ?3. What is the rate of interest, and what are the conditions of redemption ? I do not think any member of this Parliament knew whafc the amount was, or the extent of the loan indebtedness. I . do Ausnot think even the members of the GoThese are 3k per cent.

This payment covers interest at the rates the stated. The balance of the payment is applied towards the redemption of the debt, which will be extinguished in 1956. Amount of debt Interest Bank and other charges In 1921 Sir Joseph Cook was Treasurer. Reading the financial journals which came out from England, I began to be alarmed regarding the loans which were being floated in London. I asked Sir Joseph Loanfloatedin London on 22nd October, 1921. £5,000,000 at 96. Loan received .. .. .. Cost of flotation.. .. .. Amount received .. ..

During last year I asked whether the Government were prepared to allow Parliament to deal with the question of the Mr West.

I was told that it was not usual for a Government to make public details regarding loan transactions. The action which I wanted the Government to take was uot unusual: similar action has beeu taken by statesmen in Great Britain , where the first successful loan conversion was made in 1749. I was not asking that anything should be done which would affect detrimentally our loan transactions. I was prompted to make that request, because I had in my mind the associates of the present Ministry. We judge men by the company they keep, and I am justified in judging the Ministry by the company they keep in dealing with the financial interests of Australia. During the progress of the Great W a r I again and again brought under the notice of the Government that whereas Great Britain was setting apart 33 per cent, of her actual income from all sources to defray the cost of carrying on the conflict, we in Australia were' doing nothing in that direction. I urged that the example of the Motherland should be followed. The Nationalist party was in power when the War-time Profits Assessment Bill was troduced, and the Labour party endeavoured to induce the Government to take steps to compel those who, as the result of the war, were making huge profits, to contribute a proportion of these gains towards the cost of the war. It is useless to deny that great profits were made in Australia during the war period. In one year we raised over £80,000,000 over and above the ordinary revenue. That liuge sum of money was distributed amongst the community, and so out of the unfortunate circumstances of war, many became phenomenally rich. A new aristocracy was created in Australia, and honours were bestowed so freely that even a theatrical man was knighted for running a vaudeville show. A knighthood, indeed, became so cheap that the average citizen came to look upon a knight much as he would look upon a mongrel in the Street. There was a time when honours were conferred on men only for rendering great service to the community either in the political arena or in the field of science, art, or literature. In those days honours conferred upon a citizen by the K in g were regarded with the utmost respect; but, today, practically no respect attaches to them. Coming to the question of loan conversions I find that the first attempt to convert the national debt of Great Britain was made by Sir Bobert Walpole in 1714. w Walpole was not very successful, but another conversion scheme carried out by Henry Pelham, in 1749, was very satisfactory. I suggested in the House that the Government should follow the example set by Pelham, who, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1749, was the first to secure the passing of legislation providing for loan conversion. I urged the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to take similar action with regard to our .war loans, but my suggestion was turned down, doubtless because I was a member of the Labour party, and was considered, therefore, not to be socially the equal of honourable members opposite. A British Parliament, composed largely of Tories, in 1749 passed a Bill introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer providing for the conversion of about £58,000,000 of 4 per cents. The terms were that for one year the rate of 4 per cent, should be continued; then for - the next seven years the interest payable should be 3£ in - per cent., and thereafter 3 per cent., with a proviso that the Government should not be at liberty to pay off any part of the loan without giving one year's notice. That measure was agreed to by a British Parliament, amongst the members of which were many men connected with the banking and other financial institutions in Lombardstreet and Threadneedle-street. They were patriotic enough to realise that the working section of the community should not. be bled in order that the national war debt might be paid off. Gladstone in 1853 endeavoured to carry out a further conversion scheme, but was not very successful owing to the fact that at the time events were rapidly leading up to the Crimean War. In 18SS, Mr . Goschen carried out a large and successf u l loan conversion. He grouped the - whole of the 3 per cents., amounting to £558,000,000, and by Act of Parliament consolidated them into new stock to bear 2^ per cent, until 1923, and thereafter 1 \ per cent. The position in Australia is wholly different. Honourable members opposite are not prepared to allow this Parliament to deal with the national finances, which are the very groundwork of all our responsibilities. A failure of our finances throws thousands of people out of work; yet we are told that it is wrong that Parliament should deal with loan conversions. I have in mind tonight, not loans raised 'for carrying oub of repToductive works, but war loans-mone y raised for war poses, which vanished in the smoke of battles that depleted our manhood. Mr Goschen in making his conversions received some assistance from the fact that he converted many of 'his loans into 2^ per cent, consols, ancl the Savings Bank took up a large number of these consolsand held them for some time. I repeat again that the whole of these operations were carried out with the sanction of the Parliament of the country. I have referred to these loan operations in Great. Britain in order to put an object lesson before Che members of this Parliament. I desire that they should have more respect for the Parliament and the position they occupy, and should realise better than they appear to do what the people of Australia have sent them here for. T hold the opinion that present members of Parliament are notas big men as were some who have gone before them, and do not reach the standard of parliamentarians of some years ago. I have been troubled in mind for some time by the fact that, although loans are falling due, there is a total indifference displayed by the Government and their supporters as to what Amount of Loan 38,723,590 Interest Interest, Bonus and Cost.. 49,619,845 Bonus to Shareholders I think it is fair to ask the Governup ment why they have proposed to exsmaller tend this loan for twenty-five Such a course would not have been and followed in any other part of the habitthat able globe where parliamentary ment is in operation. Por £38,723,590, we will pay in the twentyThere five years £4 9,619,845, and when we paid that amount, we shall still have £38.723,590 to pay. Why is this done? actual facts. The only conclusion to which I can come is that it is due to the influence by the insurance companies. I know that the Prime Minister is likely to have social acquaintance with Mr Garvan, Mr. Meeks, and gentlemen like them, and this loan of £38,000,000 is only being taken Mr West. the result may be, and what are their repur- sponsibilities in this connection. I thought that honourable members would have awakened to the fact that the time has arrived when our financial position, so far as loans are concerned, is a matter worthy of their serious consideration. The loan that is at present uppermost in my mind is theconversion loan of £38,723,590, In connection with this loan, a bonus is being given by the Government. It is higher than that paid during the war period. I do not know why. Surely £ 5 Is. 5d. per cent. should satisfy the - most greedy individual who has money to lend to the community in view of the fact that it represents a War Loan conversion, l t is not as though the money were being borrowed to be invested in some commercial enterprise which might be liable to go into liquidation. A gilt-edged security is offered, and yet interest and bonus during the twenty-five years, which is to be the duration of the loan, will amount to £49,619,845 or nearly £2,000,000 more than the actual amount of the loan itself. The operation is set out in form of a balance-sheet, as follows : CONVERSION OF LOAN, 1923. £ 49,082,60 6 387,239 Cost of Conversion and Expenses 150,00 0 49,619,845 Balance due 1948 3S,723,590 £88,343,435 £88,343,435 by the big insurance companies. The people do not know why the loan years. should be for a term of twenty-five years, I cannot understand it , unless it be the unfortunate Treasurer, being new govern to ofiice,. has been surrounded by these this people and they have led him astray. can be no other excuse for what have he has done. Every statement. I have the made on this subject is based upon the I do not know why the Treasurer should not be as well informed exerted as I am on this subject. I am"" only an ordinary individual. I have not had the a same opportunities as the honourable gentleman. I have no clerks to obtain in formation for me, and I did not receive a University education. When I went to school, schools were carried on by private enterprise. I nave to obtain my information from trade and nnancial journals, and this is what one of them says The average bank rate of interest in London during last year was £3 13s. per cent., as against £6 Is. 5d. per cent, in 1921 and £6 14s. 2d. per cent, in 1920. The average in the second half of the year, according to calculations made by the Statist, was substantially below that for the first half. Even the trade and financial journals supporting the views of honourable members opposite point out the fact that in two years the average rate of interest fell from 6 per cent, to 3 per cent., and yet the Commonwealth Treasurer offers £ 5 Is. 5d. per cent, for twenty-five years to satisfy insurance companies and such institutions that have money to lend. I have obtained some further information which may be of value to the Treasurer from an Australian journal. It is not a Labour journal, but one which will probably be found on the tables of clubs in Melbourne. No doubt the Governor General receives it , and probably the Speaker glances at it occasionally, seeing that he takes an interest in public companies. This journal made the following statement in A p r i l , 1923: Mortgages are being quoted by some institutions, banking and others, at a rate that would not have been looked at some months ago, but there has not Ibeen any relaxation in the matter of rigid exaction with reference to the soundness of backing offered for that class of accommodation. It will be seen that there is direct evidence that the ^bank rate has gone down in such a way as to justify my strong opposition to the flotation of this loan for twenty-five years, to the benefit of persons who are interested in financial in stitutions. At the present time there is what is known as a Finance Committee in connection with the Treasury, and all the three members of that Committee are connected with public companies, for their services to which they receive large emoluments. Doubtless those services are faith full y rendered, and I ask, How can these men defend the interests of the Commonwealth when the interests of their own in stitutions are involved ? No doubt, those institutions benefit by the advice these gentlemen give the Treasurer, and I do not see how we can expect anything else. I know they are respectable men and good citizens, but, as apublic man, whatever may be my opinion of their social and other qualities, it is my duty to represent the people. The figures and quotations I have laid before honourable members are, I submit, sufficient in themselves to compel this Parliament to deal with the finances, and not allow secret diplomacy to have control over millions of money. We have such transactions as borrowing £38,000,000, paying £49,000,000 in in terest, and then still owing the original loan; and that is a condition of things that cannot be allowed to continue. In 1925 we shall have £49,000,000, and in 1927, £72,000,000, falling due, and I ask whether we shall then do the same as in the past. We are not fit for our jobs as representative men in a legislative body, with the destinies of Australia in our hands, if we allow such financing to continue. In December, 1922, the population of Australia was financial 5,634,352, and our total debt was about £850,000,000. This Ministry is certainly going on very rapidly, and it is distinguished by two outstanding featuresexcess of borrowing, and the desire to destroy Commonwealth activities which have within them the possibility of combating the profiteers, as shown in their action in regard to the Geelong Woollen Mills and the Federal shipping. Mr . Lawson, the Premier of Victoria, and Sir George Fuller, Premier of New Soutn Wales, both went to London in their official capacity, and I suppose our own Prime Minister is filled with t/he desire to do the same thing. No doubt, when the Prime Minister does arrive, he will be invited to the Carlton Club, the Reform Club, or the Athenaeum Club, and given a fine dinner amid magnificent surroundings. Under, such influences he - will be, as it were, hypnotized, and then the company will begin to talk about borrowing money. Under such conditions Australia must suffer. It is said that Sir George Fuller is anxious to be "" Baron Fuller, of Blow Hole,"" a noted place near Kiama. Lord Forrest, who was elevated to the peerage only a very short time before his death, was a nice old man whom I loved; but he was ambitious, and thought more of being a lord than of anything else on earth. Mr MCGRATH'-Will it be Lord Bruce ? Mr. WEST - No , I think it will be another title for the Prime Minister; his name is Stanley Melbourne Bruce, and probably he would like to be the "" Duke of Melbourne.""- These visiting Premiers are really canvassers; they have nothing to sell, but they, are seeking money, and in so doing are inflicting untold in ju ry on Australia. It is hard for us to realise what evil is done by these means. I knew London well in my youthful days, and 1 can appreciate what the effect of such visits must be on the interests of this country. Had we had in power a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who knew their business, they would have told the Premiers' Conference that this National Parliament will wake up to the responsibility the people placed in their hands when Pederation was established, ana that the Commonwealth Government and Parliament must be the only governing power in Australia. The Premier or South Australia, Sir Henry Barwell, was knighted for making the suggestion, when at-Home- a suggestion with which I do not think many honourable members will agree-thaf c a' barbed wire fence should be placed across the northern portion of Australia, and any race, however objectionable, allowed to settle beyonci that fence. There seems to be no other reason at all why that gentleman should have been knighted.",56
223,Mr LACEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,He promised to do away with the Arbitration Courts.,61
224,Mr WEST,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"That is a small matter compared with the maintenance of our White Australia policy. I remember that when Sir Henry Parkes, as Premier of New South Wales, placed a poll tax of £100 on Chinese, .there was quite a turmoil on Circular Quay, numbers of men, each armed with a lump of wood, being prepared to meet the immigrants. The Chinese were on the ships in the harbors, and I asked Sir Henry whether he intended to prevent our stopping Asiatic races from entering this country of ours-whethe r he would like his daughter to bring home to tea on a Sunday one of the Chinese as her young man. "" Would you like a Lascar for a son-inlaw?"" I asked. He replied, "" Jack, I certainly would not."" "" Then,"" said I , "" you should not do anything that would make it possible for any g i r l to put her in that relation."" That would be the result of any departure from our White Australia policy. Either the white population would be driven out of our northern areas or they would be dragged down to the level of the coloured and Asiatic races. An y attempt in this direction must be sternly checked. The authority of State Governments must give way to the will of the National Parliament. The responsibility is on us to see that the already burdensome public debt of nearly £1,000,000,000 is not unduly enlarged. Are honourable members aware that the public debt of this country, State and Federal, represents a mortgage of about 10s. per acre of the whole continent, including swamp lands, lakes, rivers, mountains, and unproductive waste areas? The recent Conference of Ministers was a farce. It s decisions have been ridiculed on every hand because the representatives of the various States are what were known in the early days of Federation as "" L it t l e Australians,"" whose vision does not extend beyond the buttons of their waistcoats. Do they realise, I wonder, that in every ten years the Commonwealth has to provide £270,000,000 by way of interest on its public debt and still has the debt to pay? In view of our financial position, it was extraordinary that the Prime Minister should surrender this right of direct taxation to the States. I can only come to the conclusion that he is prepared to allow the burden of Customs and Excise duties to fall upon the poorer sections of the community, whose contribution to the Consolidated Revenue in this way would equal that of a man with an income of from £7,000 to £10,000 a year. The attitude of the Government in regard to our finances is in marked contrast with the course adopted by Mr . Stanley Baldwin, Chancellor of the British Exchequer, who recently announced that owing to unexpected reductions in expenditure there would be a surplus of £101,000,000, which would be applied to the reduction of the National Debt, and that next year it would be possible to reduce the debt by another £50,000,000. The Commonwealth Ministry, it appears, are content to take 10 per cent, off the income tax, and to submit a proposal to borrow £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 to extend the facilities of the father Postal Department. And as the result of secret negotiations in connection with the conversion of loans, substantial benefits are to be conferred upon a limited number of insurance companies and other financial institutions. I enter my strong . protest against the introduction of sectarianism during the last election campaign, and the suggestion that I and other members of my party were not f it to sit in this Parliament. No one is so vile as the man who would sell himself and his principles for position, place and power. In connection with a measure brought forward in the Parliament of Great Britain, a Mr Johnson drew attention to the Commonwealth Bank which until rece,ntly has been under the control of Sir Denison Miller. In the death of that gentleman, Australia has lost one of her most able men, and in writing to his widow I said that I found it difficult to express my sympathy with her in her bereavement, and in the loss which Australia had sustained in consequence of his death. A few months ago a gentleman named Mr Williams, connected with a British banking institution, wrote to the Associated Banks of Australia in an endeavour to get them to use their influence in getting the Australian note issue increased to overcome the difficulty in meeting payments for the excess of imports over exports. The communication was brought under my notice, and I was astounded to think that there was a possibility of the note issue being used for such a purpose. I mentioned the matter to the late Sir Denison Miller, who said, "" West, no such tricks will be played by those gentlemen."" The Government propose to appoint a Board to control the Commonwealth Bank, and I presume the members of that Board will consist of men who are occupying important positions in connection with existing financial institutions. Naturally they will consider the interests of the institutions with which they are directly concerned.",61
225,Mr BRUCE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"The honourable member is, of course, aware that the note has been under the control of a Board some time.",62
226,Mr WEST,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"Yes , and apparently that Board has been able to do is to stitute, for what was generally regarded as a serviceable note, a miserably nificant production. The Commonwealth Bank is a magnificent institution, out i to be regretted that its services have been utilized by the various State Governthau ments. Queensland, which is the best governed State in the Commonwealth, and consequently the most prosperous, does its [5] business through the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford), when a member of our party, and I conferred with Mr . Fisher in an endeavour to arrange that the whole of the States Savings Bank business should be absorbed by the Commonwealth. It was suggested that if that were done, the Commonwealth should not interfere with the State Savings Banks' existing mortgages, and that 70 per cent, of their income sbould not be touched by the Commonwealth - If the State Governments transacted their business through the Commonwealth Bank there would be no occasion to issue bills until loans could be floated; yet notwithstanding the concessions that could be obtained by the States, there are unfortunately men who cannot realise the advantages that would be derived if such a course were adopted. I have already referred to the action taken by Walpole, Gladstone, and others, in connection with the conversion of loans. I have not referred to the liabilities of the States, because they have assets in the form of railways, water conservation works, and other schemes; but have confined my remarks more particularly to war expenditure, which is not reproductive. In order to meet the interest on loans amounting to £92,000,000 floated in England at 6 per cent., every man, woman, and child in Australia will have to contribute at least £ 1 per head for thirty-three years. In addition, we shall have to pay interest on the last loan conversion amounting to £49,000,000. During the war Australia depended on raising loans for the payment of its war expenditure instead of devoting Customs revenue to that purpose. Great Britain set us an example of how war expenditure could be met out of revenue, and even today, although that country is not as prosperous as Australia, whatever issue surplus is obtained is employed in for reducing the national debt. I hope that when the Prime Minister goes all to London, he will not follow the submethod adopted by Sir George Fuller and Mr Lawson, and attend the dinners insigarranged by the underwriting firm of Niviscn and Son. The head of that firm, t is who was at one time a clerk in the Lonnot don and Westminster Bank, has in less ten years been able to buy in succession a baronetcy and a peerage. I know that it costs tens of thousands of pounds to buy a baronetcy-Heaven only knows the cost of buying a peerage Drastic steps will have to be taken, even to the extent of enforcing criminal penalties, recommended by a British mentary Committee to remedyevils of the system of titles. I can foresee the day when this Parliament will be asked decide by a vote whether any in the nnancial world or in any other sphere is justly deserving of having a title bestowed upon him by the King. that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth loans should be launched by the Commonwealth Bank. The credit of Australia in the eyes of Europe and America is so substantial that this can be done. I believe that the people of Great Britain and America would feel that they were getting better security for the money they were advancing when they realized that the whole of the credit of the people of Australia stood behind the Bank that was asking for to a loan. The investors of the Old World are not fools. They look into all these investments with a view to seeing the possibility of the repayment money they advance. Australia is better known today than it was when was a boy. When I arrived here my mate was a tailor, who had left his mother in London. She wrote out to. him, "" William, I do not know what you are doing in Australia, because I understand the blacks wear no clothes."" of Great Britain know more of the potentialities and possibilities of since Australia's sons played their gallant part in the recent war. A nephew of mine, who saw Australian soldiers in London, wrote out to me, saying that the Australian . troops were so well dressed and had so much money to spend that he thought they must all be officers. impression our troops made in London is such that there is no doubt we could raise our loans through the wealth Bauk and save millions of pounds in doing so, although it might deprive Sir Henry Barwell and Sir George Fuller of a few dinners. This is a subject. I have often endeavoured to get honourable members to take into earnest but there is no limelight shining from it. The man who deals with the position gets no publicity. I do not blame the reporters; they are all good fellows, Afr. West. but when they take their reports - of my speeches to their offices it is a case of, "" Oh ! West said this!"" and the blue pencil deletes my remarks. Parlia- The people cannot get a true record of the the financial position of Australia, beawarding cause the press will not place the actual facts before them."" When in- Mr Fisher's to time the Labour party tried to raise war Australian loans in Australia, it was met with the strongest opposition from its political opponents, but it succeeded in establishI think ing the Commonwealth Bank and the note issue, and it inaugurated the flotation of loans within the Commonwealth. The Labour party is the only political organization that has made a serious attempt to deal with the financial problem, and no improvement of the present position will be brought about until that party is returned to office. The Labour party alone can awaken the people of the Commonwealth to the true situation. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr . subscriptions Paterson), in seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-inB.eply, advocated a number of socialistic schemes, although he would strongly of the resent their being described as such. He asked for cheap f r u it freights I and railway fares, and, no doubt, he wanted the Government to bear the cost of the concessions. What is the difference between that and Socialism ? It would be fairer to afford practical help to the unemployed. The people I believe that the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) is anxious to go to London to atAustralia tend the Imperial Conference, but in view of the many troubles besetting the British authorities at the moment, such as the unemployed problem and the difficult political situation, Mr Bruce could better serve the interests of the Empire by remaining at home and trying to get The his Government to put the affairs of Australia on a firmer footing. Canada's slogan is "" Canada for the Canadians,"" Common- and that Dominion is likely to be determined in its requests, because it has an American frontier, whereas Australia is an island continent. I fear that the League of Nations will be unable to achieve much. It would be consideration, necessary to have Germany, France, and the TJnited States of America amicably financial co-operating in its deliberations in order to obtain satisfactory results. Personally, I have more faith in a league of the English-speaking races throughout the world. If these acted conjointly they could, with their control of the seas, aud their numerous outposts, reduce the chances uf war to a minimum. Such a combination appeals to me as more likely to benefit the world than any attempt to pacify races in southern Europe with widely divergent aspirations. These nations are'fighting with one another at present, and I see little hope of bringing about peace between them under any agreement in which their word would be of value. I am afraid the Prime Minister has left it open for people to suppose that he 'is eager to bring the present session of Parliament to a close because he is determined to do nothing, and does not wish Parliament to do anything in hit, absence. I have gathered that impression in the light of his deeds since he has come into power. He is the leader of a composite Government. been difficult to bring the component parts together, and it is almost impossible to understand their respective points of view. The majority of the members of the Ministry are interested in land in vestments, and they are Tories from head to foot. I sometimes sympathize with the Prime Minister in the awkward position in which he finds himself. The new members on the other side of the House are. no doubt meekly supporting the Government because they are anxious to retain their seats for the next three years. They are afraid that if they went before the electors too soon they would be rejected.",62
227,Mr LACEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY,"What about the grants the Government are bringing out ' Mr WEST - As a resident of Auswaiting tralia, and a member of the Labour party, I hold out my right hand to any Britisher who comes to this country. Many new arrivals have called at my home, and I willingly do anything I can to help them. There are placards in Australia and Engdoes land which read, "" Place immigrants on the land ""- a cruel thing for any man advocate who knows the conditions. I was in New Zealand in 1874 when, under the immigration scheme there, they bringing out from 500 to 1,000 people per month. They did not merely dump them down on the wharf,. as we do, for liness of country Ufe was removed. "" thimble-riggers "" and rogues to defraud. They made provision for their proper ception ; their luggage was taken off steamer, and put in a place 'of security, and they themselves were put under cover until such time as they could find their footing. In Australia immigrants are sent up the country, where they are employed by farmers and pastoralists, who make no provision whatever for housing them. I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and in the course of our travelling we have been to almost every part of Australia. In a certain shire the council gave us afternoon tea, and perhaps something thicker. 1 was asked to say a few words. They did not know I was going to say what I did say. I asked the shire president whether he wanted any immigrants. He said, "" We can"" find employment for a couple of mechanics immediately."" I told him that mechanics were always married men, with one or two children, and I asked him where they could stay. He said, ""There is a lean-to in the back yard of the hotel, It has which a man could have for 30s. or 35s. a week."" 1 told him that his wife did not marry him to live 200 miles away from him in a strange country. If a man went there to work he would have to spend 35s. a week for a lodging, and another 35s. to keep himself out of mischief at night, to relieve the monotony of his existence and prevent him from becoming silly. What would his wife in Melbourne receive at the finish'! To induce immigrants of character to go to the country districts, the people there' must, first of all, build proper habitations. Some time ago I was at Cairns when a strike was in progress. I was asked to use my influence to settle it . l t appeared that men immifrom the south who had been in that ? State' had earned big cheques; and, while in Cairns for their boat, had '-' painted the town red,"" so that by the ' time the boat arrived they had very little money left . In that State there are' thousands of acres of fertile land, which not even need ploughing; it is only necessary to throw the seed at it . Proper to provision should be made to induce men to go there with their wives and families. In Belgium and France f if t y years ago were they had community settlements, in which five or six families lived in close proximity. . In this way some of the loneNo man should be compelled to take his wife reto live where the next-door neighbour is the 20 or 25 miles away. The man w h "" favours immigration wants cheap labour,. or he is a property-owner who wants to have five persons wishing to become tenants of his property, so that Le can raise the rent every week. I desire people of my own race to come to Australia. 1 love them. No people on earth have done so much to advance civilization and spread it over the world.",64
