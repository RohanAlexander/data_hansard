The Prime Minister went on a little later There is I believe a growing belief in the community workforce is measured only by individual ability, rather not as I repeat just in terms of the rather narrow there is a growing realisation in our nation that cal science people live longer and as the number tering the workforce for the first time dwindles eral Treasury with last year's Budget provided a There is a growing realisation in our nation, within that we do need to husband the resource of the mature pacities of those workers will permit.

The prospect that age discrimination legislation workers stay in the work force for longer would lieve that the Prime Minister is not in touch lieves that people will be compelled to work changes to their employment conditions.
